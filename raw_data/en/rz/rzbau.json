The Annual Intellectual Property Report to Congress, developed by the Office of the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, brings together the combined and coordinated efforts of the White House, the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, State, and Treasury, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the U.S. Copyright Office. What follows is an overview of the intellectual property enforcement strategy and related efforts undertaken by departments and agencies during fiscal year 202 2. 3 APPENDICES To the Annual Intellectual Property Report to Congress 1.

USDA's main goal is to ensure GI protections do not disadvantage U.S. producers by unfairly granting protection to products with common names, which could ultimately result in a loss of market access. During FY 2022, USDA engaged at the most senior levels with key foreign country counterparts to emphasize concerns and counter harmful GI po licies, such as those of the European Union (EU), emphasizing transparency, adherence to internationally recognized standards, seeking an opportunity to comment on any proposed GIs through comment period, and requesting the countries be fair in the evaluat ions. USDA worked with interagency partners to engage a number of countries, including Chile, the MERCOSUR countries, China, the European Union, and Morocco to raise the importance of procedural fairness and transparency as well as preserving common terms for food products. Consortium for Common Food Names Activities Supported by USDA The U.S. Dairy Export Council, on behalf of several U.S. agricultural associations including the U.S. Meat Export Federation and California Wine Institute, established the Consortium for Common Food Names (CCFN) in 2013 to monitor and combat GI -related trade restrictions. These activities are partially supported by USDA's Market Access Program through a Global Broad -based Initiative. Since 2013, CCFN has received $200,000 in funding annually from USDA for these efforts; beginning in calendar year 2022 CCFN's grant was expanded to $300,000. Each item listed below helped preserve U.S. exporters' rights to use common food names. 7 CCFN coordinated responses to various ongoing EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA ) negotiations, including : Australia - EU FTA: In March 2022, CCFN contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) regarding the ongoing EU -Australia FTA negotiations to emphasize CCFN's interest areas on common names in those trade talks. Chile - EU FTA: On January 28, 2022, CCFN held a videoconference meeting with the General Manager of the National Federation of Dairy Producers (FEDELECHE) of Chile, to share CCFN's comments and concerns regarding the possible outcome of the GI discussion as part of the modernization of the EU -Chile FTA . In the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2022, CCFN met with local counsel from Chile to discuss a strategy considering the impasse in the conclusion of the EU -Chile FTA and new avenues given the changes in the Chilean government. Mexico - EU FTA: In June 2022, during a visit by USDEC's President and CEO and CCFN's Executive Director to Mexico City, a meeting was held with the author ities of the Secretariat of Economy, where concerns were shared about the negative impact the Mexico -EU FTA's registration of multiple GIs would impose on common name use in that market and how to best mitigate this. Vietnam - EU FTA: CCFN submitted a letter to Vietnam's National Office of Intellectual Property and Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Science and Technology to urge further clarity and action on how Vietnam is implementing certain provisions of the EU -Vietnam FTA, focusing on how generic name users are grandfathered under the agreement. In January 2022, CCFN sent a follow up letter, urging the authorities to share their response as soon as possible. During the first and third quarters of 2022, CCFN has repeatedly contacted Vietnamese authorities to receive an answer to the request. CCFN continued to build a strong relationship with the new Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and his incoming leadership team : In January 2022, following a December 2021 in- person visit to WIPO's office in Geneva, CCFN sent a letter to the WIPO's Deputy Director- General, Brands and Designs Sector, to reiterate its requests that all WIPO staff be tasked with the shared responsibili ty of ensuring that common name -related concerns, including appropriate due process procedures and generic usage safeguards, are incorporated into all relevant areas of interest (for example: capacity building, events and guidelines related to GIs and othe r WIPO workstreams touching on IP and common name issues). Over the course of the following months, CCFN had several interactions with WIPO officials to reinforce these policies and programs. For example, in March 2022, CCFN's local legal counsel met with WIPO's Director General during a visit to Mexico City. Th e meeting was an opportunity to reinforce CCFN's message about the need for greater consideration to be given to the \"common names\" element in the preparation of WIPO 8 events and training sessions on GIs. CCFN also met with a WIPO official during the INTA Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. in May 2022. CCFN has been developing proposals for WIPO based on feedback from WIPO and interactions with USPTO over this period. CCFN has also served as an Observer to the WIPO Standing Committee on the Law of Trademarks, Industrial Designs and Geographical Indications and participated in the Information Session on Geographical Indications . CCFN was also an Observer for the Working Group on the Development of the Lisbon System in June 2022. CCFN monitors the countries and names registered in the Lisbon and Geneva systems to identify any issues of concern. CCFN continued working with the International Trademark Association (INTA): CCFN obtained two seats on INTA's GI Committee for the 2022- 2023 period - on the Governance and Expansion & Monitoring Subcommittees - to promote and defend CCFN's interests and object ives, by working on several proposals (webinars, papers, interviews, podcasts) within INTA's framework. CCFN participated in the January 2022 kick- off meeting of the GI Committee the April Governance Subcommittee meeting, and the 2022 1 st quarter Expansion & Monitoring Subcommittee meetings. Within the latter, CCFN has contributed to the review of an INTA document including GI provisions under FTAs negotiated around the globe. CCFN identified and reviewed the FTAs in force that include IP and GI provisions and is coordinating with the chair of the Subcommittee to continue this process. CCFN representatives participated in -person at INTA's May 2022 Annual Meeting. CCFN also monitored the June 2022 WIPO Working Group on the Development of the Lisbon Syste m for INTA. CCFN continued media outreach concerning common names, placing media pieces in the food press, including in multiple international publications regarding the benefits of preserving common names and the authenticity of U.S. food products. CCFN submitted comments to government officials in key markets regarding how to best preserve the rights of common name users: El Salvador: In March 2022, as part of CCFN's membership in INTA's GI Committee, CCFN submitted comments on El Salvador's Indus trial Property Bill. Comments and proposals were developed based on INTA's Model Trademark Law Guidelines and its 2019 Board Resolution on GIs. They focused on the need for a transparent local registration and opposition process for GIs and to ensure the free use of common names. European Union: In August 2022, CCFN submitted comments on the European Commission's recent GI regulations proposal r egarding the inclusion of sustainability factors in EU quality schemes, in addition to other changes to EU GI regulations. Japan: In August 2022, CCFN submitted comments on the Ministerial Ordinance amending parts of the Regulation for Enforcement of the Act on Protection of the Names 9 of Specific Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Products and Foodstuffs urg ing appropriate balancing of stakeholders' interests as Japan makes modifications to its GI regulations . Malaysia: In December 2021, the Geographical Indications Bill 2021 was approved by the Parliament. The corresponding Act, Guidelines and Regulations became effective on March 18, 2022. CCFN reviewed and prepared an assessment of those March 2022 provisions to determine the risks for continued free use of common names. Mexico: In January and February 2022, CCFN engaged with the Mexican Association of the Protection of Intellectual Property (AMPPI) by developing comments and recommendations on the draft implementing regulations of the IP law of 2020. During Q2 and Q3 2022, CCFN continued monitoring developments and sharing comments and suggestions t o ensure the effective implementation of the USMCA side letters between the United States and Mexico on cheeses and prior users. Philippines: On May 8, 2022, CCFN submitted comments on the country's Draft Rules and Regulations on GIs and attended virtually the Philippine's Public Consultation on GIs on May 11. At the consultation, CCFN shared with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippine s (IPOPHIL) and other stakeholders its comments and proposals on the regulations. As part of the exchange, CCFN referred to the importance of avoiding \"TRIPS- Plus\" provisions that constitute unilateral concessions from the Philippines . CCFN also mentioned its proposal for a list with common terms, and the need of having the prior trademarks exemption applying to agricultural products and foodstuffs. Vietnam: CCFN contacted the National Office of Intellectual Property in June 2021 requesting the issuance of clear guidelines regarding the GIs and trademarks issues regulated by the FTA and the relationship between the agreement and Vietnam's domestic IP law. On January 13, 2022, CCFN sent a follow up letter, urging the authorities to share their response as soon as possible. During the first quarter of 2022, CCFN contacted again the Vietnamese authorities to receive an answer to the previous request. Monitoring of GI applications in foreign markets to take appropriate action: CCFN developed logos that include, but do not claim exclusive rights in, words that are commonly used to describe certain food products, such as bologna or feta. CCFN has filed trademark applications to register its logos in jurisdictions around the world and has obtained registrations in several countries. CCFN plans to allow producers of such products to use its trademarks in order to help preserve those producers' ability to use common terms on their products and defend against others' attempts to monopolize such terms through GI protection. Australia - Opposition filing against \"Le Gruyere Switzerland\" trademark application: In August 2022, as part of the task of monitoring trademark applications comprising common names, CCFN identified the LE GRUYERE SWITZERLAND 10 trademark application. CCFN worked with Dairy Australia to confirm that based on industry data, 'gruyere' cheese has been manufactured in Australia for the best part of forty years and there are at least five companies currently producing and marketing gruyere in Australia. CCFN decided to file a notice of intention to oppose to this trademark application. Canada - Opposition filing against \"Grana Padano\" trademark applications: In July 2022, a CCFN member flagged two trademark applications applying for services rather than the usual dairy products. After examining the applications, it was determined they were blockage trademarks to expand the scope of protection of the GI. CCFN is preparing oppositions against these applications to ensure the good faith use of traders and producers in Canada to describe their products and services i n advertisement. Chile - Opposition filing against \"Gorgonzola\" GI application: In 2022, the process for the registration of \"gorgonzola\" by the Italian Consorzio as an AO in Chile resumed after its suspension due to the COVID pandemic. CCFN had previously challenged this registration and in April 26, submitted the written submission of the evidence. A decision from the Chilean authorities on this issue has not been made and Chile does not have a timeframe for when it intends to reach a decision on this or any registration request. Plant Variety Protection USDA plant variety protection certificates are recognized worldwide and expedite foreign plant variety protec tion application filing. The USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)'s Plant Variety Protection Office (PVPO) works actively with members of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) to promote cooperation on the stand ards for variety examination. Once plant variety protection is granted, the certificate owners have exclusive legal rights to market and to exclude others from selling their varieties. This legal protection for breeders and inventors promotes the develop ment of new varieties that can increase yield and crop productivity, increase farmer income, and expand trade opportunities. Other benefits of plant variety protection include provisional protection upon application receipt, priority when filing in anothe r country, user -friendly filing without the need for an attorney, no annual maintenance fees, and applicant -conducted field trials. FAS encourages free trade agreement partners to become UPOV members to protect U.S. plant breeders' rights across the globe . For example, at a TIFA meeting in February 2022, FAS raised Uruguay's possible accession to the 1991 UPOV Convention and emphasized the benefits of the Convention for Uruguay's plant breeders. USDA Plant Variety Protection Activities in FY 2022 PVPO rec eived 646 applications for sexually reproduced, tuber propagated, and asexually reproduced varieties during the fiscal year . Among these were more than 45 applications for asexually reproduced varieties including varieties of almond, blackberry, pistachio, pomegranate, and raspberry. PVPO issued 465 certificates of protection and examined 4 84 applications. It achieved mutual standard recognition with Canada for asexually reproduced plants so that the two countries will accept each other's examination results, which eliminates duplicative work, saving money and time for plant breeders. PVPO staff provided presentations on the program, the electronic Plant Variety Protection System, and examination procedures - to participants from Jamaica, Pakistan, Japan, and Ecuador. The presentations reviewed the benefits of the electronic plant variety protection system, an overview of PVPO examination procedures, and how the addition of asexually reproduced varieties has been implemented. PVPO continues to actively work with the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA), the International Community of Breeders of Asexually Reproduced Horticultural Plant Varieties (CIOPORA), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and other seed and vegetative industry stakeholders regularly. The current Plant Variety Protection (PVP) Board was appointed by the Secretary on September 24, 2022. The Board consists of 14 members representing farmers, the seed industry, trade and professional associations, and public and private institutions involved with developing new plant varieties. Members of the PVP Board provide oversight and guidance to the program on plant variety protection issues. The last PVP Board meeting was held on December 14, 2021, by videoconference. T he meeting included updates from PVPO on 2021 program accomplishments, 2022 program initiatives, international outreach, status of incoming asexually reproduced variety applications, and acceptance of examination reports from other countries. Presentation s on the soybean molecular marker method was provided by PVPO and the ASTA molecular marker working group. AMS provides intellectual property rights protection through PVPO, which protects breeders of varieties of seed and tuber propagated plants, and asexually reproduced plants that are new, distinct, uniform, and stable. Authorized by the Plant Variety Protection Act, PVPO examines new variety characteristics to grant certificates that protect varieties for 20 years (25 years for vines and trees). Agricu ltural Research Service's Protection of USDA's Own Intellectual Property USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has a comprehensive program to protect U.S. Government -owned intellectual property. In addition to IP protection, ARS delivers a comprehens ive training program on IP. The program has four components: (1) training scientists on Dual Use Research of Concern, Technology Transfer (TT), and insider threats; (2) training TT Staff on U.S. Department of Commerce regulations; (3) Export Control Revie ws; and (4) entrance and exit procedures for agency employees to minimize insider threats. 12 D EPARTM ENT OF COMMERCE 13 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE \"There is no fair access to the innovation ecosystem when someone can compete with you illegally using your own brand \u2014 especially when they can do so more cheaply and with inferior products.\"2 \"Whether it is car or video game components, make- up or prescription drugs, or purses and shoes, this pervasive criminal activity must be stopped. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and I are committed to cracking down on counterfeit goods for the benefi t of every American and entrepreneur.\"3 - Kathi Vidal, Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO Department of Commerce Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2022 activities of the Commerce Department, through the Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the U .S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The Commerce Department continues to engage in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement internationally. Additionally, the USPTO provides many different patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret capacity building programs as fully described in our TRIPS Article 67 report each year, and the following highlights some enforcement activities during FY 2022. COMMERCIAL LAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM The Comm erce Department's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) creates a level playing field for U.S. firms overseas, in particular by building the capacity of foreign countries to improve the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). As the Office of General Counsel's technical assistance arm, CLDP upholds the Department of Commerce's mission, as stated in its 2018 -2022 strategic plan to \"Accelerate American Leadership.\" Strategic Objective 1.3 is \"Strengthen Intellectual Property Protection,\" and one of the plan's strategies is to \"strengthen the protection of intellectual property\" abroad. CLDP helps enforce IPR overseas through two types of technical assistance programs: programs that help countries develop an effective IPR enfo rcement environment, and programs that help countries create their own intellectual property, which gives them a vested interest in enforcing IPR. 2 Remarks at the International Trad emark Association Annual Council , press release on \"McGruff the Crime Dog\u00ae and NASCAR's Joey Gase want you close cooperation with the USPTO, other Commerce bureaus, USTR, and other Federal agencies, C LDP's activities typically include consultations, seminars, workshops, and meetings. Starting in March 2020, in light of the public health situation (COVID -19) and of the resulting impossibility to travel overseas, CLDP suspended its traditional activiti es, most of which took place overseas and conducted, instead, online video- conferences and webinars. At the suggestion of the Director of the USPTO's Global Intellectual Property Academy ( GIPA ), GIPA and CLDP created an \"IP eLearning Community of Practice \" that has been effective in sharing lessons learned by both institutions as they conducted virtual programs. In FY 2022, CLDP IP activities were conducted for the following countries and regions: Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Central Asia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Ukraine. As outlined below, CLDP's FY 2022 activities mainly fell into four categories: Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement; Capacity Building for Institutions that Grant IPR; Capacity Building for Institutions that Enforce IPR; and Development of Innovation Ecosystems, in particular through Technology Transfer. OVERVIEW OF CLDP's FY 2022 IP PROGRAMS 1. Judicial Capacity Building in IPR Enforcement Azerbaijan CLDP Holds Judicial Webinar on Intellectual Property Rights On April 27, 2022, CLDP, in coordination with U.S. Embassy Baku, the Azerbaijani Justice Academy, and USPTO, held a webinar on the basic tenets of intellectual property (IP) rights for judges in Azerbaijan. The webi nar was a refresher on the basics of IP in preparation for an extensive workshop that took place in May (discussed directly below) and is part of a series of workshops and consultations to strengthen IP in Azerbaijan and focus on rule of law technical assistance. CLDP Leads Workshop on Intellectual Property Adjudication On May 17- 18, 2022, CLDP, in coordination with U.S. Embassy Baku, the Azerbaijan Justice Academy, and the Azerbaijan Intellectual Property Agency, led a workshop focused on intellectual property rights enforcement on issues related to technology and software licensing for judges in Azerbaijan.

The goal of the workshop, attended by customs officials, judges and prosecutors, was to provide a platform for participants to align customs processes and facilitate regional cooperation and exchange of information on laws and best practices on intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement and pro tection. The next steps will focus on targeted issues within both customs processes and IPR. Bosnia and Herzegovina CLDP Organizes Intellectual Property Bench Book Update On June 20- 21, 2022, CLDP supported a workshop for a working group consisting of judges, private sector representatives, academics, and an IP institute representative, to update an existing intellectual property (IP) bench book. This workshop, a follow -up to monthly virtual idea exchanges and drafting exercises, is designed to facili tate collaboration among Republika Srpska and Federation entities, as well as to encourage private sector, institutional, and judiciary collaboration. The bench book update will be used as a reference point and an educational tool to boost IP adjudication capacity in the country. Georgia CLDP Hosts Workshop on Adjudication of Civil Intellectual Property Infringement Cases On July 30- 31, 2022, CLDP held a Workshop on Adjudication of Civil Intellectual Property Infringement Cases for Georgian judges in Batumi, Georgia. CLDP brought two U.S. Federal District Court judges and a European Union intellectual property (IP) expert to the workshop to train judges f rom the Georgian local, appellate, and Supreme Court levels on the legal principles governing the adjudication of civil intellectual property cases in the U.S. and European systems. The workshop allowed the Georgian judges , through case studies taken from both the U.S. and Georgian courts, to practically apply and cement the principles learned throughout the workshop. Through this workshop, CLDP continued its ongoing efforts to strengthen the capacity of the judiciary and rule of law in Georgia. 2. Capacit y Building for Institutions that Grant IPR Egypt CLDP Initiates an Interagency Review of the Trademark Registration Manual In November 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, initiated an interagency review of the existing guidelines for trademark e xamination and registration (the Guidelines) by the Egyptian Trademarks and Industrial Designs Office (ETMO). Prior to initiation of the 16 interagency review, CLDP arranged for the translation of the Guidelines and related documents to facilitate the timely completion of the review. CLDP Discusses with Embassy Officers the Potential for Expanding Intellectual Property Technical Assistance During CLDP's December 2021 meetings at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, the Economic Office highlighted CLDP's work in intellectual property and asked if it might be possible to expand work in this area to include technical assistance for the National Committee, the patent office, and further assistance for the judiciary. CLDP will carry on this conversation with USAID and USPTO, and make suggestions in terms of further intellectual property rights technical assistance that CLDP could offer. Pakistan Distinctiveness, Acquired Distinctiveness and Disclaimers in Trademark Examination On December 15, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, conducted the second 2- hour session for the Intellectual Property Organization (IPO) of Pakistan Trademark Directorate (IPO - TM) in a series of webinars focusing on the critical elements of trademark examination, classification, registration and appeal. Session 2 focused on USPTO practices concerning the element of distinctiveness, including acquired distinctiveness and the use of disclaimers. USPTO experts employed a lecture format interspersed with examples and a question -and- answer period, followed by open discussion to deliver effective understanding of the subject matter. Non-Traditional Tradema rks and Madrid Protocol Obligations On January 27, 2022, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, conducted the third 2- hour virtual session for the IPO -TM. Session 3 focused on non- traditional trademarks, with an emphasis on the U.S. legal tests of functio nality and distinctiveness, including examples and discussion of the types of non- traditional marks registrable in the U.S. Additionally, USPTO experts discussed the handling of out -going trademark applications under the Madrid Protocol. Trademark Opposi tion, Appeal and Cancellation, and Operational Procedure On February 23, 2022, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, conducted the fourth 2- hour virtual session for IPO -TM officials. Session 4 focused on trademark opposition, appeal and cancellation, and operational procedure followed by USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB). The session began with an overview of the TTAB, including its make -up and mission. USPTO experts then discussed TTAB opposition and cancellation proceedings in general, before covering the specifics of ex parte appeals and inter -partes oppositions practice, both of which occur before trademark registration. Actions after trademark registration, such as inter- partes cancellations practice, were discussed in detail and incl uded a question- and-answer period. 17 Georgia CLDP Presents Recommendations on Collective Copyright Management On November 10, 2021, CLDP led a workshop with the National Intellectual Property Center of Georgia and members of the Georgian Parliament's Culture Committee Working Group on Intellectual Property, to review CLDP recommendations on strengthening the legal and institutional framework for collective copyright management in Georgia. The recommendations were produced after a March 2021 CLDP webinar on the collective management system and a gap analysis of Georgia's Law on Collective Management of Copyright and Related Rights. Georgia has been a mode l for collective management in the Caucasus and Central Asia region, but due to recent developments in the collective management field, rightsholders and users have expressed confusion about the system and concerns about royalty collection and distribution. 3.

Pakistan CLDP and USPTO Lead Interagency Planning to Conduct Capstone Sessions in the Multi - Series Program on Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement at the Border, Focusing on Best Practices in Combating Counterfeit Medical Products On October 7, 2021, CLDP, in close cooperation with USPTO, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Pakistan Customs Service (PCS) began planning for Module 4 of the multi -series p rogram on stopping counterfeit goods transiting through ports of entry in Pakistan. Modules 1- 3 were conducted virtually, whereas Module 4 is being structured as in -person training consisting of delegations traveling to the U.S. and Pakistan to observe on- the-ground activities combating counterfeit goods transiting through ports of entry. The program continues to focus on the enforcement of intellectual property rights as a primary tool in the identification, interdiction, and seizure of contraband (e.g., counterfeit medical products) transiting through air, land, and seaports of entry. U.S. and U.K. capabilities and practices, concentrating on air freight and air mail facilities, serve as aspirational goals for improving Pakistan's anti -counterfeiting activities. South Caucasus CLDP Establishes Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights On July 27, 2022, CLDP chaired the inaugural meeting of the Eastern Europe Expert Level Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights. CLDP inv ited the participation of intellectual property (IP) government officials from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine for the Working Group and succeeded in the participation of officials from all but Azerbaijan and Ukraine. The Working Group seeks to promote greater harmonization, cooperation, and 20 information sharing in the protection and enforcement of IP within the region, as well as increasing the commercialization and utilization of IP in line with internationally accepted standards and best practices. The assembled delegations agreed upon several baseline procedures to guide future meetings of the Working Group and engaged in an open discussion of salient IP topics and issues to be addressed by the Working Group going forward. CLDP will continue stewarding the Working Group through its early stages with the goal of developing it into an integral, self -sustaining piece of multilateral IP landscape in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus. South Caucasus and Central Asia CLDP Convenes Intellectual Property Forum On July 28, 2022, CLDP brought together delegations of intellectual property (IP) government officials from Eastern Europe and Central Asia (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, U zbekistan) for the Trans -Caspian Intellectual Property Forum. Following the meetings of the Eastern Europe and Central Asian Expert Level Working Groups, the Forum allowed the assembled delegations to engage in direct dialogue with their counterparts from across the Trans -Caspian region on best practices in the enforcement and protection of IP rights. The Forum divided the delegations into three groups to discuss different aspects of IP protection and enforcement - internal markets, customs and transshipment, and digital and online piracy - with each group reporting on the most pressing regional issues, best practices, and proposed solutions. By the end of the Forum, participants had not only broadened their perspective of IP issues affecting other countries throughout the region, but also gained valuable insight into how to best address these issues in their home countries. 4. Development of Innovation Ecosystems/Technology Transfer Algeria CLDP Co -Organizes, and Presents at Workshop on The Viability of Advanced Technology Start -ups The development of advanced technology start -ups (ATS) is a priority for the Algerian government, as it will be a key condition of the country's transition from a resource -based economy to a knowledge -based economy. The U.S. Embassy in Algeria supports th is priority because it will contribute to better enforcement of intellectual property rights. In light of the embassy's position, CLDP proposed to join forces with the Algerian Information Technology Association (AITA) to organize a workshop focused on wa ys to ensure the viability of ATS. The embassy agreed and the Algerian government, at the highest level, embraced this initiative. On October 5- 6, 2021, a workshop focused on The Viability of Algerian Advanced Technology Start -ups took place in Algiers. This workshop - co -organized by CLDP, AITA, and Algerian government institutions - had more than 100 participants, including government officials, managers of technology incubators, and members of start -ups. A delegation from the U.S. embassy attended th e workshop, with CLDP joining virtually. CLDP gave a presentation on the 21 methodology it has created to assess the viability of ATS; the Algerian government co - organizers, in a written message, praised this presentation. Bahrain CLDP Conducts Technology Transfer Online Consultations On January 20, 2022, in collaboration with the University of Maryland technology transfer office, and on January 24, with the George Mason University Office of Technology Transfer, CLDP conducted online consultations for repr esentatives from the Bahrain Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (BITTC) to meet with directors of the aforementioned U.S. -based centers to learn the structure and management of technology transfer offices. Collaboration between BITTC and U.S. unive rsities will provide opportunities to commercialize innovations developed in Bahrain and increase access to the Gulf Cooperation Council market for innovations developed in U.S. universities. Bosnia and Herzegovina CLDP Leads Workshop on Challenges of Intellectual Property Protection in the Information Technology Age On October 18, 2021, CLDP held a roundtable with ICT companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to address some of the key challenges for the private sector in protecting IP rights. The workshop was a comparative approach to protection of software, databas e, and trademark law among the U.S., Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia, which served as a regional example. Importantly, experts and participants discussed gaps in IP protections with respect to the current BiH law during a panel discussion with the Insti tute for Intellectual Property and the experts and identify next steps. Strengthening intellectual property rights will help BiH to develop as a knowledge -based economy, improving employment opportunities and economic stability, and will protect the IP of both Bosnian and U.S. companies. Sri Lanka CLDP Participates in a Conference of University Business Linkages Offices On January 25, 2022, CLDP virtually participated in the eleventh meeting of the University Business Linkage (UBL) Cell Standing committee of the University Grants Commission. The meeting gathered UBL Cell managers from over 40 private and public universit ies in Sri Lanka, and featured progress updates on research and commercialization. CLDP confirmed its commitment to support strengthening the activities of the UBL Cells through continuation of the Technology Transfer Workshops series. Technology transfe r and commercialization of intellectual property promote innovation and economic development and create opportunities for future research and development partnerships with American institutions. CLDP Conducts Series of Technology Transfer Workshops On Mar ch 31, 2022, CLDP, in cooperation with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), conducted the third workshop in a series for the managers of university technology transfer offices (TTOs). The workshop consisted of recorded presentations and liv e discussions focused on concepts and issues related to software licensing agreements and negotiations. This 22 workshop series builds on previous programs conducted by CLDP with MoHE, USPTO, and others to establish and enhance TTOs in public and private uni versities across Sri Lanka. TTOs play a key role in creating and maintaining an ecosystem of innovation and contribute to the strengthening of Sri Lanka's IP rights enforcement regime. CLDP Continues Series of Technology Transfer Workshops On April 15 and April 25, 2022, CLDP, in cooperation with the former director of Cornell University's technology transfer office, conducted two workshops on pre -negotiation valuation of licensing agreements. The workshops, which combined recorded presentations with live virtual discussion sessions, were the fourth and fifth in a series for the managers of university TTOs. CLDP Continues Series of Technology Transfer Workshops From September 26 to 28, 2022, in Kathmandu, Nepal, CLDP, in cooperation with USPTO and the Sr i Lanka Ministry of Higher Education, conducted a technology licensing workshop for the managers of university TTOs. This was the sixth workshop in a multi -series program designed to strengthen the capabilities of the country's TTOs to commercialize patented inventions through technology licensing. Ensuring effective enforcement of intellectual property rights overseas is an important objective of the U.S. Department of Commerce and CLDP helps develop innovation ecosystems where IP rights are enforced, benefiting U.S. firms that operate overseas. Ukraine Intellectual Property Moot/Licensing Webinar On December 15 -17, 2021, CLDP and a group of stakeholders conducted a series of interactive lectures and trainings for Ukrainian law students. This builds on a September 2021 in-person training for students that introduced them to high -level concepts in IP law. The December program focused more specifically on domestic and international legal concepts surrounding licensing agreements. In addition to substantive topics, students heard from practicing IP attorneys about various careers in the field. The webinar is part of CL DP's Ukraine IP moot initiative aimed at increasing interest and appreciation for IP law and protection among Ukrainian law students. INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION (ITA) Office of Standards & Intellectual Property (OSIP) STOPfakes.gov The International Trade Administration's Office of Standards and Intellectual Property (OSIP) helps lead the STOPfakes.gov program including resources provided on the STOPfakes website. 23 STOPfakes.gov hosts digital materials which seek to educate and assis t businesses, consumers, government officials, and the general public.

IP Highlights These digital resources raise awareness on a range of IP related issues. The inaugural IP Highlight was on Suspicious Solicitations , and it noted how bad actors negative ly impact rightsholders by impersonating government agencies. Additionally, the IP Highlights provide information on an array of U.S. Government IP Resources, including the IP Attach\u00e9 Program, the Interior Department's Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Enforc ement on Counterfeit Car Seats, and the USPTO's Patent Pro Bono Program. 24 STOPfakes at 2022 Consumer Electronics Show The STOPfakes team provided IP education and direct outreach to over 600 businesses of all sizes over 3 days in person at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. STOPfakes Roadshows The STOPfakes Roadshows deliver critically important information about intellectual property to the audiences that need it most - start -ups, entrepreneurs, small and medium -sized businesses, independent creators, and inventors. The information is presented by experts from multiple government agencies focused on advancing stakeholders' intellectu al property interests : The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides information about how to protect patents and trademarks; The U.S. Copyright Office discusses the importance of copyright protection to creators and businesses; U.S. Customs and Borde r Protection (CBP) explains how a registered trademark or copyright can be recorded with CBP to facilitate the seizure of infringing goods at our borders; The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or a U.S. Attorney's Office discusses how to protect trad e secrets and identify internal and external threats; The U.S. Department of State highlights the role diplomacy and our diplomatic missions play in advocating for U.S. businesses overseas; The International Trade Administration identifies mechanisms f or obtaining intellectual property rights protections in export markets; and The Small Business Administration advises on the potential use of grants and loans to help with the costs of obtaining IP protection before exporting. Participating agencies al so identify additional resources they make available to assist U.S. businesses with acquiring and protecting their intellectual property rights. Due to COVID- 19, in- person Roadshows were not held during FY 2022, and have recently restarted. Instead, as discussed below, STOPfakes webinars were with several webinars to various audiences. These webinars were co -hosted by STOPfakes and feature some of the same topics and speakers from the roadshow agendas as well as some content from new partners. (The 25 STOPfakes roadshows resumed in -person roadshows in late Fall 2022 with a successful program in Orlando, F lorida. ) An example of topics covered in the FY 2022 STOPfakes engagement included: Promoting World IP and Youth: Innovating for a Better Future\" focusing on our youngest inventors, entrepreneurs and innovators with blog posts, social media outreach and virtual events. Delaware ExporTech is a national export assistance program helping companies enter or expand in global markets. IP topics included: specific countries where IP protection and enforcement is more risky; best practices to ensure IP protection on new innovations; and broad overview of IPR resources. Participating in a US and UK Small and Medium Enterprises Dialogue \"IPR Border Enforcement: Recording Trademarks and Copyrights\" with CBP \"Trademark Basics: What Every Small Business Should Know Now, Not Later\" with USPTO Patent Basics and USPTO Resources: What Every Small Business Should Know When Developing their Business Plan and Moving Forward Registering Your Trademark Internationally Participating in the Discover Global Markets: Blue Economy Event including specialized business consultations IP Consult ations for Businesses and Associations OSIP provided IP business guidance and insight for entities as they sought to expand their opportunities for exporting. Additionally, OSIP participated as a panelist on webinars for associations seeking to provide IP information for their association memb ers. Combatting Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods OSIP undertook a critical role in the interagency process to develop and implement the January 2020 Report by the Department of Homeland Security on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pir ated Goods ( 2022, OSIP continued to meet regularly with industry leaders and provide industry's unique perspective as part of OSIP's support for the ongoing USG activities to combat trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods. 26 NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA) Protect Intellectual Property at ICANN The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), USPTO, and other Federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, continue to engage within the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Number s (ICANN) and the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), highlighting the importance of timely access to domain name registration information (known as WHOIS) for IP rightsholders, to combat infringement online. In response to the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect during 2018, crucial domain name registration information details are no longer publicly provided. The U.S. Government continues playing an active role in the ongoing discussions to establish a sustainable access and accreditation model as soon as possible, so that IP rightsholders and other legitimate interests can access non -public WHOIS information for enforcement and security purposes. In addition, the USG also will be closely following the upcoming review of the Uniform Domain Name Dispute- Resolution Policy (UDRP). Since its introduction in 1999, the UDRP has been a successful tool in assisting trademark rightsholders to combat cybersquatting. As ICANN takes further steps for implementing a second round of new gTLDs, the U.S. Government will continue to work through the GAC to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected in the various ICANN policy development processes. The Section 1201 Rulemaking In an extensive consultation letter, transmitte d October 1, 2021, NTIA formally shared its views with the Copyright Office on the rulemaking proceeding under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1)(C). The rulemaking process allows the Librarian of Congress to determine whether the Librarian should grant any temporary exemptions to the prohibition on circumvention in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a)(1). NTIA worked to fulfill its statutory role to engage in consultation with the U.S. Copyright Office during the rulemaking proceedings. NTIA reviewed the proposals and additional comments received in the process. NTIA appreciates the positive process changes that the Copyright Office has continued to implement in the rulemakings, several of which track closely with recommendations NTIA has made both in its previous consultations and in less formal discussions. For example, although necessitated by the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, NTIA found remote participation at the public hearings to be a success, as it allowed for more inclusive public participation in the process. 27 UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (USPTO) The Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO has the responsibility of, among other things, advising \"the President, through the Secretary of Commerce, on national and certain international intellectual property policy issues\" and advising \"Federal departments and agencies on ma tters of intellectual property policy in the United States and intellectual property protection in other countries.\" 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(b)(8) -(13). Consistent with this responsibility, the USPTO provides expert legal and policy advice to the Administration on issues related to the protection and enforcement of patents, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical indications, copyrights, plant varieties, and trade secrets, including regulatory test data. The USPTO represents the United States at the Worl d Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in other international intergovernmental organizations that discuss IP -related matters. In addition, during FY 2022, the Department of Commerce - including the USPTO - provided advice to the Office of the Un ited States Trade Representative (USTR) through extensive input into: the annual Special 301 review of global IP regimes, the Notorious Markets Review, the National Trade Estimate Report, as well as the Section 301 investigations when intellectual property issues are involved. Additionally, the USPTO participates in the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG) meetings and advises USTR on IP enforcement -related issues in the context of APEC initiatives. The USPT O provides advice on initiatives, reports, proposed programs, and developments related to IP enforcement made or produced by other APEC economies. The USPTO also organizes and conducts IP enforcement -related programs/seminars for APEC economies. Strengthen Intellectual Property Enforcement through International Organizations The USPTO continues to lead the U.S. delegation to the WIPO Advisory Committee on Enforcement (ACE). ACE provides a multilateral forum for exchanging information and best practices on combatting trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy. USPTO is also a bureau member of the OECD's Countering Illicit Trade Task Force (TF -CIT). Promote Enforcement of U.S. Intellectual Property Rights through Trade Policy Tools Throughout FY 2022, the USPTO provided policy advice and technical expertise on domestic and international IP matters to multiple other federal agencies. These included USTR, the U.S. Department of State, the IPEC, and other bureaus of the Commerce Depart ment. The USPTO also advised USTR on the intellectual property aspects of its trade discussions, such as a country's Trade Policy Forum (TPF) or Trade & Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA); reviews under U.S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); Science and Technology Agreements involving the 2015 Model IP Annex, Trade Policy Reviews undertaken at the World Trade Organization (WTO); participation in the U.S.- E.U. Trade and Technology Council (TTC); amendments to the South Africa copyright and performers laws; a draft Nigerian copyright bill; support for Ukraine in the 2022 Special 301 Review and our actions to reduce our bilateral IP relationship with Russia due to the War in Ukraine, Ukrainian copyright law reform and software 28 legalization; ongoing legislative reform in India and several ASEAN/APEC members; the U.S. - Kenya Trade Dialogue and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA); Mexico's implementation of its USMCA obligations; and accessions underway at the WTO. In addition, the USPTO assisted USTR in the preparation of its annual review of global developments on trade and IP and the Special 301 Report. The Special 301 Report identifies U.S. trading partner s in which IP protection and enforcement has deteriorated or remained at inadequate levels and where U.S. persons who rely on IP protection have difficulty with fair and equitable market access. The USPTO assisted in its preparation by providing extensive information on the state of IP protection and enforcement in 80 countries under review. The USPTO likewise provided USTR with information in connection with its evaluation and compilation of the annual Notorious Markets List, which highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in and facilitate substantial copyright piracy and trademark counterfeiting. Support U.S. Small and Medium -Size Enterprises (SMEs) In Foreign Markets The USPTO offers basic - and advanced- topic pro gramming for U.S. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) doing business abroad through its Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA), a component of the Office of Policy and International Affairs (OPIA). These in -depth programs - organized and conduc ted by OPIA attorneys - cover best practices in domestic and international IP protection and enforcement and are typically delivered through face -to-face and distance learning modes, both from the USPTO's headquarters in Alexandria, VA, and around the country in cooperation with the USPTO's regional offices and other business units. OPIA collaborates with the USPTO's IP Attach\u00e9s, Regional Offices, other USG agencies, and the Federal Judiciary. In FY 2022, GIPA provided IP awareness and education programmi ng to over 6,526 U.S. SMEs, U.S. government officials, and other U.S. stakeholders. About 22% of GIPA's 175 programs in FY 2022 targeted this domestic audience of IP rights owners, users, and policymakers. During FY 2022, GIPA continued its successful 2020 pivot to all -remote outreach and education delivery, thanks to prior investments in technology platforms and e -learning strategies. However, a slow transition has begun to in -person outreach and education programs as well. The USPTO through OPIA/GIPA continued certain domestic training and outreach initiatives, converting previously in -person programming to the virtual environment for several audiences, including IP education programming for universities in cooperation with the ITA on DOC Resources to Assist U.S. Higher Education Institutions, and Webinars for U.S. SMEs, as well as a virtual pilot program on IP for U.S. SMEs doing business in Southeast Asia. USPTO continued a successful multi -year webinar initiative to provide comprehensive IP education to grantees of the Small Business Administration's (SBA) SBIR -STTR programs participating in the SBA Office of Trade webinar on IP basics and USPTO resources for SBIR/STTR applicants and support organizations; supported small bus iness advisors by providing information about USPTO resources, international IP protection and enforcement, and customs recordation sessions in the international trade track and plenary at the annual America's Small Business Development Center (ASBDC) conf erence; and offered a program on copyright basics and considerations for entrepreneurs for several Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) in cooperation with the USPTO Eastern Regional Outreach Office. 29 In conjunction with the Commercial Service under t he International Trade Administration, the USPTO has participated in programs with representatives of the Minority Business Development Agency, specifically addressing the interests of minority business owners concerning domestic and foreign IP registratio n and protection protocols. As part of the EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) working group, the USPTO helped produce a webinar titled, \"Intellectual Property and SMEs in the Digital Economy\" on the importance of intellectual property for SMEs seeking to do business abroad. Slides from the webinar are publicly available online and include free government resources to support SMEs. More in formation is available whole -of-government efforts to support Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) through providing IP subject matter expertise to WEE programming. USPTO participated in USAID and ITA WEE programming, including the January 2022 virtual event on APEC Supporting Women Entrepreneurs in E -Commerce in Vietnam, which was marketed to policymakers who can provide support to women -owned businesses. In the interest of further ensuring efficiency and coordination, GIPA also presented programs for U.S. officials and policymakers, providing updates on domestic and IP law and policy. The USPTO's OPIA once again collaborated with the Department of State' s Foreign Service Institute (FSI) and Economic Bureau to provide (virtual) IP training for outbound Foreign Service Officers, and to provide subject matter expertise in developing an update to FSI's IP distance learning products. GIPA continued to engage in interagency training coordination meetings with other USG IP training donors such as DOJ, CBP, and DOC's CLDP program, on a whole -of- government basis as well as in smaller, more focused groups. These meetings facilitate discussions around avoiding dupl ication of efforts to allow agencies with aligned goals to leverage each other's resources to streamline the planning, execution and wrap -up of IP capacity building programs. Raise Public Awareness of International Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement The USPTO engages in many outreach activities to raise public awareness of IP. Knowledge is shared through libraries and resource centers, universities, regional of fices, face -to-face and distance learning educational programs, and through presence at trade shows. Additionally, content covering all areas of IP is available on the USPTO's website and promoted through the USPTO's social media platforms. In FY 2022, GIPA continued its decade -long commitment to produce on- demand content through distance -learning modules on the USPTO website. These modules are available in five languages and cover six different areas of IP protection. In addition, self -study materials - including recordings of events, training slides, and IP toolkits - were updated for asynchronous learning. According to USPTO, t he most recent videos covering Patents and Trade Secrets have received a combined 88,031 views as of September 30, 2022 . 30 On November 30, 2021, the USPTO released the \"You're Smart. Buy Smart\" video public service announcement (PSA). The PSA, directed by Oscar\u00ae-nominated producer Trevor White, was released and rolled out to more than 2,100 broadcast outlets, including YouTube, social media channels, electronic billboards, online gaming sites, radio and music services, and other platforms that directly reach twee ns and teens as part of the OPIA enforcement team's Go For Real anti -counterfeiting campaign. On August 11, 2022, the Go For Real campaign released a second PSA \"The Real McGruff\" in English and Spanish. The newest PSA, also directed by Oscar \u00ae-nominated producer Trevor White, features a 3D animated McGruff the Crime Dog and his nephew Scruff. According to USPTO, at the close for FY22, the two campaigns had a combined 78,435 airings on tv stations , over 570 million impressions and an estimated ad value of over $20 million. On February 22, 2022, the USPTO's OPIA enforcement team and trademarks teams, together with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, co- hosted the virtual workshop on IPR Protection Beyond US Borders: Preventing Infringing Exports from China as part of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Year of the SME outreach program. In celebration of the annual World Intellectual Property Day (April 26, 2022), USPTO headquarters and IP Attach\u00e9s in cooperation with WIPO, other U.S. government agencies, and national IP offices hosted a number of events overseas in FY 2022 to commemorate and raise awareness of the 2022 global theme: IP Youth: Innovating for a Better Future . Events included USPTO's World IP Day celebration, a virtual program encouraging t he world to leverage the innovative power of youth to solve problems and create opportunities. The virtual event included an intimate fireside chat discussion with the leadership of the USPTO, WIPO, and the U.S. Copyright Office about promoting IP adoption among young innovators. In addition to the USPTO, organizations participating in this event included WIPO, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the International Trademark Association, the American Bar Association's Section of Intellectua l Property Law, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, the U.S. Copyright Office, the Licensing Executives Society International, the U.S. IP Alliance, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Innovation Policy Center. In April 24 -30, 2022, the Public Affairs section of the Rio Consulate and the Rio IP Attach\u00e9 Office partnered to produce and publicize an awareness video on the importance of IP, presented by the popular Brazilian singer Anitta. The video has been posted at least on the Rio Consulate\u00b4s Instagram and Facebook accounts, the Embassy's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, and the S\u00e3o Paulo Consulate's Instagram account. According to USPTO, on the Instagram accounts of the Rio a nd S\u00e3o Paulo consulates alone, the video quickly reached a combined 40,000+ views, and the video likely has at least that many views on the Embassy's Instagram account. Across all three Instagram accounts, the video generated over 1000 comments. Notably, the video sparked increased awareness of and excitement about IP and attracted widespread attention to the topic. At least five online articles have been published regarding the famous singer's video. One article, posted on the website POPline, mentione d the U.S. Mission to Brazil, the USPTO, and World IP Day. The article also quoted the video regarding the importance of protecting intellectual property and described the U.S. Mission's IP -related work in Brazil. Another article, on the website Noticias do Mundo, quoted the video and the U.S. Mission's website, explaining that \"intellectual property rights are the universal currency of 31 today's innovation economy.\" A third article used the video and a brief discussion of World IP Day as a jumping off poi nt to discuss the Special 301 report and Brazil's place on the Special 301 Watch List. While the overall impact of the video cannot be quantified, the video achieved the desired result: it has brought attention to the issue of IP, to a younger audience ( Anitta fans), in a country where IP awareness is lacking, and during a time when popular support of IP rights is more important than ever (given ongoing discussions of IP treaties and laws in Brazil's executive and legislature). On June 9, 2022, the USPTO's Enforcement Policy Team participated in the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) -Microsoft IP Law Institute (IPLI), an annual IP program for law school students that provides an in- depth look into various career opportunities in the field of IP protection and enforcement. Capacity -Building and Training The USPTO's Global Intellectual Property Academy (GIPA) In FY 2022, the USPTO's GIPA continued to develop and provide capacity- building programs, organized and conducted by OPIA attorneys, to help improve IP systems in key countries and regions to the benefit of U.S. stakeholders. Although traditional, face -to-face training programs did not start taking place until mid -FY 2022, the USPTO continued to meet training obligations during this unprecedented time through increasing its leverage of various technologies to provide live online IP training. GIPA's established capacity for e -learning supported a successful pivot to all -remote delivery of its programs in mid -FY 2020 and continued this delivery into FY 2022. Through these well -attended and well -received distance learning initiatives, the USPTO provided tailored content to developed and developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The progr ams addressed a full range of IP protection and enforcement matters, including enforcement of IP rights at national borders, Internet piracy, trade secrets, copyright policy, and patent and trademark examination. Participants included officials with IP -related responsibilities, such as judges, prosecutors, patent and trademark examiners, and IP office and Collective Management Organization (CMO) administrators. In FY 2022, GIPA conducted 222 IP programs covering all areas of IP. About 78% of these program s targeted foreign officials with IP portfolios, engaging over 10,679 officials from 161 countries and intergovernmental organizations. A complete list of all countries represented at GIPA trainings in FY 2022 is available online at the USPTO Data Visuali zation Center (https://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/externalaffairs/main.dashxml ). Generally, programs are delivered from GIPA's headquarters in Alexandria, VA, and around the world, through face -to- face and distance learning modules. In the interest of further ensuring efficiency and coordination, GIPA also presented programs for U.S. officials and policymakers, providing updates on domestic and IP law and policy. The USPTO's OPIA , which includes the Office of Chief Economist (OCE), once again collaborated with the Department of State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) and Economic Bureau to provide (virtual) IP training for outbound Foreign Service Officers, and to provide subject matter 32 expertise in developing an update to FSI's IP distance learning products. GIPA continued to engage in interagency training coordination meetings with other USG IP training donors such as DOJ, CBP, and DOC's CLDP program, on a whole -of-government ba sis as well as in smaller, more focused groups. These meetings facilitate discussions around avoiding duplication of efforts to allow agencies with aligned goals to leverage each other's resources to streamline the planning, execution and wrap- up of IP ca pacity building programs. Other USPTO Activities Related to IP Protection and Enforcement In April 2022, pursuant to a Joint Project Agreement (JPA), USPTO and the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) Consumer Protection Training and Research Institute, co- organized an in- person workshop on Intellectual Property and Consumer Protection in Denver, Colorado, for State Attorney General (AG) Officers, attended by more than 30 State AG officers from the Midwest and Rocky Mountain region. In May 2022, USPTO hosted its fourth trade secret symposium. Open to the public, the event featured six panels, with an overall focus on cross -border issues in trade secret protection. The World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Advisory Committee on Enforcement (ACE) met for the first time since the pandemic began in March 2020, allowing individuals and teams working in the enforcement field to share their experiences on IP and enforcement. The ACE, established by the WIPO General Assembly in 2002, is mandated to carry out technical assistance and coordination in the field of enforcement. Norm -setting is explicitly excluded from the mandate. The 14th session of ACE met from August 31 to September 2.

The USPTO's OPIA China Team conducted regular outreach to U.S. rights holders over the course of FY 2022. In December 2021, March 2022, and July 2022, the China Team hosted webinar updates on recent IP developments in Chi na. The updates provide U.S. businesses, inventors, and IP rightsholders the opportunity to hear from senior USPTO attorneys about the recent developments, and obtain the knowledge needed to navigate China's rapidly changing IP landscape. Each of the qua rterly webinars reached hundreds of attendees. In addition to the quarterly updates on Chinese IP legal developments, the USPTO's OPIA China Team organized and presented several virtual programs on various topics related to China IP enforcement. These webinars included a two -part series on E -Commerce in China for small and medium sized enterprises facing the online sale of counterfeits sourced in China. The first program, in October 2021, focused on the use of online enforcement mechanisms. The second program, in December 2021, focused on moving thos e investigations from online enforcement efforts to offline enforcement, in administrative, civil, and criminal proceedings in China as well as in the United States. The team also hosted a webinar in February 2022 on bio- pharma patents in China, providing detailed discussion of recent litigation, licensing, and patent linkage 44 developments. In June 2022, the OPIA China team organized a webinar on commercializing IP in China through licensing, and provided a September 2022 joint webinar with the China Natio nal Intellectual Property Administration on developments in trademark law. In addition to public facing webinars, the China Team regularly meets with stakeholder organizations, both in- person and virtually, to receive the viewpoints and concerns of member s who help identify issues, as well as provide briefings on recent developments in IP issues relevant to rights holders. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the U.S.- China Business Council, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the International Anti -Counterfeiting Coalition, and International Trademark Association. In FY 2022, the Shanghai IP Attach\u00e9's office provided commercial assistance on numerous IP matters involving patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, related to a range of products, including advanced capacity batteries, information and communications technology, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, chemicals, food, beverage, nutrition, infant care, and design. The Shanghai Attach\u00e9 addressed protection and enforcement of tra demarks and other IP at three industry events organized by the Department of Commerce's Export Assistance Centers and the Commercial Section of the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai. The Shanghai office hosted and supported the Beijing IP Counselor's vis it to Shanghai in October and November 2021 to engage with high- level SAMR officials at the China International Import Expo's (CIIE) IP forum and to gather feedback from affected rights holders in conjunction with the China Attach\u00e9s' reporting for USTR's a nnual Notorious Market List (out -of-cycle) review. In April 2022, to commemorate World IP Day, the Beijing IP Counselor and Guangzhou IP Officer each promoted the importance of IP protection and enforcement. The Beijing IP Counselor prepared op- ed pieces for our Ambassador to China that was disseminated through various media outlets. The Guangzhou IP Officer and local USPTO Guangzhou staff hosted public discussions, highlighting the contributions of women and individuals who invented new and innovative products and methodologies that provided solutions to vexing problems. They also focused on young Chinese artists and entrepreneurs seeking to safeguard their intellectual creations. Since arriving at post in quarter 4 of this fiscal year, the Shanghai Attach\u00e9 has engaged in local outreach on IP issues throughout her consular district. In early September, the Beijing IP Counselor gave keynote remarks at an event organized by the International Publishers Coalition in China (IPCC), which focused on recent developments related to copyright enforcement of scientific publications in the PRC online environment, as well as areas for possible engagement with the PRC government (including PRC judges) on copyright enforcement issues. Following that event, the Beij ing IP Counselor spoke with individual attendees regarding several ongoing enforcement matters, and how the U.S. Embassy could play a supporting role. In mid -September, the Beijing IP Counselor hosted the first Ambassador IPR Roundtable with U.S. Ambassad or to China, Nicholas Burns. Ambassador Burns and the IP Counselor engaged 45 with a wide range of U.S. industries, including fashion, software, telecommunications, publishing, pharmaceuticals, films, sports, chemicals, and fast -moving consumer goods on pressing IPR enforcement -related challenges in China, and how the Embassy could better engage with PRC officials to seek positive reforms and improve the overall effectiveness of PRC IPR enforcement. During Q4 of FY 2022, the Guangzhou IP Attach\u00e9 and Senior I P Specialist virtually conferred with at least fifteen U.S. -based rights holders seeking remedies for trademark infringement in South China. With other members of the USPTO Guangzhou team, they also met with China - based rights holders in their offices and at Consulate Guangzhou, concerning IP challenges occurring in South China. They offered constructive input on effecting solutions. USPTO Guangzhou also counseled rights holders with issues concerning patent infringement, trade secret theft, and enforcem ent challenges. As part of USTR's Notorious Market List research, USPTO Guangzhou enlisted the assistance of the new State Department Consular Officers' assistance in visiting different markets in Guangdong Province, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and S hantou, and Putian in Fujian Province. The added benefit was wider geographic investigation of problematic markets, known for offering a broad range of counterfeit products, including apparel, footwear, toys, watches, mobile and other electronic devices, hardware, and software, and pharmaceuticals. With rights holders continuing complaints about Chinese e -commerce venues and social - commerce platforms offering counterfeit goods for sale, USPTO Guangzhou engaged with other U.S. Government agencies at post a nd in Washington to pursue solutions, including the State Department, ICE/HSI, and the Commercial Service. It also worked with U.S.- based e- commerce platforms to help rights holders take down spurious listings. Importantly, during this period, the Senior IP Specialist has maintained USPTO and Consulate Guangzhou's contacts . The Senior IP Specialist has represented USPTO and the Consulate, either in person or virtually, at several different IP conferences in Sanya, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. The IP topics ranged from protection of seed and agricultural IP to region -wide IP commercialization and enforcement initiatives in the Greater Bay Area, consisting of Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong Province. The central government is promoting the Greater Bay Area as a regional hub of research, development, and innovation, with IP playing a central role in its evolution. European Union Building on the efforts in FY 2021, during FY 2022, USPTO Brussels continued to engage with counterparts in the EU institutions and key EU Member States to facilitate the sharing of best practices on IP enforcement; explore areas of transatlantic cooperati on, such as best practices to enhance enforcement efforts; and plan public -awareness and capacity -building programs and campaigns. With respect to China's detrimental influence in IP matters relevant to U.S. stakeholders and EU economies (especially the s ustained surge of China -origin counterfeit and substandard COVID -19 related products), USPTO Brussels continued to emphasize the 46 importance of establishing a strong risk- based, national -security -focused customs screening system that identifies and removes counterfeit goods from the stream of commerce. USPTO Brussels continued its work in raising public awareness on the importance of IP protection and enforcement, especially as it relates to consumer health and safety, including the situation around the COV ID-19 crisis and ensuing economic recovery efforts. To that end, the IP Attach\u00e9 for Europe spoke at several events on trade in counterfeit products, its negative impact on IP and the economy, and the risks for public health. In November 2021, USPTO OPIA' s Enforcement Team, with support from CBP, presented two virtual workshops to Romanian customs officers and other relevant Romanian officials. The first program was an Overview of Intellectual Property Enforcement at the Border. The second program was a follow -up on Risk Targeting. In December 2021, USPTO OPIA's Enforcement Team, in conjunction with DOJ, presented a virtual program for Romanian law enforcement entitled Workshop on Investigation and Prosecution of Digital Piracy Crimes. In January 2022, USPTO OPIA's Enforcement Team, in conjunction with DOJ, presented a virtual program for Bulgarian law enforcement: Workshop on Investigation and Prosecution of Digital Piracy Crimes. In January 2022, the IP Attach\u00e9 for Europe participated in a regional pr ogram for enforcement officials and a workshop on the investigation and prosecution of digital piracy crimes for officers from Eastern Europe. Moreover, the Attach\u00e9 spoke at the annual AmCham EU IP Committee roundtable. At AmCham EU in Brussels, the Atta ch\u00e9 highlighted the importance of strong IP protection for U.S. businesses to be competitive in Europe. In April 2022, USPTO Brussels organized the World IP Day together with AmCham EU. On this occasion, the IP Attach\u00e9 for Europe discussed innovation pol icies for young generations with an Expert from the Cabinet of the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education, and Youth, before U.S. stakeholders. Moreover, a panel consisting of a member of the European Parliament and young entre preneurs focused on the importance of IP rights and their enforcement for businesses to access and remain competitive in technology markets. In May 2022, the IP Attach\u00e9 for Europe took part in O peration Lascar , an operation launched by U.S. FDA in 2017 concerning trade in illicit products traveling to the U.S. from the U.K. In addition, the Attach\u00e9 spoke at the Virtual Dialogue on Digital Marketplaces and IP Counter - infringement organized by the U.K. Intellectual Property Office. The event gathere d government officials from the G7 countries and focused on countering IP crime and infringement, with specific a focus on online marketplaces and initiatives to tackle counterfeits and enforce IP rights on these platforms. The Attach\u00e9 spoke also at the f irst of three events of the program on \"Whole of Governments Approach to Protect Consumers Against Illicit Health and Safety Regulated Products\" jointly organized by FDA and the Organi zation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Co untering Illicit Trade (TF -CIT). The event gathered officials from several countries and intergovernmental organizations and focused on the need for 47 a whole of governments approach to tackle effectively trade in illicit medicines. The Attach\u00e9 stressed th e importance of IP protection and discussed how the U.S. government agencies cooperate to address the complex international problem of trade in counterfeit medicines. In June 2022, USPTO OPIA's Enforcement Team, with the support of other USG agencies and international organizations, presented a three -day in- person program for government representatives from Bulgaria and Romania entitled Workshop on the Investigation and Handling of Counterfeit Medicine Cases. Oceania In November 2021, the USPTO organized an \"IPR Dialogue\" event with the Oceania Customs Organization (as part of a larger IP legislative technical assistance project with OCO focused on trademark and copyright laws). 48 D EPARTM ENT OF DEFENSE 49 Department of Defense Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2022 activities of the Department of Defense (DoD). Defense Acquisition University : The Defense Acquisition University (DAU) continued to engage in training and educational initiatives during FY 2022 that reflect the following themes: (1) Intellectual property as a critical component of DoD acquisitions in maintaining U.S. military technological superiority; (2) DoD 's desire to collaborate with U.S. Government agencies to identify and build partnerships to address areas of economic, technological, and informational vulnerabilities; and (3) the need to respect and protect technology development investments by the pr ivate sector and U.S. Government in the acquisition of military systems . DAU's Great Power Competition Initiative : DAU established the Great Power Competition (GPC) Initiative (https://www.dau.edu/greatpowercompetition ) focused on educating the acquisition community as they strive to address the impact of peer and near -peer adversaries, per the National Defense Strategy. The GPC Initiative provides domain expertise by connecting with experts, consulting, curating resources, and educating on a spectrum of challenges that global adversaries present, such as global supply chain risk management, intellectual property (IP) issues in the acquisition of military technology, industrial base challenges, international acquisition, innovation and speed, and how peers and near -peers conduct acquisition. A primary goal of the GPC is to educate the acquisition workforce on these challenges and assisting them in developing and implementing strategies to meet them. In connection with the GPC Initiative, DAU began a monthly webinar series, \"Competing to Win,\" where the workforce engages with experts in the field as they share their insights and advice on GPC issues ( https://www.dau.edu/greatpowercompetition/pages/events -and- webcasts.aspx ). Other Key FY2022 DAU Intellectual Property Educational Initiatives : Developing 2 additional on- demand topical videos (e.g., Negotiating IP and SBIR and STTR) . Engaging in a two- year project to update DAU's online suite of IP courses addressing the fundamentals of IP and Data Rights in DoD acqui sitions; t he suite is core to DAU's Foundational IP Credential for the acquisition workforce. Incorporated IP into Executive Level Courses and Workshops (PMT 4010, 4020, Defense Acquisition Executive Overview Workshops - DAEOWS). 50 Participated in numerous webinars and in -person events on IP (e.g. Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) and National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) 2022 Technical Data Rights Forum and DAU's Hacking Program Management webinar series on IP, Part 2). DAU has conducted IP S trategy Workshops with several Program Offices across all of the services to assist these offices in the development of program specific IP strategies. 51 D EPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 52 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \"The FDA's Cybercrime Investigation Unit has been working for a number of years to disrupt and dismantle the growing number of dark web marketplaces, vendors, and networks that are manufacturing and selling counterfeit, misbranded, and unapproved drugs. \"In one investigation in Massachusetts, for example, a man who called himself 'KillWill' distributed counterfeit oxycodone pills that bore markings similar to the Mallinckrodt Pharmaceutical company's oxycodone tablets. Instead of containi ng oxycodone hydrochloride, the tablets were made up of heroin and fentanyl. \"We're also continuing to collaborate with the DEA to crack down on activities that contribute to potential abuse, misuse, and overdoses. Just last week, FDA and DEA issued joint warning letters to operators of two websites illegally selling amphetamine drug products marketed as Adderall. Administrator Milgram and I are focused on this, and will do everything we can to bring to justice those involved in this kind of illegal and dangerous activity.\"4 - Robert M. Califf, FDA Commissioner Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report Drug counterfeiting is a serious threat to public health. Counterfeit drugs or other illegally marketed medical products can raise significant public health concerns because their safety or effectiveness may be unknown. In the United States, a relatively comprehensive system of laws, regulations, and enforcement by Federal and state authorities have helped reduce drug counterfeiting incidents, and FDA works to ensure that Americans can have a high degree of confidence in the drugs that they obtain through legal channels. FDA has made it a priority to investigate reports of concerns associated with counterfeit and other unapproved new drugs and works with U.S. drug supply chain stakeholders to improve our ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats associated with such drugs. FDA also educates consumers and the health care community about the risks of, and minimizing exposure t o, counterfeit drugs , unapproved new drugs , and substandard drug products through oversight of voluntary recalls, public awareness campaigns, and other steps. Additionally, FDA works with our foreign counterparts to identify global supply chain vulnerabil ities as well as identify and implement realistic solutions, nationally and internationally. Improving the Security of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Drug Traceability FDA continues to implement provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Ti tle II of the Drug Quality and Security Act), which was enacted on November 27, 2013. The DSCSA helps to improve the integrity and security of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain for most prescription drugs by establishing product tracing, produc t identifier, authorized 4 Remarks by FDA Commissioner Robert Califf to the 2022 Rx and Illicit Drug and verification requirements for manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distribut ors, and dispensers. The DSCSA also requires critical steps to achieve electronic, interoperable tracing of certain prescription dru gs at the package level by November 27, 2023. These requirements will help to identify and trace such prescription drugs that are distributed in the United States, in addition to establishing national standards for licensure of wholesale distributors and third -party logistics providers. The DSCSA enhances FDA's ability to help protect U.S. consumers from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful by improving detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs f rom the supply chain. In FY 2022, amongst other continued stakeholder engagement, FDA held a virtual public meeting in November 2021 for discussion around enhanced drug distribution security. In February 2022, FDA issued the proposed national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and third -party logistics providers (3PL) along with several key guidance documents for industry. The proposed rule would establish standards for all State and Federal wholesale distributor or 3PL licenses. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on September 6, 2022, and FDA is now in the process of reviewing comments submitted to the public docket. Additionally, FDA proposed to remove certain requirements related to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) . This action was taken because the PDMA requirements are duplicative of the proposed rule. In 2022, FDA issued a series of guidance documents laying out FDA recommendations for how to comply with applicable DSCSA requirements, including those for product tracing, verification systems under the DSCSA, identifying trading partners, and standards for the interoperable exchange of information. The guidance documents are summarized b elow : The final guidance on Drug Product Tracing: The Effect of Section 585 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Questions and Answers was issued to assist industry and State and local governments in understanding the effects of section 585 (Uniform National Policy) on drug product tracing as required by the DSCSA , which establishes a Federal system for tracing prescription drug products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain and requires trading partners to pass, receive, and maintai n certain product and distribution information. Section 585 requires there be a uniform national policy, preempting States from establishing or continuing in effect certain standards and requirements. The revised draft guidance Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs covered the verification system requirements that include the quarantine and investigation of a suspect product and the quarantine and disposition of a product determined to be illegitimate. It also addresses the requirement for notification to FDA of a product that has been cleared by a trading partner after a suspect product investigation because it is determined that the product is not an illegitimate product. Finally, this draft guidanc e addresses the requirement for responding to requests for verification and processing saleable returns. 54 The revised draft guidance DSCSA Standards for the Interoperable Exchange of Information for Tracing of Certain Human, Finished, Prescription Drugs Guidance for Industry identifies the standards necessary to facilitate the DSCSA -mandated adoption of secure, interoperable, electronic data exchange among the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, and clarifies the trading partners, products, and transa ctions subject to such standards. The revisions update the policy articulated in the November 2014 draft guidance to reflect the enhanced drug distribution security requirements that will go into effect on November 27, 2023, including that paper -based met hods of product tracing will no longer be permitted and verification of product at the package level will be required, unless a waiver, exception, or exemption applies. The revised draft guidance Identifying Trading Partners Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act was issued to assist industry and State and local governments in understanding how to categorize the entities in the drug supply chain in accordance with the DSCSA. The guidance explains how to determine when certain statutory requireme nts will apply to entities that are considered trading partners in the drug supply chain (e.g., private -label distributors, salvagers, and returns processors and reverse logistics providers), provides clarification on certain scenarios, and addresses the interpretation of section 582(a)(7) of the FD&C Act, which discusses third -party logistics providers licensure status prior to the effective date of the forthcoming regulations establishing licensure standards. The final guidance Exemption and Exclusion f rom Certain Requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) for the Distribution of FDA -Approved Naloxone Products During the Opioid Public Health Emergency clarifies the scope of the public health emergency exclusion and exemption under the DSC SA as they apply to the distribution of FDA -approved naloxone products indicated for the emergency treatment of opioid overdoses to harm reduction programs during the opioid public health emergency. FDA is planning for additional stakeholder engagement and discussions on systems and processes needed for enhanced supply chain security requirements that go into effect in 2023. For updates about DSCSA implementation and copies of the guidance documents see http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugIntegrityandSupplyChainSecurity/DrugSupplyChain SecurityAct/default.htm . Engagement with Other Countries on Counterfeit Medical Products and Su pply Chain Security Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Global Medical Product Quality and Supply Chain Security Efforts FDA continues to support and advance the APEC Supply Chain Security Toolkit, which is a comprehensive resource that addresses prevention, detection, and response with regards to vulnerabilities in the medical product supply chain. The toolkit is the culmination of a collaborative project that was commissioned by APEC with the oversight of the Regulatory 55 Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) and is updated as the medical product supply chain evolves. Efforts are currently underway to update both the post -marketing surveillance (PMS) and internet sales sections of the APEC Toolkit, with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies (ASOP Global) , respectively, taking the leads. Updates to the APEC Toolkit are being made with gui dance from the pharmaceutical industry, member states regulators, and the World Health Organization ( WHO). WHO Member State Mechanism FDA is highly involved in the technical, policy, and strategic implementation of the World Health Organization Member S tate Mechanism on Substandard and Falsified Medical Products (WHO MECH) and serves as a vice -chair for the America's region on its Steering Committee. FDA supports the WHO MECH in its global efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to substandard and falsi fied (SF) medical products, including the development of reports, guidance, tools, and other products. The WHO MECH, composed of public health and national medicines regulatory authorities, focuses on the public health aspects of SF medical products, and does not address intellectual property rights issues. Global Surveillance and Monitoring System FDA has supported the WHO to establish the Global Surveillance and Monitoring System (GSMS) for Substandard and Falsified Medical Products which was l aunched in 2013. The GSMS provides national medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) with an information portal to report counterfeit medical products, and the ability to check if similar products have been found around the globe. If similar products have been found, the WHO works with NMRAs to investigate suspected counterfeit cases and issue alerts as necessary. The GSMS portal is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The online portal, search facility, and access to the photo library have also enhanced participation by Member States. Manufacturers can also submit information on counterf eit products to the GSMS. The WHO has reported that the quality and number of reports to GSMS has been steadily increasing in the last few years. FDA and the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development Bilateral Initiative In May 2022, FDA and the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development launched a three -part program entitled \"Whole of Governments Approach against Illicit Health Products.\" With increasingly sophisticated criminal networks, the threat posed by the illicit pharmaceu tical trade has become too complex to be adequately addressed by a singular stakeholder. Through this program, participants from multiple countries collaborate and use their respective authorities to safeguard consumers from harm, hold bad actors accountable, and identify threats as they emerge. 56 Addressing Illegal Controlled Substances, Other Illegally Marketed Drugs, and Consumer and Health Care Provider Education Illegal Stimulants Online and Warning Letters Issued Schedule II stimulants have an acknowledged high potential for abuse, and it is important to address the public health impact of their diversion and nonmedical use. Diversion is the primary source of prescription stimulants for nonmedical use, and nonmedi cal use is most frequent among young adults and college students. Polysubstance use is common among those who use prescription stimulants nonmedically, with individuals frequently co -using illicit drugs and/or prescription opioids. These concerns come ag ainst a backdrop of rising mortality from psychostimulant -involved overdoses, which involve illicit stimulants the vast majority of the time, but sometimes involve prescription stimulants. In FY 2022, FDA and DEA issued joint warning letters to operators of two websites illegally selling Schedule II stimulants, including amphetamine drug products marketed as Adderall, that are misbranded in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The website operators also violate the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Act (RHA) by failing to register their online pharmacies with the DEA despite knowingly or intentionally advertising the sale of controlled substances. See https://www.fda.gov/news -events/press- Opioids Online and Warning Letters Issued Opioid addiction is an immense public health crisis and addressing it is one of FDA's highest priorities. Tragically, more than 100,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in the 12 months leading up to April 2021, representi ng a 28% increase over the same period during the prior year.5 The illegal online marketing of unapproved opioids is particularly concerning in light of the nation's opioid addiction and overdose crisis. In addition, opioids bought online may be counterfeit and could contain other dangerous substances. In addition to opioids, benzodiazepines are drug products with an acknowledged potential for abuse, and it is important to address the public health impact of their nonmedical use. Benzodiazepine nonmedical use is widespread, and individuals frequently co- use benzodiazepines with alcohol, prescription opioids, and illicit drugs. Associated harms of benzodiazepine nonmedical use are substantial, but occur primarily when people use benzodiazepines in combination with other drugs. Further, in cases where ben zodiazepines were co-used with other substances, medical outcomes are typically more severe than in cases involving benzodiazepines alone. Polysubstance overdose deaths account for the vast majority of overdose deaths documenting involvement of benzodiaze pines. 5 FACT SHEET: The Biden Administration Launches New Efforts to Counter Transnational Criminal Organizations and Illici t Drugs, December 15, FY 2022, FDA issued a warning letter to the operator of a network of 25 websites illegally offering for sale unapproved and misbranded opioids and benzodiazepines to U.S. consumers in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Unpr oven products that claim to treat, cure, or prevent COVID -19 and other conditions As part of its response to the public health emergency, FDA has also addressed the increase in unproven products sold with fraudulent claims to prevent, diagnose, treat, mitigate, or cure COVID- 19 and has issued more than 219 warning letters to companies. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health- fraud -scams/fraudulent -coronavirus -disease- 2019- covid- 19-products for more information. In addition, since the start of the COVID -19 pandemic, FDA has issued 22 warning letters to owners and/or operators of internet pharmacy websites that illegally offer for sale unapproved and misbranded drugs purported to treat, cure, or prevent COVID- 19 to U.S. consumers. See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug- Operation Quack Hack leverag ed agency expertise and advanced analytics to protect consumers from fraudulent medical products during the COVID -19 pandemic. Building upon our previous experience with illegal online pharmacies, a team of consumer safety officers, special agents, and in telligence analysts triage incoming complaints about fraudulent and unproven medical products. Where appropriate, complaints are sent to other agencies or to FDA centers for additional review and possible follow -up action. In some cases, following a preliminary investigation, the Operation Quack Hack team sends an abuse complaint to the domain name registrars or a report to online marketplaces. As of September 30, 2022, FDA issued more than 660 abuse complaints and reports, which are intended to notify c ompanies that may not have been aware that their platforms were being used to sell an unapproved, unauthorized, or uncleared medical product during the COVID -19 pandemic. Through Operation Quack Hack, online marketplaces and registrars have been notified by the FDA of more than 2,200 fraudulent COVID -19 related product listings and websites. Please see FDA's website for more information regarding Operation Quack Hack. On December 27, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a consent decree of permanent injunction that prohibits a New Jersey -based company from receiving or distributing any drugs until the company complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other requirements. The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice on behalf of the FDA, alleged that Natural Solutions Foundation, an orga nization, and its two principals, Rima Laibow and Ralph Fucetola, violated the FD&C Act by selling unapproved and misbranded drugs intended to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent COVID -19. The defendants had received a jointly issued warning letter from FDA and FTC on May 19, 2020. FDA Warns 12 Companies Selling Unapproved Skin Lightening Products On April 19, 2022, FDA addressed the sale of unapproved over -the-counter (OTC) skin lightening drug products containing hydroquinone that do not meet the require ments to be legally sold as OTC drugs in the U.S. marketplace. The agency had received reports of serious side effects, including skin rashes, facial swelling, and ochronosis (discoloration of skin), from the 58 use of skin lightening products containing hydroquinone. Due to the potential harm they may cause, consumers were advised not to use these products. As a part of its response, FDA issued 12 warning letters to manufacturers and distributors of OTC skin lig htening drug products and 19 notification letters to manufacturers who listed these products with FDA but did not actively distribute them, notifying them that these products are unapproved new drugs and are misbranded. The letters explained that OTC skin lightening drug products containing the active drug ingredient hydroquinone are unapproved drugs and are not generally recognized as safe and effective. FDA also added certain skin lightening drug product manufacturers to an import alert to help stop the ir products from entering the U.S. FDA Warns Consumers Not to Purchase or Use Artri and Ortiga products In April 2022, FDA warned consumers not to purchase or use products marketed with variations of the names \"Artri\" and \"Ortiga\" due to potentially dangerous hidden active drug ingredients not listed on the product label. FDA purchased and te sted various Artri and Ortiga products from online sources and found that products purchased from Amazon, eBay, and Walmart and the website www.latinfoodsmarket.com contained hidden drug ingredients. The FD A's laboratory testing found the products contained various undeclared active ingredients, including diclofenac, dexamethasone, and methocarbamol. FDA urged consumers taking these products to immediately talk to their health care professional (e.g., docto r) to safely discontinue use of the product because suddenly stopping these drugs may be dangerous. Walmart and Latin Foods Market voluntarily recalled the products sold on their platforms. FDA Warns Website Operator Illegally Selling Domperidone Product s In May 2022, FDA issued a warning letter to the operator of a website offering unapproved domperidone drug products for sale to U.S. consumers in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Domperidone is not currently a legally marketed hum an drug and it is not approved for sale in the U.S. There are serious risks associated with domperidone including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. These risks are related to the blood level of domperidone, and higher levels in the blood are associated with higher risks of these events. Concurrent use of certain commonly used drugs, such as erythromycin, could raise blood levels of domperidone and further increase the risk of serious adverse cardiac outcomes. The easy availability of domperidone via the Internet poses significant risks to U.S. consumers. Enforcement Actions The FDA Office of Criminal Investigation's Cybercrime Investigations Unit (CcIU ) continues to target darknet marketplaces and vendors that manufacture and sell counterfeit opioids, by identifying those responsible, arresting perpetrators, and seizing manufacturing equipment, counterfeit drugs, and assets. Since the start of the program in November 2017 until September 30, 2022, CcIU's Operation CyberPharma has led to 60 arrests, 26 convictions, and aided in the takedown of a major darknet marketplace as well as the seizure of drug counterfeiting tools, counterfeit drugs, and over $8.4 million in virtual currencies and other assets. CcIU agents also monitor the surface web to identify sellers of counterfeit FDA -regulated products. Cybercrime agents can swiftly make test 59 purchases from online merchants selling consumer goods suspe cted to be counterfeit or substandard. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, CcIU agents have participated in Operation Quack Hack, an FDA -wide initiative targeting counterfeit or substandard COVID -19 related products. Cybercrime agents have used this operation in support of a number of COVID -related criminal cases, including the identification of counterfeit masks and the closure of a website claiming to sell the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine. In March 2022, OCI successfully partnered with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Embassy London, and the United Kingdom's Revenue and Customs, Border Force, and Intellectual Property Office to execute Operation Lascar V . Operation Lascar was first launched in 2017 in response to illicit FDA regulated products being shipped to the U.S. from and through the United Kingdom (U.K.). Since then, Operation Lascar has included five unprecedented joint enforcement operations, bilateral training opportunities, and senior -level engagement. Further, through these enhanced relationships, with a range of U.K. counterpart agencies and the posting of an FDA special agent at U.S. Embassy London, we have successfully participated and supported several crim inal investigations, including those related to fraudulent COVID -19 and counterfeit products. Operation Lascar V, which was conducted in the U.K. from March 21- 25, 2022, examined more than 300 shipments of violative medicines intended for the U.S., identi fied new types of products being transshipped through the U.K. ( including an increase in the shipment of veterinary products ), and obtained updated intelligence regarding how these products are being distributed. Pilot Process to Reduce the Availability of Opioids Online Launched In June 2020, FDA and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) partnered to announce the launch of a 120- day pilot to help reduce the availability of unapproved opioids illegally offered for sale online. Under the pilot, the FDA notified participating internet registries - Registry Services (formerly Neustar), Verisign, and Public Interest Registry - when the agency sent a warning letter to a website operator and the website operator did not respond adequately within the required timeframe. The internet registries reviewed the FDA's notifications and assessed whether to take further voluntary action, including possible domain name suspensions or blocks. As a result of the pilot, nearly 30 websites ill egally offering opioids for sale became inaccessible to the public. 6 In FY 2022, FDA continued this collaboration to help prevent illegal online opioid sales, in addition to other controlled substances, including benzodiazepines. 6 FDA In Brief: FDA Continues Efforts to Curb Illegal Availability of Unapproved Opioids Online , note the pilot was directed to websites offering misbranded and/or unapproved opioids for sale to U.S. consumers and did not specifically address counterfeits. 60 Outreach to Health Care Providers FDA provides various online courses to inform healthcare professionals and provide them continuing education opportunities. One of these courses, Tainted Products Marketed as Dietary Supplements , is available for access through the F DA website. The course focuses on the prevalence of adulterated and misbranded products masquerading as dietary supplements sold in convenience stores, retail establishments, and online. These products continue to be the source of adverse event reports s ubmitted to the agency. The webinar outlines how healthcare professionals can help protect consumers and patients from these products, how adverse events can be reported to FDA, and what measures FDA is taking to protect consumers and patients. Using Adv anced Technology to Identify Suspect Products: CDx (handheld Counterfeit Detection tool) FDA scientists developed a handheld Counterfeit Detection (CDx) tool intended to be used to rapidly screen suspect products and packaging, by visualizing differences between suspect and authentic products and providing preliminary findings in the field. The current CDx technology is used at the U.S. International Mail Fac ilities (IMFs) and other ports of entry to screen suspect incoming packages to assess finished dosage form pharmaceuticals that are offered for entry. The goal is to put affordable tools for identifying counterfeit FDA -regulated products, including pharmac euticals, in the hands of global regulatory law enforcement, and public health officials. An updated prototype, CD5, is currently being evaluated for field- screening of suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals, and sampling of products for further examination and confirmation/analysis. Nine consumer safety officers from the Office of Import Operations received training on the CD5 in 2022. Information gathered during a pilot study is being used to finalize the CD5 production units and to refine the training p rogram and materials to support their use. In FY 2022, a total of 29 products, consisting of 3,811 tablets/capsules/pieces, were examined by import investigators using the CDx. The identified products were examined using the CD5, which has a library that includes over 170 pharmaceutical product profile s. Of the 29 unique products examined, 18 of them were sent to the Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) for confirmation and/or analysis. Since June 2022, t he CD5s have been out of the field and at the manufacturer receiving hardware updates based o n field staff suggestions to make the instrument more user friendly. These updates will allow closer viewing/display of tablets and simplified matching to the library. Once update s are complete the instruments will be returned to field staff and expanded training will be provided. Scientific presence and field deployable tools for rapid field detection of illegal, unapproved, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals and tainted supplements In October 2020, FDA, with DHS/CBP and DHS/ICE Commissioners formalized a partnership at International Mail Facilities (IMF) in a Memorandum of Understanding. This agreement increases collaboration to maximize inspection and detection capabilities in order to prevent 61 illegal and harmful products entering the U.S. through the nation's IMFs. This partnership includes an increase in scientific resources at selected IMFs and sharing of space, technologies, and information, which will facilitate mission respon sibilities by improving efficiency and reducing duplication of efforts. Additionally, FDA and CBP partnered in 2022 to conduct joint operations targeting opioids and other unapproved drugs. Phase 1 of this operation included data sharing across FDA and C BP to inform location and product targeting for Phase 2. During phase 2, FDA and CBP partnered at eight IMFs and five Express Courier Hubs (ECH) to identify products of interest. Under Operation Opioids and Other Drugs (OOOD), over 3,500 parcels containi ng opioids, controlled substances, and unapproved drugs were examined by FDA and CBP which resulted in refusals, including some violative drug products subject to destruction, and referrals to CBP. Through these examinations, approximately 395,000 tablets /capsules/pieces consisting of unapproved drugs and controlled substances were refused, destroyed, or referred to CBP for regulatory action. Operational findings from work completed in FY 2022 OOOD operations will drive future targeting efforts in FY2023. FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC) identified specially trained field -based scientists who use an established set of tools designed to be the most scientifically reliable and efficient approach for the rapid identification of illicit FDA -regulated products (such as falsified and counterfeit drugs, including opioids, and adulterated \"supplements\"). ORA expanded collaborative efforts with Federal partners in the fight against illegal/unapproved drugs by establi shing the first of several planned satellite laborator ies at the Chicago O'Hare IMF in partnership with CBP's Laboratories and Scientific Services (LSS ). The FCC continues its work on field detection of pharmaceutical based agents. While COVID interrupte d IMF lab operations in 2020, full satellite lab operations resumed in June 2021 and FDA's FCC trained eight additional chemists in 2022 to support additional satellite laboratories . Collaboration with CBP at international mail facilities (IMFs) As part of FDA's Import Operation Strategy, FDA import operations personnel work daily with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel at IMFs. FDA regulatory investigators determine admissibility of FDA -regulated products. All parcels reviewed that cont ain pharmaceuticals, are documented and processed by FDA. FDA generates data at eight IMFs regarding the number of mail parcels examined, detention of unapproved drugs, suspected counterfeit pharmaceuticals, products marketed as foods and/or dietary supplements containing undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other non- compliant FDA -regulated products. This data is routin ely shared within FDA and CBP. FDA also shares technology with CBP. For example, FDA and CBP personnel collaborate to utilize FDA's handheld CDx (discussed above) to identify counterfeit pharmaceuticals. FDA's OIO, in cooperation with ORS, is looking at extending the CDx in conjunction with other handheld technologies to identify additional potential counterfeit pharmaceuticals and FDA - regulated products containing undeclared APIs . Beginning in May 2022, ORS held four training sessions for OIO field staff and nine OCI Special Agents on a handheld Raman device, with a potential for further advanced training in FY 2023. The handheld Raman is also used by IMF satellite lab chemists to complement the CDx for identification of falsified/counterfeit pharmaceuticals. This tool can screen for potentially misbranded and adulterated drug products, 62 assist investigators in making sampling decisions, and add a margin of safety for investigato rs by permitting some identifications to be accomplished on intact containers. International Capacity Building and Training: FDA Capacity Building and Training Below are examples of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) capacity building and training activities with foreign countries. In October 2021, OCI participated in the 30th Meeting of the Head of Medicines Agencies (HMA) Working Group of Enforcement Officers, which was sponsored this year by the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of the Republic of Slovenia. In November 2021, OCI provided results to Europol regarding Operation Shield II . Operation Shield is an initiative funded by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) and coordinated by Europol. This ye ar's operation was led by France, Italy, Finland, and Greece and was focused on illicit COVID -19 related products, Benzodiazepines (such as Clonazepam), hormonal substances, food supplements and medicines for erectile dysfunction. In November 2021, OCI participated in the Europol Intellectual Property (IP) Crime Conference. This annual meeting is an overview of general activities being undertaken in the European Union to combat IP violations. In February 2022, OCI met with the London representative of I ndia's Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) regarding general investigative trends and issues with DRI and the United Kingdom. In March 2022, OCI participated in the 10th plenary session of the Organization for Economic Development' Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade (OECD -TFCIT). In March 2022, OCI met with the West Midland Police Department to participate in a brief of the West Midlands Regional Cyber Crimes Unit and their work with OCI. OCI discussed general investigative trends and issues wi th counterfeit pharmaceuticals. In March 2022, OCI participated in the Universal Postal Union's (UPU) Postal Security Group Meeting. This hybrid meeting was held physically at UPU headquarters in Berne, Switzerland. OCI delivered a brief presentation entitled \" Challenges and approaches in the arena of pharmaceutical and medical devices .\" In March 2022, OCI provided an OCI 101 presentation to the Metropolitan Police Intelligence Unit, and representative to the UK Government Agencies Intelligence Networ k (GAIN). The GAIN Unit provided a brief regarding to the investigative jurisdiction of the unit and their work to share criminal intelligence among the UK law enforcement community. In March 2022, OCI partnered with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. Embassy London, and the United Kingdom's Revenue and Customs, Border Force, and Intellectual Property Office to execute Operation Lascar V . Initially 63 launched in 2017, Operation Lascar addresses illicit FDA regulated products being shipped to the U.S. through the United Kingdom (U.K.). In May 2022, OCI hosted representatives from the U.K. Food Crimes Unit at the U.S. Embassy in London and provi ded a presentation to unit members on OCI mission and work. OCI also discussed how the two agencies could cooperate further in the future, to include possible participation in the next Lascar operation. In June 2022, OCI participated in the biannual meet ing of the Heads of Medicines Agencies' Working Group of Enforcement Officers (WGEO). The Heads of Medicines Agencies is a network of the leaders of the National Competent Authorities who are responsible for the regulation of medicinal products for human and veterinary use in the European Economic Area. The WGEO was established in 2007 to contribute to the protection of human and animal health. In June 2022, OCI participated in a joint training program with the USPTO for the countries of Romania and Bulgaria. This initiative provided training to law enforcement officials from both countries training regarding the investigation and handling of counterfeit medicines. In June 2022, OCI participated in an anti -counterfeiting panel for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Packaging Conference held in Berlin, Germany. In June 2022, OCI participated in a workshop (Indo- Pacific Regional Workshop on Enforcement Against Trade in Counterfeit Goods) and a series of USG interagency meetings ( International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA ), State Department, USAID -OIG, CDC) in Bangkok, Thailand. In June 2022, OCI participated in meetings with the Scotland Food Crime Unit regarding the types of investigations OCI conducted between the two organizations. In July 2022 , OCI, FDA Europe Office, and the Organi zation for Economic Co -Operation and Development (OECD) participated in part two of a three -part program calling for a \"whole of governments\" approach, utilizing coordinated efforts by multiple countries and their arsenal of authorities that crosscut multiple sectors of government, to safeguard consumers from harm, hold bad actors accountable, and identify threats as they emerge. Laboratory/Analytical Capacity Building through International Collaboration The Inte rnational Laboratory Forum on Counterfeit Medicines (ILFCM) is comprised of scientific experts from National Regulatory Control Laboratories. It began in 1999 with a bilateral arrangement between FDA and the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and it developed into a partnership with global regulatory counterparts from Europe, North America, Asia, and Aus tralia to maximize the benefits of a scientific network and exchange information on emerging issues related to counterfeit and illegal medicines. The ILFCM also focuses on issues related to falsified/substandard medicines, adulterated dietary supplements, and other important public health topics. The ILFCM is closely 64 aligned with the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC) and provides scientific guidance and laboratory support. Enforcement Activities OCI's Cybercrime Investigation Unit (CcIU) OCI's internet- related criminal investigations are led by its Cybercrime Investigations Unit (CcIU), which strategically targets online transnational criminal networks that threaten the public health of Americans. In FY 2022, CcIU focused resources to counter public health threats, such as the COVID- 19 pandemic and the opioid crisis, through enforcement operations such as Operation Quack Hack and Operation Cyber Pharma (described above). CcIU also participates with the FBI's Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) group, the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC), the Public Safety Working Group of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), and seve ral cybercrime -related international law enforcement working groups. OCI's International Operations Program OCI's International Operations Program (IOP) assists in detecting violative shipments of FDA - regulated products entering our domestic ports and facilities. It is led by three senior operations managers, two of which are posted internationally, and consist s of 15 full -time and one part -time IOP special agents and is supported by two intelligence research specialists. Recently, OCI established a new operations officer position to serve as a focal point within OCI to engage with U.S. and international stakeholder agencies regarding the importation of violative FDA -regulated products. IOP's priorities include engaging with foreign counterpart agencies and international organizations, responding to U.S. Postal Service International Mail Facilities (IMFs), express consignment carrier facilities (including integrators such as DHL, UPS, and FedEx), air cargo facilities, and sea and land ports. IOP special agents routinely conduct joint enforcement activities, including internationally, and play a critical role as part of the FDA's support to the U.S. government -wide effort to combat cross -border crime. IOP frequently provides training to its foreign law enforcement counterparts. Continuing from FY 2021, IOP successfully completed a six -month virtual bilateral training workshop and joint exercise for the Pakistan Customs Service, together with the Commerce Department's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The focus of this workshop was to help identify, int erdict, and seize contraband transiting through air freight and air mail facilities in Pakistan that poses a significant health and safety risk to the public in the United States, Pakistan, and elsewhere. IOP also provides training to federal partner agen cies, State and local law enforcement personnel, and regulated industry. 65 OCI Enforcement Actions OCI plays a leading role in combating counterfeit pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Below are notable examples of OCI's enforcement activities. Additio nal FDA enforcement cases are discussed further below. Review of Certain Imported Drugs FDA has implemented the enforcement tool provided by section 708 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) to combat illegal drug importation. Section 708 amended section 801(a) of the FD&C Act to give FDA the authority to administratively destroy refused drugs that are valued at $2500 or less. This authority was implemented nationwide in FY 2017. In addition, in the SUPPORT Act (Substance Use -Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and C ommunities Act), which became law on October 24, 2018, Congress granted FDA additional import authority to help the Agency advance efforts to stop illegal and unsafe drugs from being imported into the United States. For instance, section 3022(d) of the SU PPORT Act added section 801(u) to the FD&C Act; the provision authorizes FDA to treat certain imported articles as \"drugs\" for purposes of determining admissibility, including if the article is an ingredient \"that presents significant public health concern \" and it is, or contains, the same active pharmaceutical ingredient of an FDA approved drug. This provision enhances FDA's ability under its importation authorities in section 801 of the Act to detain, refuse and potentially destroy illicit articles impor ted in the IMFs. FDA developed procedures for the section 801(u) authority and began using this new authority on March 4, 2019. In FY 2020, FDA destroyed over 34,000 violative drug products that were not in compliance with U.S. requirements. More than 22,000 (65%) of those violative drug products were destroyed based on the new authority under section 801(u). In FY 2021, FDA destroyed over 59,000 violative drug products with more than 43,000 (74%) utilizing this authority. In FY 2022, FDA destroyed over 56,000 violative drug products with more than 33,000 (58%) utilizing this authority. The Safeguarding Therapeutics Act In the Safeguarding Therapeutics Act (Pub. L. 116- 304), signed into law on January 5, 2021, Congress amended section 801(a) of the FD&C Act to grant FDA the authority to administratively destroy medical devices valued at $2500 or less (or such higher amount as the Secretary of the Treasury may set by regulation) that have been refused admission into the United States. FDA is in the p rocess of revising the associated regulation(s) necessary for implementing this new destruction authority. 66 Operation Opson FDA continues to participate in the annual Operation Opson , which is a joint operation lead by Europol and INTERPOL that targets counterfeit and substandard food and beverages. Operation Opson began in 2010 and has grown to include over 60 participating countries. Operation Pangea FDA continues to participate in the annual Operation Pangea, which is coordinated by INTERPOL. Operation Pangea is a well -established international effort to disrupt the online sale of counterfeit and illicit health products. Since its launch in 2008 until now, Operation Pange a has removed more than 105 million units (pills, ampoules, sachets, bottles and so on) from circulation and made more than 3,000 arrests. Other FDA Enforcement Actions In addition to the operations discussed above, FDA -led enforcement cases during FY 2022 include the following prosecutions: Woman sentenced for importing counterfeit products to the U.S. On March 18, 2022, Dina Al-Sbeihi of Merrillville, Indiana, pleaded guilty to a consumer fraud charge and was sentenced in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of Indiana , to 2 years of probation and 6 months of home detention, and ordered to pay a judgment of $260,739.49. The investigation was initiated upon the detention by U.S. Customs and Border Protection of multiple packages addressed to Al - Sbeihi. The packages were found to contain counterfeit units of Restylane and Juvederm. The investigation revealed that Al -Sbeihi was selling the products through \"The Beauty Pharmacy\" located in Merrillville, Indiana and thebeautypharmacy.com. Through a series of undercover online purchases, additional evidence was obtained from Al -Sbeihi. Laboratory analysis conducted by the Forensic Chemistry Center determined that the products were not consistent with the authentic product provided by the manufacturer. Al -Sbeihi was indicted in June 2020 and later pleaded guilty to selling the counterfeit products from July 2015 through August man sentenced for selling counterfeit prescription drugs. Albert Boozer was sentenced to 4 months of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 for introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce . Investigation revealed that Boozer offered fo r sale counterfeit versions of Ambien, C ialis, clonazepam, hydrocodone, S oma, T ramadol, Valium, X anax, www.cheapmedstore.com. https://casetext.com/case/united -states-v -boozer -4 67 D EPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 68 Department of Homeland Security \"Customs and Border Protection remains committed to intercepting counterfeit and potentially dangerous consumer goods, and we strongly encourage consumers to protect themselves and their families by purchasing goods only from reputable vendors.\"7 - Mark Laria, CBP Area Port Director, Area Por t of Norfolk - Newport News \"A vehicle's airbag is an essential car safety feature and counterfeit airbags pose an invisible threat to a vehicle's occupants. Protecting the health and safety of the American consumer is a top priority for Customs and Border Protection, and CBP officers will continue to work closely with our law enforcement and consumer safety partners to intercept counterfeit and potentially dangerous consumer products.\"8 - Joseph Martella, C BP Area Port Director, Area Port of Philadelphia \"Counterfeit airbags pose real dangers to unsuspecting members of the public. The risks of counterfeit and substandard auto parts are known by those who work in the automotive industry. . . . This investigation is yet another reminde r of the risks posed by counterfeit goods.\"9 - William S. Walker, Acting Special Agent in Charge, HSI Philadelphia Department of Homeland Security Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report This appendix discusses the FY 2022 activities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As outlined below, DHS's activities including protecting public and private acquisition supply chains from counterfeits; conducting law enforcement operations; engaging with stakeholders; educating the public; cooperating with foreign law enforcement; enhancing IP enforcement through international organizations; and providing capacity building and training to support IP enforcement in other countries. At the Department level, the DHS Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans continues to maintain responsibility for coordinating the development and implementation of strategies and policies for the Department, including those related to trade, specifically, illicit trade, intellectual property rights, and counterfeiting and piracy. The DHS Private Sector Office (PSO) continues to coordinate U.S. Government- wide efforts to catalyze and support private sector and non- governmental -based counter -illicit trade activities. On the international stage, PSO seeks to co ordinate conferences and workshops in key global locations (e.g., Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Hemisphere) to collaborate on U.S. and international government efforts to bolster enforcement through the sharing of best practices and approaches for dete cting and disrupting illicit trade activities. The U.S. Department of State is key to this 7 CBP press release, \"Norfolk, VA CBP Officers Seize nearly $2 Million in Counterfeit Diabetic Socks Destined to Loudoun County, VA\" (July 14, 2022), press release, \"Federal Authorities Arrest Philadelphia Man who Allegedly Imported Counterfeit Airbags\" 2, \"Philadelphia Man Charged with Trafficking Counterfeit Airbags from China\" (February -china . 69 effort as their respective Missions work with host governments to strengthen their enforcement regimes. The appendix includes two sections - submissions by the Hom eland Security Investigations (HSI)- led National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) and those of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) HSI is the principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and is responsible for investigating transnational crime and threats, specifically those criminal organizations that exploit the global infrastructure through which international trade, tra vel, and finance move. As part of these efforts, HSI maintains a global footprint available to support investigations into IP violations with 86 attach\u00e9 offices covering 55 countries, territories, and islands; and leads the IPR Center, bringing regulatory, civil, and criminal authorities under one roof\u2014including the tactics, techniques, and procedures of the partner agencies\u2014 to fight counterfeiting and piracy, and to provide education to both agencies and the public about the danger and impact of IP theft. Protecting Public and Private Acquisition Supply Chains from Counterfeits Counterfeiting is a significant challenge that can impair supply chains for both the public and private sectors. This challenge has increased with the rise of e -commerce, as DHS explained in its January 2020 r eport on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods . In the context of the U.S. Government, acquiring products or services from sellers with inadequate integrity, security, resilience, and quality assurance controls create significant risks, from a national security and mission assurance perspective, as well as from an economic standpoint (due to the increased costs to American taxpayers). Counterfeiting can have significant consequences for the Department of Defense (DoD) supply chain by nega tively affecting missions, the reliability of weapon systems, the safety of the warfighter, and the integrity of sensitive data and secure networks. The goal is to reduce the risk of counterfeits entering the supply chain; quickly and collectively address those that do enter the supply chain; and strengthen remedies against those who provide counterfeit items. DHS Training for Acquisition Professionals Buyers in the public and private sectors need better visibility into and understanding of (1) how the products, services, and solutions they buy are developed, integrated, and deployed, and (2) the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of those products and services. This requires underst anding the threat that counterfeits pose, mitigating their purchase and distribution, and identifying counterfeits and reporting them. 70 To address the systemic threat from counterfeits, the HSI -led IPR Center provides educational opportunities for public and private acquisition professionals. The IPR Center has coordinated with the ICE Chief Financial Officer to provide this training to all purchase card holders across the agency. Additionally, t he IPR Center has posted free training on its websit e that is designed to provide acquisition professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to combat the counterfeit threat . The training on Acquisition Professional Training: Counterfeit Awareness, Mitigation, Identification, and Reporting is at https://www.iprcenter.gov/file -repository/acquisition- professional -training -1.pdf/view . Law Enforcement Efforts to Secure the USG Supply Chain (Operation Chain Reaction) In addition to the steps taken to secure the front end of the U.S. Government's supply chain (through Federal procurement regulations, supplier requirements, and acquisition training), the U.S. Government is also committed to protecting it s vital interests by taking robust enforcement measures against those who sell counterfeit goods to the U.S. Government. Operation Chain Reaction Operation Chain Reaction provides comprehensive, cradle -to-grave supply chain risk management that targets counterfeit items entering the Department of Defense and U.S. Government supply chains. Meaningful results are garnered by focusing on key public and private partnerships, modernizing existing infrastructure and processes, exploiting inter -agency data sources, and identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting supply chain threats. This IPR Center-coordinated effort is led by HSI and consists of 17 Federal law enforcement agenci es (including HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and DoD's criminal investigative offices). In FY 2022, under Operation Chain Reaction , HSI initiated 16 criminal investigations, conducted 7 criminal arrests, and helped secure 11 indictments and 4 convictions, as well as 27 seizure incidents of counterfeit goods. Other notable Operation Chain Reaction activities during FY 2022 included the following. The IPR Center coordinated with Orange County HSI for Operation Chain Reaction on a multi- year investigation resulted in an indictment on July 8, 2022. HSI Orange County and CBP, from July 2016 to February 2022, targeted 200 shipments resulting in 176 seizures valued well over $5 million. In July 2021, HSI Miami and HSI Orange County executed a federal search warrant resulting in the seizure of 1,156 counterfeit network items with an estimated MSRP value of over $7 million. The July 2022 indictment effectively disrupted an importer of over $1 billion in counterfeit electronics. In March 2022, the IPR Center coordinated with HSI Oklahoma City for Operation Chain Reaction on targeting the importation and trafficking of counterfeit network equipment. On July 28, 2022, HSI Oklahoma City executed a federal residential search warrant resulting in the seizure of 1,388 items with an estimated MSRP value (if genuine) of $3.4 million. 71 Law Enforcement Operations Protection and enforceme nt of IP is a national priority, and U.S. law enforcement stands at the forefront of these efforts. In addition to Operation Chain Reaction (discussed above), the DHS law enforcement efforts during FY 2022 included the following operations: Operation A pothecary Operation Apothecary is the IPR Center's public health and safety initiative that addresses, analyzes, and attacks potential vulnerabilities in the entry process that might allow for the smuggling of commercial quantities of counterfeit, unapproved, and/or adulterated drugs t hrough international mail facilities, express courier hubs, and land borders. In FY 2022, the IPR Center conducted two advanced domestic IP pharmaceutical trainings in New York City, NY and Los Angeles, CA. These trainings provided specialized investigative methodologies to special agents from HSI and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, as well as U.S. CBP officers. This training was geared towards advanced targeting and criminal investigative techniques that focused on the increase in mail and e -commerce shipments of counterfeit pharmaceuticals through illicit online pharmacies. In September 2022, the IPR Center conducted two State -INL funded international training s in conjunction with the Department of Justice (DOJ), International Cyber Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) division. The first training in Nairobi, Kenya provided advanced cyber, IP, and pharmaceutical training to Kenyan officials from various law enforcement agencies, the Pharmaceutical and Pesticide Board, and local prosecutor s. Additionally, a second training was conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia where administrative, civil, and criminal judges were in attendance as well as prosecutors, law enforcement and the Mongolian Intellectual Property Rights Office. This training also focused on cyber, IP and pharmaceutical training and sought to establish key partnerships within the region. During FY 2022, under Operation Apothecary , HSI initiated 63 criminal investigations, 22 arrests, 28 indictments, and 21 convictions, as well as 66 seizure incidents of counterfeit items. E-Commerce/Operation in Our Sites The E- Commerce Program is an on -going HSI initiative targeting entities that sell counterfeit products through the internet. This program consists of the well -known operation, Operation in Our Sites (IOS), which was initiated in 2010 as a method to disrupt this activity online. The e - Commerce initiative focuses on developing long term investigations that identify targets, assets, and financial schemes used in operating infringing websites devoted to trafficking in infringing materials. It also emphasizes working in partnership with third -party entities, such as online marketplaces, payment processors, and the express consignment industry. Additionally, the IPR Center coordinates with rightsholders, who utilize civil and administrative remedies to shutdow n infringing sites. 72 In recognition of the wide reach of e -commerce into many of its programmatic areas, HSI promulgated a single agency strategy on February 14, 2018. The HSI e -Commerce Strategy emphasizes an agency approach that leverages collaboration between private industry and law enforcement partners in an effort to act as a force -multiplier in a cooperative enforcement approach to identify and dismantle organizations, and to prosecute persons or entities, that traffic in all manners of dangerous and illicit goods utilizing various e -commerce outlets including open- net websites, the dark web, point -to-point sales platforms, social media, and a variety of payment processors and shipping methods. In FY 2022, in furtherance of the e -Commerce Strategy , IPR Center personnel conducted several meetings with representatives from online platforms, payment processors, and the shipping industry for the purpose of furthering dialogue about how to share information for the purpose of stopping the online sale of counterfeit goods. In FY 2022, under e -Commerce/IOS , HSI initiated 22 criminal investigations, conducted 4 arrests, and helped secure 3 indictments and 1 conviction, and 102 seizures. These investigations are initiated and developed by HSI field offices through IPR Center leads, seizures, informants, complaints, industry leads, and/or other investigative techniques. Operation Engine Newity Operation Engine Newity (OEN) is an HSI -led, IPR Center initiative that focuses on securing the supply chains of automotive and other heavy industry from counterfeit components. The proliferation of counterfeit parts - including critical components such as airbags, bearings, brake pads, accelerator arms, and windshields - has grown exponentially over the last several years and now poses a significant health and safety threat to end users and an economic cost to businesses and consumers through lost revenue, downtime, and replacement costs. OEN personnel work closely with automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), aftermarket parts manufacturers and suppliers, and other automotive parts and equipment companies, including members of the Automotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A 2C2) and the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) Intellectual Property Council. The companies support criminal investigations by providing case support and product authentication. In October 2019, Operation Engine Newity industry partner notified HSI New York, Seaport Border Enforcement Security Task Force (NYC BEST) regarding counterfeit automotive merchandise. On January 14, 2022, HSI NYC BEST executed a federal search warrant resulting in the seizure of approximately 307 items with an estimated MSRP value (if genuine) of $331K. On April 15, 2022, the IPR Center coordinated with HSI Portland for Operation Engine Newity on targeting the importation and trafficking of counterfeit automotive merchandise. On May 4, 2022, HSI Portland executed a search warrant resulting in the seizure of 5,124 items with an estimated MSRP value (if genuine) of $375K and $70K in seized curre ncy. 73 In March 2022, Operation Engine Newity brand partners notified HSI Detroit about counterfeit automotive merchandise. On April 25, 2022, HSI Detroit conducted a knock- and-talk resulting in the seizure of approximately 2,400 items with an estimated MS RP value (if genuine) of $100K. On May 2- 4, 2022, IPR Center representatives traveled to Portland, OR to meet with HSI Portland and assist with executing a search warrant with Portland Police Bureau, and representatives of A2C2. In March 2019, U.S. Custo ms and Border Protection notified HSI Detroit regarding a detained shipment of suspected counterfeit automotive merchandise. This multi -year investigation became Operation Slow Your Roll and culminated on July 5, 2022, when HSI Detroit executed a search w arrant resulting in the seizure of approximately 23,397 items with an estimated MSRP value (if genuine) of $14.4 million.

Finally, the IPR Center de -conflicted 87 investigative targets for partner agencies and industry. Engaging with Stakeholders The IPR Center forms the communications hub around which much of the interaction between private sector stakeholders a nd the law enforcement and regulatory communities takes place. The January 2020 DHS report on Combating Trafficking in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods recommended numerous \"Immediate Actions by DHS and Recommendations for the U.S. Government\" ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/20_0124_plcy_counterfeit - pirated -goods -report_01.pdf ). Recommendation six acknowledged the work of the IPR Center E-Commerce Working Group (ECWG) and recommended the formation of the Anti - Counterfeiting Consortium to Identify Online Nefarious Actors (ACTION). On January 13, 2022, the IPR Center hosted an ACTION meeting. During this meeting, 14 ACTION participants engaged in discussions concerning the structure of ACTION and the E - Commerce Working Group moving forward, including standardizing the procedures for joining ACTION and for information sharing be tween companies and law enforcement. Operation Joint Venture and P roject Trade Watch Through the IPR Center's Outreach and Training Section, HSI coordinates with the public and private sectors to combat IP infringement through its Operation Joint Venture (OJV) initiative. This IPR Center -led outreach initiative is designed to increase information sharing with public and private sectors to combat the illegal i mportation and distribution of counterfeit, substandard and tainted goods, as well as the evasion of duties. The initiative is aimed at fostering investigations into commercial fraud, including activities that threaten public health and safety and violate IP rights. Through OJV, the IPR Center engages with rightsholders, manufacturers, importers, customs brokers, freight forwarders, bonded facilities, carriers, and others to discuss the IPR Center's priorities of protecting public health and safety, the e conomy, and the U.S. Government's supply chain. Through outreach and public engagement, the IPR Center raises the public's awareness of the dangers of commercial fraud violations (such as those involving IP) and serves as a public point of contact for investigative leads. The IPR Center's audience includes a broad spectrum of industries and government agencies, including but not limited to the pharmaceutical, entertainment, wearing apparel, sports, electronic, and automobile industries, as well as customs bonded entities, importers, and law enforcement officials. Project Trade Watch is HSI and CBP's outreach campaign to the importing comm unity to facilitate informed compliance by private industry and to enhance public awareness of law enforcement efforts within the trade comm unity. This campaign exists under the IPR Center's broader OJV initiative . Through Project Trade Watch , HSI and CBP field personnel provide information and red-flag indicators of potential import fraud and importer identity theft. 78 Other Engagements DHS law enforcement agencies which support IP enforcement had numerous other engagements with stakeholders during FY 2022. Some of these public education and outreach efforts are described below. The IPR Center has a unique role within the U.S. Government by serving as a one -stop shop for IP enforcement efforts. In this role, the IPR Center has regular contact with the international community, the media, Members of Congress, trade organizations, i ndustry leaders, and the public . In FY 2022, the IPR Center conducted 107 outreach and training events with 5,494 attendees. In FY 2022, the IPR Center continued the monthly publication of the IPRC Connections newsletter to keep stakeholders up to date on the most significant IPR Center enforcement efforts and outreach activities. Additionally, the IPR Center collects, tabulate s, and catalogs victim impact accounts of brand holders and consumers with the aim to show more clearly the full effect of IP infringement and trade fraud on the U.S. and global economies, public health and safety, and any related threat to government supply chains. Throughout FY 2022, HSI - through its leadership at the IPR Center - collaborated with industry and other government agencies to present training and foster communication. Examples of this include: Engaged the Automotive Anti -Counterfeiting Council (A2C2) and the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA) to provide case -study training addressing counterfeit automobile parts. Collaborated with DOJ 's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and USPTO to provide virt ual training on various IP Enforcement topics and COVID - 19-related fraud. Liaised with CBP 's Office of Trade o n numerous virtual training opportunities in combating commercial fraud and intellectual property rights enforcement. IPR Center HSI personnel assigned to the National Cyber -Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) leverage the resources and analytical tools of the NCFTA to identify domain names and networks affiliated with infringing activity in support of criminal investigations or potential civ il enforcement action. (The NCFTA is a non -profit corporation that conducts real -time information sharing and analysis with subject matter experts in the public and private sectors and academia.) Educating the Public In FY 2022, the IPR Center - in coordination with Michigan State University's Center for Anti - Counterfeiting and Product Protection (A -CAPP), hosted a forum with Co -Founder of Detroit - vs- Everybody to discuss brand protection to help creatives protect their business against IP theft 79 in support of World Intellectual Property Day 2022. With more than 6 million business owners in the U.S. under the age of 35, the April 2022 World IP Day theme focused on young entrepreneurs. Supporting the theme \"IP and Youth: Innovating for a Better Futur e,\" this outreach effort focused on sharing best practices for future innovators who will, in turn, supply the world with their own world -changing ideas. By highlighting IP Protect , an IPR Center initiative launched in 2021 in conjunction with Michigan St ate's A -CAPP , future creators were given tools to effectively navigate IP rights and enforcement. Cooperating with Foreign Law Enforcement As discussed above, DHS law enforcement agencies regularly cooperate with other Federal law enforcement agencies and with law enforcement offices in other countries. Below are especially notable examples of DHS cooperation with foreign law enforcement. In FY 2022, as discussed above, U.S. law enforcement and Federal agencies - including the IPR Center thro ugh HSI, CBP, and FDA - participated in Operation Pangea, a global enforcement effort led by INTERPOL that is aimed at disrupting organized crime networks behind the illicit online sale of fake drugs. The majority of Pangea participant countries conducted a week of coordinated enforcement efforts from June 23- 30, 2022. Through the U.S.- China IP Criminal Enforcement Working Group , DOJ and U.S. law enforcement (including HSI and FBI) maintain a steady exchange of information and case leads with Chinese law enforcement, resulting in successful operations to disrupt the manufacture of counterfeit items, such as airbags, pharmaceutica ls, batteries, electronic components, and luxury items. During FY 2022, the IPR Center was again able to physically host foreign government officials with an interest in IP enforcement at the IPR Center. These included delegations from Canada, Indonesi a, and Saudi Arabia. The IPR Center also engaged with foreign counterparts in meetings and various outreach and training efforts throughout the world.

Capacity Building and Training DHS engages in training and capacity building programs to strengthen intellectual property awareness and enforcement domestically and abroad. Domestic Capacity Building and Training The IPR Center works closely with partner USG agencies, as well as state and local officers, to deliver training and support domestic investigative and enforcement capacity throughout the U.S. 80 In FY 2022, the IPR Center conducted multiple domestic training programs in support of these efforts, as described b elow. The Intellectual Property and Trade Enforcement Investigations (IPTEI) course is hosted by the IPR Center. The IPTEI offers advanced training with a specific focus on commercial fraud and IP theft. Presenters are CBP and HSI subject matter expert s in selected topics and programs. HSI and CBP field personnel are the target audience for this training, which also supports the educational requirement of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. Additional attendees may include representatives from the IPR Center partner agencies, DHS, and DOJ, as well as task force o fficers placed within HSI field offices representing local and federal law enforcement. The course is evaluated through anonymous online surveys which are used to review an d enhance the training curriculum. In FY 2022, due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the IPR Center continued offering the IPTEI training course virtually. Three online sessions (20 training hours each) were held in FY 2022, attracting over 300 participants. The IPR Center also coordinates and hosts virtual training to partner agencies on the use of USPTO's Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) and CBP's Intellectual Property Rights Search (IPRS) systems in support of IP enforcement and investigative efforts. Additionally, the IPR Center delivered multiple IP and commercial fraud -focused trainings to U.S. federal, state, and local officials in FY 2022, including: In June 2022, the IPR Center delivered intellectual property training in Henderson, Nevada to HSI, CBP and Nevada state and local authorities.

In July 2022, the IPR Center delivered IP enforcement training in San Juan, Puerto Rico to HSI, CBP and FBI officers. The training included presentations from private sector to enhance the investigative capacity and sharing of information in combating IP theft. Foreign Capacity Building and Training The IPR Center works closely with partner USG agencies, overseas attach\u00e9s, and U.S. embassies to deliver training and support capacity building efforts across the globe. These efforts are conducted through multiple channels, including th e interagency International Law Enforcemen t Academy (ILEA) program, INTERPOL programs, and the Global Intellectual Property Rights Foreign Law Enforcement Training and Technical Assistance Initiative that is funded through the Department of State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). 81 This initiative - administered cooperatively by the IPR Center, DOJ CCIPS, DOJ OPDAT, and USPTO - is designed to complement the U.S. Transnational and High- Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) in developing and delivering training and technical assistance on IPR and computer crimes to foreign partners in the investigative, prosecutorial, judicial, and customs and border enforcem ent areas. The initiative is designed to strengthen the enforcement capacity of these foreign partners for IPR matters involving transnational organized crime. Through this initiative, the IPR Center, in conjunction with HSI Attach\u00e9 offices, directs, organizes, and delivers regional IPR training in the form of lectures and presentations to foreign customs, police, prosecutors, and magistrates. The IPR Center training programs are typically held in person for 3- 5 days and focus on the investigation and prosecution of IPR violations and associated crimes like smuggling and money laundering. The training programs are interactive workshops led by subject matter experts and focus particular on health and safety counterfeited items such as pharmaceuticals, el ectronics, automotive parts, and health and beauty products. With the growing number of e -commerce marketplaces, the training programs also focus on internet investigations. Private sector representatives or associations are invited to participate in many of the training programs to highlight the challenges their industry sector may face in a particular region and to highlight the necessity of government and industry cooperation. In FY 2022, the IPR Center participated in 50 international training and outreache s in support of these programs. HSI continues to work closely with its foreign law enforcement counterparts, particularly those who received training in IP enforcement.

On June 28, 2022, a grand jury indictment was unsealed, charging three individuals with violating federal wire fraud and money laundering statutes in connection with an operation to sell over $88 million of stolen Avaya Direct International (ADI) software licenses, which were used to unlock features of a popular telephone system used by thousands of companies around the globe. The grand jury charged the following defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 13 counts of wire fraud: Raymond Bradle y Pearce aka Brad Pearce, of Tuttle, Oklahoma; 10 DOJ press release, \"Chemist Sentenced for Stealing Trade Secrets, Economic Espionage and Wire Fraud \" (May 9, of Tuttle, Oklahoma; and Jason M. Hines aka Joe Brown, aka Chad Johnson, aka Justin Albaum, of Caldwell, New Jersey. In addition, the grand jury charged both Brad Pearce and Dusti Pearce with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering. According to the indictment, Avaya Holdings Corporation, a multinational business communications company headquartered in California, sold a product called IP Office, a telephone system used by many midsize and small businesses in the United States and abroad. To enable additional functionality of IP Office such as voicemail or more telephones, customers had to purchase software licenses - which Avaya generated - from an authorized A vaya distributor or reseller. Avaya used software license keys to control access to Avaya's copyright -protected software and to ensure that only customers who paid for the software could use it. In addition, Avaya required that each software license on a n IP Office system be associated with the system's Avaya Secure Digital (SD) card - a small flash memory card with a unique serial number that plugged into the IP Office manager computer - which the end user had to keep in its possession in order to use the licenses. According to the indictment, Brad Pearce, a long- time customer service employee at Avaya, allegedly used his system administrator privileges to generate tens of millions of dollars of ADI software license keys that he sold to Hines and other customers, who in turn sold them to resellers and end users around the globe. The retail value of each Avaya software license ranged from under $100 to thousands of dollars. Brad Pearce also allegedly employed his system administrator privileges to hijack the accounts of former Avaya employees to generate additional ADI software license keys. Furthermore, he allegedly used these privileges to alter information about the accounts to conceal the fact that he was generating ADI license keys, preventing Avaya from discovering the fraud scheme for many years. Brad Pearce's wife, Dusti Pearce, is alleged to have handled accounting and helped run the financial side of the illegal business. Hines operated Direct Business Services International (DBSI), a de -authorized Avaya reseller, in New Jersey. He allegedly bought software licenses from the Pearces under his own name and also using an alias, Joe Brown. Hines was the Pearces's largest customer and significantly influenced how the scheme operated. Hines also received help from Brad Pearce to resell the stolen software licenses. Hines was allegedly one of the biggest users of the ADI license system in the world. Websites Illegal Access to Copyrighted Music.

On November 18, 2021, George Bridi, a citizen of the United Kingdom, pled guilty to his role in the Sparks Group, an international piracy group that illegally distributed movies and television shows on the Internet. Bridi was arrested on August 23, 2020, in Paphos, Cyprus, on charges of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement, wi re fraud conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, for his involvement in the Sparks Group. Bridi was extradited from Cyprus on August 31, 2021. As alleged in the indictment and statements made in open court, between 2011 and the present, Bridi and others known and unknown were members of the Sparks Group, a criminal organization that disseminated on the Internet movies and television shows prior to their retail release date, including nearly every movie released by major production studios, after compromising the content's copyright protections. In furtherance of its scheme, the Sparks Group fraudulently obtained copyrighted DVDs and Blu- Ray discs from wholesale distributors in advance of their retail release date by, among other things, making various misrepresentations to the wholesale distributors concerning the reasons that they were obtaining the discs prior to the retail release date. Sparks Group members then used computers with specialized software to compromise the copyright protections on the discs, a process referred to as \"cracking\" or \"ripping,\" and to reproduce and encode the content in a format that could be easily copied and dissemi nated over the Internet. Sparks Group members then uploaded copies of the copyrighted content onto servers controlled by the Sparks Group, where other members further reproduced and disseminated the content on streaming websites, peer -to-peer networks, torrent networks, and other servers accessible to public. The Sparks Group identified its reproductions by encoding the filenames of reproduced copyrighted content with distinctive tags, and also uploaded photographs of the discs in their original packaging to demonstrate that the reproduced content originated from authentic DVDs and Blu- Ray discs. Bridi arranged for discs to be picked up, mailed, or delivered from distributors located in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and New Jersey to other members of the Sparks Group prior to their official release date. BRIDI then reproduced, and aided and abetted the reproduction of, 104 these discs by using computer software that circumvented copyright protections on the discs and reproducing the copyrighted content for further dist ribution on the Columbia Couple Pleads Guilty to Selling Counterfeit Disney Movies on eBay.

On Feb. 4, 2015, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized a parcel addressed to Clint Rodgers that contained 200 counterfeit Disney DVDs. According to court documents , undercover federal agents purchased several counterfeit Disney DVDs from the Rodgers on eBay in February and March 2015. The Rodgers represented that the DVDs were genuine and authentic Disney products, when in reality, they were aware the products were counterfeit. During the investigation, agents contacted two persons who assisted the Rodgers in selling counterfeit DVDs on eBay. They told agents they were aware of numerous complaints from customers, including complaints that the DVDs didn't work. On Aug. 25, 2015, HSI agents executed a search warrant at the Rodgers' residence. Agents seized an assortment of counterfeit goods, including numerous counterfeit Disney DVDs. Tabitha Rodgers admitted that she conducted the day- to-day operation of the business. She corresponded via email with the counterfeit DVD supplier in Hong Kong and placed orders for the DVDs. She also packaged and sent the DVDs to customers and processed customer complaints when DVDs were inoperable.

Gary Bowser, a Canadian national of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, pleaded guilty in October 2021 to Conspiracy to Circumvent Technological Measures and to Traffic in Circumvention Devices, and Trafficking in Circumvent ion Devices. Bowser was a prominent leader of the criminal enterprise that developed and sold illegal devices that hacked popular videogame consoles so they could be used to play unauthorized, or pirated, copies of videogames. The enterprise targeted pop ular consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo 3DS, the Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition, the Sony PlayStation Classic, and the Microsoft Xbox. According to court documents, the Team Xecuter criminal enterprise is comprised of over a dozen individual members located around the world, including developers who exploit vulnerabilities in videogame consoles and design circumvention devices; website designers who create the various websites that p romote the enterprise's devices; suppliers who manufacture the devices; and resellers around the world who sell and distribute the devices. The indictment alleges that due, to the illegal nature of its business, Team Xecuter continuously sought to evade e nforcement efforts by victim companies, financial institutions, and law enforcement. Notably, Team Xecuter attempted to protect its overall business by using a wide variety of brands, websites, and distribution channels, according to the indictment. From approximately June 2013 through August 2020, Team Xecuter used a variety of product names for its devices, such as the Gateway 3DS, the Stargate, the TrueBlue Mini, the Classic2Magic, and the SX line of devices that included the SX OS, the SX Pro, the SX Lite, and the SX Core.

According to the indictment, Onur Aksoy, aka Ron Aksoy, aka Dave Durden, of Miami, allegedly ran at least 19 companies formed in New Jersey and Florida as well as at least 15 Amazon storefronts, at least 10 eBay storefronts, and multiple other entities (collectively, the \"Pro Network Entities\") that imported tens of thousands of fraudulent and counterfeit Cisco networking devices from China and Hong Kong and resold them to customers in the United States and overseas, falsely representing the products as new and genuine. The operation allegedly generated over $100 million in revenue, and Aksoy received millions of dollars for his personal gain. According to the indictment, the devices the Pro Network Entities imported from China and Hong Kong were typically older, lower -model products, some of which had been sold or discarded, which Chinese counterfeiters then modified to appear to be genuine ver sions of new, enhanced, and more expensive Cisco devices. As alleged, the Chinese counterfeiters often added pirated Cisco software and unauthorized, low -quality, or unreliable components - including components to circumvent technological measures added by Cisco to the software to check for software license compliance and to authenticate the hardware. Finally, to make the devices appear new, genuine, high -quality, and factory -sealed by Cisco, the Chinese counterfeiters allegedly added counterfeited Cisco labels, stickers, boxes, documentation, packaging, and other materials. Customers of Aksoy's fraudulent and counterfeit devices included hospitals, schools, government agencies, and the military. As set forth in the indictment, between 2014 and 2022, U.S . Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized approximately 180 shipments of counterfeit Cisco devices being shipped to the Pro Network Entities from China and Hong Kong. In response to some of these seizures, Aksoy allegedly falsely submitted official pap erwork to CBP under the alias \"Dave Durden,\" an identity that he used to communicate with Chinese co- conspirators. To try to avoid CBP scrutiny, Chinese co -conspirators allegedly broke the shipments up into smaller parcels and shipped them on different da ys, and Aksoy used at least two fake delivery addresses in Ohio. After CBP seized a shipment of counterfeit Cisco products to Aksoy and the Pro Network 107 Entities and sent a seizure notice, Aksoy allegedly often continued to order counterfeit Cisco products from the same supplier. According to the indictment, between 2014 and 2019, Cisco sent seven letters to Aksoy asking him to cease and desist his trafficking of counterfeit goods. Aksoy allegedly responded to at least two of these letters by causing his a ttorney to provide Cisco with forged documents.

From approximately September 2017 through June 2018, You was employed as a packaging application development manager for Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tennessee, where she was one of a limited number of employees with access to trade secrets belonging to Swiss Scientist Convicted by Federal Jury of Conspiracy to Steal Trade Secrets Belonging to GlaxoSmithKline. On May 2, 2022, Gongda X ue, formerly a resident of Allschwil, Switzerland, a legal permanent resident of Switzerland and citizen of China, was convicted of charges related to his participation in a conspiracy to steal trade secrets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) pertaining to biopharmaceutical products under development from January 2010 to January 2016. Xue worked as a scientist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI) in Switzerland, which is affiliated with Novartis. His sister, Yu Xue, worked as a scient ist at GSK in Pennsylvania. Both the defendant and his sister conducted cancer research as part of their employment at these companies. Their research was sensitive and confidential. Consequently, GSK and FMI required Yu Xue and Gongda Xue respectively to sign confidentiality agreements as part of their employment. While the defendant performed basic research for publication in journals, the defendant's sister performed research relating to GSK's anti -cancer drugs under development. Evidence presented at trial showed that the defendant knew that GSK's research could prove incredibly valuable, and that it was proprietary and confidential. While working for their respective entities, the defendant and his sister betrayed their employers and shared confidential information for their own personal benefit. Gongda Xue created Abba Therapeutics AG in Switzerland and Yu Xue and her associates formed Renopharma, Ltd., in China. Both companies intended to develop their own 113 biopharmaceutical anti -cancer products. Renopharma received direct funding and support from the government of China. Gongda Xue stole FMI research into anti -cancer products and sent that research to Yu Xue. Yu Xue, in turn, stole GSK research into anti -cancer products and sent that to Gongda Xue. Yu Xue also provided hundreds of GSK documents to her associates at Renopharma. Renopharma then attempted to re -brand GSK products under development as Renopharma products and attempted to sell them for billions of dollars. Renopharma's own inter nal projections showed that the company could be worth as much as $10 billion based upon the stolen GSK data. In January 2016, the FBI arrested Yu Xue and her Renopharma associates, seized e -mail accounts containing the stolen GSK data, and seized the funds in a Renopharma bank account in order to prevent Renopharma from achieving its goals and monetizing the stolen GSK information. Gongda Xue was charged in 2018 and extradited from Switzerland to the United States in December 2019. Two former GSK employ ees, Yu Xue and Lucy Xi, have pleaded guilty for their roles in sending GSK trade secrets to Renopharma. Yu Xue's sister, Tian Xue, pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy for agreeing to launder the substantial ill- gotten gains which Renopharma e xpected to receive. One of the directors of Renopharma, Tao Li, also pleaded guilty for his role in conspiring to steal GSK trade secrets. The other director of Renopharma, Yan Mei, is a fugitive who currently resides in China. (EDPA, Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets from GlaxoSmithKline to Benefit Chinese Pharma Company. On January 3, 2022, Lucy Xi, formerly a resident of Malvern, PA, pleaded guilty to stealing trade secrets from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to benefit a Chi nese pharmaceutical company named Renopharma. Xi's co -defendants, Yu Xue, Tao Li and Yan Mei, established Renopharma to research and develop anti -cancer drugs. In reality, the company was used as a repository of information stolen from GSK. Renopharma received financial support and subsidies from the government of China. At the time, Lucy Xi (who was married to Yan Mei) and Yu Xue were employed as scientists at a GSK facility in Upper Merion, PA, which worked on developing biopharmaceutical products. Th ese products typically cost in excess of $1 billion to research and develop. In January 2015, Lucy Xi sent Yan Mei a GSK document that contained confidential and trade secret data and information. The document provided a summary of GSK research into monoclonal antibodies at that time. In the body of the e -mail, Lucy Xi wrote, \"You need to understand it very well. It will help you in your future business [RENOPHARMA].\" Yu Xue, her sister, Tian Xue, and Tao Li have all pleaded guilty for their roles in this conspiracy. Yan Mei is a fugitive who currently resides in China. Of JHL Biotech Sentenced For Conspiring To Steal Trade Secrets And Commit Wire Fraud Exceeding $101 Million. On March 15, 2022, Racho Jordanov, the co -founder and former Chief Executive Officer of JHL Biotech, and Rose Lin, another of the company's co -founders and former Chief Operating Officer, were sentenced for their 114 respective roles in conspiring to commit trade secret theft and wire fraud. Jordanov was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months and one day, to be followed by a term of supervised release of 36 months, a condition of which shall be to serve nine months in home confinement. Lin was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months and one day, to be followed by a term of supervised release of 36 months. Both defendants pleaded guilty to the charges on August 24, 2021. According to the plea agreements, in 2012, Rac ho Ivanov Jordanov, also known as \"Racho\" Jordanov, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., and Rose Lin, also known as Rose Sweihorn Tong, of South San Francisco, Calif., co -founded JHL Biotech, Inc., a biopharmaceutical start -up in Taiwan. Between 2011 and 2019, Jordanov, as President and CEO of JHL Biotech, obtained and possessed confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information from Genentech, and used it to accelerate the timeline for and to reduce the costs of JHL Biotech's development and production of Genentech biosimilars and to enhance JHL Biotech's ability to meet various regulatory requirements related to the same. By various means, Jordanov obtained for JHL Biotech's use many confidential and proprietary documents from Genentech without authorizat ion, some of which contained trade secret information. In so doing, he worked with multiple people within JHL Biotech to possess and use confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information he knew JHL Biotech was not authorized to have. According to t he plea agreement, Jordanov hired former Genentech employees to work at JHL Biotech, several of whom he learned surreptitiously brought, without authorization, confidential and proprietary documents with them from Genentech to JHL Biotech. The company use d only some of the stolen documents, but Jordanov tolerated this practice by the employees of JHL Biotech and made no effort to discourage its employees from using the documents or information they brought with them. The employees Jordanov hired provided the Genentech documents and information to JHL Biotech, which, at times, allowed the company to cheat, cut corners, solve problems, provide examples, avoid further experimentation, eliminate costs, lend scientific assurance, and otherwise help JHL Biotech start-up, develop, and operate its business secretly using the intellectual property and scientific know -how taken from Genentech. Jordanov admitted that he suspected that some or all the stolen information was brought to JHL Biotech in violation of relev ant Genentech non-disclosure agreements and employment contracts, but he made no effort to verify whether that was true. In January 2014, Lin arranged for Xanthe Lam, a Principal Scientist working full -time at Genentech, to secretly work as the head of formulation for JHL Biotech. Lin encouraged JHL Biotech scientists to ask Xanthe Lam for assistance or information when they ran into problems. Throughout this time, Lin knew that Xanthe Lam continued to work for Genentech and was not authorized to work for JHL Biotech. Lin also knew that Xanthe Lam did not want Genentech to learn of her work for JHL Biotech. Lin agreed to pay Xanthe Lam's consultancy fee and communicate through her husband, Allen Lam. Between 2014 and 2018, Jordanov sometimes personall y used and instructed others to use confidential, proprietary, trade secret Genentech documents and information relating to Genentech's complex technology transfer procedures and processes. He used Genentech's 115 confidential and tech transfer documents in the development, construction, and operation of new facilities for JHL Biotech including its manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China. In early -December 2016, Jordanov and Lin met with representatives of Sanofi S.A., the multi- national French pharmaceutical company, for approximately one week, during which they reviewed the strategic partnership agreement to be entered into by Sanofi and JHL Biotech. During this week -long meeting, Jordanov and Lin reviewed the prospective partnership agreements, which involved JHL Biotech representing to Sanofi that it had developed and was conducting its biosimilar operations without infringing the intellectual property rights of other companies or using other companies' proprietary information. Jordanov and Lin knew that i f they had not concealed that JHL Biotech had relied upon intellectual property, including confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information that it stole or received without authorization, Sanofi would not have agreed to the corporate transaction a nd invest approximately $80 million in JHL Biotech securities pursuant to the subscription agreement and approximately $21 million pursuant to Biologics Products Options Agreement (BPOA) for a total investment by Sanofi in JHL Biotech of approximately $101 million. On June 1, 2021, a federal grand jury indicted Jordanov and Lin, charging both defendants with: (1) conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and wire fraud; (2) wire fraud (three counts each defendant); (3) international money laundering (nine counts against Jordanov and five counts against Lin); and (4) conspiracy to obstruct justice. In addition, the indictment charges Jordanov with two counts of theft of trade secrets and charges Lin with one additional count of making false statements to a government agency. Pursuant to the plea agreements, both defendants pleaded guilty to count one of the indictment, conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets and wire fraud. The remaining charges were dismissed at sentencing. (DNCA, IRS, Indictment Charges PRC -Based Telecommunications Company with Conspiring with Former Motorola Solutions Employees to Steal Technology.

Based on a review of the public comments, and after further c onsideration of the issues, the three agencies decided to withdraw the 2019 Statement on Remedies for Standard Essential Patents Subject to FRAND commitments (2019 Statement). In announcing their decision on June 8, 2022, the agencies explained that withd rawal of the 2019 Statement was the best course for promoting competition and innovation. The Division indicated that it will evaluate conduct by standards -essential patent (SEP) holders or standards implementers on a case -by-case basis to determine if either party is engaging in practices that result in the anticompetitive use of market power or other abusive processes that harm competition. 12 11 Executive Order 14036 on \"Promoting Competition in the American On the Antitrust Division's request for public comments on a draft of a revised Policy Statement, see DOJ's press release on \" Public Comments Welcome on Draft Policy Statement on Licensing Negotiations and Remedies for 129 Standards -Essential Patents Subject to F/RAND Commitments \" agencies' withdrawal of the 2019 Policy Statement, see the press releases issued by DOJ, USPTO, and NIST on STATE 131 DEPARTMENT OF STATE \"So as we make sure the next wave of innovation is unleashed by the United States and our allies and partners, we'll also protect ourselves against efforts to siphon off our ingenuity or imperil our security.\"13 \"Investing in the United States is the smartest decision an investor can make \u2014 we are one of the most open markets in the world, with a predictable and transparent legal system, intellectual property rights, and a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation. \"14 - Anthony J. Blinken, Secretary of State Department of State Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report In FY 2022, the Department of State continued to promote international economic environments conducive to strong intellectual property (IP) regimes and thereby protect the products of U.S. ingenuity through efforts in Washington, DC, and in embassies and consulates around the world. The Department of State advocates for strong IP protection and enforcement in bilateral policy dialogues and in multilateral fo ra; collaborates with bilateral, interagency, and private sector partners on capacity building; monitors the state of IP protections and enforcement around the world to better address problem areas; and educates public and official audiences on the value of IP both to generate economic growth and to improve people's quality of life. Aligned with the Biden -Harris Administration's foreign policy for the middle class, better IP protection and enforcement abroad allows U.S. companies, including small to medium enterprises, to conduct business around the world with greater confidence. The Department of State's lead on IP issues is the Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement (IPE), located in the Trade Policy and Negotiations Division in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) in Washington, DC. IPE participates in a range of interagency bilateral and multilateral efforts, conducts research and outreach, and serves a central support function on all IP matters for the agency's personnel. Areas in which U.S. embassies work with their host governments include increasing political will for strengthening copyright, patent, trademark, and other IP protections and their associated enforcement, as well as combatting forced technology transfer, online copyright piracy, and the production and sale of counterfeit goods. United States embassies and consulates report year -round on IP issues to keep Department of State headquarters and relevant U.S. government agencies up to date on key developments. Depar tment of State economic sections at embassies also liaise with local and global representatives of creative industries, manufacturers, and others about IP issues and advocate for U.S. rightsholders. State Department officials working on IP issues overseas collaborate with, and receive support from, many agencies, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) IP Attach\u00e9s, the Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), which funds and co -manages the U.S .

The COVID -19 pandemic continued to limit in- person work and travel throughout the fiscal year, and the Department of State operated under a maximum telework statu s for most of the year, but began shifting to a hybrid telework/in- person status as local health conditions improved. With in -person activities limited based on local pandemic conditions, the Department of State maintained widespread use of video- conferen cing and other technologies. This enabled the Department of State to continue crucial bilateral dialogues, create and participate in a broad range of IP -related events and activities, discuss IP issues with interagency partners, and advance U.S. IP priori ties overseas. What follows are illustrative examples of the broad, diverse range of work the Department of State performed on IP issues during the reporting period. Diplomacy to Advance and Protect IP Rights The United States has more than 270 d iplomatic missions around the world. In addition to IPE efforts in Washington, DC, embassies and consulates feature Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) and locally employed staff who work to advance IP protection and combat IP infringement. They advocate for U.S. rightsholders and alert Department of State headquarters and relevant U.S. government agencies about opportunities to collaborate with foreign governments and others, including to improve IP conditions by reviewing legislative and judicial matters, policy changes, and economic and political conditions that affect the IP environment. In addition to fulfilling Department of State activities on IP issues, the embassies and consulates support the overseas work of other U.S. government agencies through their economic sections, public affairs sections, and other Department of State offices. This assistance takes many forms including information gathering, diplomatic engagement to facilitate and coordinate bilateral discussions, participation in public IP -related events, organizing official U.S. government delegations addressing IP issues, and leading follow -up activities to high -level, IP -focused bilateral meetings. Below are illustrative examples of the work that Department of State staff undertook during FY 2022. Argentina: The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires assembled interagency partners and industry representatives at an event to inform local judges and prosecutors about the Protect Lawful Streaming Act (PLSA), which was enacted in December 2020 and established enhanced (\"felony streaming\") penalties for large -scale commercial digital piracy of copyrighted material. In addition to strengthening IP enforcement in the US, the PLSA serves an example for other countries of a law that updates IP protections for today's digital environment while being carefully tailored to apply only to large -scale commercial infringers. The PLSA added 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319C, and it was enacted in P.L. 116- Div. Q, Title II, Sec . 211. Bahr ain: With U.S. Embassy support, the University of Bahrain launched the Bahrain Innovation and Technology Transfer Center (BITTC), established to secure intellectual property protection for any discoveries made by University of Bahrain's faculty, negotiate 133 partner/licensing arrangements, and assist in the commercialization process to develop products and services that meet Bahrain's economic development priorities. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) and the U.S. Patent and Trade mark Office (USPTO) provided training with funding from the State Department's U.S. Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) p rogram. Bulgaria: Investigation and prosecution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) legal cases is a challenge in Bulgaria. Economic Officers (ECONOFFS) from Embassy Sofia continue to support interagency U.S. experts that are assisting the government with IPR capacity building across a broad range of audiences, from university students and entrepreneurs to invest igators, prosecutors , and judges. ECONOFFS note that industry representatives have stated that IPR protection concerns are part of Bulgaria's larger rule of law problems. To help strengthen patent protection , embassy officials and other U.S. government personnel have been assisting Bulgaria in joining the U.S. Google Patents platform, which provides information about patents from around the world. In addition, embassy officials and other U.S. government personnel have been assisting in rule of law reform that would also strengthen IPR protections. Kenya: In February 2022, State Department IP enforcement officials organized meetings between the Washington IP i nteragency, U.S. Embassy Nairobi, U.S. Congressional leaders, and Kenyan Parliamentarians to discuss the global trade effects of proposed Kenyan Copyright legislation. Through the interactions, Kenyan parliamentarians discovered that their new draft Copyr ight legislation would weaken IP protections for American and Kenyan creators and threaten existing important internet service provider (ISP) -related liability provisions. As a result of the engagement, Kenyan leaders were able to successfully pass legisl ation that protects Kenyan and global IP interests, uphold ISP -related liability provisions needed to combat digital piracy, and position Kenya to be in compliance with internationally accepted copyright best practices. Korea: U.S. Department of Stat e personnel in Seoul continue to engage with the Korea Atomic Industrial Forum (KAIF) in working with interlocutors to encourage and track cooperation on nuclear Small Modular Reactor (SMR) innovation that is dependent upon strong U.S.- Korea engagement on intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, and enforcement. Collaboration between U.S. and ROK industries is already underway for global SMR deployment including $2.4 billion of current contracts. This U.S. -Korea partnership is essential to meeting r ising global demand for nuclear power plant construction in combatting climate change. Kuwait: Embassy Kuwait personnel met with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's (MOCI) in October 2021. The meeting highlighted the development of an online syste m to streamline the infringement complaint process and facilitate quicker enforcement responses. Mongolia: There will be more Mongolian inspectors at the PRC border specializing in Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) as U.S. and Mongolian officials set go als for joint IPR protection initiatives for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Subsequent to discussions with the U.S. Ambassador and ECONOFF, the Intellectual Property Office of Mongolia (IPOM) is working closely with Post on IPR events and training for Mongolian judges, digital service providers and entrepreneurs. Further, engagement by the U.S. Ambassador resulted in the 134 Director General of IPOM to confirm that they will work with Mongolian Customs to better implement Mongolia's WTO TRIPS obligations. Pakistan: In July 2022, the State Department's Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs traveled to Pakistan where he met with business and government leaders and pressed them to make improvements to the country's business climate, specifically highlighting the need to address IPR protection and enforcement regimes. People's Republic of China: In September 2022, t he U.S. Embassy in Beijing hosted an IP roundtable discussion with the U.S. A mbassador that cover ed a wide range of consumer good and industry sectors. Discussions focused on obtaining effective IP enforcement through China's civil, criminal, and administrative channels. Romania: U.S. Embassy officers continue to work with their IP interlocutors to improve IPR protection and enforcement in Romania. W orking closely with the INL -supported DOJ ICHIP based in Bucharest, Embassy officers continue to engage with Romanian officials on their National Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy and execution of their intellectual property rights (IPR) work plan. As a result of its \" taking significant actions to improve IP protection and enforcement ,\" Romania was removed from the Special 301 Report 's \"watch list\" in April 2022. 15 In addition, the USG's engagement has established the United States as the key coordination partner on IPR with one of our most valuable strategic allies in the Black Sea region. U.S. Department of State and interagency experts are continuing efforts to enhance IPR protection and enforcement , which further supports growth in our rapidly blossoming Romania - U.S. commercial relationship. Taiwan: In cooperation with Taiwanese i nterlocutors, U.S. Department of State personnel in Taiwan continue to track the semiconductor industry to prevent overcapacity, inadvertent technology transfer, and intellectual property theft. This work is especially important given the potential significance of compound semiconductor chips in military systems and aerospace applications. The work of U.S Department of State Foreign Service Officers with Taiwan's industry leaders helps inform the discussion around export controls and other measures to prevent PRC exploitation of this industry. Thailand: Thailand's new copyright act, which was modeled on the United States' Digital Millennium Copyright Act, went into force in August 2022 after technical assistance by USPTO and advocacy by both U.S. Departm ent of State officers and the Regional IP Attach\u00e9 based at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. Of note, the updated Copyright Act includes a notification system by which rights holders can make direct requests to online platforms to remove IP infringing content. Thailand is also in the process of amending its Patent Act to meet international standards and speed up the patent registration process. 15 USTR press release , \"USTR Releases 2022 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Pr otection and Romania's actions \"include the appointment of its first -ever national IP enforceme nt coordinator, establishment of a new department of the economic police dedicated to online piracy cases, dedication of additional officers to IP investigations, and the General Prosecutor Office Intellectual Property Coordination Department's resumed coordination of IP working group sessions.\" 135 Vietnam: Due to advocacy and interagency engagements by U.S. Department of State officers, Vietnam's National Assembly amended Vietnam's intellectual property law and legal frameworks to better enforce IPR, in concert with their inter- ministerial committee. As commercial relationships continue to rapidly expand, State Department officers with Mission Vietnam and other U.S. government representatives continue to be the partners of choice , including through establishing strong partnerships with the private sector, industry associations, academia, and IP agencies from Thailand and the Philippines. In September, Embassy Hanoi sponsored an IP roundtable and workshop. United States Mission to the Africa Union (USAU): In Spring 2022, State Department Officials, including USAU Mission leadership and representatives from the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, met with the DOJ International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Officer (ICHIP) for an extended discussion on engaging with the Afr ican Union on issues related to enhancing cybersecurity measures and enforcing against cybercrime. There is an overlap in both areas sufficient for the ICHIP to appear at certain cybersecurity -focused events hosted by the AU, as was done in 2021. World Intellectual Property Day The Department of State promotes the awareness of Intellectual Property through ongoing events and activities at embassies around the world . The flagship annual engagement is the celebrat ion of World Intellectual Property Day (World IP Day) on April 26. As the theme for 2022 World IP Day, t he World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) selected \"IP and Youth: Innovating for a Better Future .\" In support of the WIPO theme, the Department of State's Bureau of Econ omic and Business Affairs' IP Enforcement Office (IPE) hosted a virtual private sector panel of four young inventors under age 35 who had experienced the process of obtaining a patent, trademark, or copyright. This inspirational panel discussion was open to the public and targeted specifically at our embassies and their guests. The recorded event was posted on the Economic Bureau's website and on social media. In addition, IPE created a social media Toolkit for all embassies that were interested in usi ng pre-cleared, ready -made content for various social media platforms. The Bureau also executed a 10-day countdown campaign on social media, posting content to generate excitement and interest for the April 26 th event. The IPE Director recorded a sp ecial video message, in both English and Spanish, highlighting the importance of IP. IPE sent the video to all our embassies. And, for the second year in a row , the video message was the Economic Bureau's top media tweet for April. The Department of State also marked World IP Day by engaging in a wide range of activities around the world, which included the following: Argentina: Entrepreneurs, business students, and business leaders attended U.S Emb assy Argentina's World IP Day \"Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship\" event. The hybrid online -in-person event targeted local entrepreneurs in the software industry, emphasizing the 136 importance of IP rights for business development. Speakers from the Argentine Copyright Office, the local Software Chamber, the USPTO IP Attach\u00e9 regional team , and State helped raise awareness about the importance of IP rights for economic development. Botswana: Embassy Gaborone planned a variety of activities surrounding World IP Day. Post led the U.S. Government partnership with Botswana's Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Intellectual Property Authority, and the Government of Botswana's innovation body in an April 26 event focused on \"Intellectual Property and Youth.\" Botswana's Minister of Trade and Industry celebrated Botswana's potential for innovation and encouraged Botswana's youth to harness creativity and government initiatives to extend Botswana's creative industry to international markets. In the run up to World IP Day, Post held a competition for students from high schools and technical colleges. The students were asked to develop a prototype for a product that provides a practical solution to a problem within defined parameters in line with the students' area of interest. In addition, Post worked with USPTO to create radio advertisements and short videos of inspiring young people who have navigated IP journeys and who could point to copyright protections as the critical element that led to their succe ss. These first -hand narratives of life lessons were very motivating and inspiring to Botswanans under the age of 25, who make up more than half of the nation's population. Estonia: Embassy Tallinn, in cooperation with the Estonian Organization for Copyright Protection (EOCP) and the Baltic Film, Media and Arts School (BFM) of Tallinn University, and with support from the Ministry of Education and Research, launched an information campaign targeted at Estonian youth, to raise awareness about copyright and related IPR issues in a digital environment, focusing on how illegal use of digital content may harm digital safety. The project targeted children in all general education schools in Estonia in the 10 to 15 -year-old age group, where the basi c habits of internet use are formed. The EOCP held a contest for second year BFM students to create an original digital campaign poster to teach the importance of copyright, related intellectual property rights, and digital safety. Campaign organizers di splayed the winning works in schools, and all contestants received academic credit for their work.

There were four parts of the event: a short lecture by IP law specialists on the ethical principles of using IP in culture; a meeting and discussion with the film's creators (the director and two lead actors) about the importance of IP ; the lead actress's short, live performance from the film's soundtrack ; and a screening of the film. Embassy organizers livestreamed the event on its Facebook page and the Foundation's website, allowing them to reach a larger audience. Uzbekistan: Embassy Tashkent celebrated World IP Day for an entire month, with trainings, roundtables, lectures, American Space \"Chai Chats,\" and social media campaigns to support IPR in Uzbekistan. Post's goal was to make a broad spectrum of Government of Uzbekistan (GOU) interlocutors, private sector businesses, legal firms, and individuals aware of IPR issues, and to further strengthen enforcement capacity across Uzbekistani society. On April 26, the U.S. Embassy in Uzbekistan held a U.S. panel discussion for university students learning the basics o f IP. Embassy staff translated the event in several languages and reached an audience of about 100, many of whom were learning about IP for the first time. Zimbabwe: In observance of World IP Day and in furtherance of a key mission goal to build an inclusive economy, the U.S. Embassy in Harare hosted American musician and IP activist James Barraque Monfils Evangelista on a five -day exchange visit. The Embassy collaborated with leading arts organization Magamba Network , which curated the exchange that featured IP workshops, public performances , and networking sessions with musicians and music produc ers. As a result, the Mission deepened its network of contacts with emerging and established musicians, music producers, and the arts regulatory bodies , and increased the appreciat ion of the importance of IP for protecting creative work s. Multilatera l Engagement The Department of State works closely with our interagency partners to ensure U.S. views are known and incorporated in global regulatory, standard- setting bodies and in trade -focused organizations. The Department of State participates in U .S. delegations to multilateral forums and international organizations with global IP protection and enforcement implications including the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council) , the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Customs Organization (WCO) Enforcement Committee , the Intellectual Property Rights Experts Group (IPEG) of the Asia -139 Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, the Group of 7 (G7), the Group of 20 (G20), and various United Nations (UN) bodies. Within such multilateral fora, State IPE participates in interagency processes to review resolutions, declarations, and other statements and ensure that U.S. IP priorities are accurately reflected. Depending on the venue and in the event that multiple rounds of negotiations do not result in a document that ref lect U.S. views, an Explanation of Position or an Explanation of Vote may be issued to clarify U.S. policies. A few examples of multilateral documents containing IP equities issued in 2022 include the UN Human Rights Council's Access to medicines, vaccines and other health products in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; the Zero Draft of the G20 Roadmap to Stronger Recovery and Resilience in Developing Countries, LDCs and SIDS ; multiple resolutions from the Seventy -fifth World Health Assembly, including the resolution on Strengthening clinical trials to provide high- quality evidence on health interventions and to improve research quality and coordination; and the UN's Report of the Committee on Information. The United States reports on its incentives to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed country (LDC) WTO members in the annual Article 66.2 Report. IPE receives input from U.S. missions overseas, S tate Department regional and functional bureaus, and interagency partners on the range of U.S. government technology transfer and capacity building activities around the world. IPE submits the Article 66.2 Report to the WTO TRIPS Council annually. The br oad range of activities covered in this report - including laboratory- based scientific collaboration, capacity building and education, and IP enforcement activities - highlight the United States' efforts to promote effective and voluntary transfer of techn ology to LDC members. The United States also continued to engage at the WTO TRIPS Council in FY 2022 on proposals related to the COVID -19 pandemic response. In June 2022, after difficult and protracted negotiations throughout the last year, WTO Members came together to reach an agreement on an IP response to the COVID -19 pandemic that is intended to help get safe and effective vaccines to those who need it most. IPE oversaw the Department of State's response to inquiries on this policy, including by sup porting and coordinating with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. Following the June 2022 meeting of the WTO TRIPS Council, IPE continues to provide input to the broader U.S Government IP interagency regarding whether or not to extend a TRIPS waiver to COVID -19 related therapeutics and diagnostics. Other activities that the Department of State participated in during FY 2022 include the following: OECD Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade Department of State Office of Intellectual Property Enforcement (IPE) leads the U.S. delegation to the OECD Task Force on Countering Illicit Trade (TF -CIT). In March 2022, IPE's Acting Director led the U.S. Delegation for the TF -CIT Task Force Trade plenary meetings in which the United States helped garner multilateral support for the Task Force's work on the development 140 of an OECD Certification Scheme for Free Trade Zones, a novel and innovative policy tool that sets voluntary standards for FTZs that want to join forces in countering illicit trade, promote trade transparency and rules based international order. Investment Climate Statements Every year, economic officers at U.S. embassies and other diplomatic missions prepare Investment Climate Statemen ts analyzing more than 170 foreign markets to help U.S. companies make informed business decisions regarding overseas investments and operations. Each Investment Climate Statement focuses on an individual country market and includes a chapter on IP. Thes e Statements also form a chapter of the Department of Commerce's Country Commercial Guides and can be read together with those guides for a broad description of the investment and business environments in foreign economies. The State Department continues to work with the Commerce Department to further align the complementary Statements and Guides for a more unified experience for the end user. Science and Technology Agreements (STAs) In 2022, t he United States signed joint statements with Denmark, Finland, France, Sweden, and Switzerland for cooperation in quantum information science and technology. 16 These statements referenced existing STAs, which included IP annexes. Interagency Policy Cooperation Department of State IPE, working with U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, engages with U.S. stakeholders and foreign governments to ensure that the U.S. government's positions are informed by the full range of views on pertinent issues, and encourages trading partners to engage fully and transparently with the full range of IP stakeholders. These thorough \"on- the- ground\" explorations of overseas IP environments support bilateral policy decisions by deepening U.S. departments' and a gencies' knowledge. For example, the Department of State provided extensive support to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and interagency colleagues for USTR's IP -related reports, including the annual Special 301 Re port and Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy. At IPE's request, posts around the world submitted detailed analyses of IP protection and enforcement conditions, as well as insights into trademark counterfeiting, protection of trade se crets, and copyright piracy. 16 The US -Denmark joint statement of drafting, the US -France statement was not yet posted. 141 The U.S. Transnational and High -Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network The U.S. Transnational and High- Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) consists of DOJ International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Advisors (ICHIPs), Global Cyber Forensic Advisors (GCFAs) , and long- term agent mentors. The GLEN works with foreign countries to strengthen IP protection and enforcement leading to more effective investigation and prosecution of IP offenses. The ICHIPs are experienced DOJ prosecutors who strengthen global and regional law enforcement coordination and deliver capacity building training. Ten ICHIPs are posted overseas in Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; The Hague, Netherlands; Hong Kong, China SAR; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Bucharest, Romania; Abuja, Nigeria; Bangkok, Thailand; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In addition, two ICHIPs are deployed out of Washington, DC, to specifically address dark market/cryptocurrency and online consumer protection -related aspects of cybercrime and IP theft. The GLEN is almost entirely funded and managed by the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office of Global Programs and Policy (INL /GPP) . The two exceptions are ICHIP Kuala Lumpur, which is funded by the INL Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA), and ICHIP Bangkok, which is funded by the Department of Justice Office of International Affairs (DOJ/OIA). INL and DOJ consult closely with I PE in GLEN program development and implementation. The GLEN has global and regionally focused responsibilities. The ICHIPs: (1) assess the capacity of law enforcement authorities throughout the region to enforce IP; (2) develop and deliver training an d other capacity building formats designed to enhance the capacity of justice sector personnel to enforce IP; (3) assist in developing or strengthening institutions dedicated to enforcing IP; (4) monitor regional trends in IP protection and computer crimes ; and (5) provide expert assistance in support of U.S. IP and computer crimes policies and initiatives in the region. The GCFAs, in coordination with ICHIPs, deliver digital forensics training for investigators, while the long- term federal agent mentors a re designed to be paired with an ICHIP to deliver sustained mentoring to foreign counterparts. Recognition of the importance of international capacity building takes place at the highest levels of the State Department. For example, at the ICHIP Industry Forum for IP Rights Protection on February 23, 2022, INL Assistant Secretary Todd D. Robinson said: \"Intellectual property crime is often marginalized based on a misconception that it is less serious. U.S. foreign law enforcementcapacity building progr amsemphasize how intellectual property crime endangers public health, undermines investment and job creation, and erodes trust in public institutions.\" To deliver foreign law enforcement training and technical assistance to complement the work of the GLEN , INL also provides funding to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) of the United State s Department of Homeland Security , U.S. Immigration and Custom s Enforcement's Office of Homeland Security Investigations (DHS ICE/HSI). DHS and USPTO - delivered workshops ensure that patent and trademark agencies and foreign border and customs 142 agencies receive IP enforcement capacity building tailored to their missio ns. DHS and USPTO programming is closely coordinated with the work of the GLEN. INL funds also support DHS providing U.S. trainers to participate in INTERPOL -managed IP workshops around the world. Capacity Building and Training As noted, the Department of State, using foreign assistance anti- crime funds managed by INL, has a longstanding program to provide U.S. government capacity -building training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat IP crime and to deter wid espread commercial -scale pirated and counterfeit goods and services. The Department of State works with other agencies to prioritize assistance to developing countries that are named in USTR's Special 301 Report as countries of concern. Examples of r oundtable discussions, lectures, and training successes through the ICHIP program include the following. ICHIP Bucharest and officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP) participated in meetings and roundta ble discussions with Kazakh public and private sector IP stakeholders in Nur -Sultan, Kazakhstan. The ICHIP met with officials from the IPR Department (Ministry of Justice), the Industrial Property Division (Justice), the Directorate for Copyright and Rela ted Rights (Justice), the Department of Intellectual Property Rights (Justice), the Department of Services and Investments (Trade), and the independent National Institute of Intellectual Property. These officials are part of Kazakhstan's delegation to the Central Asia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) IP Working Group. ICHIP Hong Kong delivered a series of four virtual cybercrime programs for Vietnamese police and prosecutors from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. At the webinar, about 40 Vietnam ese prosecutors learned about online investigations in a hybrid workshop. The virtual workshop built on previous ICHIP programs on electronic evidence and digital piracy. ICHIP Panama City and ICHIP Dark Web and Cryptocurrency (DWC) assembled the first- ever ICHIP regional cryptocurrency working group in Western Hemisphere. Approximately thirty officials from Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Chile, and Costa Rica learned fundamentals of cryptocurrencies during a multi- day virtual program delivered by a blockc hain analytics company that assists primarily financial institutions and governmental organizations with tracing various cryptocurrencies to services that may possess valuable suspect information. ICHIP S\u00e3o Paulo: In March 2022, a team of Rio de Janeiro- based organized crime prosecutors trained by the ICHIP for Latin America and the Caribbean used best practices to effectively impeach a corrupt police officer who perjured himself while testifying in defense of another corrupt police officer. During a hearing against a former police chief accused of running a protection racket against counterfeit vendors, the witness claimed to have no knowledge of an attempt by the defendant to frame internal affairs officers 143 involved in the investigation. The prosecut ors used ICHIP -taught best methods to obtain cloud- based evidence and used online backups of WhatsApp chats between the witness and the defendant in which they actively discussed framing the internal affairs officer. When presented with this contradictory evidence, the judge spontaneously found the witness perjured himself and detained him pending sentencing. ICHIP Zagreb participated in a lecture from the Department of Commercial and Company Law at the Faculty of Law Zagreb. The lecture covered many concepts related to blockchain technology and associated legal issues, including a comparison of blockchain versus central data systems, the possibility of a blockchain server serving as a central depository, different types of tokens, issues related to the public offering of investment tokens that can trigger SEC oversight, and U.S. case law concerning virtual assets and securities. In addition, in FY 2022, IPE assumed a coordinating role to generate meaningful results of the IP training programs that multiple federal agencies conduct overseas. Working with interagency partners, IPE compiled a list of the IP -related trainings, identified priority countries where the United States may be able to make real progress, and started the process of developing coordinated training plans to maximize both U.S. resources and impact. Internal Education Activities The Department of State is committed to educating its employees about IP issues. In July 2022, IPE partner ed with USPTO's Global IP Academy (GIPA) to provide a two -day virtual training course on IP issues for U.S. government officials. The course was hel d in-person at the USPTO, after being held virtually the prior two years because of the COVID -19 pandemic. Most participants were U.S. foreign service officer diplomats (FSOs) preparing for onward assignments domestically or overseas. The training also i ncluded civil servants and locally employed staff of U.S. overseas diplomatic posts. Experts and stakeholders briefed attendees on IP fundamentals, U.S. government positions on current IP \"hot topics,\" and U.S. industry priorities. These officials are no w better equipped to advocate for U.S. rightsholders and to articulate U.S. government policy positions in bilateral discussions and in international fora. IPE also trained FSOs, locally employed staff, and representatives from various U.S. government agencies in sessions of the Foreign Service Institute's classes on Commercial Tradecraft. The training provided participants with the latest U.S. policy perspectives on international IP issues, enabling them to advocate better for U.S. rightsholders overseas. 144 D EPARTMENT OF TREASURY 145 DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY Department of the Treasury Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report Treasury IP -related efforts on Customs Treasury authority for border enforcement of intellectual property laws, along with certain other customs revenue functions, has been delegated to DHS and is carried out by CBP and ICE (see Treasury Order 100- 16 and 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 212, 215). Under the delegation, Treasury retains the sole authority to approve any regulations concerning copyright and trademark enforcement at the border and works closely on these promulgations with DHS and its components. Treasury efforts to identify and address certain IP -related risks to national security through the CFIUS process The Secretary of the Treasury serves as Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions in order to determine their effect on the national security of the United States. The President's Executive Order of September 15, 2022 ensures, among other things, the robust consideration by CFIUS of risks associated with foreign investment in U.S. businesses with technologies that are fundamental to national secu the authority, among others, to review certain non- controlling investments by foreign persons in U.S. businesses that produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop critical technologies, and this review may include aspects of a technology's underlying intellectual property. The Department of the Treasury continues to accept declarations and notices under its regulations. Among other things, these regulations mandate the filing of a declaration with CFIUS for certain foreign investment transactions involving a U.S. business that produces, designs, tests, manufactures, fabricates, or develops one or more critical technologies based on whether certain U.S. Government export control authorizations would be required to export, re -export, transfer (in country), or retransfer such U.S. business's critical technolo gy to certain transaction parties or their owners. The regulations defining critical technology reference certain control lists of U.S. export control agencies, such as the Department of Commerce. This makes the CFIUS definition of critical technology dy namic. CFIUS does not enforce intellectual property laws. If, however, during its review of a transaction CFIUS identifies a risk to U.S. national security arising from a foreign person's acquisition of, or access to, the intellectual property of a U.S . business, and if other authorities are not adequate or appropriate to address the identified risk, CFIUS will seek to mitigate such risk. Mitigation measures could take a variety of forms, including but not limited to placing the intellectual property in escrow; controlling the foreign person's access to the intellectual property; requiring mechanisms to monitor and enforce such access controls; and ensuring U.S. Government access to, or insight into, the intellectual property. If CFIUS determines that the identified risk cannot be resolved through mitigation, CFIUS may refer the transaction to the 146 President, who can, in accordance with section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, suspend or prohibit certain transactions that threaten t o impair the national security of the United States. Treasury authority to impose sanctions under Executive Order 13694, as amended, in response to certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including the theft of trade secrets for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain. Treasury con tinues to encourage referrals from relevant departments and agencies, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies, regarding targets for potential designation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended by E.O. 13757. The Executive Order authorizes the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, certain malicious cyber -enabled activities, including those \"causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain.\" (The two executive orders are available 147 O FFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE 148 OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE \"The global trade in counterfeit and pirated goods undermines critical U.S. innovation and creativity and harms American workers. This illicit trade also increases the vulnerability of workers involved in the manufacturing of counterfeit goods to exploitative labor practices, and the counterfeit goods can pose significant risks to the health and safety of consumers and workers around the world. \"17 - Ambassador Katherine Tai, U.S. Trade Representative USTR Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report One avenue to promote intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement abroad is through engagement with our trading partners. Through such engagement, the Administration advocates for strong IP protection and enforcement in other countries for, inter alia , creative works, brands, designs, trade secrets, and inv entions by U.S. creators, inventors, artists, and businesses. Through direct engagement with foreign counterparts, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) emphasizes the importance that the U.S. government places on protecting and enforcing IP, and presses for concrete action by trading partners to protect and enforce IP rights, which includes those owned by Americans. To advance the Administration's objectives, USTR uses a broad range of trade policy tools to promote strong IP rights protectio n and enforcement, including Section 301 of the Trade Act; the annual Special 301 review of IP protection and enforcement and related market access issues; trade agreement negotiations; monitoring and enforcement of those agreements; trade and investment f ramework agreements; participation in the TRIPS Council at the World Trade Organization; and high -level engagement in multilateral and bilateral meetings. Given the international competitiveness of U.S. innovative and creative industries, the United States considers strong and effective protection and enforcement of IP rights as critical to U.S. economic growth and American jobs. According to the U.S. Depar tment of Commerce, 63 million American jobs in 2019 were directly or indirectly supported by \"IP -intensive\" industries, and these jobs paid higher wages to their workers, relative to workers in non- IP-intensive industries. In addition, in 2019, these IP -intensive industries accounted for $7.8 trillion in value added and 41 percent of the U.S. GDP. (See Department of Commerce, Intellectual Property and the U.S. Economy: Third Edition (2022) , https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/ documents/uspto- ip-us-economy- third -edition.pdf .) Innovation and creativity are key export strengths for the United States. Combatting unfair IP trade policies will encou rage domestic investment in the United States, foster American innovation and creativity, and increase economic security for American workers and families. 17 USTR press release, \"USTR Releases 2021 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and (February 17, 2022), 149 The USTR initiatives that have advanced IP protection and enforcement include the following. Section 301 Investigation on China's Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property and Innovation Law In 2018, USTR reported that its investigation under Section 301 found that China pursues a range of unfair and harmful acts, policies, and practices related to technology transfer, IP, and innovation. These include investment and other regulatory requirements that require or pressure technology transfer, substantial restrictions on technology licensing terms, dire ction or facilitation of the acquisition of foreign companies and assets by domestic firms to obtain cutting- edge technologies, and conducting and supporting unauthorized intrusions into and theft from computer networks of U.S. companies to obtain unauthor ized access to IP. In March 2018, the United States initiated a WTO case challenging Chinese measures that deny foreign patent holders the ability to enforce their patent rights against a Chinese joint -venture partner after a technology transfer contract ends and that impose mandatory adverse contract terms that discriminate against and are less favorable for imported foreign technology as compared to Chinese technology. Consultations took place in July 2018, and a panel was established to hear the case at the United States' request in November 2018. In March 2019, China revised certain measures that the United States had challenged, including the Administration of Technology Import/Export Regulations. The United States considered that China's actions ha d sufficiently addressed U.S. concerns, and after 12 months, the authority of the panel expired on June 8, 2021. As part of the United States -China Economic and Trade Agreement, China agreed to provide effective access to Chinese markets without requiring or pressuring U.S. persons to transfer their technology to Chinese persons. China also agreed that any transfer or licensing of technology by U.S. persons to Chinese persons must be based on market terms that are voluntary and mutually agreed, and that C hina would not support or direct the outbound foreign direct investment activities of its persons aimed at acquiring foreign technology with respect to sectors and industries targeted by its industrial plans that create distortion. In addition, China comm itted to ensuring that any enforcement of laws and regulations with respect to U.S. persons is impartial, fair, transparent, and non -discriminatory. USTR continues to work with stakeholders to evaluate whether these commitments have resulted in changes in China's ongoing conduct at the national, provincial, and local levels. The United States, Mexico, and Canada Agreement (USMCA) The United States -Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) entered into force on July 1, 2020. The USMCA will support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth in North America. It includes a modernized, high- standard IP chapter, which breaks new ground in U.S. trade and IP policy. It contains comprehensive protections against misappropriation of trade secrets, including by state -owned enterprises. It provides the most robust border enforcement mechanisms of any prior FTA. In addition, strong copyright protection and enforcement, more transparency in the grant of geographical indications (GI) protection or recognition, and full national treatment also promote the strong and effective 150 protection and enforcement of IP rights that is critical to driving innovation, creating economic growth, and supporting American jobs.18 The United States continues to engage with Canada and Mexico to ensure full implementation of the IP protection and enforcement obligations. Ongoing Trade Agreement Implementation and Enforcement In FY 2022, the U.S. continued to engage with Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners (including Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Korea) to ensure that FTA obligations, including those re lated to IP, are being implemented. USTR Special 301 Report Each year, pursuant to statute, USTR issues the Special 301 Report on the adequacy and effectiveness of protection and enforcement of IP by our trading partners. The Special 301 Report is an important tool to engage with our trading partners to promote strong protection for U.S. creative and innovative industries, as well as to promote compliance with trade commitments. USTR actively employs the Special 301 process to identify and address key I P challenges for American businesses and to document and encourage continued progress in countries that undertake legislative and enforcement reforms following engagement under Special 301. USTR released the 2022 Special 301 Report in April 2022. (The 2022 Report is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2022 Special 301 Report.pdf , and the related USTR highlighted serious and ongoing concerns with respect to the environment for IP rights protection and enforcement in China, India, Indonesia, Russia, and other markets. The Special 301 Report provides an opportunity to put a spotlight on foreign countries and the laws, policies, and practices that fail to provide adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement for U.S. inventors, creators, brands, manufacturers, and service providers, which, in turn, harm American workers whose livelihoods are tied to America's innovation -driven sectors. The Report identifies a wide range of concerns, including (a) challenges with border and criminal enforcement against counterfeits, including in the online environment; (b) high levels of online and broadcast piracy, including through illicit streaming devices; (c) inadequacies in trade secret protect ion and enforcement in China, Russia, and elsewhere; (d) troubling \"indigenous innovation\" and forced technology transfer policies that may unfairly disadvantage U.S. rightsholders in markets abroad; and (e) other ongoing, systemic issues regarding IP prot ection and enforcement, as well as market access, in many trading partners around the world. Combatting such unfair trade policies will encourage domestic investment in the United States, 18 United States -Mexico -Canada Trade Fact Sheet: Modernizing NAFTA into a 21st Century Trade Agreement (October American innovation and creativity, and increase economic se curity for American workers and families. Notorious Markets List The Notorious Markets List (NML) highlights select online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR has identified notorious markets in the Special 301 Report since 2006. In 2010, USTR announced that it would begin publishing the NML separately from the annual Special 301 Report, pursuant to an Out -of-Cycle Review. USTR first separately published the 2010 NML in February 2011, and has published an NML for every year since. In the NML, USTR highlights markets not only because they exemplify global concerns about counterfeiting and piracy, but also because the scale of infringing ac tivity in such markets can cause significant economic harm to U.S. IP rightsholders. Some of the identified markets reportedly are host to a combination of legitimate and unauthorized activities. Others reportedly exist solely to engage in or facilitate unauthorized activity. The NML does not purport to be an exhaustive list of all physical and online markets worldwide in which IP rights infringement takes place. A goal of the NML is to motivate appropriate action by the private sector and governments to reduce piracy and counterfeiting. The operators of several websites identified in past NMLs have begun to work with rightsholders to address counterfeiting and piracy. Several markets have also ceased operations or have been the focus of government enf orcement efforts. The 2021 Notorious Markets List was issued in February 2022. (The NML is at https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021 %20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf , and includes an Issue Focus section that examines the adverse impact of counterfeiting on workers involved with the manufacture of counterfeit goods. India The U.S. maintains bilateral engagement with India on IP issues through the IP Working Group under the United States -India Trade Policy Forum (TPF). USTR, working with its interagency partners (USPTO, U. S. Copyright Office, ITA, DOJ, Health and Human Services, FTC, and others), sustained revitalized engagement on IP issues with Indian government counterparts during FY 2022, including through IP Working Group meetings held in October 2021 and July 2022, and a Ministerial -level meeting of the TPF in November 2021. These exchanges and activities centered on the robust protection of IP and enforcement of IP rights, with a focus on areas such as copyright, trade secrets, trademarks, patents, enforcement, and p romoting innovation and creativity through high- level government policies. 152 World Trade Organization Council on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council) The World Trade Organization (WTO) provides an additional venue for USTR to lead engagement with trading partners on IP rights issues, including through accession negotiations for prospective Members, the Council for Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Council), and the Dispute Settlement Body. In FY 2022, the United States advanced its IP and Innovation agenda in the TRIPS Council by focusing on intellectual property and financing. The United States is working with WTO Members including Australia, Canada, Chile, Chinese Taipei, the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, examining how IP protection and enforcement promote innovation and creativity to meet societal challenges and needs. World Trade Organization Accession Governme nts in the process of negotiating the terms for accession to the WTO work with WTO Members, including the United States, to appropriately update and strengthen their IP regimes as well as to expand trade and enhance the investment climate for innovative and creative industries. Other Fora In addition to the WTO (which is the principal forum for addressing trade -related aspects of intellectual property), the United States also advanced these issues in other fora during FY 2022, including the OECD, WIPO, APEC forum, and various U.N. bodies. In the APEC Intellectual Property Experts Group (IPEG), the United States continued to lead an initiative on illicit streaming, which involved the joint publication of the Report on Results of Survey Questionnair e on Domestic Treatment of Illicit Streaming Devices (ISDs) by APEC Economies with APEC and discussions on effective practices for enforcement against illicit streaming. The United States also continued to lead an initiative on industrial design protectio n, including the benefits of the Hague System, which can be a critical component of IP portfolios for competitive businesses in the modern innovation economy, particularly for small and medium- sized businesses in the APEC region. Examples of Additional Ar eas of IP Rights Engagement During FY 2022, USTR, coordinating with interagency subject matter experts, engaged meaningfully with Ukrainian counterparts on next steps for addressing longstanding areas of concern such as the administration of the system fo r collective management organizations, online piracy, and government use of unlicensed software. At the United States -Ukraine Trade and Investment Council meeting held in November 2021, Ukraine agreed to pursue an Intellectual Property Work Plan identifying tangible steps Ukraine can take to demonstrate progress on key IP issues and to develop and implement a program to eliminate use of unlicensed software by 153 government agencies. Ukraine also participated in the Special 301 process in early 2022. However , due to Russia's premeditated and unprovoked further invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Special 301 review of Ukraine was suspended. At the United States -Paraguay Trade and Investment Council meeting held in September 2022, Paraguay and the United States agreed on an Intellectual Property Work Plan that will serve as a roadmap to address issues on the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Paraguay. The two countries, with the relevant agencies coordinating, will implement t he Work Plan, and review this implementation on an ongoing basis. The Central Asia IP Working Group serves as an important mechanism to provide sustained engagement on IP issues and help improve IP regimes in the region. The Working Group met in Tbilis i, Georgia in July 2022. The United States held TIFA intersessional meetings with Pakistan in March 2022 and with Taiwan in May 2022, and held a TIFA Council meeting with Algeria in June 2022. The United States also held technical meetings under the Unit ed States- Indonesia TIFA in November and December 2021; and an Innovation and Creativity Forum with Argentina in November 2021. These meetings discussed a range of issues relating to IP protection and enforcement, such as combatting the sale of counterfei t and pirated goods. Engagement with Stakeholders and the Public USTR frequently seeks public input from all sectors of society, including private citizens, non-governmental organizations, academia, consumer groups, small and medium -size businesses, and the business community (including innovators, content providers, and technology and other service providers). To this end, USTR holds public hearings; seeks written comments regarding negotiation objectives through Federal Register notices; chairs regular sessions with designated public advisory committees; and disseminates trade policy materials such as press releases, factsheets, and statements on the USTR website. These dialogues are critical at every stage of USTR's work, including in connection with the process of negotiating, implementing, and enforcing trade rules. USTR also seeks public input for the annual Special 301 and Notorious Markets List processes. The annual Special 301 Report identifies countries that fail to adequately and effectively protect or enforce IP rights or use unfair barriers to limit market access for U.S. businesses that rely on IP. The Notorious Markets List highlights prominent online and physical marketplaces that reportedly engage in or facilitate substantial copyright piracy or trademark counterfeiting. USTR publishes requests for public comment in the Federal Register that provide opportunities for public input and rebuttals, and the submitted comments are available online. In addition, USTR holds a public hearing for the Special 301 process. 19 In addition to requesting comments from the public and 19 In 202 2, due to the COVID -19 pandemic , USTR fostered public participation via written submissions rather than an in -person hearing with the interagency Special 301 Subcommittee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) 154 holding a public hearing on IP matters, IP trade policy figured heavily in USTR's broader stakeholder and Congressional outreach, including in a range of domestic and inte rnational fora. sending written questions about issues relevant to the review to those that submitted written comments, including to representatives of foreign governments, industry, and non- governmental organizations. 155 C OPYRIGHT OFFICE 156 U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE Copyright Office Appendix for FY 2022 Annual Report This appendix summarizes some of the key enforcement -related activities taken by the United States Copyright Office during Fiscal Year 2022. Overview During FY 2022, the Copyright Office continued to work on many important public initiatives, including the launch of the Copyright Claims Board; the completion of several policy studies; and continued efforts to modernize the Office's operations. The Office also provided law and policy advice to Congress, provided expert advice to the federal courts and executive branch agencies on domestic and international copyright matters, and conducted public outreach and education efforts. Ple ase visit https://www.copyright.gov/ for more information on all of the Office's activities. Copyright Claims Board In December 2020, Congress enacted the Copyright Alternative in Small -Claims Enforcement Act of 2020 (CASE Act) to establish a new Copyright Claims Board (CCB) that would be a voluntary \"small copyright claims\" tribunal comprised of three Copyright Claims Officers who will have the authority to render determinations and serve as an accessible and efficient option for resolving copyright disputes. On June 16, 2022, the CCB began accepting claims as the first U.S. copyright small claims forum via its new we bsite, https://www.ccb.gov/ . Through the CCB website, potential claimants can access and create an account with eCCB, the CCB's electronic filing and case management system, submit or respond to a claim, opt out of a proceeding, and contact the CCB with questions. The CCB website also provides users access to the CCB Handbook materials for guidance on the CCB's rules and how to navigate the CCB procedures. As of September 30, 2022, 181 claims were filed with the Board. No proceeding has yet resulted in a final determination, but there are a few noteworthy trends. Of the three types of claims that can be brought before the CCB, claims for infringement are t he most prevalent. In regard to the types of works at the heart of these claims, the majority of claims involve pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. Motion picture and audiovisual works, literary works, and sound recordings are also the subjects of a number of claims. Additionally, to date, the CCB has issued to claimants approximately forty -five compliance notices and over forty orders to amend for noncompliance. The following are some of the CCB's key features: The CCB is accessible to anyone, with or without an attorney. CCB proceedings are designed to be clearly understood and usable by anyone, even without legal training. Users of the CCB are permitted to have an attorney but can also represent themselves. 157 Participation is voluntary. Both claimants and respondents can decide whether or not to participate in CCB proceedings. Only certain types of claims can be brought before the CCB . Unlike federal court, the CCB's jurisdiction is limited to certain copyright -related claims. Only three t ypes of claims can be brought: o claims of infringement of a copyright; o claims seeking declarations that specific activities do not infringe copyright; and o claims of \"misrepresentation\" in notices sent under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Monetary damages are capped at $30,000. A party cannot bring a claim before the CCB seeking more than $30,000 in total damages. No injunctive relief is available. However, a respondent can agree to stop the complained- of conduct, which agreement can be part of the final decision. For more information, visit https://www.ccb.gov/ . Reports & Studies The Copyright Office advis es Congress on national and international issues relating to copyright. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1). This advice includes providing requested opinions on pending and existing legislation as well as providing analyses on areas of copyright law. The Office seeks to ensure that all members of the copyright community - including copyright owners, technology companies, consumers, public interest groups, academics, and the general public - have robust opportunities to participate and contribute to the Office's policy studies, reports, and recommendations. During FY 2022, the Office worked on three studies that involved issues related to c opyright protection and enforcement . All three studies have now been completed. Study on Ancillary Copyright Protections for Publishers (report issued in June 2022) In response to a series of congressional heari ngs on reforms to digital copyright law, Senators Thom Tillis, Patrick Leahy, John Cornyn, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, and Christopher Coons sent a letter to the Copyright Office on May 3, 2021, asking the Office to undertake a public study to assess the viability of establishing \"ancillary copyright\" protections for press publishers, similar to protections being implemented in Europe, that would require online news aggregators to pay publishers for excerpts of content they provide for others to view. The Copyright Office issued a notice of inquiry requesting comments on issues, such as a) the effectiveness of current protections for press publishers under U.S. law; b) whether additional 158 protections for press publishers are desirable and, if so, what the scope of any such protections should be; and c) how any new protections for press publishers in the U.S. would relate to existing rights, exceptions and limitations, and international treaty obligations. The Office held a public roundtable in December 2021 via Zoom. The final report was released on June 30, 2022. The Office recognized that adequate funding for journalism may currently be at risk and that there are implications for the press's essential role in our system of government. However, the Offi ce recommended against adopting any new copyright protections for press publishers, finding that press publishers have significant protections under existing law and that the challenges of funding journalism in the internet era do not appear to be copyright -specific. The full report and any additional materials (such as public comments, recordings and transcripts of the roundtables ) can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/publishersprotections/ . Technical Measures Consultations (report issued in December 2022) In the hopes that further discussion and collaboration would help ensure that technical measures that identify or protect copyrighted works online provide a reasonable, effective, and flexible approach for all stakeholders involved, Senators Patrick Leahy and Thom Tillis sent a letter in June 2021 requesting the Office to \"convene a representative working group of relevant stakeholders to achieve the identification and implementation of technical measures.\" The Office issued a notice of inquiry on December 22, 2021, soliciting comments and statements of interest to participate in the consultations on voluntary technical measures that identify or protect copyrighted works online. These consultations addressed current and forthcoming technologies for identifying or protecting works, including the technologies' availability, their use-cases, and their limitations. The Office received over 6,000 comments and over 40 statements of interest to participate. Based on the responses received to the notice of inquiry and the outcome of the plenary session, the Office identified specific industry -sector based groups that formed the basis for a subsequent series of smaller sessions. After holding a plenary session in Fe bruary 2022, the Office held a series of smaller consultations in June 2022, which included six moderated sessions and six 'office hours' meetings, in order to dive deeper into the issues identified during the plenary. The Office host ed a closing plenary session for the public on October 4, 2022. A letter addressed to Congress detailing the study's findings was released on December 20, 2022. The letter and additional materials (such as public comments, agendas for the consultations, and recordings of the plenary session) can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/technical - measures/ . 159 Standard Technical Measures and Section 512 (report issued in December 2022) The Copyright Office's 2020 report, \"Section 512 of Title 17,\" examined section 512's \"safe harbor\" framework, which limits an internet service provider's liability for infringement if the provider meets certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the internet service provider \"accommodates and does not interfere with standard technical measures\" to identify or protect copyrighted works. Recall that in September 2020, the Copyright Office held virtual stakeholder discussions covering the legal foundat ion of standard technical measures (STMs), current technologies and their potential for adoption as STMs, and means of identifying or developing STMs going forward. In June 2021, Senators Thom Tillis and Patrick Leahy asked the Office to further explore the identification and implementation of STMs under section 512(i). As a result of this Senate request, the Office issued a notice of inquiry in April 2022 to gather additional information on the development and use of standard technical measures for the protection of copyrighted works, as defined by the statutory framework in section 512(i). This notice of inquiry on standard technical measures is separate from and complements the Office's Technical Measures Consultations for identifying or protecting cop yrighted works online. Whereas the consultations focus on the voluntary development of technical measures to identify and protect copyrighted works online generally, this notice of inquiry focuses on standard technical measures as defined in section 512(i ) specifically. Sixty public comments were received by the May 27, 2022 deadline. A letter addressed to Congress detailing the study's findings was released on December 20, 2022. The letter and additional materials (such as public comments) can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/policy/stm/ . Rulemakings During FY 2022, the Copyright Office engaged in a number of rulemakings. A lis t of both active and closed rulemakings is available at https://www.copyright.gov/rulemaking/ . An illustrative list of enforcement -related closed rulemakings appears below. Section 1201 Exemptions to Prohibition Against Circumvention of Technological Measures Protecting Copyrighted Works On June 22, 2020, the Office initiated the eighth triennia l rulemaking proceeding under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which provides that the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, may adopt temporary exemptions to section 1201's prohibition against circumvent ion of technological measures that control access to copyrighted works. In accordance with the statute, the Librarian's determination to grant an exemption is based upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, who also consults with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce. The ultimate goal of the proceeding is to determine whether there are particular classes of works as to which users are, or are likely to be in the next three years, 160 adversely affected in their ability to make non -infringing uses due to the prohibition on circumventing access controls. The following are a few types of activities which the Register recommended exemptions: Excerpts of motion pictures for criticism or comment and educational uses. Motion pictures, for the provision of captioning and/or audio description by disability services offices or similar units at educational institutions for students, faculty, or staff with disabilities. Literary works, for the purpose of deploying text and data mining techniques on a corpus of literary works for scholarly research and teaching by researchers at institutions of higher education. Computer programs for purposes of invest igating a potential infringement of free and open- source computer programs. The Register did not recommend adopting of the following proposed exemptions: Audiovisual works, for purposes of creating clips to be used in text messages Audiovisual works, for purposes of livestream recording Audiovisual works, for purposes of space -shifting The Register's full recommendation and the final rule issued by the L ibrarian of Congress were published in the Federal Register on October 28, 2021. The exemptions will be in place for the next three years, until October 2024. Information on this entire proceeding is available at https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2021/ . Fair Use Index The Copyright Office hosts and maintains the Fair Use Index, which was undertaken in coordination with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator. This searchable database contains notable cases from U.S. courts that comment on fair use law. The Index contains more than 200 cases. The Office continually updates the Index to keep practitioners and the public informed of new or prominent issues in fair use law, the applicati on of fair use to a variety of types of works, and the law across appellate jurisdictions in the United States. The Index contains clear and concise language describing the facts and outcome of each case, making the Index accessible to the general public and providing valuable information \u2014including a full legal citation \u2014to aid a viewer in further research. The Fair Use Index is hosted at https://www.copyright.gov/fair -use/ . 161 International Activities Throughout the year, the Copyright Office continued to provide outreach and education regarding copyright issues to foreign officials, mostly via video meetings. The Office also hosted international programs to discuss and exchange information on the U.S. copyright system and significant international copyright issues. The Office works with other agencies, including the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and the State Department to participate in meetings, ranging from bilateral matters to international issues affecting various issues affecting intellectual property enforcement and other IP topics. International Copyright Institute Every two years, the Copyright Office and WIPO co- host the International Copyright Institute, a week -long program designed to provide representatives from developing countries and countries in transition with a deeper understanding of copyright law in the digital age. Held from September 26 -30, this year's program, Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Environment for Developing Countries and Countries in Transition, invited participants from twenty -one countries to discuss emerging issues in the copyright field, including issues such as treaty obligations, modern copyright registration systems, the rapidly changing digital environment, the intergovernmental coordination necessary to build an effective enforcement system, tra ining and public education, as well as issues on collective managements, licensing digital works and library issues. Advise Executive Branch Agencies on International Copyright & Trade Matters The Copyright Office supports USTR and other executive branch agencies by serving on official delegations and negotiating teams, as part of its statutory duties (17 U.S.C \u00a7 701(b)). In FY 2022, the Office supported the U.S. government delegations to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) where the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR) discussed, among other topics, a draft treaty that would protect broadcasting organizations against signal piracy. The Office also participated in the annual Special 301 review facilitated by USTR (i ncluding the Notorious Markets out -of-cycle review), and engaged in regular consultation with executive branch agencies on copyright law and enforcement developments in other countries, including draft legislation and guidance documents, compliance efforts , World Trade Organization trade policy reviews and accessions, the TRIPS waiver, and other programs. Copyright Office Modernization Over the past several years, the Copyright Office has engaged in several modernization efforts to provide a more user -centered and flexible design for the Office's electronic registration, recordation, and public record streams. More information about the Office's modernization efforts can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/copyright -modernization/ . The Office also hosts a bimonthly webinar series that focuses on various aspects of the modernization process, which can be found at https://www.copyright.gov/copyright -modernization/webinar/ . 162 Public Outreach The Copyright Office implements a full program of outreach activities to educate the public regarding copyr ight protections. The Office's outreach programs cover a wide range of formats and media, including live presentations, video tutorials, social media, and participation in programs hosted by outside organizations. The Office regularly produces events to educate stakeholders and the general public, including events to reach music and songwriter communities with information about the MMA. In fiscal year 2022, Copyright Office staff fielded over 152,000 public inquiries on copyright topics ranging in complexity, and hosted or spoke about copyright to a variety of audiences at nearly 150 events in virtual, hybrid and in- person modes. The Office has expanded promotional efforts to reach out to new audiences and to create a variety of easily accessible educational resources. These materials provide plain -language explanations of copyright law and specific information relating to the MMA and copyright issues for musicians. The Office hired a diversity outreach specialist focused on reaching underserved communities. Illustrative examples of public events include the following. Public events : In April 2022, the Copyright Office celebrated World Intellectual Property Day with a program, Engage Your Creativity: Copyright and IP for Young Professionals, whi ch reflects the World Intellectual Property Organization's 2022 theme. Panelists explored the intellectual property rights creators enjoy daily and discussed young artists' experience with IP, their career stories, and links to copyright relevance. Legal audience events : The Register of Copyrights and senior staff spoke on a wide number of issues at several events with legal audiences and at other legal and academic venues throughout the fiscal year.
