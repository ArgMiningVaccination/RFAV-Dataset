Jun 12, 2023 Apr 6, 2023 Sep 12, 2022 Lovely fragrance, second time purchase. Thank you Sep 3, 2022 This perfume oil smells fantastic! Definitely a happy scent. I ordered more immediately. Shipped extremely quickly. Professional, efficient Etsy seller. Highly recommend. Thank you. Jun 27, 2022 \"Joy\" is a wonderful scent--it definitely lives up to it's name! I used to work at the College of Botanical Healing Arts (COBHA). COBHA was the first California school where one could become a certified essential oil practitioner. It sounds a little granola, but the curriculum was tough and comprehensive! At COBHA I learned about the power of essential oils. I could differentiate between the high-quality oils from the meh ones, and I can tell you that Moonrise Creek uses awesome essential oils! I'm thrilled to be a Moonrise Creek customer, and I look forward to trying other Moonrise Creek "}
