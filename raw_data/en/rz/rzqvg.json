Al Shaar,1 M.F.S. Ismail,1,2 W.A.A.A. Yousuf1 and R.E. Salama1,3 ABSTRACT A cross-sectional study of knowledge, attitudes and practice of general practitioners (GPs) towards complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was conducted in Doha, Qatar. Out of 119 respondents, 39.1% reported poor knowledge about CAM. Self-reported knowledge was highest for counselling and psychotherapy (69.0%), diet and supplements (68.1%), acupuncture (45.2%), herbal medicine (47.3%) and massage (42.5%). While 83.8% described their attitude to CAM as welcoming and 97.5% were interested to learn more about it, fewer (30.1%) had practised it before, referred patients (24.8%) or asked patients' about their use of CAM (34.8%). Their own lack of knowledge and training in CAM was seen as a barrier to its use by 60.0% of the GPs. 1Department of Family Medicine, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar (Correspondence to M.F.S.
