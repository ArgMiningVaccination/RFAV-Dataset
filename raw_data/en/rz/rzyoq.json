I recommend [The Master Cleanse created by Stanley Burroughs](http://themastercleanse.com/master-cleanse/the-master-cleanser/). The Master Cleanse is a great way to cleanse your body while giving the digestive system a much-needed rest. The Master Cleanse, usually used to achieve rapid weight loss, can also be used to heal and nourish the body in only 10 days. The cleanse is a liquid diet, which some refer to as a juice fast. It effectively supplies all of the healthy and essential nutrients and calories the body needs to function. The beauty of the Master Cleanse is that in addition to being rewarding and beneficial for your body, it is also very easy to follow. There are three main parts of the Master Cleanse. You should utilize all three of these parts in order to extract all of the healing and fasting properties of the Master Cleanse. The three parts to cleanse your body are the lemon drink, the salt drink, and the herbal/laxative teas: Part One: First, you need to make six to 12 glasses of the lemon drink per day over the course of a 10-day period. The lemon drink consists of 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1/10 teaspoons of cayenne pepper, 8 oz. water, and 2 tablespoons maple syrup. Balance out your intake of the lemon drink throughout the day with regular water if you still feel thirsty. This drink is meant to jump-start your metabolism and give you enough calories and carbohydrates to get through the day. Part Two: The salt drink part of the cleanse is a little bit different. The salt drink consists of just a quart of lukewarm water mixed with 2 teaspoons of natural sea salt. You should make sure to drink a quart every morning all in one sitting. The theory is that the salt water helps to stimulate the bowels and flush out the system. Part Three: The third and final part to the master cleanse is an herbal laxative or tea. You can drink peppermint tea throughout the day as a way to calm any nausea you may be experiencing. Make sure to drink an herbal laxative tea before bed each night in order to continue stimulating the bowels and cleansing the system. The Master Cleanse is meant to be followed rigidly for 10 days. After ten days, you can begin reintroducing other foods - juice and vegetable soup at first, followed by raw fruits and vegetables. The Master Cleanse is an easy and extremely effective form of detox dieting. Just follow the simple steps and cleanse your body this spring! I also recommend [acupuncture](https://bewellokc.com/what-is-acupuncture/) in addition to a liquid diet in order to aid in the detoxing, healing, and balancing of your body. Happy Cleansing!
