There is a lot of scope for students opting for life sciences in the near future. CBSE has introduced Life Sciences as an optional course at secondary and Senior Secondary level. Scientists today are capable of generating more data in a day than their predecessors 20 years ago could have gen erated in an entire career. This ability to rapidly generate data has also created a number of new scientific challenges. We are no longer in an era where data can be processed by loading it into a spreadsheet and making a couple of graphs. In order to distil scientific knowledge from these datasets, we must be able to identify and extract nonobvious relationships. All the topics are covered in simple language, with pictures to make it more interesting. As homework, at the end of every unit there is a set o f questions, for revision purpose. The team of authors is thankful to CBSE (Skill Education) for their untiring efforts for bringing out the handbook on time. It is a pleasure for the authors to express their special thanks to the CBSE (Skill Education) ad visors and other coordinating staff members. The book has been made with lot of efforts, still there may be some errors, so valuable suggestions from the readers will be appreciated for further improvement of this handbook in future. 4 Content Unit -1 Common Sicknesses 1.1.

Chalk & talk method. 2. Book Activity: List some of the common sicknesses, and what you do to cure them 7 Objectives After attending this session, you should be able to: Learn about some of the common sickness Know about the symptoms and causes of diseases 1.1. Fever The normal body temperature is between 35.8 \u00b0C (96.4\u00b0F) and 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) in healthy persons. A person with temperature higher than 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) has fever. Fever is produced when the body fights off germs or harmful things that enter the body and cause harm, like bacteria, parasites, or drugs . The cells in the body react with these organisms and try to destroy them before they can do any harm. While the cells react with these germs, certain things are released from the cell that cause an increase in heat production and a decrease in heat loss causing the body temperature to rise. Fever itself is not an illness but it is a sign of illness. It is a warning that there is something wrong with the body and that it is reacting to injury. The importance of fever as a vital sign Fever is a vital sign that tells how ill the person is, if he is improving or not, and whether he is responding to the treatment . The pattern (rise and fall of temperature) and type of fever also tell you what kind of illness the person may be having . Different types of fever : A fever can either be high, mild, or moderate . Listed here are some of the common illnesses that can cause fever: Mild fever ( 99.8 \u00b0C-100.4 \u00b0C) a. infected wound b. boils and abscesses c. tooth abscess d. infection of the middle ear e. cold 8 Moderate Fever ( 100.5 \u00b0C-102.2 \u00b0C) a. urinary tract infection High Fever ( 102.3 \u00b0C and higher) a. influenza (with muscle and joint pains) b. measles c. chicken pox d. pneumonia e. typhoid fever (with severe headache) f. Malaria g. tonsillitis or streptococcal sore throat h. diphtheria i. meningitis (with severe headache and vomiting) The pattern (rise and fall) of temperature are characteristics of some illness like: a. ever that comes only in the afternoon and is gone in the morning may be due to an abscess b. High fever that goes up little each day may be typhoid fever c. Fever that comes every second or third day with chills and sweating may be due to malaria . Treatment Fever causes discomf ort to the sick person. It can cause fits in small children and in epileptic persons. It also increases the heart rate which is dangerous in person with heart diseases. Sweating causes further loss of salt and water from body causing dehydration. High feve r can also cause delirium. When a person has fever 1. Uncover the person completely Small children must be left uncovered and without any dress until fever goes down. Never wrap the child in blanket or any clothing. Wrapping a child with fever is very dangerous Open the window from where fresh breeze or air will come in, it will not harm the person, rather it would cool down the fever 2. Wipe the body with cool wet cloth 3. Give plenty of liquid with pinch of salt in it 9 4. Consult doctor for a suitable medicine either in clinic or on phone 1.2. Headaches and Migraines Headache is one of the most frequent complaints . It may be caused only be tension, migraine or it may be a signal of serious disease s. In persons with headache , it is important to know following: 1. Character of headache -tightness, pressure, bursting, throbbing, dull or steady pain 2. Location of headache -both sides, all over, one side, front, back 3. How long it lasts -minutes, hours, days, or weeks 4. What time of the day -waking up in the morning, midmorning, evening? headache occurs 5. What condition can -tension, reading, stooping of the head cause the attack 6. what condition -position, alcohol intake, etc can make it worse 7. what can relive -rest, medicines etc. the headache Conditions Causing Headache SIMPLE HEADACHE can be helped by rest and aspirin. It often helps to put a cloth soaked in hot water on the back of the neck and to massage (rub) the neck and shoulders gently. Some other home remedies also seem to help. Headaches that keep coming back may be a sign of a chronic illness or poor nutrition. It is important to eat well and get enough sleep. If the headaches do not go away, seek medical help. A migraine is a headache that can cause severe pain or a thumping sensation, usually on one side of the head. Migraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors. Preventive and pain -relieving medication can help manage migra ine. 10 There's no cure for migraines yet. But medications can help prevent or stop them or keep your symptoms from getting worse. You can also avoid things that trigger your migraines. Some symptoms of Migraines Sensitivity to light, noise, and odours. Nausea and vomiting, upset stomach and abdominal pain. Loss of appetite. Feeling very warm (sweating) or cold (chills). Pale skin colour (pallor). Feeling tired. Dizziness and blurred vision. Tender scalp. Fig: 1 Causes of Migraines Exact cause of migraine is still not known. Though various trigger factors are associated with Physiological factors, such as: Stress Hunger Fatigue Dietary triggers include: Eating less food (dieting) Delayed or irregular meals Dehydration Alcohol Food containing high content of tyramine (for instance: dairy, meat, poultry, and fish products) 11 Caffeine products, such as tea and coffee Specific foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit, or cheese Environmental factors include: Bright light Smoke Crowded atmosphere Loud noise Changes in climate, such as changes in humidity or very cold temperature Flickering screen on television or computer screen Management of Migraines There is currently no cure for migraines. One should do the following: Avoid triggers such as dietary as well as environmental triggers Lie down in a dark, quite place. Do your best to relax. Try not to think about your problems. Exercise regularly as it helps in managing stress and thus can help prevent migraines Tension headache Headaches caused by tension is described as a pressure, tightness, or aching pain felt on both the sides of the head which my last for hours or days. This occurs when the person is depressed, nervous, anxious or cannot sleep. Treatment consists of massage and relaxation. Eyestrain Headache This is due to prolonged use of eyes. It may keep coming back. The pain is felt around the eyes, forehead, temples - sometimes at the back of the head . Treatment consists of rest. If the headache persists, seek medical he lp. Headache caused by sinusitis This usually occurs upon waking up and during midmorning. This is made worse by bending the head. 12 1.3. Cough Coughing is not a sickness in itself but is a sign of many different sicknesses that affect the throat, lungs, or bronchi (the network of air tubes going into the lungs). Cough is produced when the air tubes and lungs are inflamed or infected (as in bronc hitis and pneumonia). Inhaling dust, cigarette, chemicals, very hot or cold air can also make a person cough. Coughing is a way of body to defend itself. It clears the breathing system and gets rid of phlegm (thick, stingy mucous) and germs in the throat o r lungs. So when a cough produces phlegm, do not take medicine to stop the cough; rather, do something to loosen and bring out the phlegm. Try to find out what sickness is causing the cough and treat it. The following question in the history will help you: Is the cough acute or long standing? Is fever also present? Is there sputum/ what is the color and smell? Is there blood in sputum? Does the person smoke? The occupation of the person will also give an idea about cause of cough. Ask if the person had same illness before. Treatment for cough 1. To loosen mucus and ease any kind of cough, drink lots of water. This works better than any medicine. Also breathe hot water vapors. Sit on a chair with a bucket of very hot water at your feet. Place a sheet over the b ucket to catch the vapors as they rise. Breathe the vapours deeply for 15 minutes. Repeat several times a day. Some people like to add mint or eucalyptus leaves or Vaporub, but hot water works just as well alone. CAUTION: Do not use eucalyptus or Vaporub i f the person has asthma. They make it worse . 2. For all kinds of cough, especially a dry cough, the following cough syrup can be given: Peel, then finely grate ginger into a small bowl. Squeeze grated ginger through a fine mesh sieve (or just use your fingers) to release about 1 teaspoon of juice. Discard pulp. 13 Mix the teaspoon of fresh ginger juice thoroughly into the tablespoon of honey. Take the syrup right away, swallowing slowly and deliberately. Take 2 -3 times a day, as needed to soothe sore thro at and dry coughing. WARNING: Do not give honey to babies under 1 year. 3. For a severe dry cough that does not let you sleep : See a doctor immediately 4. For a cough with wheezing (difficult, noisy breathing) : See a doctor immediately 5. Try to find out what sickness is causing the cough and treat that. If the cough lasts a long time, if there is blood, pus, or smelly phlegm in it, or if the person is losing weight or has continual difficulty breathing : See a doctor immediately 1.4. Cold and the Flu Colds and the flu are common virus infections that may cause runny nose, cough, sore throat, and sometimes fever or pain in the joints. There may be mild diarrhoea, especially in young children . Colds and the flu almost always go away without medicine. Drink plenty of water and get enough rest. Inhale steam, this helps to clear a stuffy nose No special diet is needed. However, fruit juices, especially orange juice, or lemonade, are helpful. For treating coughs and stuffy noses that come with colds, see the following pages If a cold or the flu lasts more than a week, or if the person has fever, coughs up a lot of phlegm (mucus with pus), has shallow fast breathing or chest pain, he could be developing bronchitis or pneumonia. The danger of a cold turning into pneumonia is greater in old people, in those who have lung problems like chronic bronchitis . Sore throat is often part of a cold. No special medicine is needed, but it may help to gargle with warm water. However, if the sore throat begins suddenly, wi th high fever, it could be a strep throat. Special treatment is needed so see a doctor in that case. 14 Prevention of colds: Getting enough sleep and eating well helps prevent colds. Eating oranges, tomatoes, and other fruit containing vitamin C may also help. Contrary to popular belief, colds do not come from getting cold or wet (although getting very cold, wet, or tired can make a cold worse). A cold is 'caught' from others who have the infection and sneeze the virus into the air. To keep from giving this cold to others, the sick person should eat and sleep separately \u2014and take special care to keep far away from small babies. He should cover his nose and mouth when he coughs or sneezes. Fig:2 To prevent a cold from leading to earache, tr y not to blow your nose \u2014just wipe i t. 1.5. Stuffy and Runny Nose A stuffy or runny nose can result from a cold or allergy . A lot of mucus in the nose may cause ear infections in children or sinus problems in adults. To help clear a stuffy nose, do the following: 1. Older children and adults can put a little salt water into their hand and sniff it into the nose. This helps to loosen the mucus. Plain water can also be used. Fig:3 2. Breathing hot water vapor helps clear a stuffy nose. 3. Wipe a runny or stuffy nose but try not to blow it. Blowing the nose may lead to earache and sinus infections. Prevent ear and sinus infections \u2014try not to blow your nose, just wipe it. 15 1.6. Allergic Reactions An allergy is a disturbance or reaction that affects only certain persons when things they are sensitive or allergic to things which ... are breathed in are eaten are injected Touch the skin Allergic reactions, which can be mild or very serious, include: Itching rashes, lumpy patches, or hives Runny nose and itching or burning eyes Irritation in the throat, difficulty breathing, or asthma Allergic shock Diarrhoea (in children allergic to milk \u2014a rare cause of diarrhoea ) An allergy is not an infection and cannot be passed from one person to another. However, children of allergic parents also tend to have allergies. Often allergic persons suffer more in certain seasons or whenever they come in touch with the substances that bother them. Common causes of al lergic reactions are: pollen of certain flowers and grass dust chicken feathers kapok or feather pillows moldy blankets or clothes certain medicines hair from cats and other animals specific food, especially fish, shellfish, peanut , etc 16 Fig: 4 1.7. Abdominal Pain A person complaining of abdominal pain should be properly examined because this may be emergency (like in acute abdomen) or a mild abdominal pain. There are many causes of abdominal pain. This can be caused by problems affecting the intestines or can come from other causes like the kidneys, liver, the gallbladder , or the fallopian tubes in women . A good history had physical examination will help you find out the cause of abdominal pain Treatment of abdominal pain Before giving any medicine for abdomin al pain, you must be sure that it is not an acute abdomen. Giving medicine to a person with acute abdomen is dangerous. If the person has acute abdomen, seek medical help fast. If the person does not have an acute abdomen: Ask the person to lie down in a comfortable position 1.8. Vomiting Many people, especially children, have an occasional 'stomach upset' with vomiting. Often no cause can be found. There may be mild stomach or gut ache or fever. This kind of simple vomiting usually is not serious and clears u p by itself. 17 Fig:5 Vomiting is one of the signs of many different problems, some minor and some quite serious, so it is important to examine the person carefully. Vomiting often comes from a problem in the stomach or guts, such as: an infection, diarrh oea, poisoning from spoiled food, or 'acute abdomen' (for example, appendicitis or something blocking the gut ). Also, almost any sickness with high fever or severe pain may cause vomiting, especially malaria, hepatitis, tonsillitis, earache, meningitis, urinary infection, gall bladder pain or migraine headache . Danger signs with vomiting \u2014seek medical help quickly! Dehydration that increases and that you cannot control Severe vomiting that lasts more than 24 hours Violent vomiting, especially if vomit is dark green, brown, or smells like shit Constant pain in the gut, especially if the person cannot defecate or if you cannot hear gurgles when you put your ear to the belly Vomiting of blood To help control simple vomiting: Eat nothing for 2 -4 hours while vomiting is severe Sip some tea with sugar but no milk, adding lime or ginger may also help Sip a cola drink or ginger ale. Some herbal teas, like camomile, may also help For dehydration give small frequent sips of ORS, tea, or Rehydration Drink If vomiting does not s top soon, see a doctor immediately 1.9. Dehydration Most children who die from diarrhoea die because they do not have enough water left in their bodies. This lack of water is called dehydration. When the body loses more liquid than what it takes in, dehydration results. This can happen with severe diarrhoea especially when there is also vomiting , fever, or in serious illness where the person is too sick to take enough food or liquid. People of any age can become dehydrated, but dehydration develops mo re quickly and is most dangerous in small children. 18 You should recognize the signs of dehydration and how to treat early so that severe dehydration which leads to shock and death can be prevented. Signs of dehydration: Thirst is often a first, early sign of dehydration little or no urine; the urine is dark yellow lack of sweat production rapid breathing dry mouth sunken, tearless eyes The symptoms of severe dehydration include, and they need medical care severe diarrhoea blood in the stool diarrhoea for 3 or more days inability to store fluids in body To prevent or treat dehydration: When a person has watery diarrhoea, act quickly: Give lots of liquids to drink: Rehydration Drink is best. Or give a thin cereal porridge or gruel, teas, soups, or even plain water. Keep giving food. As soon as the sick child (or adult) will accept food, give frequent feedings of foods he likes and accepts. 2 WAYS TO MAKE 'HOME MIX' REHYDRATION DRINK 1. With sugar and salt (raw sugar or molasses can be used instead of sugar) In 1 litre of boiled water put \u00bc teaspoon salt and \u00bc teaspoon bicarbonate of soda. If you do not have soda, use another \u00bc teaspoon salt. Add 8 levels of sugar or honey (honey is better) CAUTION: Before adding the sugar, taste the drink and be sure it is less salty than tears. To either Drink add half a cup of fruit juice, coconut water, or mashed ripe banana, if available . It provides potassium which may help the child accept more food and drink. 2. With powdered cereal and salt (Powdered rice is best. Or use finely ground maize, wheat flour, sorghum, or cooked and mashed potato) In 1 liter of water, put half a teaspoon of salt and 8 heaping teaspoons (for 2 handful) of salt powdered cereal. 19 Boil for 5 to 7 minutes to form a liquid gruel or watery porridge. Cool the Drink quickly and start giving it to the child Caution: Taste the drink each time before you give it be sure it is not spoiled as in hot weather cereal drink may get spoiled. IMPORTANT: Adapt the Drink to your area. If liter containers or teaspoons are not in most homes, adjust quantities to local forms of measurement. Where people traditionally give cereal gruels to young children, add enough water to make it liquid, and use that. Look for an easy and simple way. Give the de hydrated person sips of this Drink every 5 minutes, day , and night, until he begins to urinate normally. A large person needs 3 or more liters a day. A small child usually needs at least 1 liter a day, or 1 glass for each watery stool. Keep giving the Drin k often in small sips, even if the person vomits. Not all of the Drink will be vomited. WARNING: If dehydration gets worse or other danger signs appear, go for medical help. It may be necessary to give liquid in a vein (intravenous solution). Prevention a nd treatment of dehydration: A person who loses fluid in large amounts should drink more water, tea, soup and eat enough soft food to prevent dehydration. Sick person who cannot take large amount of water would take sips of water very often. Dehydration r esulting from diarrhoea with or without vomiting can be prevented if the person is given plenty of liquids or dehydration drink from start of the diarrhoea. This is especially important for small children with watery tools. How much Rehydration drink to give? Below are two tables that tell you how much rehydration drink you must give within 4 -6 hours. If weight of the person is known use table 1 if age is known and not the weight use table 2. If the child is very dehydrated and cannot drink water seek imm ediate medical health. Table 1 Amount of rehydration drink to be given according to the weight of person 20 Weight in kilograms Amount of rehydration drink to be given in 4 -6 hours (in ml) up to 6 kg 200-400 ml (approx. 1 -2 glasses) 6-9 kg 200-400 ml (approx. 2 -3 glasses) 9-13kg 600-800 ml (approx. 3 -4 glasses) 13-20 Kg 800-1000ml (approx. 4 -5 glasses) 20-40 Kg 1000 -2000 ml (1 -2 litres) More than 40 kg 2000 -4000ml (2 -4Litres) Table 2 Amount of rehydration drink to be given according to the age of person Age of person Amount of rehydration drink to be given in 4 -6 hours (in ml) 0-7 months 200-400 ml (approx. 1 -2 glasses) 7-12 months 200-400 ml (approx. 2 -3 glasses) 1-3years old 600-800 ml (approx. 3 -4 glasses) 3-8 years old 800-1000ml (appro x. 4-5 glasses) 8-15 years old 1000 -2000 ml (1 -2 litres) 16 y ears and above 2000 -4000ml (2 -4Litres) Diarrhoea and dysentery When a person has loose or watery stools, he has diarrhea. If mucus and blood can be seen in the stools, he has dysentery. Diarrhea can be mild or serious. It can be acute (sudden and severe) or chronic (lasting many days). Diarrhoea is spread through contaminated water or food. Diarrhoea caused by 21 contaminated food or water while travelling is often known as traveller's diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is more common and more dangerous in young children, especially those who are poorly nourished. Diarrhoea has many causes. Sometimes special treatment is needed. However, most diarrhoea can be treated successfully in the home, even if you are not sure of the exact cause or causes. THE MAIN CAUSES OF DIARRHEA Poor Nutrition This weakens the child and makes diarrhoea from other causes more frequent and worse. worm infections (most worm infections do not cause diarrhoea ) virus infection or 'intestinal flu' an infection of the gut caused by bacteria (amebas or giardia) infections outside the gut (ear infections, tonsillitis , measles,; urinary infections ) food poisoning (spoiled food) malaria (falciparum type \u2014in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific) eating too much unripe fruit or heavy, greasy foods side effects produced by certain medicines, such as ampicillin or tetracycline inability to digest milk (mainly in severely malnourished children and certain adults) Preventing diarrhoea : Although diarrhoea has many different causes, the most common are infection and poor nutrition. With good hygiene and good food, most diarrhoea could be prevented. And if treated correctly by giving lots of drink and food, fewer children who get diarrhoea would die. 22 Fig:6 Children who are poorly nourished get diarrhoea and die from it far more often than those who are well nourished. Yet diarrhoea itself can be part of the cause of malnutrition. And if malnutrition already exists, diarrhoea rapidly makes it worse . To learn about the kinds of foods that help the body resist or fight off different illnesses, including diarrhea. The prevention of diarrhea depends both on good nutrition and cleanliness. These include the use of latrines, the importance of clean water, and the protection of foods from dirt and flies. Treatment of diarrhea : For most cases of diarrhea no medicine is needed. If the diarrhea is severe, the biggest danger is dehydration. If the diarrhea lasts a long time, the biggest danger is malnutrition. So the most important part of treatment has to do with giving enough liquids and enough food. No matter what the cause of diarrhea, always take care with the following: 1. PREVENT OR CONTROL DEHYDRATION. A person with diarrhea must drink a lot of liquids. If diarrhea is severe or there are signs of dehydration, give him Rehydration Drink. Even if he does not want to drink, gently insist that he do so. Have him take several s wallows every few minutes. 2. MEET NUTRITIONAL NEEDS. A person with diarrhea needs food as soon as he will eat. This is especially important in small children or persons who are already poorly nourished. Also, when a person has diarrhoea , food passes thr ough the gut very quickly and is not all used. So, give the person food many times a day \u2014 especially if he only takes a little at a time An underweight child should get plenty of energy foods and some body -building foods (proteins) all the time he has diar rhea \u2014and extra when he gets well. If he stops eating because he feels too sick or is Prevent diarr hoea by preventing malnutrition. Prevent malnutrition by preventing diarrh oea 23 vomiting, he should eat again as soon as he can. giving Rehydration Drink will help the child be able to eat. Although giving food may cause more frequent stools at first, it can save his life. If a child who is underweight has diarrh oea that lasts for many days or keeps coming back, give him more food more often \u2014at least 5 or 6 meals each day. Often no other treatment is needed. If possible, give zinc supplements to a baby or child with diarrhea . FOODS FOR A PERSON WITH DIARRHEA When the person is vomiting or feels too sick to eat, he should drink: As soon as the person is able to eat, in addition to giving the drinks listed at the left, he should eat a balanced selection of the following foods or similar ones: energy foods body -building foods ripe or cooked bananas chicken (boiled or roasted) crackers eggs (boiled) rice, oatmeal, or other meat (well cooked, without well-cooked grain much fat or grease) fresh maize (well cooked beans, lentils, or peas and mashed) (well cooked and mashed) potatoes fish (well cooked) applesauce (cooked) milk (sometimes this papaya causes problems, (It helps to add a little sugar or see the next page) vegetable oil to the cereal f oods.) watery mush or broth of rice, maize powder, or potato rice water (with some mashed rice) chicken, meat, egg, or bean broth REHYDRATION DRINK Breast milk yogurt or fermented milk drinks fatty or greasy foods most raw fruits DO NOT EAT OR DRINK any kind of laxative or purge highly seasoned food alcoholic drinks Diarrhoea and milk: 24 Cow's milk, powdered milk, or canned milk can be good sources of energy and protein. Keep on giving them to a child with diarrhoea . In a very few children these milks may cause more diarrhoea . If this happens, try giving less milk and mixing it with other foods. But remember: a poorly nourished child with diarrhoea must have enough energy foods and protein. If less milk is given, wel l cooked and mashed foods such as chicken, egg yolk, meat, fish, or beans should be added. Beans are easier to digest if their skins have been taken off and they are boiled and mashed. As the child gets better, he will usually be able to drink more milk without getting diarrhea. Medicines for diarrhoea: For most cases of diarrhoea, no medicines are needed. But in certain cases, using the right medicine can be important. However, many of the medicines commonly used for diarrhoea do little or no good. Some are actually harmful:25 Special treatment in different cases of diarrhoea While most cases of diarrhea are best treated by givi ng plenty of liquids and food, and no medicine, sometimes special treatment is needed Sudden, mild diarrhea. No fever Drink lots of liquids. Usually, no special treatment is needed. Diarrh oea with vomiting If a person with diarrh oea is also vomiting, the danger of dehydration is greater, especially in small children. It is very important to give the Rehydration Drink, tea, soup, or whatever liquids he will take. Keep giving the Drink, even if the person vomits it out again. Some will stay inside. Give sips every 5 to 10 minutes. Note: If you cannot control the vomiting or if the dehydration gets worse, seek medical help fast. Diarrh oea with mucus and blood. Chronic diarrhoea (diarrhoea that lasts a long time or keeps coming back). When to Seek Medical Help in Cases of Diarrhoea Diarrh oea and dysentery can be very dangerous \u2014especially in small children. In the following situations you should get medical help: if diarrh oea lasts more than 4 days and is not getting better \u2014or more than 1 day in a small child with severe diarrh oea if the person shows signs of dehydration and is getting worse if the child vomits everything he drinks, or drinks nothing, or if frequent vomiting continues for more than 3 hours after beginning Rehydration Drink if the child begins to have seizures, or if the feet and face swell 26 THE CARE OF A PERSON WITH ACUTE DIARRH OEA Fig: 7 Exercise 1: Ram, went to his village to meet his grandmother by train , on his way to the village, he felt nauseous, but he ate something and felt little better. When he reached his grandmother's home, his head and stomach began to ache, and he started vomiting. His grandmother got worried, but she knew that he must have eate n something unwanted in train that is why it was happening, she also knew she can cure her grandson, with some home remedies, and with the things she can find in her kitchen.

Book Activity: Name the places from where medicine can be purchased 29 Objectives After attending this session, you should be able to: Explain the home remedies Learn steps to create the remedies at home Ideal situation in an illness is to immediately consult with a doctor and get treatment advice. But in situations, where no doctor is around, the priority is to manage the illness till a doctor could be reached. Although modern medicines are effective to c ure but they can't be consumed without doctor's advice. India has long history of Ayurveda and naturopathy. There have been \"Dadi Maa ke Nuskhe\" practised at every home in India and are the best to use in such situations. But these home remedies must be us ed with caution likewise any modern medicine. Let us learn about some of the common home remedies used to cure certain common diseases. 2.1. Home remedies for common sickness Cold and cough If a child has cold and cough: Crush 10 -15 leaves of tulsi, give one teaspoon of this juice mixed with honey or jaggery three times a day to babies for 5 days Heat four teaspoons of coconut oil. Crush one teaspoon of camphor. Dissolve this in the oil. Keep it stored in airtight bottles. This can be rubbed on the chest or throat of the child to relieve congestion (this can also be used for any muscular pain) Fig: 1 30 If an adult has cough and cold: Boil a handful of fresh eucalyptus leaves in two glasses of water, till only 1 glass is left.
