Often, orthodox medical intervention is not even directed toward the cure of the patient but only toward the life-long drug management of a condition (for example, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis). The argument that we have more illness because we are living longer does not hold up; longevity does not necessarily result in disease\u2014many people live very long lives in perfect health. We have more and better food, clean running water, and an understanding of hygiene unknown to our forebears, which should greatly increase our chances of achieving a long and healthy life. But unfortunately many spend years of their lives feeling not quite well, with no clear cause for their distress. In 1900, there were three main causes of death: pneumonia or severe influenza, tuberculosis, and enteritis. All that has now changed. Since 1940, heart disease, stroke, and cancer have taken the place of these fatal diseases. Chronic ill-health and debilitating conditions are a huge cost to the happiness of human life. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion describes chronic disease (heart problems, cancer, diabetes) as the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, accounting for 70 percent of all deaths. One in 10, or 25 million people, in the United States have chronic disease.\u00b9 There is general agreement that these diseases are preventable and that their incidence can be lowered dramatically by means of changes in diet and behavior, but this is seldom reflected in the way patients are treated for these conditions once they have manifested. Pharmaceutical drugs are routinely prescribed to patients with the recommendation that they must stay on them for the rest of their lives, and yet underlying conditions and causes, whether physical or mental and emotional, are not addressed. Our conditioning leads us to see disease as something to be fought; the fight for health is a war in which the enemy (disease) must be eradicated, excised, or beaten. The means to this end often involve the pharmacological blocking of natural responses, surgical excision, and genetic modification. Most modern medical interventions fall into these categories. The medical paradigm is to go against, for which we use the term allopathy. Such an approach seldom leads to cure, and a growing number of people today do not wish to take pharmaceutical drugs, which burden the body with synthesized chemicals and suppress natural responses. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug development, it is now widely recognized and reported that pharmacological use is itself a source of disease, with many thousands of people affected by iatrogenic illness every year. Though modern Western pharmaceutical drugs tend to cause energy deficits, Ayurveda (the ancient medical system of India), Traditional Chinese Medicine, and most current alternative medicine systems (homeopathy, acupuncture, reflexology, crystal therapy, to name but a few) work to promote energy, recognizing that the balanced flow of energy through the systems of the body is one of the keynotes of health. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that perhaps as much as 80 percent of the global population relies on long-established traditional medicine, most of which is herbal medicine. During the last twenty years of the last century, phytochemicals have been identified and analyzed as a new prospect for health maintenance. Bioactive substances in herbs and food plants have been found to play a significant role in protecting us from heart disease and strokes. Mainly, there has been a focus on food plants, but the range of investigation extends to a huge array of herbs around the world that have been regarded over centuries of tradition as healing agents. These plants contain biochemicals of highly specialized forms. Moreover, the complexity of phytochemicals in any one plant may have more significance than we thought previously. Some phytochemicals exist in plants in infinitesimal doses, but their synergy with each other in the same plant may be the important clue to long-term benefit. We stand at the threshold of a new era of medicine and at a point where it may be useful to engage with what has been known in the past about the importance of phytomedicines in all their various forms. Energy comes from our food, of course, and from sunlight, good-quality sleep, and exercise, but also from phytotherapeutics. Plants contain nutrients and highly specialized volatile oils and resins in tiny amounts whose value in contributing to human health has not yet been fully understood. Like herbalism, spagyrics is a system of medicine based upon the energetic qualities of healing plants that contain substances that can help tune the human physiology and metabolism. The word spagyric (German spagyrik) comes from two Greek verbs: spao (to separate) and agyro (to unite), in accordance with the alchemical maxim solve et coagula, et habebis magisterium\u2014 dissolve and bind, and you will have the magistery. As the two Greek verbs suggest, the process of separating and combining implies a synthesis in which the finished whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Spagyrics has a long therapeutic history that can be traced back to the work of the great Swiss-Swabian physician, magus, and alchemist Paracelsus (1493-1541). Spagyrics refers to a branch of alchemy in which a therapeutic substance is separated into its constituent virtues, which are then recombined after purification. In plant alchemy the constituent virtues are essential oils, naturally occurring alcohols, and water-soluble salts (electrolytes). Spagyric essences can be effective treatments for many ailments. They are harmonizing and balancing. Further, when prepared properly, spagyric medicines are safe to use over a long period of time, and thus can relieve many chronic complaints. They are also invaluable when a person feels unwell but tests show nothing abnormal. At this early stage, before illness has become morbid pathology, the strengthening, balancing, and harmonizing effects of spagyric essences can prove restorative. The spagyric method is the first level of practical alchemy and a way of enhancing the healing virtues of plants. Plant minerals and oils act as catalysts to stimulate the body's own natural powers of healing and homeostasis. By stimulating faster and more efficient cellular activity, energetic plant essences help to restore the organs' capacity for self-regeneration. Spagyrics is an alchemical process that enables the capture of the essential minerals and salts in plants, purifies them (by ridding them of heavy metals), and then enhances their vibrational qualities. The result is a fine medicinal tincture, pleasant and easy to take, that regulates the systems of the body and is powerfully restorative. These tinctures are prescribed according to homeopathic (meaning similar suffering) principles. The homeopathic paradigm has a long history going back to Hippocrates in ancient Greece. It has also been an operative principle of Ayurveda for centuries. Working with plants in this way will give you an understanding of practical alchemical philosophy and an insight into the profound healing capability latent in the vegetable kingdom. But how is it determined that someone is indeed in need of treatment for a condition? Lack of energy is one of the first symptoms that all is not well. The subjective feeling of dis-ease, fatigue, apathy, irritability, or despondency may precede actual pathological change by weeks, months, or even years. These feelings are often indications that the body's resistance to external influences, stress, or viruses is diminishing. Energy deficit ultimately leads to local or systemic dysfunction, such as chronic fatigue syndrome; cancer; circulatory insufficiency; or chronic debilitating conditions such as diabetes, myalgias, and rheumatism. All chronic and recurrent infections may be traced to energy deficit. Moreover, the rapid rise of diseases that are now partly or wholly resistant to antibiotics means that it is becoming urgent to seek out other forms of treatment. Those people who choose a lifestyle and medical system that build immune competence will always be the winners in the long run. They opt for treatments and lifestyles that promote energy in the body, including systems of health that recognize the need to build up energy in the body, so that the body is then able to cope with stress, fend off infection, and clear itself of toxicity. The means to this are dynamic medicines that stimulate a healing response in the body. For a number of minor ailments, there is still a place for simple medicines that can be prepared easily and economically at home from herbs and common garden plants. Many people do this as a matter of course. Finding a few sage leaves, steeping them in hot water, and drinking the resulting tea soothes a sore throat, or drinking mint tea alleviates mild indigestion. This book is for those who would like to go further and explore the wonderful range of healing that is ours for the taking as soon as we step out into the natural, wild world. PART ONE Theoria Alchemical Philosophy and Pioneers of Spagyrics 1 Alchemical Philosophy Plants as Healers Phytotherapeutics was once virtually the only form of medicine. Despite the continued and widespread use of herbs across the world and the fact that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, herbal medicines constituted a high proportion of prescribed medicines in the United States, they are now usually categorized as alternative medicines\u2014despite the fact that much modern medicine (including morphine, digitalis, quinine, and aspirin) were originally derived from plants. Many of these are now made from a synthesized form of the active ingredient, which the pharmaceutical company believes it has identified and isolated. Today, the pharmacist in a white coat dispensing drugs in blister packs is far removed from the ardent potency of plants. The medical science to which the modern world is now so subservient depends upon machines for assessing health and on technological interventions to correct ill health. The vital body is forgotten, as though the body were itself a machine, an assembly of parts. When something goes wrong, the diseased part must be located and fixed. When each part of the body is seen in isolation, the long-term impact of emotional shock on the physical body as a whole is often discounted. Although some of our most highly respected modern drugs, such as aspirin, were derived originally from plant sources, herbalism itself is often disparaged because, it is argued, the active ingredient in plants is variable and uncertain. Yet the scientific search for the active ingredient is a sterile pursuit, because it rejects the integrity of the plant and its natural synergistic qualities. The active, vital principles of plants are complex and subtle, and the life force, chi, or prana of fresh, green herbs is contained in the sum of its parts\u2014not in the isolated ingredient. In fact, the wonderful advantage of all phytotherapy is the synergistic effect of using the whole plant. For example, Taraxacum (dandelion), which is an excellent remedy for ailments of the liver, contains a high proportion of potassium, meaning that it is safe as a diuretic. The more we work with plants, the more we realize that nature brings the healing spectrum to us in neat, well-thought-out packages congruent with the needs of the human body. We now recognize that some plants contain compounds present in such minute concentrations that they are often hardly detectable by standard techniques, and yet they may be potent pharmacological agents. Plants belong to time and the cosmos in a way that is unique in the vegetable world. Nourishment for plant growth may come from earth, air, and water, but the energy for their growth comes from the sun, moon, and stars. Whereas humankind and much of the animal kingdom seeks shelter at night, plants lie directly under the night sky so that their life rhythms are also mysteriously connected to cosmic time. Daytime is solar, as is the yearly cycle, and monthly cycles are lunar. The moon controls the rising and falling of the tide, the quantity of rainfall, and the rising and falling levels of water and sap. Earth-rooted plants reach ever upward, mirroring the aspiration of ascent and the marriage of earth and sky. Waxing and waning through each month, the moon mirrors the light from the sun at various angles. At the time of the full moon, the moon is opposite the sun and is in synchronicity with it: as the sun sets, the moon rises. These continually changing angles of the sun and moon bring about electrical and magnetic changes in the upper atmosphere to which plants are subtly attuned. Flowers are recipients of light, and some plants are particularly oriented to the sun. The flowers of the genus Helianthus, such as the sunflower, follow the path of the sun: as the sun moves from east to west each day, so the flowers turn their open faces to gratefully receive the maximum benison of sunlight, which is stored in their great treasure hoard of a seed head. Light becomes matter and richly nourishing food. How good it is to walk in nature, striding in wild places where the breeze is invigorating, the water is clean and pure, and the plants are vibrant and colorful. A healthy, natural countryside is not only green, but also should be full of bright flowers: clovers\u2014purple and white; tall, yellow agrimony and mullein; charming wild orchids; and dazzling poppies. When we are close to Nature, the feeling that Nature is herself a living being full of wondrous powers is inescapable. Radiant flowers reveal to us her shining intelligence, full of the light of wisdom and healing power. In those moments, we ourselves may feel the benefit of nature's restorative energies, surprising ourselves by walking with a straighter back and a certain loose limberness that give each of our steps a kind of buoyancy and springiness that is all the more welcome for being unaccustomed. This is the healing presence that we capture in medicinal plants, many of which are the outcasts of the plant world, the misfit weeds that the fastidious gardener often ignores. Dandelion and goldenrod, plantain, teasle, and nettles\u2014all of these are full of nature's healing virtues and can offer support for the ailing, even in quite severe illness. A connection to the earth and to medicinal plants is our natural birthright. Animals have recourse to herbs, seeking out by instinct the grasses and weeds they need. This was also the human relationship to plants for long centuries of our existence. When we begin to work with plants, this connection to the original source of vitality and health is restored. You will find that plants come to you as healers and teachers. If you watch your garden through the seasons, you will find that certain plants seed themselves\u2014and very often, they may be just the thing you need to assuage a condition. I have been amazed at how often Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) invades the gardens of the chronically depressed, and how rapidly nettles proliferate in the gardens of women of a certain age, and how hawthorn creeps unbidden into the gardens of the weak of heart. Among traditional herbalists, plants are valued as allies and collaborators in the field of health; knowledge of well-being comes from the plants, which offer themselves for healing. Plants as Helpers It is true, of course, that medicinal herbs cannot be regarded as completely safe: they contain many naturally occurring chemicals, and some contain powerful alkaloids. Their uncontrolled or ill-informed use is rightly discouraged. Yet the spagyric method of preparing plants does render them more vital and relatively safe. Any therapeutic agent can be harmful, and we should take great care in handling, preparing, and taking herbs. It is particularly important to be wary of taking herbs while also taking prescribed pharmaceutical drugs. The interaction of drugs and herbs is wholly underresearched. It is also clearly unwise to discontinue your prescribed medication in order to try herbal preparations. Always take due regard for your health and consult with qualified health professionals for the diagnosis and treatment that may be necessary for you. Living among therapeutic plants involves a reassessment of value. Nettles, plantains, or chickweed are not usually tolerated in tidy suburban gardens. Yet these may be the very plants on which you will most come to rely for your health and well-being. There is an old saying: A weed is only a plant for which no use has yet been found. Make space for your herbal allies, become friends with plants that turn up uninvited, tune into their virtues, and they will tune in to your needs. We can begin a relationship with plants that will turn in to an extraordinary adventure, inviting engagement with ourselves, our bodies, and our problems at a deep level. Healing means to become whole. We are all called to joy and adventure and to fulfill with "}
