Authorized for distribution by the : RI 71 -005 2 Important Notice from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan About Our Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare OPM has determined that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan's prescription drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for all plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage. Thus you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug benefit coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later, you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However, if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and your FEHB plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remem ber: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re -enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advise d If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that's at least as good as Medicare's prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will alway s be at least 19 percent higher than what many other people pay. You'll have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15th through December 7th) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicare's Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available.

This Plan is underwritten by participating Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans (Local Plans) that administer this Plan in their individual lo calities. For customer service assistance, visit our Web site, www.fepblue.org , or contact your Local Plan at the telephone number appearing on the back of your ID card. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is the Carrier of the Plan . The address for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan administrative office is: Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 1310 G Street, NW, Suite 900 Washington, DC 20005 This brochure is the official statement of benefits. No oral statement can modify or otherwise affect the benefits, limitations, and exclusions of this brochure. It is your responsibility to be informed about your health care benefits. If you are enrolled in this Plan, you are entitled to the benefits described in this brochure. If you are enrolled in Self and Family coverage, each eligible family member is also entitled to these benefits. You do not have a right to benefits that were available before January 1, 201 4, unless those benefits are also shown in this brochure. OPM negotiates benefits and rates with each plan annually. Benefit changes are effective January 1, 201 4, and changes are summarized on page s 15-17. Rates are shown on the back cover of this brochure. Coverage under this Plan qualifies as minimum essential coverage (MEC) and satisfies the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) individual shared responsibility requirement. Please visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) W eb site at www.irs.gov/uac/Questions -and-Answers -on-the-Individual -Shared -Responsibility -Provision for more information on the individual requirement for MEC. The ACA establishes a minimum value for the standard of benefits of a health plan. The minimum value standard is 60% (actuarial value). The health coverage of this Plan meets the minimum value standard for the benefits the Plan provides. Plain Language All FEHB brochures are written in plain language to make them easy to understand. Here are some examples: Except for necessary technical terms, we use common words. For instance, \"you\" means the enrollee or family member; \"we\" means the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan. We limit acronyms to ones you know. FEHB is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. OPM is the United States Office of Personnel Management. If we use others, we tell you what they mean first. Our brochure and other FEHB plans' brochures have the same format and similar descriptions to help you compare plans. Stop Health Care Fraud! Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone and increases your Federal Employees Health Benefits Program premium. OPM's Office of the Inspector General investigates all allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in the FEHB Program regardless of the agency that employs you or from which you retired. Protect Yourself From Fraud - Here are some things you can do to prevent fraud: Do not give your plan identification (ID) number over the telephone or to people you do not know, except for your health care provider, authorized health benefits plan, or OPM representative. Let only the appropriate medical professionals review your medical record or recommend services. Avoid using health care providers who say that an item or service is not usually covered, but they know how to bill us to get it paid. Carefully review explanations o f benefits (EOBs) statements that you receive from us. Periodically review your claim history for accuracy to ensure we have not been billed for services that you did not receive. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 6 Introduction/Plain Language /Advis ory Do not ask your doctor to make false entries on certificates, bills, or records in order to get us to pay for an item or service. If you suspect that a provider has charged you for services you did not receive, billed you twice for the same service, or misrepresented any information, do the following: Call the provider and ask for an explanation. There may be an error. If the provider does not resolve the matter, call us at 1 -800-FEP-8440 (1- 800-337-8440) and explain the situation. If we do not resolve the issue: CALL THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE 1-877-499-7295 OR go to www.opm.gov/oig You can also write to: United States Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Street NW Room 6400 Washington, DC 20415- 1100 Do not maintain as a family member on your policy: Your former spouse after a divorce decree or annulment is final (even if a court order stipulates otherwise); or Your child age 26 or over (unless he/she was disabled and incapable of self -support prior to age 26). If you have any questions about the eligibility of a dependent, check with your personnel office if you are employed, with your retirement office (such as OPM) if you are retired, or with the National Finance Center if you are enrolled under Temporary Continuatio n of Coverage. Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact is prohibited under the Plan. You can be prosecuted for fraud and yo ur agency may take action against you. Examples of fraud include, falsifying a claim to obtain FEHB benefits, tryi ng to or obtaining service or coverage for yourself or for someone who is not eligible for coverage, or enrolling in the Plan when you are no lo nger eligible. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage (i.e., you have separ ated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. You may be billed by your provider for services received. You may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member is no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. Preventing Medical Mistakes An influential report from the Institute of Medicine estimates that up to 98,000 Americans die every year from medical mistakes in hospitals alone. That's about 3,230 preventable deaths in the FEHB Program a year. While death is the most tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer recoveries, and even additional treatments. By asking questions, learning more and understanding your risks, you can improve the safety of your own health c are, and that of your fa mily members. Take these simple steps: 1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. Take a relative or friend with you to help you ask questions and understand answers. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 7 Introduction/Plain Language /Advis ory 2. Keep and bring a list of all the medicines you take. Bring the actual medicines or give your doctor and pharmacist a list of all the medicines and dosage that you take, including non-prescription (over -the-counter) med icines and nutritional supplements. Tell your doctor and pharmacist about any drug , food, and other allergies you have , such as to latex . Ask about any risks or side effects of the medication and what to avoid while taking it. Be sure to write down what your doctor or pharmacist says. Make sure your medicine is what the doctor ordered. Ask the pharmacist about your medicine if it looks different than you expected. Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medicine, including all warnings and instructions. Know how to use your medicine. Especially note the times and conditions when your medicine should and should not be taken. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. 3. Get the results of any test or procedure. Ask when and how you will get the results of tests or procedures. Do not assume the results are fine if you do not get them when expected, be it in person, by phone, or by mail. Call your doctor and ask for your results. Ask what the results mean for your care. 4. Talk to your doctor about which hospital is best for your health needs. Ask your doctor about which hospital has the best care and results for your condition if you have more than one hospital to choose from to get the health care you need. Be sure you understand the instructions you get about follow -up care when you leave the hospital. 5. Make sure you understand what will happen if you need surgery. Make sure you, your doctor, and your surgeon all agree on exactly what will be done during th e operation. Ask your doctor, \"Who will manage my care when I am in the hospital?\" Ask your surgeon: \"Exactly what will you be doing?\" \"About how long will it take?\" \"What will happen after surgery?\" \"How can I expect to feel during recovery?\" Tell the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and nurses about any allergies, bad reactions to anesthesia, and any medications or nutritional supplements you are taking.

This policy helps to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive. When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you don't expect to leave with additional injuries, infections , or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay. Although some of these complications may not be avoidabl e, too often patients suffer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if the hospital had taken proper precautions. We have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital -acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores , and fractures; and reduce medical errors that should never happen called \"Never Events\". When a Never Event occurs, neither your FEHB plan nor you will incur cost to correct the medical error. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benef it Plan 9 FEHB Facts FEHB Facts Coverage information No pre- existing condition limitation We will not refuse to cover the treatment of a condition you had before you enrolled in this Plan solely because you had the condition before you enrolled. Minimum essential coverage (MEC) Coverage under this Plan qualifies as minimum essential coverage (MEC) and satisfies the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) individual shared responsibility requirement. Please visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) W eb site at www.irs.gov/uac/Questions -and-Answers -on- the-Individual -Shared -Responsibility -Provision for more information on the individual requirement for MEC. Minimum value standard The ACA e stablishes a minimum value for the standard of benefits of a health plan. The minimum value standard is 60% (actuarial value). The health coverage of this P lan meets the minimum value standar d for the benefits the Plan provides. Where you can get inform ation about enrolling in the FEHB Program See www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance/healthcare for enrollment information as well as: Information on the FEHB Program and plans available to you A health plan comparison tool A list of agencies who participate in Employee Express A link to Employee Express Information on and links to other electronic enrollment systems Also, your employing or retirement office can answer your questions, and give you a Guide to Federal Benefits , brochures for other plans, and other materials you need to make an informed decision about your FEHB coverage. These materials tell you: When you may ch ange your enrollment How you can cover your family members What happens when you transfer to another Federal agency, go on leave without pay, enter military service, or retire What happens when your enrollment ends When the next Open Season for enrollment begins We do not determine who is eligible for coverage and, in most cases, cannot change your enrollment status without information from your employing or retirement office. For information on your premium deductions, you must also contact y our employing or retirement office. Types of coverage available for you and your family Self Only coverage is for you alone. Self and Family coverage is for you, your spouse, and your dependent children under age 26, including any foster children authorized for coverage by your employing agency or retirement office. Under certain circumstances, you may also continue coverage for a disabled child 26 years of age or older who is incapable of self -support. If you have a Self Only enrollment, you may change to a Self and Family enrollment if you marry, give birth, or add a child to your family. You may change your enrollment 31 days before to 60 days after that event. The Self and Family enrollment begins o n the first day of the pay period in which the child is born or becomes an eligible family member. When you change to Self and Family because you marry, the change is effective on the first day of the pay period that begins after your employing office receives your enrollment form; benefits will not be available to your spouse until you marry. Your employing or retirement office will not notify you when a family member is no longer eligible to receive health benefits, nor will we. Please tell us immedia tely of changes in family member status, including your marriage, divorce, annulment, or when your child reaches age 26. If you or one of your family members is enrolled in one FEHB plan, that person may not be enrolled in or covered as a family member b y another FEHB plan. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benef it Plan 10 FEHB Facts If you have a qualifying life event (QLE ) - such as marriage, divorce, or the birth of a child - outside of the Federal Benefits Open Season, you may be eligible to enroll in the FEHB Program, change your enrollment, or cancel coverage. For a complete list of QLEs, visit the FEHB Web site at www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance/life -events . If you need assistance, please contact your employing agency, Tribal Benefits Officer, personnel/payroll office, or retirement office. Family member coverage Family members covered under your Self an d Family enrollment are your spouse (including your spouse by valid common -law marriage if you reside in a state that recognizes common -law marriages) and children as described in the chart below. Children Coverage Natural, adopted children, and stepchildren Natural, adopted children and stepchildren are covered until their 26th birthday. Foster Children Foster children are eligible for coverage until their 26th birthday if you provide documentation of your regular and substantial support of the child and sign a certification stating that your foster child meets all the requirements.

Children with or eligible for employer -provided health insurance Children who are eligible for or have their own employer -provided health insurance are covered until their 26th birthday. You can find additional information at www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance . Children's Equity Act OPM has implemented the Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000. This law mandates that you be enrolled for Self and Family coverage in the FEHB Program, if you are an employee subject to a court or administrative order requiring you to provide health benefits for your child(ren). If this law applies to you, you must enroll for Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing office that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for y our children. If you do not do so, your employing office will enroll you involuntarily as follows: If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing office will enroll you for Self and Family coverage in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan's Basic Option; If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee -for-service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing office will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the same option of the same plan; or If you a re enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing office will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan's Basic Option. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benef it Plan 11 FEHB Facts As long as the court/administrative or der is in effect, and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, you cannot cancel your enrollment, change to Self Only, or change to a plan that doesn't serve the area in which your children live, unl ess you provide documentation that you have other coverage for the children. If the court/administrative order is still in effect when you retire, and you have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, you must continue your FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel your coverage, change to Self Only, or change to a plan that doesn't serve the area in which your children live as long as the court/administrative order is in effect. Contact your employing office for further in formation. When benefits and premiums start The benefits in this brochure are effective on January 1. If you joined this Plan during Open Season, your coverage begins on the first day of your first pay period that starts on or after January 1. If you changed plans or plan options during Open Season and you receive care between January 1 and the effective date of coverage under your new plan or option, your claims will be paid according to the 2014 benefits of your old plan or option. However, i f your old plan left the FEHB Program at the end of the year, you are covered under that plan's 201 3 benefits until the effective date of your coverage with your new plan. Annuitants' coverage and premiums begin on January 1. If you joined at any other t ime during the year, your employing office will tell you the effective date of coverage. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage (i.e., you have separated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be res ponsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. You may be billed for services received directly from your provider. You may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not pa id premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member are no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. When you retire When you retire, you can usually stay in the FEHB Program. Generally, you must have been enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years of your Federal service. If you do not meet this requirement, you may be eligible for other forms of coverage, such as Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) . When you lose benefits When FEHB coverage ends You will receive an additional 31 days of coverage, for no additional premium, when: Your enrollment ends, unless you cancel your enrollment; or You are a family member no longer eligible for coverage. Any person covered under the 31- day extension of coverage who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the Plan during the continuance of the confinement but not beyond the 60th day after the end of the 31- day temporary extension. You may be eligible for spouse equity coverage, or Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC), or a conversion policy (a non- FEHB individual policy). Upon divorce If you are divorced from a Federal employee or annuitant you may not continue to get benefits under your former spouse's enrollment . This is the case even when the court has ordered your former spouse to provide health benefits coverage for you. However, you may be eligible for your own FEHB coverage under either the spouse equity law or Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). If yo u are recently divorced or are anticipating a divorce, contact your ex -spouse's employing or retirement office to get RI 70 -5, the Guide to Federal Benefits for Temporary Continuation of Coverage and Former Spouse Enrollees , or other informati on about your coverage choices. You can also download the guide from OPM's Web site, www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance/healthcare/plan -information/guides . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benef it Plan 12 FEHB Facts Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) If you leave Federal service, Tribal employment, or if you lose coverage because you no longer qualify as a family member, you may be eligible for Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) . For example, you can receive TCC if you are not able to continue your FEHB enrollment after you retire, if you lose your Federal job, if you are a covered dependent child and you turn age 26, regardless of marital status, etc. You may not elect TCC if you are fired from your Federal or Tribal job due to gross misconduct. Enrolling in TCC. Get the RI 79 -27, which describes TCC, and the RI 70 -5, the Guide to Federal Benefits for Temporary Continuation of Coverage and Former Spouse Enrollee s, from your employing or retirement office or from www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance/healthcare/plan - information/guides . It explains what you have to do to enroll. We also want to inform you that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not eliminate TCC or change the TCC rules . Converting to individual coverage You may convert to a non- FEHB individual policy if: Your coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law ends (if you canceled your coverage or did not pay your premium, you cannot convert); You decided not to receive coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law; or You are not eligible for coverage under TCC or the spouse equity law. If you leave Federal or Tribal service, your employing office will notify you of your right to convert. You must apply in writing to us within 31 days after you receive this notice. However, if you are a family member who is losing coverage, the employing or retirement office will not notify you. You must apply in writing to us within 31 days after you are no longer eligible for coverage. Your benefits and rates will differ from those under the FEHB Program; however, you will not have to answer questio ns about your health, and we will not impose a waiting period or limit your coverage due to pre -existing conditions.

This is a Web site provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that provides up -to-date information on the Marketplace. Getting a Certificate of Group Health Plan Coverage The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a Federal law that offers limited Federal protections for health coverage availability and continuity to people who lose employer group coverage. If you leave the FEH B Program, we will give you a Certificate of Group Health Plan Coverage that indicates how long you have been enrolled with us. You can use this certificate when getting health insurance or other health care coverage. Your new plan must reduce or eliminate waiting periods, limitations, or exclusions for health -related conditions based on the information in the certificate, as long as you enroll within 63 days of losing cover age under this Plan. If you have been enrolled with us for less than 12 months, but were previously enrolled in other FEHB plans, you may also request a certificate from those plans. For more information, get OPM pamphlet RI 79- 27, Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) under the FEHB Program . See also the FEHB Web site at www.opm.gov/healthcare - insurance/healthcare and refer to the \"TCC and HIPAA\" frequently asked questi ons. These highlight HIPAA rules, such as the requirement that Federal employees must exhaust any TCC eligibility as one condition for guaranteed access to individual health coverage under HIPAA, and have information about Federal and State agencies you can contact for more information. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 13 Section 1 Section 1. How this Plan works This Plan is a fee -for-service (FFS) plan. You can choose your own physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers. We reimburse you or your provider for your covered services, usually based on a percentage of the amount we allow. The type and extent of covered services, and the amount we allow, may be different from other plans. Rea d brochures carefully. General features of our Standard and Basic Options We have a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Our fee -for-service plan offers services through a PPO . This means that certain hospitals and other health care providers are \"Preferred providers.\" When you use our PPO (Preferred) providers, you will receive covered services at a reduced cost. You r Local Plan (or, for retail pharmacies, CVS Caremark) is solely responsible for the selection of PPO providers in your area. Contact your Local Plan for the names of PPO (Preferred) providers and to verify their continued participation. You can also go to o ur Web page, www.fepblue.org , and select \"Provider Directory\" to use our National Doctor & Hospital FinderSM. You can reach our Web page through the FEHB Web site, www.opm.gov/healthcare -insurance . Under Standard Option, PPO (Preferred) benefits apply only when you use a PPO (Preferred) provider. PPO networks may be more extensive in some areas than in others. We cannot guarantee the availability of every specialty in all areas. If no PP O (Preferr ed) provider is available, or you do not use a PPO (Preferred) provider, non -PPO (Non -preferred) benefits apply. Under Basic Option, you must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Note: Dentists and oral surgeons who are in our Preferred Dental Network for routine dental care are not necessarily Preferred providers for other services covered by this Plan under other benefit provisions (such as the surgical benefit for oral and maxillofacial surgery). Call us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card to verify that your provider is P referred for the type of care (e.g., routine dental care or oral surgery) you are scheduled to receive. How we pay profe ssional and facility providers We pay benefits when we receive a claim for covered services. Each Local Plan contracts with hospitals and other health care facilities, physicians, and other health care professionals in its service area, and is responsibl e for processing and paying claims for services you receive within that area. Many, but not all, of these contracted providers are in our PPO (Preferred) network. PPO providers. PPO (Preferred) providers have agreed to accept a specific negotiated amoun t as payment in full for covered services provided to you. We refer to PPO facility and professional providers as \"Preferred.\" They will generally bill the Local Plan directly, who will then pay them directly. You do not file a claim. Your out -of-pocke t costs are generally less when you receive covered services from Preferred providers, and are limited to your coinsurance or copayments (and, under Standard Option only, the applicable deductible). Participating providers. Some Local Plans also contract with other providers that are not in our Preferred network. If they are professionals, we refer to them as \"Participating \" providers. If they are facilities, we refer to them as \"Member\" facilities. They have agreed to accept a different negotiated amount than our Preferred providers as payment in full. They will also generally file your claims for you. They have agreed not to bill you for more than your applicable deductible, and coinsurance or copayments, for covered services. We pay them directly, but at our Non -preferred benefit levels. Your out -of-pocket costs will be greater than if you use Preferred providers. Note: Not all areas have Participating providers and/or Member facilities. To verify the status of a provider, please contact the Local Plan where the services will be performed. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 14 Section 1 Non-participating providers. Providers who are not Preferred or Participating providers do not have contracts with us, and may or may not accept our allowance. We refer to them as \"Non -participating providers\" generally, although if they are facilities we refer to them as \"Non -member facilities.\" When you use Non -participating providers, you may have to file your claims with us. We will then pay our benefits to you, and you must pay the provider. You must pay any difference betwee n the amount Non -participating providers charge and our allowance (except in certain circumstances - see page s 145-147). In addition, you must pay any applicable coinsurance amounts, copayment amounts, amounts applied to your calendar year deductible, and amounts for noncovered services. Important: Under Standard Option, your out -of-pocket costs may be substantially higher when you use Non- participating providers than when you use Preferred or Participating providers. Under Basic Option, you must use Pre ferred providers to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Note: In Local Plan areas, Preferred providers and Participating providers who contract with us will accept 100% of the Plan allowance as payment in full for covere d services. As a result, you are only responsible for applicable coinsurance or copayments (and, under Standard Option only, the applicable deductible), for covered services, and any charges for noncovered services.

Cancer Research Facility - A facility that is: (1) A National Cooperative Cancer Study Group institution that is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and has been approved by a Cooperative Group as a blood or marrow stem cell transplant center; (2) An NCI -designated Cancer Center; or (3) An institution that has a peer -reviewed grant funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study allogeneic or autologous blood or marrow stem cell transplants. FACT -Accredited Facility A facility with a transpla nt program accredited by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT ). FACT -accredited cellular therapy programs meet rigorous standards. Information regarding FACT transplant programs can be obtained by contacting the transplant coordinator at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card or by visiting www.factwebsite.org . Other facilities specifically listed in the benefits descriptions in Section 5(c). What you must do to get covered care Under Standard Option, you can go to any covered provider you want, but in some circumstances, we must approve your care in advance. Under Basic Option, you must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits, except under the special situations listed below. In addition, we must approve certain types of care in advance. Please refer to Section 4, Your costs for covered services , for related benefits information. (1) Medical emergency or accidental injury care in a hospital emergency room and related ambulance transport as described in Section 5(d), Emergency services/ac cidents ; (2) Professional care provided at Preferred facilities by Non -preferred radiologists, anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), pathologists, emergency room physicians, and assistant surgeons; (3) Laboratory and pathology services, X -rays, and diagnostic tests billed by Non -preferred laboratories, radiologists, and outpatient facilities; (4) Services of assistant surgeons; (5) Special provider access situations ( we encourage you to contact your Local Plan for more information in these types of situations before you receive services from a Non -preferred provider ); or (6) Care received outside the United States , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands . Unless otherwise noted in Section 5, when services of Non -preferred providers are covered in a special exception, benefits will be provided based on the Plan allowance. You are responsible for the applicable coinsurance or copayment, and may also be responsible for any difference between our allowance and the billed amount. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 22 Section 3 Transitional care Specialty care: If you have a chronic or disabling condition and lose access to your specialist because we drop out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program and you enroll in another FEHB plan, or lose access to your Pr eferred specialist because we terminate our contract with your specialist for reasons other than for cause, you may be able to continue seeing your specialist and receiving any Preferred benefits for up to 90 days after you receive notice of the change. Contact us or, if we drop out of the Program, contact your new plan. If you are in the second or third trimest er of pregnancy and you lose access to your specialist based on the above circumstances, you can continue to see your specialist and your Preferred benefits will continue until the end of your postpartum care, even if it is beyond the 90 days. If you are hospitalized when your enrollment begins We pay for covered services from the effective date of your enrollment . However, if you are in the hospital when your enrollment in our Plan begins, call us immediately . If you have not yet received your Service Benefit Plan ID card, you can contact your Local Plan at the telephone number listed in your local telephone directory. If you already have your new Service Benefit Plan ID card, call us at the number on the back of the card. If you are new to the FEHB Program, we will reimburse you for your covered services while you are in the hospital beginning on the effective date of your coverage. However, if you changed from another FEHB plan to us, your former plan will pay for the hospital stay until: you are discharged, not merely moved to an alternative care center; the day your benefits from your former plan run out; or the 92nd day after you become a member of this Plan, whichever happens first. These provisions apply only to the benefits of the hospitalized person. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB in whole or in part, or if OPM orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply. In such cases, the hos pitalized family member's benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment. You need prior Plan approval for certain services The pre -service claim approval processes for inpatient hospital admissions (called precertification) and for Other services (called prior approval) , are detailed in this Section. A pre -service claim is any claim, in whole or in part, that requires approval from us before you receive medical care or services. In other words, a pre- service claim for benefits (1) requires precertification or prior approval and (2) will result in a reduction of benefits if you do not obtain precertification or prior approval. Inpatient hospital admission Precertification is the process by which - prior to your inpatient hospital admission - we evaluate the medical necessity of your proposed stay, the procedure(s)/service(s) to be performed, and the number of days required to treat your condition. Unless we are misled by the information given to us, we will not change our decision on medical necessity. In most cases, your physician or hospital will take care of requesting precertification. Because you are still responsible for ensuring that your care is precertified, you should always ask your physician or hospital whether they have contacted us. For information about precertification of an emergency inpatient admission, please see page 2 5. Warning: We will reduce our benefits for the inpatient hospital stay by $500 if no one contacts us for precertification. If the stay is not medically necessary, we will not provide benefits for inpatient room and board or inpatient physician care; we will only pay for covered medical services and supplies that are otherwise payable on an ou tpatient basis . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 23 Section 3 Exceptions: You do not need precertification in these cases: You are admitted to a hospital outside the United States. You have another group health insurance policy that is the primary payor for the hospital stay. (See pages 20 -21 for special instructions regarding admissions to Blue Distinction Centers for Transplants.) Medicare Part A is the primary payor for the hospital stay. (See pages 20 -21 for special instructions regarding admissions to Blue D istinction Centers for Transplants.) Note: If you exhaust your Medicare hospital benefits and do not want to use your Medicare lifetime reserve days, then you do need precertification. Note: Morbid obesity surgery performed during an inpatient stay (even when Medicare Part A is your primary payor) must meet the surgical requirements described on page 6 4 in order for benefits to be provided for the admission and surgical procedure. Other services You must obtain prior approval for these services under both Standard and Basic Option : Outpatient surgical services - The surgical services listed below require prior approval when they are to be performed on an outpatient basis. This requirement applies to both the physician services and the facility services from Preferred, Participating/Member, and Non - participating/Non -member providers. You must con tact us at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card before obtaining these types of services. Outpatient surgery for morbid obesity. Note: Benefits for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity - performed on an inpatient or outpa tient basis - are subject to the pre- surgical requirements listed on page 6 4; Outpatient surgical correction of congenital anomalies; and Outpatient surgery needed to correct accidental injuries (see Definitions ) to jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, roof a nd floor of mouth. Outpatient intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) - Prior approval is required for all outpatient IMRT services except IMRT related to the treatment of head, neck, breast, or prostate cancer. Brain cancer is not considered a for m of head or neck cancer; therefore, prior approval is required for IMRT treatment of brain cancer. Contact us at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card before receiving outpatient IMRT for cancers which require prior approval. We will request the medical evidence we need to make our coverage determination. Hospice care - Contact us at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card before obtaining home hospice, continuous home hospice, or inpatient hospice care services. We will request the medical evidence we need to make our coverage determination and advise you which home hospice care agencies we have approved. See page 86 for information about the exception to this requirement. Organ/ tissue transplants - Contact us at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card before obtaining services. We will request the medical evidence we need to make our coverage determination. We wi ll consider whether the facility is approved for the procedure and whether you meet the facility's criteria. Clinical trials for certain organ/tissue transplants - See page s 72 and 73 for the list of conditions covered only in clinical trials for blood o r marrow stem cell transplants. Contact us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card for information or to request prior approval before obtaining services. We will request the medical evidence we need to make our coverage determination. Note: For the purposes of the blood or marrow stem cell clinical trial transplants listed on page s 72 and 73, a clinical trial is a research study whose protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Cancer Research Facility or FACT -accredited facility (see page 21) where the procedure is to be delivered. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 24 Section 3 Prescription drugs and supplies - Certain prescription drugs and supplies require prior approval. Contact CVS Caremark, our Pharmacy Program administrator, at 1 -800-624-5060 (TDD: 1 -800-624-5077 for the hearing impaired) to request prior approval, or to obtain a list of drugs and supplies that require prior approval. We will request the information we need to make our coverage determination. You must periodically renew prior approval for certain drugs. See page 100 for more about our prescription drug prior approval program, which is part of our Patient Safety and Quality Monitoring (PSQM) program . Please note that updates to the list of drugs and supplies requiring prior approval are made periodically during the year. New drugs and supplies may be added to the list and prior approval criteria may change. Changes to the prior approval list or to prior approval criteria are not considered benefit changes. Note: Until we approve them, you must pay for these drugs in full when you purchase them - even if you purchase them at a Preferred retail pharmacy or through our specialty drug pharmacy - and submit the expense(s) to us on a claim form. Preferred pharmacies will not file these claims for you. Under Standard Option, members may use our Mail Service Prescription Drug Program to fill their prescriptions. However, the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program also will not fill your prescription until you have obtained prior approval. CVS Caremark , the administrator of the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program, will hold your prescription for you up to thirty days. If prior approval is not obtained within 30 days, your prescr iption will be returned to you along with a letter explaining the prior approval procedures. The Mail Service Prescription Drug Program is not available under Basic Option . Surgery by Non - participating providers under Standard Option You may request pr ior approval and receive specific benefit information in advance for non - emergency surgeries to be performed by Non -participating physicians when the charge for the surgery will be $5,000 or more . When you contact your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Pla n before your surgery, the Local Plan will review your planned surgery to determine your coverage, the medical necessity of the procedure(s), and the Plan allowance for the services. You can call your Local Plan at the customer service number on the back of your ID card. Note: Standard Option members are not required to obtain prior approval for surgeries performed by Non -participating providers (unless the surgery is listed on page 23 or is one of the transplant procedures listed on page 23) - even if the charge will be $5,000 or more. If you do not call your Local Plan in advance of the surgery, we will review your claim to provide benefits for the services in accordance with the terms of your coverage. How to request precertification for an admissio n or get prior approval for Other services First, you, your representative, your physician, or your hospital must call us at the telephone number listed on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card any time prior to admission or before receiving services that require prior approval. Next, provide the following information: enrollee's name and Plan identification number; patient's name, birth date, and phone number; reason for hospitalization, proposed treatment, or surgery; name and phone number of admitting physician ; name of hospital or facility; and number of planned days of confinement. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 25 Section 3 Non-urgent care claims For non -urgent care claims (including non -urgent concurrent care claims) , we will tell the physician and/or hospital the number of approved inpatient days, or the care that we approve for Other services that must have prior approval . We will notify you of our decision within 15 days after the receipt of the pre -service claim. If matters beyond our control require an extension of time, we may take up to an additional 15 days for review and we will notify you of the need for an extension of time before the end of the original 15 -day period. Our notice will include the circumstances underlying the request for th e extension and the date when a decision is expected. If we need an extension because we have not received necessary information from you, our notice will describe the specific information required and we will allow you up to 60 days from the receipt of the notice to provide the information. Urgent care claims If you have an urgent care claim (i.e., when waiting for your medical care or treatment could seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function , or in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without this care or treatment), we will expedite our review of the claim and notify you of our decision within 72 hours as long as we receive sufficient information to complete the review. (For concurrent care claims that are also urgent care claims, please see If your treatment needs to be extended on page 26.) If you request that we review your claim as an urgent care claim, we will review the documentation you provide and decide whether it is an urgent care claim by applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and me dicine. If you fail to provide sufficient information, we will contact you within 24 hours after we receive the claim to provide notice of the specific information we need to complete our review of the claim. We will allow you up to 48 hours from the re ceipt of this notice to provide the necessary information. We will make our decision on the claim within 48 hours of (1) the time we received the additional information or (2) the end of the time frame, whichever is earlier. We may provide our decision orally within these time frames, but we will follow up with written or electronic notification within three days of oral notification. You may request that your urgent care claim on appeal be reviewed simultaneously by us and OPM. Please let us know that you would like a simultaneous review of your urgent care claim by OPM either in writing at the time you appeal our initia l decision, or by calling us at the telephone number listed on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card . You may also call O PM's Health Insurance 1 at (202) 606- 0727 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. E astern Time to ask for the simultaneous review. We will cooperate with OPM so they can quickly review your claim on appeal. In addition, if you did not indicate that your claim was a claim for urgent care, call us at the telephone number listed on the back of your ID card. If it is determined that your claim is an urgent care claim, we will expedite our review (if we have not yet responded to your claim). Concurrent care claims A concu rrent care claim involves care provided over a period of time or over a number of treatments. We will treat any reduction or termination of our pre -approved course of treatment before the end of the approved period of time or number of treatments as an appealable decision. This does not include reduction or termination due to benefit changes or if your enrollment ends. If we believe a reduction or termination is warranted , we will allow you sufficient time to appeal and obtain a decision from us before th e reduction or termination takes effect. If you request an extension of an ongoing course of treatment at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the approved time period and this is also an urgent care claim, then we will make a decision within 24 h ours after we receive the request . Emergency inpatient admission If you have an emergency admission due to a condition that you reasonably believe puts your life in danger or could cause serious damage to bodily function, you, your repre sentative, the physician, or the hospital must telephone us within two business days following the day of the emergency admission, even if you have been discharged from the hospital. If you do not telephone us within two business days, a $500 penalty may appl y - see Warning under Inpatient hospital admissions earlier in this Section and If your hospital stay needs to be extended on page 26. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 26 Section 3 Maternity care You do not need precertification of a maternity admission for a routine delivery. However, if your medical condition requires you to stay more than 48 hours after a vaginal delivery or 96 hours after a cesarean section, then your physician or the hospital must contact us for precertification of additional days. Further, if your baby stays after you are discharged, then your physician or the hospital must contact us for precertification of additional days for your baby. If your hospital stay needs to be extended If your hospital stay - includ ing for maternity care - needs to be extended, you, your representative, your physician , or the hospital must ask us to approve the additional days. If you remain in the hospital beyond the number of days we approved and did not get the additional days precertified, then for the part of the admission that was medically necessary, we will pay inpatient benefits, but for the part of the admission that was not medically necessary, we will pay only medical services and supplies otherwise payable on an outpatient basis and we will not pay inpatient benefits. If your treatment needs to be extended If you request an extension of an ongoing course of treatment at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the approved time period and this is also an urgent care claim, then we will make a decision within 24 hours after we receive the claim. If you disagree with our pre-service c laim decision If you have a pre-service claim and you do not agree with our decision regarding precertification of an inpatient admission or prior approval of Other services , you may request a review by following the procedures listed below . Note that these procedures apply to requests for reconsideration of concurrent care claims as well (see page 25 for definition). (If you have already received the service, supply, or treatment, then your claim is a post -service claim and you must follow t he entire disputed claims process detailed in Section 8. ) To reconsider a non - urgent care claim Within 6 months of our initial decision, you may ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. Follow Step 1 of the disputed claims process detailed i n Section 8 of this brochure. In the case of a pre- service claim and subject to a request for additional information, we have 30 days from the date we receive your written request for reconsideration to: 1. Precertify your hospital stay or, if applicable, approve your request for prior approval for the service, drug, or supply; or 2. Write to you and maintain our denial; or 3. Ask you or your provider for more information. You or your provider must send the information so that we receive it within 60 days of our request. We will then decide within 30 more days. If we do not receive the information within 60 days , we will decide within 30 days of the date the information was due. We will base our decision on the information we already have. We will write to you with our decision. To reconsider an urgent care claim In the case of an appeal of a pre- service urgent care claim, within 6 months of our initial decision, you may ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. Follow Step 1 of the disputed claims process detailed in Section 8 of this brochure. Subject to a request for additional information, we will notify you of our decision within 72 hours after receipt of your reconsideration request. We will expedite the review process, which allows oral or written requests for appeals and the exchange of i nformation by telephone, electronic mail, facsimile, or other expeditious methods.

Your costs for covered services This is what you will pay out -of-pocket for your covered care: Cost -sharing Cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out -of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Note: You may have to pay the deductible, coinsurance, and/or copayment amount(s) that apply to your care at the time you receive the services. Copayment A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider, facility, pharmacy, etc. , when you receive certain services. Example: If you have Standard Option when you see your Preferred physician, you pay a copayment of $20 for the office visit and we then pay the remainder of the amount we allow for the office visit. (You may have to pay separately for other services you receive while in the physician's office.) When you go into a Preferred hospital, you pay a copayment of $250 per admission. We then pay the remainder of the amount we allow for the covered services you receive. Copayments do not apply to services and supplies that are subject to a deductible and/or coinsurance amount. Note: If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Deductible A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward your deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowanc e for the service or supply that you then pay counts toward meeting your deductible. Under Standard Option, the calendar year deductible is $350 per person. Under a family enrollment, the calendar year deductible for each family member is satisfied and benefits are payable for all family members when the combined covered expenses of the family reach $700. For families of two, each family member must fully satisfy his or her individual deductible before this \"family deductible\" is considered met. Note: If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your Standard Option calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. We will apply $80 to your deductible. We will beg in paying benefits once the remaining portion of your Standard Option calendar year deductible ($270) has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans during Open Season and the effective date of your new plan is after January 1 of the next year, you do not have to start a new deductible under your old plan between January 1 and the effective date of your new plan. If you change plans at another time during the year, you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. Under Basic Option, there is no cale ndar year deductible . Coinsurance Coinsurance is the percentage of the Plan allowance that you must pay for your care. Your coinsurance is based on the Plan allowance, or billed amount, whichever is less. Under Standard Option only, coinsurance does not begin until you have met your calendar year deductible. Example: You pay 15% of the Plan allowance under Standard Option for durable medical equipment obtained from a Preferred provider, after meeting your $350 calendar year deducti ble. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 28 Section 4 If your provider routinely waives your cost Note: If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your applicable deductible (under Standard Option only), coinsurance, or copayments, the provider is misstating the fee and may be viola ting the law. In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider's fee by the amount waived. Example: If your physician ordinarily charges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 35% Standard Option coinsurance , the actual charge is $65. We will pay $42.25 (65% of the actual charge of $65). Waivers In some instances, a Preferred, Participating, or Member provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total charge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver, whether you are responsible for the total charge depends on the contracts that the Local Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver, please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card. Differences between our allowance and the bill Our \" Plan allowance \" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for certain types of covered services. Fee -for-service plans arrive at their allowances in different ways, so allowances vary. For information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition o f Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider's bill is more than a fee -for-service plan's allowance. It is possible for a provider's bill to exceed the plan's allowance by a significant amount. Whether or not you have to pay the difference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the type of provider you use. Providers that have agreements with this Plan are Preferred or Participating and will not bill you for any balances that are in excess of our allowance for covered services. See t he descriptions appearing below for the types of providers available in this Plan. Preferred providers. These types of providers have agreements with the Local Plan to limit what they bill our members. Because of that, when you use a Preferred provider , your share of the provider's bill for covered care is limited. Under Standard Option, your share consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example about coinsurance: You see a Preferred physician who charges $250, but our allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, under Standard Option, you pay just 15% of our $100 allowance ($15). Because of the agreement, your Preferred physician will not bill you for the $150 difference between our allowance and his/her bill. Under Basic Option, your sha re consists only of your copayment or coinsurance amount, since there is no calendar year deductible. Here is an example involving a copayment: You see a Preferred physician who charges $250 for covered services subject to a $25 copayment. Even though ou r allowance may be $100, you still pay just the $25 copayment. Because of the agreement, your Preferred physician will not bill you for the $225 difference between your copayment and his/her bill. Remember, under Basic Option, you must use Preferred pro viders in order to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Participating providers. These types of Non -preferred providers have agreements with the Local Plan to limit what they bill our Standard Option members. Under St andard Option, when you use a Participating provider, your share of covered charges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example: You see a Participating physician who charges $250, but the Plan allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, under Standard Option, you pay just 35% of our $100 allowance ( $35). Because of the agreement, your Participating physician will not bill you for the $150 difference between our allowance and his/her bill. Under Basic Option, there are no benefits for care performed by Participating providers; you pay all charges. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 29 Section 4 Non-participating providers. These Non-preferred providers have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. As a result, your share of the provider's bill could be significantly more than what you would pay for covered care from a Preferred provider. If you plan to use a Non-participating provider for your care, we encourage you to ask the provider about the expected costs and visit our Web site, www.fepblue.org , or call us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card for assistance i n estimating your total out- of-pocket expenses. Under Standard Option, when you use a Non- participating provider, you will pay your deductible and coinsurance - plus any difference between our allowance and the charges on the bill (except in certain circumstances - see page s 145-147). For example, you see a Non - participating physician who charges $250. The Plan allowance is again $100, and you have met your deductible. You are responsible for your c oinsurance, so you pay 35% of the $100 Plan allowance or $35. Plus, because there is no agreement between the Non -participating physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $150 difference between our allowance and his/her bill. This means you wo uld pay a total of $185 ($35 + $150) for the Non -participating physician's services, rather than $15 for the same services when performed by a Preferred physician. We encourage you to always visit Preferred providers for your care. Using Non-participating or Non -member providers could result in your having to pay significantly greater amounts for the services you receive. Under Basic Option, there are no benefits for care performed by Non -participating providers; you pay all charges. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. The tables appearing below illustrate how much Standard Option members have to pay out -of- pocket for services performed by Preferred providers, Participating/Member providers, and Non - participating/Non -member providers. The first example shows services provided by a physician and the second example shows facility care billed by an ambulatory surgical facility. In both examples, your calendar year deductible has already been met. Use this information f or illustrative purposes only. Basic Option benefit levels for physician care begin on page 37; see page 81 for Basic Option benefit levels that apply to outpatient hospital or ambulatory surgical facility care. In the following example, we compare how much you have to pay out -of-pocket for services provided by a Preferred physician, a Participating physician, and a Non -participating physician. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician charges $250 and the Plan allowance is $10 0. EXAMPLE Preferred Physician Standard Option Participating Physician Standard Option Non-participating Physician Standard Option Physician's charge $250 $250 $250 Our allowance We set it at: 100 We set it at: 100 We set it at: 100 We pay 85% of our allowance: 85 65% of our allowance: of owe: allowance: of 35% of our allowance: 35 You owe: Copayment Not applicable Not applicable Not applicable + Difference up to charge? No: 0 No: 0 Yes: 150 TOTAL YOU PAY $15 $35 $185 Note: If you had not met any of your Standard Option deductible in the above example, only our allowance ($100), which you would pay in full, would count toward your deductible. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 30 Section 4 In the following example, we compare how much you have to pay out -of-pocket for services billed by a Preferred, Member, and Non -member ambulatory surgical facility for facility care associated with an outpatient surgical procedure. The table uses an example of services for which the ambulatory surgical facility charges $5,000. The Plan allowance is $2,900 when the services are provided at a Preferred or Member facility, and the Plan allowance is $2,500 when the services are provided at a Non -member facility. EXAMPLE Preferred Ambulatory Surgical Facility Standard Option Member Ambulatory Surgical Facility Standard Option Non-member Ambulatory Surgical Facility* Standard Option Facility's charge $5,000 $5,000 $5,000 Our allowance set it at: 2,900 We set it at: 2,900 We set it 2,500 We pay allowance: of our allowance: 875 You owe: Copayment Not applicable Not applicable Not applicable + Difference up to charge? No: 0 No: 0 Yes: 2,500 TOTAL YOU PAY $435 $1,015 $3,375 Note: If you had not met any of your Standard Option deductible in the above example, $350 of our allowed amount would be applied to your deductible before your coinsurance amount was calculated. *A Non -member facility may bill you any amount for the services it provides. You are responsible for paying all expenses over our allowance, regardless of the total amount billed, in addition to your calendar year deductible and coinsurance. For example, if you use a Non-member facility that charges $60,000 for facility care related to outpatient bariatric surgery, and we pay the $1,625 amount illustrated above, you would owe $58,375 ($60,000 - $1,625 = $58,375). This example assumes your calendar year deductible has been met. Important notice about Non-participating providers ! Preferred hospitals may contract with Non -participating providers to provide certain medical or surgical services a t their facilities. Non -participating providers have no agreements with your Local Plan to limit what they can bill you. Using Non -participating or Non-member providers could result in your having to pay significantly greater amounts for the services you receive. Here is an example: You have coverage under Standard Option and go into a Preferred hospital for surgery. During surgery, you receive the services of a Non -participating anesthesiologist. Under Standard Option, members pay 15% of the Non -participating Provider Allowance plus any difference between that allowance and the amount billed (after the member's $350 calendar year deductible has been satisfied), for services provided in Preferred facilities by Non -participating anest hesiologists (see page 62). For Preferred provider services, members pay only a coinsurance amount of 15% of the Preferred Provider A llowance after meeting the $350 calendar year deductible. In this example, the Non- participating anesthesiologist charges $1,200 for his/her services. Our Non-participating Provider Allowance for those services is $400. For the Non-preferred anesthesiologist's services, you would be responsible for paying 15% of the allowance ($60), plus the $800 difference between the allowance and the amount billed, for a total of $860. I f you instead received services from a Preferred anesthesiologist, you would pay only 15% of the $400 allowance (after me eting your deductible), or $60, resulting in a savings to you of $ 800 ($860 - $60 = $ 800). 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 31 Section 4 Always request Preferred providers for your care. Call your Local Plan at the number listed on the back of your ID card or go to our Web site, www.fepblue.org , to check the contracting status of y our provider or to locate a Preferred provider near you. Under Basic Option, there are no benefits for care performed by Participating/Member or Non-participating/Non -member providers. You must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Your costs for other care Overseas care. Under Standard and Basic Options, we pay overseas claims at Preferred benefit levels . In most cases, our Plan allowance for professional provider services is based on our Overseas Fee Schedule. Most overseas professional providers are under no obligation to accept our allowance, and you must pay any difference between our payment and the provider's bill. For facility care you receive overseas, we provide benefits in full after you pay the applicable copayment or coinsurance (and, under Standard Option, any deductible amount that may apply). See Section 5(i) for more information about our overseas benefits. Dental care. Under Standard Option, we pay sch eduled amounts for covered dental services and you pay balance s as described in S ection 5(g) . Under Basic Option, you pay $25 for any covered evaluation and we pay the balance for covered services. Basic Option members must use Preferred dentists in orde r to receive benefits. See Section 5(g) for a listing of covered dental services and additional payment information. Hospital care. Under Standard and Basic Options, you pay the coinsurance or copayment amounts listed in Section 5(c). Under Standard Option, you must meet your deductible before we begin providing benefits for certain hospital -billed services. Under Basic Option, you must use Preferred facili ties in order to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Your catastrophic protection out -of-pocket maximum for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments Under Standard and Basic Options, we limit your annual out -of-pocket ex penses for the covered services you receive to protect you from unexpected health care costs. When your eligible out -of-pocket expenses reach this catastrophic protection maximum, you no longer have to pay the associated cost -sharing amounts for the rest of the calendar year. Note: Certain types of expenses do not accumulate to the maximum. Standard Option maximums: Preferred Provider maximum - For a Self Only enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for your deductible, and for eligible coinsurance and copayment amounts, is $5,000 when you use Preferred providers. For a Self and Family enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for these types of ex penses is $6,000 for Preferred provider services. Only eligible expenses for Preferred provider services count toward these limits. Non-preferred Provider maximum - For a Self Only enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for your deductible, and for eligible coinsurance and copayment amounts, is $7,000 when you use Non- preferred providers. For a Self and Family enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for these types of expenses is $8,000 for Non -preferred provider services. For either enrollment type, eligible expenses for the services of Preferred providers also count toward these limits. Basic Option maximum: Preferred Provider maximum - For a Self Only enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for eligible coinsurance and copayment amounts, is $5,500 when you use Preferred providers. For a Self and Family enrollment, your out -of-pocket maximum for these types of expenses is $7,000 when you use Preferred providers.

These expenses do not count toward your catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum, and you must continue to pay them even after your expenses exceed the limits described above .

Please see page 21 for the exceptions to the requirement to use Preferred providers. Carryover Note: If you change to another plan during Open Season, we will continue to provide benefits between January 1 and the effective date of your new plan. If you had already paid the out -of-pocket maximum, we will continue to provide benefits as described on page 31 and on this page until the effective date of your new plan. If you had not yet paid the out -of-pocket maximum, we will apply any expenses you incur in January (before the effective date of your new plan) to our prior year's out -of-pocket maximum. Once you reach the maximum, you do not need to pay our deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance amounts (except as shown on page 31 and on this page ) from that point until the effective date of your new plan. Note: Because benefit changes are effective January 1, we will apply our ne xt year's benefits to any expenses you incur in January. Note: If you change options in this Plan during the year, we will credit the amounts already accumulated toward the catastrophic protection out -of-pocket limit of your old option to the catastrophic protection out- of-pocket limit of your new option. If you change from Self Only to Self and Family, or vice versa, during the calendar year, please call us about your out -of-pocket accumulat ions and how they carry over. If we overpay you We will make diligent efforts to recover benefit payments we made in error but in good faith. We may reduce subsequent benefit payments to offset overpayments . Note: We will generally first seek recovery from the provider if we paid the provider directly, or from the person (covered family member, guardian, custodial parent, etc.) to whom we sent our payment. When Government facilities bill us Facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from us for certain services and supplies they provide to you or a family member. They may not seek more than their governing laws allow. You may be responsible to pay for certain services and charges. Contact the government facility directly for more information. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 33 Standard and Basic Option Section 5 Standard and Basic Option Section 5.

............................................... 155 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 35 Standard and Basic Option Section 5 Overview Standard and Basic Option Standard and Basic Option Overview This Plan offers both a Standard and Basic Option. Both benefit packages are described in Section 5. Make sure that you rev iew the benefits that are available under the option in which you are enrolled. The Standard and Basic Option Section 5 is divided into subsections. Please read Important things you should keep in mind at the beginning of the subsections. Also read the general exclusions in Section 6; they apply to the benefits in the following subsections. To obtain claim forms, claims filing adv ice, or more information about Standard and Basic Option benefits, contact us at the customer service telephone number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card or on our Web site at www.fepblue.org . Each option offers unique features. Standard Option When you have Standard Option, you can use both Preferred and Non- preferred providers. However, your out -of-pocket expenses are lower when you use Preferred providers and Preferred providers will submit cla ims to us on your behalf. Standard Option has a calendar year deductible for some services and a $20 copayment for office visits to primary care providers ($30 for specialists). Standard Option also features a Preferred Retail Pharmacy Program, a Preferr ed Mail Service Drug Program, and a Preferred Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program. Basic Option Basic Option does not have a calendar year deductible. Most services are subject to copayments ($25 for primary care providers and $35 for specialists). Members do not need to have referrals to see specialists. You must use Preferred providers for your care to be eligible for benefits, except in certain circumstances, such as emergency care. Preferred providers will submit claims to us on your behalf. Basic Op tion also offers a Preferred Retail Pharmacy Program and a Preferred Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 36 Standard and Basic Option Section 5(a) Standard and Basic Option Section 5(a). Medical services and supplies provided by physicians and other health care professionals Important things you should keep in mind about these benefits: Please remember that all benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions in this brochure and are payable only when we determine they are medically necessary. Please refer to Section 3, How you receive benefits , for a list of providers we consider to be primary care providers and other health care professionals. Be sure to read Section 4, Your costs for covered services , for valuable information about how cost -sharing works. Also , read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 65 or over . We base payment on whether a facility or a health care professional bills for the services or supplies. You will find that some benefits are listed in more than one section of the brochure. This is because how they are paid depends on what type of provider bills for the service. For example, physical therapy is paid differently depending on whether it is billed by an inpatient facility, a physician , a physical therapist, or an outpatient facility. The amounts listed in this S ection are for the charges billed by a physician or other health care professional for your medical care. Look in Section 5(c) for charges associated with the facility (i.e., hospi tal or other outpatient facility, etc.). PPO benefits apply only when you use a PPO provider. When no PPO provider is available, non -PPO benefits apply. Under Standard Option, The calendar year deductible is $350 per person ($700 per family). We provide benefits at 85% of the Plan allowance for services provided in Preferred facilities by Non - preferred radiologists, anesthesiologists, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), pathologists, emergency room physicians, and assistant surgeons (includi ng assistant surgeons in a physician's office). You are responsible for any difference between our payment and the billed amount. Under Basic Option, There is no calendar year deductible . You must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits. See below and page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. We provide benefits at Preferred benefit levels for services provided in Preferred facilities by Non - preferred radiologists, anesthesiologists, certifie d registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), pathologists, emergency room physicians, and assistant surgeons (including assistant surgeons in a physician's office). You are responsible for any difference between our payment and the billed amount. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 37 Standard and Basic Option Section 5(a) Standard and Basic Option Benefit Description You Pay Note: For Standard Option, we state whether or not the calendar year deductible applies for each benefit listed in this Section.

Also, read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 65 or over . YOU MUST GET PREC ERTIFICATION FOR HOSPITAL STAYS; FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A $500 PENALTY. Please refer to the precertification information listed in Section 3 to be sure which services require precertification. Note: Observation services are billed as outpatient f acility care.

Please refer to page 23 for more information. You should be aware that some PPO hospitals may have non -PPO professional providers on staff. We base payment on whether a facility or a heal th care professional bills for the services or supplies. You will find that some benefits are listed in more than one section of the brochure. This is because how they are paid depends on what type of provider bills for the service. For example, physica l therapy is paid differently depending on whether it is billed by an inpatient facility, a physician , a physical therapist, or an outpatient facility. The amounts listed in this S ection are for the charges billed by the facility (i.e., hospital or surgical center) or ambulance service, for your inpatient or outpatient surgery or care. Any costs associated with the professional charge (i.e., physicians, etc.) are listed in Secti ons 5(a) or 5(b). PPO benefits apply only when you use a PPO provider. When no PPO provider is available, non -PPO benefits apply. Under Standard Option, The calendar year deductible is $350 per person ( $700 per family) .

Be sure to read Section 4, Your costs for covered services , for valuable information about how cost -sharing works. Also, read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 65 or over .

Under Basic Option, There is no calendar year deductible . You must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits, except in cases of medical emergency or accidental injury. Refer to the guidelines appearing below for additional information. What is an accidental injury? An accidental injury is an injury caused by an external force or element such as a blow or fall and which requires immediate medical attention, including animal bites and poisonings. [See Section 5(g) for dental care for accidental injury.] What is a medical emergency? A med ical emergency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability, and requires immediate medical or surgical care. Some problems are emergencies because, if not treated promptly, they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emergencies because they are potentially life threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudde n inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emergencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action. Basic Option benefits for emergency care Under Basic Option, you are encouraged to seek care from Preferred providers in cases of accidental injury or medical emergency. However, if you need care immediately and cannot access a Preferred provider, we will provide benefits for the initial treatment provided in the emergency room of any hospital - even if the hospital is not a Preferred facility. We will also provide benefits if you are admitted directly to the hospital from the emergency room until your condition has been stabilized. In addition, we will provide benefits for emergency ambulance transportation provided by Preferred or Non -preferred ambulance providers if the transport is due to a medical emergency or accidental injury. We provide emergency benefits when you have acute symptoms of sufficient severity - including severe pain - such that a prudent layperson, who possesses average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in serious jeopardy to the person's health, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman and her unborn child. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 91 Standard and Basic Option Section 5(d) Standard and Basic Option Benefit Description You Pay Note: For Standard Option, we state whether or not the calendar year deductible applies for each benefit listed in this Section.

We may also move a specialty drug from Tier 4 (preferred) to Tier 5 (non -preferred) if a generic equivalent becomes available or if new safety concerns arise .

See page 10 5 for information about your cost -share for specialty drugs purchased at a Preferred retail p harmacy that are affected by these restrictions . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 99 Standard and Basic Option Section 5(f) Standard and Basic Option We use an open formulary. This includes a list of preferred drugs selected to meet patient needs at a lower cost to us. If your physician believes a brand -name drug is necessary or there is no generi c equivalent available, ask your physician to prescribe a brand -name drug from our preferred drug list. Under Standard Option, we may ask your doctor to substitute a preferred drug in order to help control costs. If you purchase a drug that is not on our preferred drug list, your cost will be higher. We cover drugs that require a prescription (whether or not they are on our preferred drug list). Your cooperation with our cost -savings efforts helps keep your premium affordable. Under Basic Option, we encourage you to ask your physician to prescribe a brand -name drug from our preferred drug list when your physician believes a brand -name drug is necessary or when there is no generic equivalent available. If you purchase a drug that is not on our preferred drug list, your cost will be higher. (We cover drugs that require a prescription whether or not they are on our preferred drug list.) Note: Before filling your prescription, please check the preferred/non -preferred status of your medication. Other than changes resulting from new drugs or safety issues, the preferred drug list is updated periodically during the year. Member cost -share for prescription drugs is determined by the tier to which a drug has been assigned. To determine the tier assignments for formulary drugs, we work with our Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, a group of physicians and pharmacists who ar e not employees or agents of, nor have financial interest in, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan. The Committee meets quarterly to review new and existing drugs to assist us in our assessment of these drugs for safety and efficacy. Drugs determined to be of equal therapeutic value and similar safety and efficacy are then evaluated on the basis of cost. The Committee's recommendations, together with our evaluation of the relative cost of the drugs, determine the placement of formulary dru gs on a specific tier. Using lower cost preferred drugs will provide you with a high quality, cost -effective prescription drug benefit. Our payment levels are generally categorized as: Tier 1: Includes generic drugs Tier 2: Includes preferred brand -name drugs Tier 3: Includes non -preferred brand -name drugs Tier 4: Includes preferred specialty drugs Tier 5: Includes non -preferred specialty drugs You can view our formulary which includes the preferred drug list on our Web site at www.fepblue.org or request a copy by mail by calling 1 -800-624-5060 (TDD: 1- 800-624-5077). If you do not find your drug on the formulary or the preferred drug list, please call 1 -800-624-5060. Any savings we receive on the cost of drugs purch ased under this Plan from drug manufacturers are credited to the reserves held for this Plan. Generic equivalents. Generic equivalent drugs have the same active ingredients as their brand -name equivalents. By filling your prescriptions (or those of family members covered by the Plan) at a retail pharmacy , through the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program, or, for Standard Option only, through the Mail Service Prescription Drug Program, you authorize the pharmacist to substitute any available Federally approved g eneric equivalent , unless you or your physician specifically request a brand -name drug. Keep in mind that Basic Option members must use Preferred providers in order to receive benefits . Why use generic drugs? Generic drugs are generally lower cost drugs . Generic drugs have the same quality and strength as brand -name drugs and must meet the same strict standards for quality and effectiveness set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as brand -name drugs. You can save mo ney by using generic drugs. Keep in mind that doctors often have several medication options to treat their patients. If your brand -name drug does not have an equivalent generic drug, there may be a generic alternative drug available to treat your condition. You may want to talk with your doctor about generic drugs and how you can reduce your prescription drug costs. You or your doctor may request a brand- name drug even if a generic option is available. See Section 10, Definitions , for more information about generic alternatives and generic equivalents. Disclosure of information. As part of our administration of prescription drug benefits, we may disclose information about your prescription drug utilization, including the names of your prescribing physi cians, to any treating physicians or dispensing pharmacies. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 100 Standard and Basic Option Section 5(f) Standard and Basic Option These are the dispensing limitations.

Care Management Programs If you have a chronic disease or complex health care needs , the Service Benefit Plan offers members two types of Care Management Programs that provide patient education and clinical support. Case Management: We provide members with complex health care needs with the services of a professional case manager to assess the needs of the member and when appropriate, coordinate, evaluate, and monitor the member's care. Disease Management: We provide programs to help members adopt effective self -care habits to improve their self -management of diabetes; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); coronary artery disease; congestive heart failure; and certain rare conditions. You may receive information from us regarding the programs available to you in your area. If you have any questions regarding these programs, please contact us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card. Flexible benefits option Under the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, our Case Management process may include a flexible benefits option . This option allows professional case managers at Local Plans to assist members with certain complex and/or chronic health issues b y coordinating complicated treatment plans and other types of complex patient care plans. Through the flexible benefits option, case managers may identify a less costly alternative treatment plan for the member. Members who are eligible to receive services through the flexible benefits option are asked to provide verbal consent for the alternative plan. If you and your provider agree with the plan, alternative benefits will begin immediately and you will be asked to sign an alternative benefits agreement that includes the terms listed below, in addition to any other terms specified in the agreement. Alternative benefits will be made available for a limited period of time and are subject to our ongoing review. You must cooperate with the review process. If we approve alternative benefits, we do not guarantee that they will be extended beyond the limited time period and/or scope of treatment initially approved or that they will be approved in the future. The decision to offer alternative benefits is solel y ours, and unless otherwise specified in the alternative benefits agreement , we may withdraw those benefits at any time and resume regular contract benefits. Our decision to offer or withdraw alternative benefits is not subject to OPM review under the dis puted claims process. If you sign the alternative benefits agreement , we will provide the agreed -upon benefits for the stated time period, unless we are misled by the information given to us or circumstances change. You may request an extension of the tim e period initially approved for alternative benefits, but benefits as stated in this brochure will apply if we do not approve your request. Please note that the written alternative benefits agreement must be signed by the member or his/her authorized repr esentative and returned to the Plan case manager within 30 days of the date of the alternative benefits agreement. If the Plan does not receive the signed agreement within 30 days, alternative benefits will be withdrawn and benefits as stated in this broc hure will apply. Note: If we deny a request for precertification or prior approval of regular contract benefits, or if we deny regular contract benefits for services you have already received, you may dispute our denial of regular contract benefits under the OPM disputed claims process (see Section 8). 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 121 Standard and Basic Option Section 5( i) Standard and Basic Option Section 5(i).

Records Keep a separate record of the medical expenses of each covered family member, because deductibles (under Standard Option) and benefit maximums (such as those for outpatient physical therapy or preventive dental care) apply separately to each person. Save copies of all medical bills, including those you accumulate to satisfy a deductible under Standard Option. In most instances they will serve as evidence of your claim.

You must submit the claim by December 31 of the year after the year you received the service, unless timely filing was prevented by administrative operations of Government or legal incapacity, provided you submitted the claim as soon as reasonably possible. If we return a claim or part of a claim for additional information, you must resubmit it within 90 days, or before the timely filing period expires, whichever is later. Note: Once we pay benefits, there is a five -year limitation on the re -issuance of uncashed checks.

For urgent care claims, a health care professional with knowledge of your medical condition will be permi tted to act as your authorized representative without your express cons ent. For the purposes of this S ection, we are also referring to your authorized representative when we refer to you. Notice Requirements The Secretary of Health and Human Services has identified counties where at least 10 percent of the population is literate only in certain non -English languages. The non- English languages meeting this threshold in certain counties are Spanish, Chinese, Navajo , and Tagalog. If you live in one of thes e counties, we will provide language assistance in the applicable non -English language. You can request a copy of your explanation of b enefits (EOB) statement, related correspondence, oral language services (such as telephone customer assistance), and hel p with filing claims and appeals (including external reviews) in the applicable non -English language.

The disputed claims process Please follow this Federal Employees Health Benefits Program disputed claims process if you disagree with our decision on your post-service claim (a claim where services, drugs , or supplies have already been provided). In Section 3, If you disagree with our pre-service claim decision , we describe the process you need to follow if you have a claim for services, drugs , or supplies that must have precertification (such as inpatient hospital admissions) or prior approval from the P lan. You may be able to appeal directly to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) if we do not follow required claims processes. For more information about situations in which you are entitled to immediately appeal to OPM, including additional requiremen ts not listed in Sections 3, 7 , and 8 of this brochure, please visit www.fepblue.org . To help you prepare your appeal, you may arrange with us to review and copy, free of charge, all relevant materials and Plan documents under our control relating to your claim, including those that involve any expert review(s) of your claim. To make your request, please call us at the customer service number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card , or s end your request to us at the address shown on your explanation of benefits (EOB) form for the Local Plan that processed the claim (or, for Prescription drug benefits, our Retail Pharmacy Program, Mail Service Prescription Drug Program, or the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program) . Our reconsideration will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by you relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. When our initial decision is based (in whole or in part) on a medical judgment (i.e., med ical necessity, experimental/investigational), we will consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the medical judgment and who was not involved in making the initial decision. Our reconsideration decision will not afford deference to the initial decision and will be conducted by a plan representative w ho is neither the individual who made the initial decision that is the subject of the reconsideration, nor the subordinate of that individual. We will not make our decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or other similar matters with respect to any individual (such as a claims adjudicator or medical expert) based upon the likelihood that the individual will s upport the denial of benefits. Step Description 1 Ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. You must: a) Write to us within 6 months from the date of our decision; and b) Send your request to us at the address shown on your explanation of benefits (EOB) form for the Local Plan that processed the claim (or, for Prescription drug benefits, our Retail Pharmacy Program , Mail Service Prescription Drug Program , or the Specialty Drug Pharmacy Program ); and c) Include a statement about why you belie ve our initial decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure; and d) Include copies of documents that support your claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms. We will provide you, free of charge and in a timely manner, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by us or at our direction in connection with your claim and any new rat ionale for our claim decision. We will provide you with this information sufficiently in advance of the date that we are required to provide you with our reconsideration decision to allow you a reasonable opportunity to r espond to us before that date. However, our failure to provide you with new evidence or rationale in sufficient time to allow you to timely respond shall not invalidate ou r decision on reconsideration. You may respond to that new evidence or rationale at the OPM review stage described in S tep 3. 2 In the case of a post -service claim, we have 30 days from the date we receive your request to: a) Pay the claim or b) Write to you and maintain our denial or c) Ask you or your provider for more information. You or your provider must send the information so that we receive it within 60 days of our request. We will then decide within 30 more days. If we do not receive the information within 60 days , we will decide within 30 days of the date the information was due. We will base our decision on the information we already have. We will write to you with our decision. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 131 Section 8 The disputed claims process (continued) 3 If you do not agree with our decision, you may ask OPM to review it. You must write to OPM within: 90 days after the date of our letter upholding our initial decision; or 120 days after you first wrote to us - if we did not answer that request in some way within 30 days; or 120 days after we asked for additional information - if we did not send you a decision within 30 days after we received the additional information. Write to OPM at: United States Office of Personnel Management, Healthcare and Insurance, Federal Employee Insurance Operations, Health Insurance 1, 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415- 3610. Send OPM the following information: A statement about why you believe our decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure; Copies of documents that support your claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms; Copies of all letters you sent to us about the claim; Copies of all letters we sent to you about the claim; and Your daytime phone number and the best time to call. Your email address, if you would like to receive OPM's decision via email. Please n ote that by providing your email address, you may receive OPM's decision more quickly . Note: If you want OPM to review more than one claim, you must clearly identify which documents apply to which claim. Note: You are the only person who has a right to file a disputed claim with OPM. Parties acting as your representative, such as medical providers, must include a copy of your specific written consent with the review request. However, for urgent care claims, a health care professional with knowledge of your medical condition may act as your authorized representative without your express consent. Note: The above deadlines may be extended if you show that you were unable to meet the deadline because of reasons beyond your control. 4 OPM will review your disputed claim request and will use the information it collects from you and us to decide whether our decision is correct. OPM will determine if we correctly applied the terms of our contract when we denied your claim or request for service. OPM will send you a final decision within 60 days. There are no other administrative appeals. If you do not agree with OPM's decision, your only recourse is to sue. If you decide to sue, you must file the suit against OPM in Fe deral court by December 31 of the third year after the year in which you received the disputed services, drugs, or supplies , or from the year in which you were denied precertification or prior approval. This is the only deadline that may not be extended. OPM may disclose the information it collects during the review process to support their disputed claims decision. This information will become part of the court record. You may not sue until you have completed the disputed claims process. Further, Fe deral law governs your lawsuit, benefits, and payment of benefits. The Federal court will base its review on the record that was before OPM when OPM decided to uphold or overturn our decision. You may recover only the amount of benefits in dispute. Note : If you have a serious or life threatening condition (one that may cause permanent loss of bodily functions or death if not treated as soon as possible), and you did not indicate that your claim was a claim for urgent care, then call us at the customer service number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card. We will expedite our review (if we have not yet responded to your claim); or we will inform OPM so they can quickly review your claim on appeal. You may call OPM's Health Insurance 1 at (202) 606 -0727 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Please remember that we do not make decisions about plan eligibility issues. For example, we do not determine whether you or a dependent is covered under this P lan. You must raise eligibility issues with your Agency personnel/payroll office if you are an employee, your retirement system if you are an annuitant , or the Office of Workers ' Compensation P rograms if you are receiving Workers ' Compensation benefits . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 132 Section 9 Section 9. Coordinating benefits with Medicare and other coverage When you have other health coverage You must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other group health plan or has automobile insurance that pays health care expenses without regard to fault. This is called \"double coverage.\" When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its b enefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor . We, like other insurers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For e xample: If you are covered under our Plan as a dependent, any group health insurance you have from your employer will pay primary and we will pay secondary. If you are an annuitant under our Plan and also are actively employed, any group health insurance you have from your employer will pay primary and we will pay secondary. When you are entitled to the payment of health care expenses under automobile insurance, including no -fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, your automobile insurance is the primary payor and we are the secondary payor . For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit the NAIC W eb site at http://www.NAIC.org . When we are t he primary payor , we will pay the benefits described in this brochure. When we are the secondary payor , we will determine our allowance. After the primary plan pays, we will pay what is left of our allowance, up to our regular benefit. We will not pay more than our allowance. For example, we will generally only make up the difference between the primary payor 's benefits payment and 100% of the Plan allowance, subject to our applicable deductible (under Standard Option) and coinsurance or copayment amounts, except when Medicare is the primary payor (see page 140). Thus, it is possible that the combined payments from both plans may not equal the entire amount billed by the provider. Note: When we pay secondary to primary coverage you have from a prepaid plan (HMO), we base our benefits on your out -of-pocket liability under the prepaid plan (generally, the prepaid plan's copayments), subject to our deductible (under Standard Option) and coinsurance or copayment amounts. In certain circumstances when we are secondary and there is no adverse effect on you (that is, you do not pay any mor e), we may also take advantage of any provider discount arrangements your primary plan may have and only make up the difference between the primary plan's payment and the amount the provider has agreed to accept as payment in full from the primary plan. Note: Any visit limitations that apply to your care under this Plan are still in effect when we are the secondary payor . Remember: Even if you do not file a claim with your other plan, you must still tell us that you have double coverage, and you must al so send us documents about your other coverage if we ask for them. Please see Section 4, Your costs for covered services , for more information about how we pay claims. TRICARE and CHAMPVA TRICARE is the health care program for eligible dependents of military persons, and retirees of the military. TRICARE includes the CHAMPUS program. CHAMPVA provides health coverage to disabled Veterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPVA and this Plan cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPVA Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about these programs. Suspended FEHB coverage to enroll in TRICARE or CHAMPVA: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these programs, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to any applicable plan premiums.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement office. If you later want to re -enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPVA. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 133 Section 9 Workers' Compensation We do not cov er services that: You (or a covered family member) need because of a workplace -related illness or injury that the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) or a similar Federal or State agency determines they must provide; or OWCP or a similar agency pays for through a third -party injur y settlement or other similar proceeding that is based on a claim you filed under OWCP or similar laws. Once OWCP or a similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover your care. Medicaid When you have this Plan and Medicaid , we pay first. Suspended FEHB coverage to enroll in Medicaid or a similar s tate-sponsored program of medical assistance: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in one of these s tate progra ms, eliminating your FEHB premium. For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement office. If you later want to re -enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under the state program. When other Government agencies are responsible for your care We do not cover services and supplies when a local, State, or Federal Government agency directly or indirectly pays for them. When others are responsible for injuries If another person or entity, through an act or omission, causes you to suffer an injury or illness, and if we paid benefits for that injury or illness, you must agree to the provisions listed below. In addition, if you are injured and no othe r person or entity is responsible but you receive (or are entitled to) a recovery from another source, and if we paid benefits for that injury, you must agree to the following provisions: All recoveries you or your representatives obtain (whether by lawsuit, settlement, insurance or benefit program claims, or otherwise), no matter how described or designated, must be used to reimburse us in full for benefits we paid. Our share of any recov ery extends only to the amount of benefits we have paid or will pay to you or your representatives. For purposes of this provision, \"you\" includes your covered dependents, and \"your representatives\" include, if applicable, your heirs, administrators, lega l representatives, parents (if you are a minor), successors, or assignees. This is our right of recovery. We are entitled under our right of recovery to be reimbursed for our benefit payments even if you are not \"made whole\" for all of your damages in the recoveries that you receive. Our right of recovery is not subject to reduction for attorney's fees and costs under the \"common fund\" or any other doctrine. We will not reduce our share of any recovery unless, in the exercise of our discretion, we agree in writing to a reduction (1) because you do not receive the full amount of damages that you claimed or (2) because you had to pay attorneys' fees. You must cooperate in doing what is reasonably necessary to assist us with our right of recovery. Yo u must not take any action that may prejudice our right of recovery. If you do not seek damages for your illness or injury, you must permit us to initiate recovery on your behalf (including the right to bring suit in your name). This is called subrogat ion. If you do seek damages for your illness or injury, you must tell us promptly that you have made a claim against another party for a condition that we have paid or may pay benefits for, you must seek recovery of our benefit payments and liabilities, and you must tell us about any recoveries you obtain, whether in or out of court. We may seek a first priority lien on the proceeds of your claim in order to reimburse ourselves to the full amount of benefits we have paid or will pay. We may request that you sign a reimbursement agreement and/or assign to us (1) your right to bring an action or (2) your right to the proceeds of a claim for your illness or injury. We may delay processing of your claims until you provide the signed reimbursement agreement and/or assignment, and we may enforce our right of recovery by offsetting future benefits. Note: We will pay the costs of any covered services you receive that are in excess of any recoveries made. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 134 Section 9 Our rights of recovery and subrogation as described in this Section may be enforced, at the Carrier's option, by the Carrier, by any of the Local Plans that administered the benefits paid in connection with the injury or illness at issue, or by any combination of these entities. Among the other situations covered by this provision, the circumstances in which we may subrogate or assert a right of recovery shall also include: When a third party injures you, for example, in an automobile accident o r through medical malpractice; When you are injured on premises owned by a third party; or When you are injured and benefits are available to you or your dependent, under any law or under any type of insurance, including, but not limited to: No-fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, including personal injury protection benefits, regardless of any election made by you to treat those benefits as secondary to this Plan Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage Worke rs' Compensation benefits Medical reimbursement coverage Contact us if you need more information about subrogation. When you have Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one dental/vision plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or visio n plan on BENEFEDS.com, you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out -of-pocket cost. Clinical t rials If you are a participant in an approved clinical trial, this health Plan will provide benefits for related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine care costs - costs for medically necessary services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient's condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy. We provide benefits for these types of costs at the benefit levels described in Section 5 ( Benefits ) when the s ervices are covered under the Plan and we determine that they are medically necessary. Extra care costs - costs of covered services related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient's routine care. This Plan covers extra care costs related to taking part in an approved clinical trial for a covered stem cell transplant such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the clinical trial protocol, but n ot as part of the patient's routine care. For more information about approved clinical trials for covered stem cell transplants, see page s 72-73. Extra care costs related to taking part in any other type of clinical trial are not covered. We encourage you to contact us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card to discuss specific services if you participate in a clinical trial. Research costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs. An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life- threatening disease or condition , and is either Federally funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food a nd Drug Administration (FDA) ; or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 135 Section 9 When you have Medicare What is Medicare? Medicare is a health insurance program for: People 65 years of age or older Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age People with End Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant) Medicare has four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance). Most people do not have to p ay for Part A. If you or your spouse worked for at least 10 years in Medicare -covered employment, you should be able to qualify for premium -free Part A insurance. (If you were a Federal employee at any time both before and during January 1983, you will r eceive credit for your Federal em ployment before January 1983.) Otherwise, if you are age 65 or older, you may be able to buy it. Contact 1-800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227) , (TTY 1 -877-486-2048), for more information. Part B (Medical Insurance). Most people pay monthly for Part B. Generally, Part B premiums are withheld from your monthly Social Security check or your retirement check. Part C (Medicare Advantage). You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan to get your Medicare benefits. We do not offer a Medicare Advantage plan. Please review the information on coordinating benefits with Medicare Advantage plans on page 137. Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage) . There is a monthly premium for Part D coverage. If you have limited savings and a low income, you may be eligible for Medicare's Low-Income Benefits. For people with limited income and resources, extra help in paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. Information regarding this progr am is available through the Social Security Administration (SSA). For more information about this extra help, visit SSA online at www.socialsecurity.gov , or call them at 1 -800-772-1213, (TTY 1 -800-325-0778). Before enrolling in Medicare Part D, please review the important disclosure notice from us about the FEHB prescription drug coverage and Medicare. The notice is on the first inside page of this brochure. The notice will give you guidance on enrolling in Medicare Part D. Should I enroll in Medicare? The decision to enroll in Medicare is yours. We encourage you to apply for Medicare benefits 3 months before you turn age 65. It's easy. Just call the Social Security Administration toll -free number 1- 800-772-1213, ( TTY 1 -800-325-0778) , to set up an appointment to apply. If you do not apply for one or more Parts of Medicare, you can still be covered under the FEHB Program. If you can get premium -free Part A coverage, w e advise you to enroll in it. Most Federal employees and annuitants are entitled to Medicare Part A at age 65 without cost . When you do not have to pay premiums for Medicare Part A, it makes good sense to obtain the coverage. It can reduce your out -of-pocket expenses as well as costs to the FEHB, which can help keep FEHB premiums down. Everyone is charged a premium for Medicare Part B coverage. The Social Security Administration can provide you with premium and benefit information. Review the information and decide if it makes sense for you to buy Medicare Part B coverage. If you do not sign up for Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may be charged a Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty of a 10% increase in premium for every 12 months you are not enrolled. If you didn't take Part B at age 65 because you were covered under FEHB as an active employee (or you were covered under your spouse 's group health insurance plan and he/she was an active employee), you may sign up for Part B (generally without an increased premium) within 8 months from the time you or your spouse stop working or are no longer covered by the group plan. You also can sign up at any time while you are covered by the group plan. If you are eligible for Medicar e, you may have choices in how you get your health care. Medicare Advantage is the term used to describe the various private health plan choices available to Medicare beneficiaries. The information in the next few page s shows how we coordinate benefits w ith Medicare, depending on whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or a private Medicare Advantage plan. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 136 Section 9 (Please refer to page 139 for information about how we provide benefits when you are age 65 or older and do not have Medicare.) The Original M edicare Plan (Part A or Part B) The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now. You may go to any doctor, specialist, or hospital that accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary. This is true whether or not they accept Medicare. When you are enrolled in Original Medicare along with this Plan, you still need to follow the rules in this brochure for us to cover your care. For example, yo u must continue to obtain prior approval for some prescription drugs and organ/tissue transplants before we will pay benefits. However, you do not have to precertify inpatient hospital stays when Medicare Part A is primary (see page 23 for exception). Claims process when you have the Original Medicare Plan - You will probably not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original Medicare Plan. When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. When the Original Medicare Plan is the primary payor , Medicare processes your claim first. In most cases, your claim will be coordinated automatically and we will then provide secondary benefits for the covered charges. To find out if you need to do something to file your claims, call us at the customer s ervice number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card or visit our Web site at www.fepblue.org . We waive some costs if the Original Medicare Plan is your primary payor - We will waive some out -of-pocket cos ts as follows: When Medicare Part A is primary - Under Standard Option, we will waive our: Inpatient hospital per -admission copayments; and Inpatient Member and Non -member hospital coinsurance. Under Basic Option , we will waive our: Inpatient hospital per -day copayments. Note: Once you have exhausted your Medicare Part A benefits: Under Standard Option , you must then pay any difference between our allowance and the billed amount at Non -member hospitals. Under Basic Option , you must then pay the inpatient hospital per -day copayments. When Medicare Part B is primary - Under Standard Option , we will waive our: Calendar year deductible; Coinsurance and copayments for inpatient and outpatient services and supplies provided by physicians and other covered health care professionals; and Coinsurance for outpatient facility services . Under Basic Option , we will waive our: Copayments and coinsurance for care received from covered professional and facility providers. Note: We do not waive benefit limitations, such as the 25 -visit limit for home nursing visits. In addition, we do not waive any coinsurance or copayments for prescription drugs. You can find more information about how our P lan coordinates benefits with Medicare in our Medicare and You Guide for Federal Employees available online at www.fepblue.org . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 137 Section 9 Tell us about your Medicare coverage You must tell us if you or a covered famil y member has Medicare coverage, and let us obtain information about services denied or paid under Medicare if we ask. You must also tell us about other coverage you or your covered family members may have, as this coverage may affect the primary/secondary status of this Plan and Medicare. Private contract with your physician A physician may ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. Should you sign an agreement, Medica re will not pay any portion of the charges, and we will not increase our payment. We will still limit our payment to the amount we would have paid after Original Medicare's payment. You may be responsible for paying the difference between the billed amou nt and the amount we paid. Medicare Advantage (Part C) If you are eligible for Medicare, you may choose to enroll in and get your Medicare benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan. These are private health care choices (like HMOs and regional PPOs) in some areas of the country. To learn more about Medicare Advantage plans, contact Medicare at 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227) , (TTY 1 -877-486-2048), or at www.medicare.gov . If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, the following options are available to you: This Plan and another plan's Medicare Advantage plan: You may enroll in another plan's Medicare Advantage plan and also remain enrolled in our FEHB Plan. If you enroll in a Medicare Ad vantage plan, tell us. We will need to know whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or in a Medicare Advantage plan so we can correctly coordinate benefits with Medicare. Under Standard Option, we will still provid e benefits when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary, even out of the Medicare Advantage plan's network and/or service area, but we will not waive any of our copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles, if you receive services from providers who do not part icipate in the Medicare Advantage plan. Under Basic Option, we provide benefits for care received from Preferred providers when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary, even out of the Medicare Advantage plan's network and/or service area. However, we w ill not waive any of our copayments or coinsurance for services you receive from Preferred providers who do not participate in the Medicare Advantage plan. Please remember that you must receive care from Preferred providers in order to receive Basic Optio n benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to this requirement. Suspended FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan: If you are an annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, eliminat ing your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to your Medicare Advantage plan premium.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement office. If you later want to re -enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so onl y at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage or move out of the Medicare Advantage plan's service area. Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D) When we are the primary payor , we process the claim first. If you enroll in Medicare Part D and we are the secondary payor , we will review claims for your prescription drug costs that are not covered by Medicare Part D and consider them for payment under the FEHB plan. Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part B) This health plan do es not coordinate its prescription drug benefits with Medicare Part B . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 138 Section 9 Medicare always makes the final determination as to whether they are the primary payor . The following chart illustrates whether Medicare or this Plan should be the primary payor for you according to your employment status and other factors determined by Medicare. It is critical that you tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage so we can administer these requirements correctly . (Having coverage under more than two health plans may change the order of benefits determined on this chart.) Primary Payo r Chart A.

Your physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than they could bill you if you had Medicare. You and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and non -physician based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply. The following chart has m ore information about the limits. If you: are age 65 or over; and do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage. (Your employing office can tell you if this applies.) Then, for your inpatient hospital car e: The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the \"equivalent Medicare amount\" - set by Medicare' s rules for what Medicare would pay, not on the actual charge. You are responsible for your deductible (Standard Option only), coinsurance, or copayments under this Plan. You are not responsible for any charges greater than the equivalent Medicare amount; we will show that amount on the explanation of benefits (EOB) form that we send you. The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the equivalent Medicare amount. And, for your physician care, the law requires us to base our paym ent and your applicable coinsurance or copayment on: an amount set by Medicare and called the \"Medicare approved amount,\" or the actual charge if it is lower than the Medicare approved amount. If your physicia n: Then you are responsible fo r: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment for the claim and is in our Preferred network Standard Option: your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Basic Option: your copayments and coinsurance. Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment and is not in our Preferred network Standard Option: your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, and any balance up to the Medicare approved amount. Basic Option: all charges. Does not participate with Medicare, and is in our Preferred network Standard Option: your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments, and any balance up to 115% of the Medicare approved amount. Basic Option: your copayments and coinsurance, and any balance up to 115% of the Medicare approved amount. Note: In many cases, your payment will be less because of our Preferred agreements. Contact your Local Plan for information about what your specific Preferred provider can collect from you. Does not participate with Medicare and is not in our Preferred network Standard Option: your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any balance up to 115% of the Medicare approved amount. Basic Option: all charges. It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare. Such physicians are permitted to collect only up to the Medicare approved amount. Our explanation of benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you. If your physic ian or hospital trie s to collect more than allowed by law, ask the physician or hospital to reduce the charges. If you have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund. If you need further assistance, call us. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 140 Section 9 When you have the Original Medicare Plan (Part A, Part B, or both) We limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay under Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance), regardless of whether Medicare pays. Note: We pay our reg ular benefits for emergency services to a facility provider, such as a hospital, that does not participate with Medicare and is not reimbursed by Medicare. We use the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medicare- equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) when the MRA statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services provided to you if Medicare is primary, when Medicare does not pay the VA facility. If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary, your out -of-pocket costs for services that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare assignment for the claim. If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, then you pay nothing for covered charges (see note below fo r Basic Option). If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, then you pay the difference between the \"limiting charge\" or the physician's charge (whichever is less) and our payment combined with Medicare's payment (see note below for Basic Option). Note: Under Basic Option, you must see Preferred providers in order to receive benefits. See page 21 for the exceptions to th is requirement. It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not bill you for more than 115% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the \"limiting charge.\" The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) form that y ou receive from Medicare will have more information about the limiting charge. If your physician tries to collect more than allowed by law, ask the physician to reduce the charges. If the physician does not, report the physician to the Medicare carrier t hat sent you the MSN form. Call us if you need further assistance. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 141 Section 10 Section 10.

Cost -sharing Cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out -of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Covered services Services we provide benefits for, as described in this brochure. Custodial or long term care Facility -based care that does not require access to the full spectrum of services performed by licensed health care professionals that is available 24 hours -a-day in acute inpatient hospital settings to avoid imminent, serious, medical or psychiatric consequences. By \"facility -based,\" we mean services provided in a hospital, long term care facility, extended care facility, skilled nursing facility, residential tre atment facility, school, halfway house, group home, or any other facility providing skilled or unskilled treatment or services to individuals whose conditions have been stabilized. Custodial or long term care can also be provided in the patient's home, ho wever defined. Custodial or long term care may include services that a person not medically skilled could perform safely and reasonably with minimal training , or that mainly assist the patient with daily living activities, such as: 1. Personal care, including help in walking, getting in and out of bed, bathing, eating (by spoon, tube, or gastrostomy), exercising, or dressing; 2. Homemaking, such as preparing meals or special diets; 3. Moving the patient; 4. Acting as companion or sitter; 5. Supervising medication that can usually be self -administered; or 6. Treatment or services that any person can perform with minimal instruction, such as recording pulse, temperature, and respiration; or administration and monitoring of feeding systems. We do not provide benefits for custodial or long term care, regardless of who recommends the care or where it is provided. The Carrier, its medical staff, and/or an independent medical review determine which services are custodial or long term care. Deductible A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies in a calendar year before we start paying benefits for those services. See page 27. Diagnostic service An examination or test of an individ ual with signs, symptoms, or a probability of having a specific disease to determine the presence of that disease; or an examination or test to evaluate the course of treatment for a specific disease. Durable medical equipment Equipment and supplies that: 1. Are prescribed by your physician (i.e., the physician who is treating your illness or injury); 2. Are medically necessary; 3. Are primarily and customarily used only for a medical purpose; 4. Are generally useful only to a person with an illness or injury; 5. Are designed for prolonged use; and 6. Serve a specific therapeutic purpose in the treatment of an illness or injury. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 143 Section 10 Experimental or investigational services Experimental or investigational shall mean: a. A drug, device, or biological product that cannot be lawfully marketed without approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and approval for marketing has not been given at the time it is furnished; or b. Reliable evidence shows that the health care service (e.g., procedure, treatment, supply, device, equipment, drug, biological product) is the subject of ongoing phase I, II, or III clinical trials or under study to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, its e fficacy, or its efficacy as compared with the standard means of treatment or diagnosis; or c. Reliable evidence shows that the consensus of opinion among experts regarding the health care service (e.g., procedure, treatment, supply, device, equipment, drug, biological product ) is that further studies or clinical trials are necessary to determine its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, its efficacy, or its efficacy as compared with the standard means of treatment or diagnosis ; or d. Reliable evidence shows that the health care service (e.g., procedure, treatment, supply, device, equipment, drug, biological product) does not improve net health outcome, is not as beneficial as any established alternatives, or does not produce improvement outside of the research setting. Reliable evidence shall mean only evidence published in peer -reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community and physician specialty society recommendations, such as : a. Published reports and articles in the authoritative medical and scientific literature; b. The written protocol or protocols used by the treating facility or the protocol(s) of another facility studying substantially the same drug, device, or biological product or medical treatme nt or procedure; or c. The written informed consent used by the treating facility or by another facility studying substantially the same drug, device, or biological product or medical treatment or procedure. Generic alternative A generic alternative is an FDA -approved generic drug in the same class or group of drugs as your brand -name drug. The therapeutic effect and safety profile of a generic alternative are similar to your brand -name drug, but it has a different active ingredient. Generic equivalent A generic equivalent is a drug whose active ingredients are identical in chemical composition to those of its brand- name counterpart. Inactive ingredients may not be the same. A generic drug is considered \"equivalent,\" if it has been approved by the FDA as interchangeable with your brand - name drug. Group health coverage Health care coverage that you are eligible for based on your employment, or your membership in or connection with a particular organization or group, that provides payment for medical servi ces or supplies, or that pays a specific amount of more than $200 per day for hospitalization (including extension of any of these benefits through COBRA). Health care professional A physician or other health care professional licensed, accredited, or cer tified to perform specified health services consistent with state law. See pages 18-19 for information about how we determine which health care professionals are covered under this Plan. Health Risk Assessment (HRA) A questionnaire designed to assess your overall health and identify potential health risks. Service Benefit Plan members have access to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield HRA (called the \"Blue Health Assessment\") which is supported by a computerized program t hat analyzes your health and lifestyle information and provides you with a personal and confidential health action plan that is protected by HIPAA privacy and security provisions . Results from the Blue Health Assessment include practical suggestions for m aking healthy changes and important health information you may want to discuss with your health care provider . For more information, visit our Web site, www.fepblue.org . 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 144 Section 10 Intensive outpatient care A comprehensive, structured outpatient treatment program that includes extended periods of individual or group therapy sessions designed to assist members with mental health and/or substance abuse conditions. It is an intermediate setting between traditional outpatient therapy and partial hospitalization, typically performed in an outpatient facility or outpatient professional office setting. Program sessions may occur more than one day per wee k. Timeframes and frequency will vary based upon diagnosis and severity of illness. Local Plan A Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan that serves a specific geographic area. Medical foods The term medical food, as defined in S ection 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is \" a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. \" In general, to be considered a medical food, a product must, at a minimu m, meet the following criteria: the product must be a food for oral or tube feeding; the product must be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease, or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements; and the product must be intended to be used under medical supervision. Medically u nderserved areas (MUAs) Each year, OPM determines which states are \"medically underserved\" using criteria established by Federal regulation. These are states in which 25 percent or more of the residents are located in areas with a shortage of p rimary medi cal care providers. For 2014, the states are: Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming. Under this Plan, coverage of medical practitioners is not determined by yo ur state's designation as a Medically Underserved Area (MUA). We cover any licensed medical practitioner for covered services performed within the scope of that license, as required by Section 2706(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). See pages 18-19 for more information. Medical necessity All benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions in this brochure and are payable only when we determine that the criteria for medical necessity are met. Medical necessity shall mean health care services that a physician, hospital, or other covered professional or facility provider, exercising prudent clinical judgment, would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, evaluating, diagnosing, or treating an illness, injury, dis ease, or its symptoms, and that are: a. In accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice in the United States; and b. Clinically appropriate, in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; and considered effective for the patient's illness, injury, disease, or its symptoms; and c. Not primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician , or other health care pr ovider , and not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent therapeutic or diagnostic results for the diagnosis or treatment of that patient's illness, injury, or disease, or its symptoms; and d. Not part of or associated with scholastic education or vocational training of the patient; and e. In the case of inpatient care, only provided safely in the acute inpatient hospital setting. For these purposes, \"generally accepted standards of medical practice\" means standards that are based on credible scientific evidence published in peer -reviewed medical literature generally recognized by the relevant medical community and physician specialty society recommendations. The fact that one of our covered physicians, hospitals, or other professional or facility providers has prescribed, recommended, or approved a service or supply does not, in itself, make it medically necessary or covered under this Plan. Mental conditions/ substance abuse Conditions and diseases listed in the most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as psychoses, neurotic disorders, or personality disorders; other nonpsychotic mental disorders listed in the ICD; or disorders listed in the ICD requiring treatment for abuse of, or dependence upon, substances such as alcohol, narcotics, or hallucinogens. Never Events Errors in medical care that are clearly identi fiable, preventable, and serious in their consequences, such as surgery performed on a wrong body part, and specific conditions that are acquired during your hospital stay, such as severe bed sores. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 145 Section 10 Observation services Hospital outpatient services ordered by the physician to assess whether the member needs to be admitted as an inpatient or can be discharged. If you are in the hospital more than a few hours, always ask your physician or the hospital staff if your stay is considered inpatient or outp atient. Although you may stay overnight in a hospital room and receive meals and other hospital services, some hospital services - including \" observation services \" - are actually outpatient care. Since observation services are billed as outpatient care, outpatient facility benefit levels apply and your out-of-pocket expenses may be higher as a result. Partial hospitalization An intensive facility -based treatment program during which an interdisciplinary team provides care related to mental health and/or substance abuse conditions. Program sessions may occur more than one day per week and may be full or half days, evenings, and/or weekends. The duration of care per session is less than 24 hours. Timeframes and frequency will vary based upon diagnosis and severity of illness. Plan allowance Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your cost -share for covered services. Fee -for-service plans determine their allowances in different ways. If the amount your provider bills for covered services is less than our allowance, we base your share (coinsurance, deductible, and/or copayments), on the billed amount. We determine our allowa nce as follows: PPO providers - Our allowance (which we may refer to as the \"PPA\" for \"Preferred Provider Allowance\") is the negotiated amount that Preferred providers (hospitals and other facilities, physicians, and other covered health care professionals that contract with each local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, and retail pharmacies that contract with CVS Caremark) have agreed to accept as payment in full, when we pay primary benefits. Our PPO allowance includes any known discounts that can be accurately calculated at the time your claim is processed. For PPO facilities, we sometimes refer to our allowance as the \"Preferred rate.\" The Preferred rate may be subject to a periodic adjustment after your claim is processed that may decrease or increase the amount of our payment that is due to the facility. However, your cost -sharing (if any) does not change. If our payment amount is decreased, we credit the amount of the decrease to the reserves of this Plan. If our payment amount is increased, we pay that cost on your behalf. (See page 1 13 for special information about limits on the amounts Preferred dentists can charge you under Standard Option.) Participating providers - Our allowance (which we may refer to as the \"PAR\" for \"Participating Provider Allowance\") is the negotiated amount that these providers (hospitals and other facilities, physicians, and other covered health care professi onals that contract with some local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans) have agreed to accept as payment in full, when we pay primary benefits. For facilities, we sometimes refer to our allowance as the \"Member rate.\" The member rate includes any known discounts that can be accurately calculated at the time your claim is processed, and may be subject to a periodic adjustment after your claim is processed that may decrease or increase the amount of our payment that is due to the facili ty. However, your cost -sharing (if any) does not change. If our payment amount is decreased, we credit the amount of the decrease to the reserves of this Plan. If our payment amount is increased, we pay that cost on your behalf. Non-participating prov iders - We have no agreements with these providers to limit what they can bill you for their services. This means that using Non- participating providers could result in your having to pay significantly greater amounts for the services you receive. We determine our allowance as follows: For inpatient services at hospitals, and other facilities that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan (\"Non- member facilities\"), our allowance is based on the average amount paid nationally on a per day basis to contracting and non- contracting facilities for covered room, board, and ancillary charges for your type of admission. If you would like additional information, or to obtain the current allowed amount, please call the customer service number on the back of your ID card. For inpatient stays resulting from medical emergencies or accidental injuries, or for routine deliveries, our allowance is the billed amount; 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 146 Section 10 For outpatient, non -emergency surgical services at hospitals and other facilities that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan (\"Non -member facilities\"), our allowance is the average amount for all outpatient surgical claims combined that we pay nationally to contracting and non -contracting facilities. This allowance applies to all of the covered surgical services billed by the hospital and is the same regardless of the type of surgery performed. If you plan on using a Non -member hospital, or other Non -member facility, for your outpatient s urgical procedure, please call us before your surgery at the customer service number on the back of your ID card to obtain the current allowed amount and assistance in estimating your total out -of-pocket expenses. Please keep in mind that Non -member faci lities may bill you for any difference between the allowance and the billed amount. You may be able to reduce your out -of-pocket expenses by using a Preferred hospital for your outpatient surgical procedure. To locate a Preferred provider, go to www.fepblue.org and select \"Provider Directory\" to use our National Doctor & Hospital Finder, or call us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card; For other outpatient services by Non -member facilities, an d for outpatient surgical services resulting from a medical emergency or accidental injury that are billed by Non -member facilities, our allowance is the billed amount (minus any amounts for noncovered services); For physicians and other covered health c are professionals that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan, our allowance is equal to the greater of 1) the Medicare participating fee schedule amount or the Medicare Part B Drug Average Sale Price (ASP) for the service, drug, o r supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained (or 60% of the billed charge if there is no equivalent Medicare fee schedule amount or ASP) or 2) 100% of the Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) amount for the service or supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained. Local Plans determine the UCR amount in different ways. Contact your Local Plan if you need more information. We may refer to our allowance for Non -participating providers as the \"NPA\" (for \"Non -participating Provider Allowance\"); For emergency medical services performed in the emergency department of a hospital provided by physicians and other covered health care professionals that do not contract with your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Pla n, our allowance is equal to the greatest of 1) the Medicare participating fee schedule amount or the Medicare Part B Drug Average Sale Price (ASP) for the service, drug, or supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained; or 2) 100% of the Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) amount for the service or supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained; or 3) an allowance based on equivalent Preferred provider services that is calculated in compliance with the Affordab le Care Act; For prescription drugs furnished by retail pharmacies that do not contract with CVS Caremark, our allowance is the average wholesale price (\"AWP\") of a drug on the date it is dispensed, as set forth by Medi -Span\u00ae in its national drug data file; and For services you receive outside of the United States , Puerto Rico , and the U.S. Virgin Islands from providers that do not cont ract with us or with AXA Assistance, we use our Overseas Fee Schedule to determine our allowance. Our fee schedule is based on a percentage of the amounts we allow for Non -participating providers in the Washington, DC, area. Important notice about Non-participating providers! Note: Using Non -participating or Non -member providers could result in your having to pay significantly greater amounts for the services you receive. Non -participating and Non-member providers are under no obligation to accept our allowance as payment in full. If you use Non- participating and/or Non -member providers, you will be responsible for any difference between our payment and the billed amount (except in certain circumstances involving covered Non- participating professiona l care - see page 147). In addition, you will be responsible for any applicable deductible, coinsurance, or copayment. You can reduce your out - of-pocket expenses by using Preferred providers whenever possible. To locate a Preferred provider, go to www.fepblue.org and select \"Provider Directory\" to use our National Doctor & Hospital Finder, or call us at the customer service number on the back of your ID card. We encourage you to always use Preferred providers fo r your care. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 147 Section 10 Note: For certain covered services from Non -participating professional providers, your responsibility for the difference between the Non -participating Provider Allowance (NPA) and the billed amount may be limited. In only those situations listed below, when the difference between the NPA and the billed amount for covered Non -participating professional care is greater than $5,000 for an episode of care, your responsibility will be limited to $5,000 (in a ddition to any applicable deductible, coinsurance, or copayment amounts). An episode of care is defined as all covered Non -participating professional services you receive during an emergency room visit, an outpatient visit, or a hospital admission (includ ing associated emergency room or pre -admission services), plus your first follow -up outpatient visit to the Non -participating professional provider(s) who performed the service(s) during your hospital admission or emergency room visit. When you receive care in a Preferred hospital from Non -participating professional providers such as a radiologist , anesthesiologist, certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA), pathologist, neonatologist, or pediatric sub -specialist; and the professional providers are hospital -based or are specialists recruited from outside the hospital either without your knowledge and/or because they are needed to provide immediate medical or surgical expertise; and When you receive care from Non -participating professional providers in a Preferred, Member, or Non-member hospital as a result of a medical emergency or accidental injury (see pages 90-93). For more information, see Differences between our allowance and the bill in Section 4. For more information about how we pay providers overseas, see page 31 and pages 1 21-122. Post-service claims Any claims that are not pre- service claims. In other words, post -service claims are those claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to apply for benefits. Precertification The requirement to contact the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan serving the area where the services will be performed before being admitted to the hospital for inpatient care, or within two business days following an emergency admission. Preferred provider organization (PPO) arrangement An arrangement between Local Plans and physicians, hospitals, health care institutions, and other covered health care professionals (or for retail pharmacies, between pharmacies and CVS Caremark) to provide services to you at a reduced cost. The PPO provides you with an opportuni ty to reduce your out -of-pocket expenses for care by selecting your facilities and providers from among a specific group. PPO providers are available in most locations; using them whenever possible helps contain health care costs and reduces your out -of-pocket costs. The selection of PPO providers is solely the Local Plan's (or for pharmacies, CVS Caremark's) responsibility.

These programs may include drug and alcohol treatment, confidence buildi ng, military -style discipline, and psychological counseling. Many of the programs are intended to provide a less -restrictive alternative to incarceration or hospitalization, or to offer intervention for troubled individuals. RTC programs are often design ed to treat children and adolescents and have been described in a variety of ways, including \"therapeutic boarding schools,\" \"behavioral modification facilities,\" \"emotional growth camps.\" No standardized definitions exist for RTCs or for the programs they administer. RTC programs are not regulated by the Federal government. Although some RTCs may meet state licensing requirements and standards, certain types of residential facilities are exempt from licensing or monitoring by the state. Accreditation of these facilities, their clinicians, and staff members varies significantly from state to state. Benefits are not available for services performed or billed by RTCs. If you have questions about treatment at an RTC, please contact us at the customer service number listed on the back of your ID card.

Urgent care claims usually involve Pre- service claims and not Post -service claims. We will judge whether a claim is an urgent care claim by applying the judgment o f a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. If you believe your claim qualifies as an urgent care claim, please contact our customer service department using the number on the back of your Service Benefit Plan ID card and tell us the claim is urgent. You may also prove that your claim is an urgent care claim by providing evidence that a physician with knowledge of your medical condition has determined that your claim involves urgent care.

Other Federal Programs Please note, the following programs are not part of your FEHB benefits. They are separate Federal programs that complement your FEHB benefits and can potentially reduce your annual out -of-pocket expenses. These programs are offered independent of the FEHB Program an d require you to enroll separately with no government contribution. Important information about three Federal programs that complement the FEHB Program First, the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program , also known as FSAFEDS, lets you set aside pre- tax money from your salary to reimburse you for eligible dependent care and/or health care expenses. You pay less in taxes so you save money. Participating employees save an average of about 30% on products and services they routinely pay for out -of-pocket. Second, the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) provides comprehensive dental and vision insurance at competitive group rates. There are several plans from which to choose. Under FEDVIP you may choose self only, self plus one, or self and family coverage for yourself and any eligible dependents. Third, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) can help cover long term care costs, which are not covered under the FEHB Program. The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program - FSAFEDS What is an FSA? It is an account where you contribute money from your salary BEFORE taxes are withheld, then incur eligible expenses and get reimbursed. You pay less in taxes so you save money. Ann uitants are not eligible to enroll. There are three types of FSAs offered by FSAFEDS. Each type has a minimum annual election of $250. The maximum annual election for a health care flexible spending account (HCFSA) or a limited expense health care spendi ng account (LEX HCFSA) is $2,500 per person . The maximum annual election for a dependent care flexible spending account (DCFSA) is $5,000 per household. Health Care FSA (HCFSA) - Reimburses you for eligible health care expenses (such as copayments, deduct ibles, insulin, product s, physician- prescribed over-the-counter drugs and medications , vision and dental expenses, and much more) for you and your tax dependents , including adult children (through the end of the calendar year in which they turn 26) which are not covered or reimbursed by FEHBP or FEDVIP coverage or any other insurance. Note: If you are enrolled in the HCFSA, you can take advantage of the Paperless Reimbursement option, which allows you to be reimbursed from your HCFSA without submitting an FSAFEDS claim. When the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan receives a claim for benefits, the Plan forwards information about your out -of-pocket expenses (such as copayment and deductible amounts) to FSAFEDS for processing. FSAFEDS th en reimburses you for your eligible out -of-pocket costs - there's no need for a claim form or receipt! Reimbursement is made directly to your bank from your HCFSA account via Electronic Funds Transfer. You may need to file a paper claim to FSAFEDS in cer tain situations . Visit www.FSAFEDS.com for more information . FSAFEDS is not part of the Service Benefit Plan. Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA) - Designed for employees enrolled in or covered by a High Ded uctible Health Plan with a Health Savings Account. Eligible expenses are limited to dental and vision care expenses for you and your tax dependents , including adult children (through the end of the calendar year in which they turn 26) which are not covere d or reimbursed by FEHBP or FEDVIP coverage or any other insurance. Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA) - Reimburses you for eligible non- medical day care expenses for your child(ren) under age 13 and/or for any person you claim as a dependent on your Federal Income Tax return who is mentally or physically incapable of self -care. You (and your spouse if married) must be working, looking for work (income must be earned during the year), or attending school full -time to be eligible for a DCFSA. If you are a new o r newly eligible employee, you have 60 days from your hire date to enroll in an HCFSA or LEX HCFSA and/or DCFSA, but you must enroll before October 1. If you are hired or become eligible on or after October 1, you must wait and enroll during the Federal Benefits Open Season held each fall. 2014 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan 151 Section 11 Where can I get more information about FSAFEDS?

The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program - FLTCIP It's important protection The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) can help pay for the potentially high cost of long term care services, which are not covered by FEHB plans. Long term care is help you receive to perform activities of daily livin g - such as bathing or dressing yourself - or supervision you receive because of a severe cognitive impairment such as Alz heimer's disease. For example, long term care can be received in your home from a home health aide, in a nursing home, in an assisted living facility, or in adult day care . To qualify for coverage under the FLTCIP, you must apply and pass a medical screening (called underwriting). Federal and U.S. Postal Service employees and annuitants, active and retired members of the uniformed services, and qualified relatives are eligible to apply. Certain medical conditions, or combinations of conditions, will prevent some people from being approved for coverage. You must apply to know if you will be approved for enrollment.
