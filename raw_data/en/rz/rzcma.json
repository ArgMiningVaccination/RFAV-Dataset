Are there any home remedies to treat it? Fungal infection in the nails are usually caused due to a specific kind of fungus and the condition is called Onychomycosis. In this condition your nail becomes brittle, turns yellowish or blackish in colour and in some instances may also emit a foul odour. In most cases a doctor will first test the nail for the type of fungus causing the infection with the help of a microscopic examination and anti fungal drug sensitivity tests. He/she will then prescribe anti fungal medication that you will have to take orally and topically (by applying the medication on the affected nail). You will also have to undergo regular tests to check if the infection has subsided.

Henna has very powerful astringent and anti fungal properties that help clear out the infection from the root. To use this remedy, grind some fresh henna leaves, add the juice of half a lemon and some turmeric to the mixture. Now, mix it well and apply this paste to the affected nail just before you go to sleep. You may choose to wrap a cloth around the area to prevent the paste from drying and falling off. Wash off the paste the next morning. This should be done regularly in order to see good results. Sulphur: Also known as Gundhak in Ayurveda, is a great remedy for fungal infections and scabies.
