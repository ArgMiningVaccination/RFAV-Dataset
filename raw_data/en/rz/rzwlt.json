[Learn more](/excursions) Gangotri Located deep in the Himalayas, Gangotri is the seat of the goddess Ganga and origin of the sacred river Ganga. For thousands of years, yogis have aspired to absorb the sacred energy of the Ganga at its source, and receive the blessings of the immortal masters whose vibrations pervade the entire region. Gomukh A scenic trek beyond Gangotri leads to the Gomukh Glacier, the Ganga's source. Along the way, the trail passes through blue pine forests in Chirbasa, alpine meadows, and boulder fields, all the while being embraced by the towering peaks of Mounts Shivling and Meru and the flowing Bhagirathi River. Uttarkashi Uttarkashi literally means \"North Kashi (Varanasi),\" and is a shrine considered as sacred as Varanasi. Situated on the banks of the Bhagirathi River, it is the gateway to the shrines hidden deeper in the Himalayas, and renowned as the home of the sage Renuka, mother of the legendary sage Parashurama. Yamunotri Perched in the verdant mountains to the west of Gangotri, Yamunotri attracts pilgrims seeking the source of the sacred Yamuna River. Traditionally, aspirants seek the blessing of goddess Yamuna, a spiritual counterpart of the Ganga, before continuing their pilgrimage to Gangotri. Mussoorie This hill station, overlooking the Doon Valley, sits in the foothills of the Himalayas with the snowy peaks visible in the distance.
