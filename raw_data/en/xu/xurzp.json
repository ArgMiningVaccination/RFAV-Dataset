If your child is over the age of 5, they will receive two doses separated by 17 to 28 days followed by a booster dose five months later. Appointments for all doses will be scheduled at the same time. If your child over age 5 has not gotten a booster dose and it has been at least five months since their second dose, call to schedule an appointment.
