Maintain your body weight in recommended interval (for adults BMI 18.5 - 25, waist circumference in women less than 80 cm, in men no more than 94 cm) Practice regular physical activity (protective effect on the health is seen in at least 30 minutes of continuous walking), source: IOTF Eat variety of fruits and vegetables, minimum 400 g daily, preferably fresh and of local origin. Don't drink tea during the plant meals rich in iron (e.g. vegetables, legumes), because tea limits the availability of non- hem iron. Control the fat intake, decrease the consumption of fatty foods (e.g. fatty cheese, chocolates, chips etc.) and prefer plant oils to animal fats. Eat and drink low -fat milk and milk products with low content of salt. Eat breads, cereals and pasta, preferably whole- grain and the rice several times a day. Replace the fatty meat and meat products by legumes, fish and chicken and low -fat meat. If you drink alcoholic beverages, limit your daily amount of alcohol to 20 g (e.g. 200- 250 ml of wine) Limit your salt intake; don't put additional salt to your meals. Total daily intake should not exceed 5 g (1 tea spoon), incl. -hidden salt. Use only iodized salt. Choose foods with low content of s ugar, limit consumption of sweets. Sweet drinks replace by sufficient amount of non- sweet liquids, e.g. boiled water. Prepare your meals according to hygienic recommendation, save the food under safety conditions. Support exclusively breastfeeding up to 6t h month and then breastfeeding plus complementary feeding up to 2 years of age. Eating is one of the life's great pleasures, which is based on people on peoples' tradition, cultures and environment. People eat according to their appetite and financial availability. They consume the food that they give preference to. Diet must be correspondent to the required energy in human's body, which is based on its growth, age, body -weight, living conditions, work, climate, human's physiological conditions (pregnancy breast -eating). Human body, according to its physiological requirements must be ensured with the defined amount and proportion of nutrients . Food must be safe for people and distributed during the day. Hypocrite's words are modern even nowadays: \"Let your diet be your medicine, and your food will be your remedy\". It's beyond doubt that nutrition plays a major role in human's health. Whole series of chronic diseases can be avoided by eating right food (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, problems caused by the lack of iodine and other micronutrients, osteoporosis, obesity, oral diseases and others), the rate of which about 60% of total death. 3 What is healthy eating and how to achieve it? There are principles of healthy nutrition, fulfillment of whic h regulates humans eating conditions, so defines those food products and daily portions, which will have anly good effects on human's health and provides with needed energy and nutrients. # Food groups Specification of 1 standard serving Recommended portions per day Amount of recommended portions per day (in grams) 1 Cereals (Breads, rolls, pasta, rice) P B. 1. bread(60g); 1 roll cooked rice or pasta 1/2cup of porridge (125g) 5-6 500-600 2 Vegetables (Except potatoes ) 1 pepper 2 carrots or tomatoes a small bowl of raw leafy vegetables or mixed vegetable salad 3-5 400-500 3 Potatoes \u00bd1/2 plate of potatoes (100g) 300-400 5 Milk and dairy products (with reduced amount of fats) a cup of milk (250 ml), 1/2 cup o yogurt , sour milk - (125ml), a piece of cheese (30g) 2-3 200-300 6 Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes cooked lean meat, poultry or fish - 80g, 1 egg - 1/4 cup of beans 1-3 150-200 7 Sweets 25g chocolate half piece of cake 1 lump of sugar 20g of jam 1-2 20-25 8 Fats Plant oils 1 t/s 10g of plant oil Margarine _ 15 g Animal fats - 10 g 1 10-15 Eat the balanced diet based more on the food of plant than animal origin. Plant contains a lot of biologically active substances, metabolites, which have been used in medicines since ancient times. Metabolites protect human body from chronic diseases (cancers, heart diseases and others) Most fruits and vegetables and as well as grains: breads, cereals contain fibers; Corns, beans, sunflowers contain phytosterins, huts and berries - lignas, onion, lettuce, tomato's, cabbage - glucisinolats, grapes, strawberries, phenols, citrus, cherry, greans -terpins. For ensuring human body with these nutrients it's necessary to eat various fruits and vegetables regularly. 2. Eat breads, cereals and pasta, preferably whole- grain and the rice several times a day. The amount this product should be equal to which is reco mmended by health orgs. 4 The amount of one portion is 60- 100g. Grains provide human body with needed and are rich with nutrients: carbohydrates (especially starch), fibers, minerals (Ca, K, Mg and other), but there are proteins too. Eat 5 -8 portions of var ious fruits and vegetables a day. Better to them raw. The amount of portion is equal to 100g fruit and 100g vegetables. Why are fruits and vegetables important for humans' health? Fruits and vegetables contain vitamins, microelements fibers and other ndi spensable nutrients in huge amounts. Soluble nutritional fibers ensure fats modification and regulate the level of cholesterol and sugar in blood. Raw fruits and vegetables prevent human body from obesity, because they contain fats and energy in small amounts. Fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants (carotenes, vitamins C, E) lack of which causes high risk of heart diseases and cancers. Taking vitamin C with iron rich products (legume, cabbage, greens, spinach) assists its absorption in human body, which decreases the risk of anemia. If you take with the food mentioned above red meat, liver, fish, it will help absorption of iron by human body. Fruits and vegetables except iron contain also other microelements and minerals, as K, Mg, Ca, which decreases the risk of hypertension. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamins of group B, and folic acid. It is widely known that folic acid place an important role in the prevention of anemia and in the development of neurotic system of the baby. It is recommended for t he women at their early age and in the beginning of the pregnancy to take food rich in folic acid. The best source of the folic acid is red legume lentil beans groundnut, soybean and bread, citrus, liver, vegetables (spinach, cabbage and etc.) Before being preserved fruits and vegetables pay attention to the labels, as they should contain minimal amount of sugar, salt and fats. Dietary fiber Long heralded as part of a healthy diet, fiber appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. Despite what many people may think, however, fiber probably has little, if any effect on colon cancer risk. Fiber is an important part of a healthy diet, and you should get a least the mini mum recommended amount of 20- 35 grams of dietary fiber per day for adults. For children over age 2, the recommended intake is the child's age + 5 grams. The best sources are fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, and whole -grain foods. You can eas ily achieve 30 grams of fiber each day by eating 3 servings of fruit, 3 servings of vegetables, 2 servings of whole grain foods, and 1 serving of legumes, such as lentils, kidney, black and lima beans. To achieve 35 grams of fiber, eat 4 servings of fruit, 4 servings of vegetables, 4 servings of whole grain foods, and 1 serving of legumes. Antioxidants Our cells must constantly contend with nasty substances called free radicals. They can damage DNA, the inside or artery walls, and proteins in the eye --just about any substance or tissue imaginable. Some free radicals are made inside the body, inevitable by products of turning food into energy. Others come from the air we breathe and the food we eat. 5 We aren't defenseless against free radicals. We extract free- radical fighters, called antioxidants, from food. Fruits, vegetables, and other plant -based foods deliver dozens, if not hundreds, of antioxidants. The most common are vitamin C, vitamin E, beta- carotene and related carotenoids. Food also supplies mineral s such as selenium and manganese, which are needed by enzymes that destroy free radicals. Antioxidants were promoted as wonder agents that could prevent heart disease, cancer, cataracts, memory loss, and a host of other conditions. It's true that the pack age of antioxidants, minerals, fiber, and other substances found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains help prevent a variety of chronic diseases. 4. Stay on the recommended body weight by physical activity One of the aim of the physical activity is to keep human body's normal weight. It's proved that right dietary and some daily physical activities (about 30- 60 min) during a week are enough for healthy heart. And good regulation of the substances in human body and at the same time it is the best way for healthy heart and good regulation of the substances in human body and at the same time it the best way of preventing people from obesity. These recommendations are for those people who are physically less active, their profession can be one of the reasons (\"sedentary\" life style) or some other factores. Owner weight increases the risk of the development of diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, some cancers, arthritis and other diseases. Normal body mass index is shown in the chart and be BMI of 18,5 -24,9 is considered healthy for grownup people, which must be preserved by the systematic control of the body weight. BMI is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m 2). In Georgia from overweight suffers about 25- 30% of the population. The classification of overweight and obesity in adults according to BMI Kclassification Body mass index ( kg/m2) Risk of comorbitidies underweight <18,5 Low risk Normal range 18,5-24,9 average overweight > 25 Pre- obesite 25-29,9 increased Obese class I 30-34,9 Obese class II 35-39,9 severe Obese class III > 40 Very severe Note a) If you have any problems with health at first you have to consult with the doctor about physical activities. b) Keep right dietary principles while impressing physical activity and c) Stop smoking 6 5. Balance fats. Give preference to plant fats Fats provide ready source of energy for human body with indispensable fatty acids and fat -soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Too much fat increases the risk of heart diseases and overweight. Fats are groups of organic substances, which have more energy then proteins and carbohydrates. They consist of glycerin and fety acids. Saturated fats are those, which resist our body temperature, but those, which don't, are unsaturated. Saturated fats are animal fats, but unsaturated plan fats (90%). Too much saturated fats increase the amount of cholesterol in blood, which may cause the risk of: thrombosis (which may lead us to heart infarct, stroke) and also overweight and obesity. But the physiological value of plant oils (sunflower, corn, soybean, olive, oil and etc.) is high, which is caused by the existence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The decrease of these acids prevents human body from normal growing and has a bad i nfluence on human's health. They are decrease prevents the process of cholesterol circulation and helps to the development fats, some of them are essential for human body, as body is unable to synthesize them. World health organization recommends giving pr eference to plant oils. Fats and the risk of heart diseases. # Factor Source The influence on risks of heart diseases 1 Saturated fat Butter, ham, milk fat cheese meat, sausage the of oil Cocoas. The level of cholesterol and the density of lipoprotei ns are high. The risk of thrombosis is high 2 Polyunsaturated fat acids Omega -6 Corn, sunflower and the oil of sunflower The level of cholesterol and the density of lipoproteins is low in blood Omega -3 Fish fats and fats which are found in veget ables and nuts The level of cholesterol and density of lipoproteins is low. Its influence of ant thrombosis and antiarithmia is high 3 Monounsaturated fat acids Olive oil, canola oil, rasp oil Reduces the level of cholesterol in blood Reducing of the l evel of cholesterol (it may have an independent effect or take place of saturated fats acid after turning them out) Fats in moderation. Limiting the amount of fat, especially saturated fats in the diet but not cuting it out entirely is the best advice for a healthy diet. Most dietary recommendations are that less then 30% of the day's total calories should come from fat and less then 10% of the day's total calories should come. Fat distribution: apples and pears. 7 BMI dose not give us information about the total fat or how the fat is distributed in our body, which is important as abdominal excess of fat can have consequences in terms of health problems. A way to measure fat distribution is the circumference of the waist. Waist circumference is not connected with the height and provides a simple and practical method of identifying overweight. If waist circumference is greater than 94- 102 cm for men and 80 -88 cm for women. It means that they have excess abdominal fat even if they are BMI is about right. The wa ist circumference measurement divides people into two categories: individuals with an android fat distribution (often told \"apple shape\") meaning that most of their body fat is distributed around their stomach and chest and individuals with a gynoid fat di stribution (often called pear shape) meaning that the most of their body fat is distributed around their hips, things ? and bottom. Obese men are more likely to be \"apples\" while women are more likely to be \"pears\". It is clear that obesity is not always s imple a result of over insurgence in highly palatable foods or of a lack or physical activity. Overweight and obesity are influenced by many factors including hereditary tendencies, environmental and behavioral factors, aging, pregnancy and etc. However, dietary factor and physical activity strongly influence the energy balance equation and they are also the major modifiable factors. Indeed high fat dense- energy diets and sedentary lifestyles are the most associated with the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide. Conversely weight loss occurs when energy intake is less the energy expenditure over an extended period of time. A restricted calorie diet combined with increased physical activity is generally the advanced proffered by dieticians for loosing extra weight. Miracle or wonder diets that severely limit calories or restrict food groups should be avoided as they are often limiting in important nutrients and cannot be sustained for prolonged periods. They do not tech ? correct eating habits and can result in yoyo dieting (the gain and loss of weight in cycles resulting from dieting followed by overeating). This is so called yoyo dieting may be dangerous to long -term physical and mental health. Individuals should not be over ambitious with their goal setting as a loss of just 10% of initial weight while brings measurable health benefits. Change your menu- fat meat and meat products into legumes fish poultry meat or nonfat meat. Fish, poultry, eggs and legumes - you can take two portions a day. These pro ducts are the source of albumin and haem -iron. Fish is very useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is recommended to take legumes with non- fat meat and liver or fish, as these products are the best source of haem -iron. Try to eat red meat at about 100g a day. Iron is a very important microelement of human body. Iron deficiency causes the development of anemia. It's rate is high in Georgia. A man should take 10 mg iron a day, a woman 15mg, pregnant and breast - feeding women should tak e 30mg a day. Take milk and milk product 2 -3 portions a day. Try to use less salt and fat. Milk products contain Ca and protein. They are important for women, children and adults, especially for girls. It has an important role informing strong teeth and b ones. It also helps to substance circulation in the cell. Ca mainly in milk, sour -milk, cheese and not in cream and fat. One portion of milk product contains about 300mg Ca. for people who doesn't take or can't take milk or milk products, is recommended to use those products, which are rich in Ca. For example: dark green- vegetables, grains and others. Give preference to that product which contains less sugar, sweets, and replace sweet drinks with water. Sugar is dangerous for human's health, for e.g. it causes 8 dental caries. The more frequently you take product and drinks rich in sugar the higher is the risk of dental caries. For the prophylactics of your teeth brush them with the toothpaste containing fluorine and Ca. Sometimes products are made with artifi cial sugar. They don't cause the risk of dental caries and they contain less energy and calories. Much sugar also increases the risk of overweight. Drink sufficient amount of liquids. Grown -ups should take at least 1.5 L liquid, more during physical acti vity and in hot weather. Water is obviously a good source of liquid, Give preferences to the product with less salt You should take maximum 5gr or 1 teaspoon a day. Both the amount of added salt and hidden salt contained in processed food must also be taken into consideration. Much salt can cause the risk of hypertension. Awhile being the product pay attention to the label where the amount of salt will be shown. That product which contain much salt use in less amounts. Give preference to that product wit h less salt for e.g. vegetables and fruits. Try to use less salt in your meals. Don't put salt in your food automatically, first taste it! Give preference to iodized salt. 10. Reduce alcoholic drinks. Much alcoholic drink has a bad influence on humans' br ains, liver, heart, muscles, and neural system, dietary conditions. It prevents normal substance circulation in human's body. In bodies of those people who are dependent on alcoholic drinks grows the risk of the deficit of substances: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, vitamin C. magnum and zinc. Word health organization recommends taking no more then 2 portions of alcoholic drinks a day (alcohol must be maximum -20 g). It must halve for women. Chart 4 Kinds of drinks Standard portions (ml) The amoun t of alcohol (in grams) Beer (5%) 250 9.8 Wine (11%) 120 10.4 High alcoholic drinks (40%) 30 9.4 11. Prepare your meals according to hygienic recommendations, save food under safety conditions, reduce the amount of fats. Especially saturated fats . While preparing meals take next conditions into consideration: - Give preference to processed products. For eg: instead of raw milk use pasteurized milk - Remember that raw products e.g. egg, raw milk may be contamined with microorganisms. 9 - But after process ing (700C) the products microorganisms die. Meat and poultry should be unfroze before preparing meals - Prepare as mush food as you can eat, because after preserving them microorganisms appear in the food. - Protect meal saving conditions e.g.. Temperature. - Don't put newly prepared food into the refrigerator until it gets cooler. - Never preserve babies (breast milk) food. - Heat you meal again after preparing and cooling it on 700C to protect yourself from microbes. - Don't put products in ready meal as it can be di rty - Wash your hand before and after preparing meals. - Keep hygiene in your kitchen. - Protect your food from rodent and flies - While preparing meal and washing food product use clean water Support breast -feeding Word health organization recommends exclusive breast -feeding during the first 6 month. Breast -milk is the best source of vitamins, and also it place in important role in boosting immune function of the infant and protects his body from the infection. The basics for child and adolescent nutrition 1. Nutritional considerations within the first year of life 2. Nutritional considerations for toddlers (1- 3 years olds) 3. Nutritional considerations for school - aged children 4. Nutritional considerations for adolescents 4.1 Iron 4.2 Iodine 4.3 Calcium 4.4 Diet regime 4.5 Energy needs Child's nutrition plays an important role, as in development of physical and psychomotor system, so its body ability to resist environment, or form its immune system. During the body growth, development of different systems and tissues the role of nutrition i s very important especially for small children. Different stages of the life cycle dictate (require) differing nutrient needs. 1. Nutritional considerations within the first year of life Breast -feeding is the ideal form of feeding for new - born babies and i nfants. Human milk is an alive biological substance, which changes according to the child's needs. It provides all the essential substances, which change according to the child's needs. It provides all the essential substances in the best correlation for t he growth and development of the child. Human milk is not only easily available food; it also has a protective function. It contains lots of factors, which protect children from many infections, non- infection and allergic diseases. At the same time human m ilk plays an important role in boosting immune function. That's why breast - fed infants get ill more seldom than formula- fed babies. Human milk contains ferments, which help food- digestion in the intestines. It also contains hormones and growth factors, w hich provide all the system functions growth and development. On 10 the bases of the various researches it has been proved that breast -feeding provides child's intellectual (mental) development. At the same time it ensures normal chewing and mimic muscles dev elopment, which is very important for normal teething and speech development in the future. Breast -feeding is economical, safe and convenient. It doesn't require boiling and heating. Breast -feeding considerably ensures child's development. Baby's contact w ith its mother, comfortable environment, satisfying of sucking reflex, safety, wholesome food, ensuring development of each body function, immune nervous and endocrinal system development are exactly connected with breast -feeding. During the first few days after birth, colostrums the fluid is produced by the mammary gland. The chemical consistence of the colostrums is individual. The colostrums are different from the nature milk in the plenty of proteins and salt, and relatively small amount of sugar fats. It is very nutritious and satisfies baby's requirements. The amount of produced colostrums is equivalent to the baby's stomach. That's why it is not necessary adding of complementary fluids and food in the infant's nutrition. The colostrums protects baby f rom the deferent infections and allergy. It is very important for the infant in the period of the adaptation to the new environment, it is also practically the first vaccination of the infant. During the breast feeding baby should be fed according to its r equirements and not according the hours. We should feed infants as in the daytime, so at night. Night feeding ensures production of the milk. During the first week the number of meals should be 8- 12 times a day and night. Every 1- 1,5 month old baby will have already worked out its individual meal regimes. The duration of each meal is regulated by the baby itself and it can continue from 5 min. to 45 min. During the meal it is compulsory that baby emptied the whole milk from each mammary gland as the consist ence of the milk changes exactly during the mealtime. At the beginning of the meal, so called \"front\" milk is produced rich in proteins and protective substances and at the end of the meal so called \"back\" milk - rich in fats. If the baby is unable to empt y the whole milk it is advisable to milk the rest and add it with the spoon. During the first 6 months human milk meets all the requirements of the baby. The introduction of complementary foods by about completed 6 months is important. It is advisable to continue breast -feeding until 2 years of age. After 1 year human milk changes into colostrums again and protects the child from the infections. Breast -feeding is an optimal method of feeding of a one- year old child and prepared formula should be used only in strict medical conditions. For the artificial feeding so called formula, containing human milk is used. There are 2 types of formula: adaptive and unadaptive. Adaptive formula is a commercially prepared formula, which on the basis of special technologic al work, attempt to mimic as far as possible the composition of human milk. Unadaptive food products are: cow milk and sour milk with its mixture. There is no food identical to human milk. Though commercially prepared composition, so called formula is very close to human milk, than homemade food. Commercially prepared any kind of food composition is identical. It is made according to the international standards. Formula -fed babies should eat according to fixed hours. Intervals during the meals mustn't be l ess than 3 hours. At night 6- 8 hour interval is desirable. Infant formula must be prepared under strict hygiene conditions (washing hands before preparing formula, sterilization of bottles and etc.) Formula must be made newly before every meal. Food - rema ins mustn't be used for the next meal. Formula must be prepared exactly according to the instructions given on the label. 11 Natural cow's milk may cause some problems, that's why it must be mixed (130ml cow milk + 70 ml water + 2 t.sp. sugar) During the firs t year baby grows rapidly. It doubles its weight at the age of 5- 6 month and triples at the age of 1 year. Minimal weight increase mustn't be more than 500g during the first 6 months and less than 400g during the next 6 months. Height increase is 25 cm during the first year. For the measurement of baby's gains in height and weight, special standard growth charts are used, which makes possible estimation of child's dynamical development, ensures displaying and controlling problems in time. Situations where breastfeeding is contraindicated for medical reasons There are very few situations in which breastfeeding is contraindicated. 3These include: Infants with galactosaemia, a rare inborn error of metabolism. Infants born to mothers affected by HTLV I and II infections. WHO and UNAIDS currently estimate that a child breastfeeding from a mother who is HIV positive has a 15% risk of infection by this route. The situation has led in some settings to a loss of support for initiatives to prom ote breastfeeding and to some women avoiding breastfeeding even if they do not know their HIV status. It is, therefore, important that women be empowered to make fully informed decisions about infant feeding and that they be suitably supported in carrying them out. Counseling for women who are aware of their HIV status should include the best available information on the benefits of breastfeeding and on the risks of HIV transmission through breastfeeding. Counseling must include several infant - feeding optio ns for consideration by HIV -positive mothers (Replacement feeding with commercial or home- prepared formula; Breastfeeding in the way generally recommended; Breastfeeding exclusively and stopping early; Use of heat -treated expressed breast -milk; and Wet -nursing).In all cases there should be timely and adequate complementary feeding. Infants of mothers with HIV/AIDS where suitable replacement artificial infant formula is acceptable, feasible, affordable, safe and sustainable should not be breastfed. However, if suitable replacement feeding is not acceptable, feasible, affordable, safe and sustainable, and if a safe source of expressed breast milk is not available, the safest alternative is exclusive breastfeeding until the infant is four to six months of age and is developmentally ready to obtain its full nutrient requirement via complementary feeding. B. Situations where breastfeeding is temporarily contraindicated 1 Some viral diseases (herpes, varicella) can be transmitted to the baby and can cause very serio us illness, especially if the baby is preterm or otherwise immune- compromised. Infants whose mothers have an active herpes simplex lesion on the nipple or areola should not be breastfed from the affected breast until the lesion has cleared. The infant may feed from the other breast if it is unaffected, provided contact between the baby and the active lesions is prevented (i.e. by keeping the affected breast covered during feeding from the unaffected breast) and given the expressed breast milk from the affec ted side via cup or spoon. The same recommendation applies to mothers with active herpes zoster lesions (shingles). Varicella (chickenpox) 12 present up to five days before and two days after delivery can be transmitted to the infant in a severe form. The mot her should therefore be isolated during the contagious phase until lesions crust. Varicella- zoster immunoglobulin or standard immunoglobulin should be given to the infant as soon as possible. Breast milk should be expressed and given to the infant. Infants born to mothers with active untreated tuberculosis should not be breastfed until treatment is fully established and the mother is medically deemed to be no longer infectious. These infants should also receive appropriate immunization and chemoprophylaxis. Breast milk should be expressed and given to the infant, since infection is not spread through the milk. Where lactating mothers are receiving diagnostic or therapeutic radioactive isotopes, breastfeeding should be interrupted for a time equal to five hal f lives of the isotope used. Nearly all common health problems can be treated pharmacologically by drugs which are compatible with breastfeeding. Where lactating mothers are receiving antimetabolites or cyclospori ne, doxorubicin, such as monoaminooxidase inhibitors) should not breastfeed until these medications are discontinued and her breast milk is clear of these drugs. 124 C. Situations where breastfeeding is sometimes mistakenly thought to be contraindicated Everybody is today exposed t o environmental chemical agents. However, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risk associated with these environmental contaminants. Current levels of chemical residues in breast milk in Europe are within acceptable limits and do not justi fy recommending restrictions to breastfeeding or eliminating specific foods from maternal diets. A small amounts of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) have been detected in some samples of breast milk, But There is no evidence that breastfeeding increases the risk of mother to child transmission. Any risk of transmission associated with breast milk is negligible compared to the high risk of exposure to maternal blood and body fluids at birth. So Breastfeeding is not contraindicated for infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen- positive, mothers who are infected with hepatitis C virus (persons with hepatitis C virus antibody or hepatitis C virus -RNA -positive blood), mothers who are seropositive carriers of cytomegalovirus, and mothers who are febrile, unless fever is caused by a disease that contraindicates breastfeeding permanently or temporarily. HCV and HBsAg - positive mothers should consider abstaining from breast -feeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding. The vast majority of inf ants and young children who suffer from allergies or gastro- oesophageal reflux should continue breastfeeding and do not require special artificial formulae (e.g. Hypo Allergenic and Anti Reflux formulas). Mastitis is not a contraindication to breastfeeding ; on the contrary, effective milk removal from the breast is part of the recommended treatment. In addition, there is no evidence that babies who suck from an affected breast get infected. Mothers needing expert information on the above issues or any othe r related issues and mothers having breastfeeding difficulties of any kind should have ready access to consultations with trained and competent health workers or skilled lactation consultants. 13 When must be introduced complementary foods in baby's meal? During the first 6 month as breast milk, so formula are ideally suited to meet child's needs, but after 6 month it is necessary to introduce complementary solid foods rich in vitamins and micro- elements into baby's diet. It must be taken into consideration that introduction of complementary foods early reduces the amount of breast -milk and often causes problems with digestion. The introduction of complimentary of complimentary foods later is also harmful, as a child may have deficiency of necessary substanc es (micronutrients), which will be reflected in his health. In some specific cases complementary foods can be introduced earlier (4- 5 month). By the recommendation of the World health organization if 4- 5 month old child's weight drops behind and he shows i nterest in other foods, complementary foods can be introduced into baby's diet. As complementary food products, can be used foods, which are different from the milk and complement child's diet with various necessary substances, microelements and vitamins. The necessity of enrichment of child's ration is conditioned by the following factors: - Deficiency of energy and nutritional substances (proteins, Iron, calcium, zinc and other), which will be reflected in the child's growth, when breast -milk and formula can't meet child's increased requirements. - Introduction of half solid foods provide speech development - Active and stimulate intestines, chewing muscles, ferment processes. Fruit juices and purees are generally the first foods that are introduced into baby's diet, with vegetable purees, meat, biscuits and etc. Introduction of egg -whites, citruses, preserved honey is not recommended until the first year of age. The amount of every new food must be increased gradually. Two new kinds of food mustn't be introduced at the same time. The introduction of each new food is possible after it gets acquainted to the old one. Foods must be introduced with a spoon, not with a bottle. Food must be prepared before each meal under strict hygiene conditions. According to the consistency food must be homogeneous, in order not to cause difficulty in swallowing. Together with the growth children are introduced more and more solid foods in order to get gradually accustomed to the process of chewing. An important consideration in the first year of life is to introduce foods rich in iron as meat, yolk of egg, fish, beans, oats, buckwheat, apples and others. The deficiency of foods rich in iron causes anemia, which is the reason of child's frequent illnesses. Iron deficiency will be refl ected on child's mental development. 2. Nutritional consideration for toddlers (1 -3 years old) During these years a child develops its independence and tries to do everything itself: holds a spoon, eats food and drinks from the glass. It is true that gets dirty, moves a lot, but it plays an important role in the development of the child's movement. Parents should support this process. In this period they should help the child develop hygienic habits (washing hands, using of aprons and napkins and etc.) In view of the fact that children of this age grow quickly, are very active and consume much energy, they need a great variety of foods for their development. A child should eat four times a day. It is advisable to have snacks with fruits and biscuits during the intervals. It is not recommended consuming of over salted, sour, bitter or other flavoring foods. The food of a one- year-old child must be squeezed, chopped into small pieces, to make it easier for the child to swallow. 14 It is inadmissible to feed the child during the period of playing and running. During eating any kind of food a child must sit calmly. It is important to pay attention to the child. A child's increased or reduced appetite, also other problems connected with his diet is a natural phenomeno n at this age - he also tries to self -establish with his attitudes to the meals. - If a child refuses to eat and doesn't gain his weight consult a doctor - At this age child's weight increases by 2kg in every year, but 8- 10cm in height. 3. Nutritional considerat ion for pre- school and school -aged children. Nutrition of pre- school and school aged children differ as in amount, so in quality. At this age children eat family meals from the same table as other family members, though their requirement on the energy is higher than adults' which is caused by the intensity of substance change and the high rate of child's growth and development. A child's weight during 3- 7 years grows from 15 kg to 25 kg, height increases by 20- 30cm. At this age child's unbalanced, monotonous nutrition stops its growth and development and causes a risk to the growth and differentiation of various organs. Pre-school and school -aged children should eat four times a day. From 11 to 14 year olds it is allowed to eat 3 times a day like grown- ups. Tasty foods nicely laid table and food appearance are very important. Unpalatable foods with bad appearance and poorly laid table lose one's appetite and are a cause of a dietary failure. Consumption of some products is necessary daily, such as: bread, milk, meat, vegetables, fruits, and some - seldom (sour, cream, fish curds). Cereals, pasta, cooked potatoes, eggs, cheese are advisable for breakfast, but, meat and fish for dinner, for supper are recommended vegetables, cereals, milk, sour milk, curds, cheese. Greens can be used in huge amounts, but other seasonings such as pepper, horseradish and mustard in reduced amounts are recommended for adults. At this age children need to drink plenty of fluids, especially if it is hot or they are physically act ive. 4 Nutritional considerations for adolescents. The nutritional requirements of young people, especially at puberty (in 11- 15 years old girls, but in 13- 16 years old boys) are recommended to be diverse. So called the peak of growth takes plays at this ag e, which is followed by the adolescents' enormous appetite. Their nutrition should contain grains in enough quantity (bread), vegetables and fruits, milk-products and animal fats. Consumption of many fats is not recommended. Which will protect adolescent s from obesity and heart diseases in future; it is advisable to consume plant - oils. It is not recommended to consume much sugar. Less amount of sugar will ensure normal quantity of sugar in blood and protects adolescents from the risks of caries, obesity, and diabetes. It is necessary to work out right food habits: - To chew foods well - To eat slowly - To keep oneself off snacks (hamburger, hot -dog, chips and etc) It is important to follow hygiene - To wash hands before each meal - To wash fruits and vegetables be fore the meals. It is recommended to drink 4- 6 glasses of water a day. 15 In preadolescent years, LBM (lean body mass) is about the same for both sexes. Once adolescence starts the boy undergoes twice as much accumulation of LBM than girls. 4.1 Iron Following the physiological peculiarities requirements of adolescents for iron is high. They tend to the risk of anemia, which is often caused by the deficit of iron. The amount of red pigments (hemoglobin) in blood entirely depends on the amount of iron. Hemoglobi n carries oxygen in body. In the last decade the rate of anemia in children rose 5.7 times, but iron- deficiency anemia - 4-2 times. The rate iron- deficiency anemia in children according to the regions varies from 20% to 24,3%. It is a reason of poor and ar tificial diet. The situation is same in adults. The rate of iron -deficiency in men according to the regions varies from 5,5% to 18,2%, in women from 40% to 44.3%. The rate of iron- deficiency anemia in pregnant is 65,2%, which is very dangerous not only for the mothers but also for the infants. One of the most important diet considerations during adolescence is an increase in the intake of iron -rich foods such as: lean meat, fish, legume, halva, dark green vegetables, nuts and iron-rich grains. Iron from ani mal foods absorbed better than from non- animal sources. Adolescents following vegetation diets are at an increased risk of iron- deficiency. However, vitamin C assists in the absorption of non- haem iron. A glass of citrus juice taken with iron- fortified foo ds can help with the amount of iron absorbed from these foods. Iron rich sources are: 100 g product Liver Lungs Meat White mushroom Peach Quince Bread Apple Potatoes Cabbage Plum Iron Iodine Iodine is an important microelement, which has a vital role for human body. It takes part in the synthesis of the thyroid gland hormone. It plays an important role in the functioning of human's body and they influence on various bio- chemical and phy siological processes, including the synthesis of proteins. Thyroid gland hormones help to the physical growth and mental development. It is important to increase protein- rich food intake together with the iodine for the normal functioning of thyroid gland. Iodine deficit is especially dangerous for the baby's and small children's health: - Iodine deficit causes the growth of death, heart diseases, neurological cretinism and mental deficiency - Iodine deficit causes goiter, cretinism and hinders physical growth in small children - Iodine deficit during the pregnancy causes high risk of stillbirth, premature birth and physical and mental deficiency. - Iodine deficit during the age of reproduction in women (15- 49 years) causes childlessness. - Goiter and hypothyroids caused by the iodine deficit often is a reason of physical weakness and intellectual deficiency. 16 Problems caused by the Iodine deficit take place because of the iodine- deficient food intake. The amount of Iodine in product 100 g Product Cow milk curds Cheese Meat Fish Sea cabbag e Wheat Eggs Strawb erry Apple Cherry Iodine (mkg) 3 12 15-25 4 150- 300 200- 600 8 9 10-16 2,9 7 Concentration upon units! mg vs. ug in table above If the earth suffers from the deficit of iodine, it's natural that plants will contain small amount of iodine and respectively population will get products with the reduced amount of iodine. In this case iodized salt is recommended. Georgia is one of those countries in the world, which has an iodine deficiency. The prevalence of thyroid g land diseases in Georgia is about 37,8%(in adults - 47,1%, children - 30,6%). Endemic goiter has a leading part among the thyroid gland diseases. 4.3 Calcium The gain in skeletal weight is most rapid during the adolescent growth. Calcium is the main cons tituent element of bones. Calcium is rapidly consumed during the adolescent growth spurt. That why the needs on the calcium increases at this age. During peak adolescent growth, calcium retention is on average about 200 mg/day in girls and 300 mg/day in boys. Its main source is: diary products (curds, sour -milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs, cabbage and others). The efficiency of calcium absorption is only around 30% so it is important that the diet supplies a great amount of calcium to help build the densest bones . The achievement of peak bone mass during childhood and adolescence is crucial to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later years. As well as a good dietary supply of calcium, vitamin D and phosphorous are needed for building up bones. Physical activity is also essential for the development of the skeletal and muscle system. Physical activity is also the best way for the weight -regulation. Activities such as: cycling, gymnastics, skiing, ball games and etc. Physical activities (e.g. walking) are recommende d to be performed daily, but as minimum 3- 5 times a week, at least 30- 60 minutes a day.

Dietary habits are generally developed in early childhood. Home and school environments play a major role in determining child's attitude to indi vidual foods. Teenagers are exposed to periodic food fads, which is caused by the quick irregular snacks and slimming diets. One of the most frequently missed meals is breakfast. Studies show that breakfast plays an important role in the concentration and performance at school. That's why the role of breakfast is very important. Snacks form 17 an integral part of the children and adolescent's nutritional ration, as children cannot eat large quantities, at one sitting and often stay hungry. Mid - morning and m id-afternoon snacks can help to meet energy needs thought the day. 4.5 Energy needs. Children and adolescents consume much energy (the process of growth, substance circulation, physical activity and etc) and respectively they have to acquire energy need from food products. Consumption of various energy -rich foods ensures normal growth and development. Reaction of each adolescent on stress and emotional upsets is individual, inspire of consuming much energy. Some adolescents have high and other low appetit es. Mild or severe infections, nervousness, menstrual, dental or skin problem can result changes in appetite. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children is now a major nutritional problem. Developing adolescents are particularly concerned about t heir body image and excessive weight can have profound effects on their physical health. Obesity is often connected with the consumption of much food, sedentary lifestyle deficit of physical activities and various diseases. Lack of activity plays an import ant role not only in the development of obesity, but also in the development of chronic diseases such as: heart diseases, diabetes, hypertension, physical activity is related to improvements in body flexibility, balance and coordination. Healthy eating and a healthy way of life are important to how we look, feel and how much we enjoy life. The right lifestyle decisions, with a routine of good food and regular exercise can help us to make the most of what life has to offer can also help to reduce the risk of certain conditions. What is the condition of healthy nutrition in Georgia? By support of World health organization there has been held epidemiological survey in 5 region of Georgia (Tbilisi, Kakheti, Imereti, Achara and Mtskheta- Mtianeti) in order to get acquainted with nutrition and food habits in September 2005. It was estimated how often consume the family members food products in portions (in grams). Comparison was made with recommended standard portions, which we can see in the table. In the observed region for the nutritional structure is typical low level of consumed meat, fish and milk products. Nutrition principles are not fulfilling among majority of questioned respondents. This can be explained by the fact that it's in fact impossible for the majority of people to get regularly necessary food, because of the high prices and for their low availability and also there is a low level of population being informed about the healthy nutrition. From the given food groups: Cattle meat, poultry, f ish, eggs, legume, less than recommended portion consumed 58% of questioned family members, -34% consumed more than recommended portion, 8% consumed the recommended portion. 38% consumed more than recommended portions of vegetable, less - 40%, the recommended portion only 22% 18 25% consumed more than recommended portion of fruts, 45% less than recommended, only 30% consumed the recommended portion. This condition can be explained, as August and September months are rich in vegetables and fruits harvest, so not only the village population but the city population also consumes generally vegetables during this season. Village population have their own fruit and vegetable gardens, but for the city population vegetables and fruits are very cheap at this period of season and so it is more available for the population to acquire these foods in comparison with the other foods. 75% consumed sweets more than recommended, 17% less than recommended and 8% only consumed the recommended portion. The rate of sweet consuming is very high. 70% consumed grains (bread, pasta, buckwheat, rice, Hercules, cakes) more than recommended portions, 18% consumed less than recommended portion and 12% consumed the recommended portion. It is clearly seen from the studies that energetically val ue is mainly fill with bread and cereals. 56% consumed fats more than recommended portions, 29% less, but only 15% consumed the recommended portion. 25% consumed more than recommended portion of diary products, less -65% but only 10% consumed the recommende d portion. The fact that meal hours and menu is not distributed in the right way has to be taken into consideration. For examples, there have been noticed families, which have dinner meals instead of breakfast etc. The distribution of meals during the day varies in the following way: breakfast from 8 till 10 o'clock, dinner 14 -15, lunch - 16-17, supper 19- 22. In chosen regions food habits and abilities are very different from each other. Georgian population's low level of information in the sphere of country's economical development and healthy eating causes the fact that it is impossible to provide families with nutritional foods and what's more the budget of home - economies is not distributed in the right way so the population (consumer of food) doesn't know exactly to which product give preference while buying them.

The surface of the newly sliced meat is a little wet, but not slimy. Edible meat is dense, when pressing its surface by your finger a litter hole appears, pay attention to the speed of its disappearance. If meat is at the beginning stage of spoiling, it is less dense and the hole disappears later (in one minute) but if the meat is spoiled it does not disappear at all. If the meat is at the beginning stage of spoiling its surface is covered with dry skin or slime and sticks to the fingers. Sometimes you may see mould on the surface of such meat. The skin is dark.

After spoiling meat gets sour, musty. The spoiled meat of the fat animal gets a rancid smell that can be defined by the analysis of fats and albumens. Meat spoils at room temperature and requires sour smell and gets inedible. How to estimate visually fat is edible or not? Fat is white, yellow, and dense and after pressing it crumbles, it is without smell. If the cattle's meat is at the first stage of sp oiling its fat is gray without color, after pressing it by fingers it plasters and sticks to the fingers. Sometimes it has mould, a bad smell.

When meat is unfrozen quickly, it discharges its juice and the meat becomes less valuable. Avoid freezing of the unfrozen meat for the second time. As it's nutritional val ue greatly reduces! Estimation of the salted meat - salted meat is gray resistant to decaying microbes. It is edible or not can be estimated by its color and smell. Spoiled salted meat grows moldy, after that it starts decaying. The surface of inedible me at is darker than usual, sometimes slightly mucous.
