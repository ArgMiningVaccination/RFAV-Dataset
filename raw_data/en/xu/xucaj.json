Keeping with the nursing programs of the College of Health Science, the MSN program believes that: Each individual is a unique person having dignity and worth. Individuals, as members of the family and the community, are shaped by cultural, physiological, psychosocial, spiritual, and developmental forces. The family and the community influence early beliefs and values of individuals, and in turn individua ls contribute to the effective functioning of the family and community. Nursing is both an art and a science grounded in a social context and related to experiences with people in need. It is based on a specific body of nursing theory and principles from b ehavioral and social sciences. Nursing is an interpersonal process and involves the application of knowledge, technical and collaborative skills, critical thinking and creative problem solving. Th e focus of nursing is on caring for individuals, families, o r client groups. By using the nursing process, nurses promote, maintain, and restore client health as well as provide compassionate care to the dying. As health care providers, nurses enga ge in a collaborative practice that focuses on outcomes and adheres to practice guidelines that ensure quality and access. Professional values and value -based interventions are fundamental to nursing education. As the basis for professional nursing practice, values and value -based actions may be viewed as ethically reflect ive practice that the nursing student uses to interact with patients, health care professionals, and society. Teaching and learning are life -long interactive processes through which active inquiry and participation result in a change in behavior. A teachin g/learning process is facilitated when the learner and teacher share responsibility for outcomes. Learning is ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 57 November 2016 facilitated when content is presented in an orderly sequential manner (i.e. simple to complex, known to unknown, normal or abnormal, general to sp ecific). Critical thinking, clinical competence, accountability, and a commitment to the value of caring is necessary to maintain or restore clients to their optimum state of health and to provide the support which allows death with dignity. As the provide r of care, the nurse's commitment to client/family -centered care will facilitate successful preparation for practice in various health care settings. It is essential that the nurse have current knowledge in nursing concepts, principles, processes, and ski lls. Supportive of that knowledge is an understanding of health, acute and chronic health deviations, nutrition, pharmacology, communication, human development, teaching -learning principles, current technology, humanities, and biological, social, and behav ioral sciences. The nurse is a manager of care in various health care settings where policies and procedures are specified and guidance is available. To be competent in the role as a manager of care, the nurse must possess the knowledge and skills necessar y to make decisions regarding priorities of care, to delegate some aspects of nursing care, and direct others to use time and resources efficiently, and to know when to seek assistance. Supporting this knowledge is an understanding of the principles o f client-care management, communication and delegation, legal parameters of nursing practice, and roles and responsibilities of members of the health care team. Organizing Framework of the MSN Program The roles and functions of the MSN nurse graduate expand f rom the BSN level. The framework for the MSN programs is built on the AACN Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing (2011). Graduates of the MSN programs will possess \"broad knowledge and practice expertise\" beyond the baccalaureate degree and the rol es of health care leader, care manager, contributor to the profession, and community collaborator. Graduates will be prepared for work in current and future innovative environments where nursing a nd healthcare are delivered. Graduates will utilize techno logy to solve unique as well as global nursing issues, and learn to coordinate care by communicating across the boundaries of degrees, departments, facilities, and states. Graduates are prepared to educat e patients, families, groups, students, and each oth er. Graduates in direct -care roles will possess graduate -level knowledge in assessment, pharmacology, and pathophysiology; and, have precepted learning experiences. Expectations for graduates will foc us on patient safety, quality healthcare, and impactin g the systems that provide care. Graduates will exemplify the Institute of Medicine (IOM) core competencies of all health care professionals (2003) by providi ng patient -centered care that identifies and respects patients' individual needs and differences. Graduates will work in interdisciplinary teams to promote care that is continuous, reliable and will use evidence -based practices to transmit research into practice. Quality improvement techniques will be applied to identify hazards to patient care, under stand safety design principles, and measures of ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 58 November 2016 quality. Graduates will also use information technology to communicate with each other and reduce the chances for error. (http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2003/Health -Professions -Education -A-Bridge -to-Quality.aspx ) Additionally, the MSN program will use the teaching methods that support the use of technology and teach for a sense of salie nce, situated cognition and action in particular situations; integrate classroom and clinical experiences where appropriate; emphasize clinical reasoning and multiple ways of thinking; and emphasize role formation in graduate roles (Carnegie, 2010, http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/elibrary/educating -nurses -highlights ) Prerequisite courses. Applicants who do not have previous undergraduate coursework in statistics, health assessment and research, or computer applications may be required to complete one or more prerequisite courses prior to acceptance in the graduate progra m. Below are the corresponding undergraduate classes, which may be taken online, to satisfy this requirement. The MSN Director or Associate Director will review the undergraduate transcript for the following content: MTH 140 Statistics NUR 340 Health Assessment NUR 350 Nursing Research & Evidence -based Practice CIS 115 Computer Applications Progression. The MSN Program follows the ECPI University graduate program policies, including the grading scale. All Graduate courses require a \"B -\" or better to be considered applicable toward degree completion and students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of a 3.0 or better to remain actively enrolled in the graduate program. Students who receive two grades of \"C+\" or below, at any time during the program, will be dismissed. A student must re -ate a course for which a grade of C+ or below was earned. Even if the course is repeated, the original earned grade counts as one of those grades and the student may not receive anoth er grade of C+ or below. Student Evaluation. The faculty uses the program student learning outcomes and course objectives within i ndividual courses as criteria for student evaluation. A graduate portfolio is created across the curriculum and submitted as evidence of accomplis hment of the student learning outcomes in the final nursing course. Student grades are determined by a variety of formative and summative evaluation methods.

The program is dedicated to providing education opportunities for qualified registered nurse students from diverse backgr ounds in caring for individuals, families, and communities and preparing graduates for the practice in a variety of healthcar e settings. A foundation for lifelong personal and professional learning is built upon a broad base of liberal arts and science s, humanities, and nursing theory to assist students to develop ethically reflective professional nursing skills that will uphold the ideals of today's healthcare delivery system. Through evidence -based clinical decision -making in nursing practice the developm ent of leadership skills, the professional registered nurse will be educated to service and benefit a multicultural society across the lifespan . ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 65 November 2016 Philosophy of the BSN Program. The BSN program believes that: Each individual is a unique person having dig nity and worth. Individuals, as members of the family and the community, are shaped by cultural, physiological, psychosocial, spiritual, and developmental forces. The family and the community influence early beliefs and values of individuals, and in turn i ndividuals contribute to the effective functioning of the family and community. Nursing is both an art and a science grounded in a social context and related to experiences with people in need. It is based on a specific body of nursing theory and principle s from behavioral and social sciences. Nursing is an interpersonal process and involves the application of knowledge, technical and collaborative skills, critical thinking, and creative problem -solving. The focus of nursing is on caring for individuals, fa milies, or client groups. By using the nursing process, nurses promote, maintain, and restore client's health as well as provide compassionate care to the dying. As healthcare providers, nurses engage in a colla borative practice that focuses on outcomes an d adheres to practice guidelines that ensure quality and access. Professional values and value -based interventions are fundamental to nursing education. As the basis for professional nursing practice, values and value -based actions may be viewed as ethical ly reflective practice that the nursing student uses to interact with patients, healthcare professionals, and society. Teaching and learning are life -long interactive processes through which active inquiry and participation result in a change in behavior. A teaching/learning process is facilitated when the learner and teacher share responsibility for outcomes. Learning is facilitated when content is presented in an orderly sequential manner (i.e. simple to complex, known to unknown, normal or abnormal, gene ral to specific). Critical thinking, clinical competence, accountability, and a commitment to the value of caring is necessary to maintain or r estore clients to their optimum state of health and to provide the support which allows death with dignity. As th e provider of care, the nurse's commitment to client/family -centered care will facilitate successful preparation for practice in various healthcare settings. It is essential that the nurse have current knowledge in nursing concepts, principles, processes, and skills. Supportive of that knowledge is an understanding of health, acute and chronic health deviations, nutrition, pharmacology, communication, human development, teaching -learning principles, current technology, humanities, and biological, social, an d behavioral sciences. The RN to BSN program builds on the fundamental knowledge and skills acquired in associate degree and diploma nursing programs. The BSN graduate is prepared to care for individuals as well as families, groups and communities utilizin g evidence - based practice. The BSN graduate will be prepared to serve in the roles of healthcare leader, care manager, community collaborator, and contributor to the profession of nursing. Organizing Framework of the RN to BSN Program. This diagram represe nts the organizing framework of the RN to BSN program at ECPI University. The program is designed to build upon knowledge acquired in diploma and associate degree RN programs and off ers courses that develop registered nurses to be healthcare leaders, commu nity collaborators, care managers, and contributors to the profession. These four roles provide the basis for the program outcomes. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 66 November 2016 Prerequisite Courses.

Classes will be held Monday -Friday and will be scheduled between 8:00 am and 6:00 pm. Clinical experiences can be scheduled at any time during the week, including weekends. Prospective students should also be aw are that clinical experience s are scheduled for the convenience of the clinical site and may be held during evenings or nights. For example, a student may have a shift of 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm or 11:00 pm - 7:00 am. Due to the high -intensity nature of this program, it is advised that a student not have outside employment . Administrative office hours may differ from scheduled class hours. Administrative office hours are generally Monday -Friday 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Classes are offered and scheduled by ECPI University in sequences or combi nations to allow the student to complete the program in a timely manner. ECPI University reserves the right to alter schedules so that proper facilities, equipment, and faculty are av ailable. As per the Florida Board of Nursing regulations, the maximum num ber of students in a clinical placement is 12 students to 1 faculty ratio and the maximum ratio for preceptored experiences is 18 students to 1 faculty ratio. The sequence in which courses are taught during the program may change at the discretion of ECPI University. Prerequisites for all courses are listed in the Course Description section of this catalog. Attendance Policy. Class Time. It is an expectation that students attend all classes and all clinical experiences. The second -degree program is a full - time program, with students in class or clinical five days a week. Because of the high intensity of this program, outside employment is not recommended. If a student is aware of the need to miss a class, he or she is to notify the faculty in advance, if po ssible. If a student misses a class, he or she is responsible for determining what materials were presented in the missed class and for making his or her own arrangements to obtain this information from available sources such as faculty, classmates, Moodle , or other on -line or reference sources. ECPI University - Orlando faculty feel very strongly that it is important for students to attend all classes in order to achieve a full understanding of essential core content throughout the nursing curriculum. Att endance will be taken daily by the course faculty. Students who do not meet the attendance requirements, as stated by the course faculty, will be marked absent. Students who ar e absent for multiple class days will have points deducted from the final course grade as follows: Absent 1 day = no reduction in course grade Absent 2 days = 1 point Absent 3 days = 2 points Absent 4 days = 3 points Absent 5 days = 4 points Absent 6 days = 5 points Absent 7 days = 6 points Absent 8 days = 7 points Absent 9 days = 8 points Absent 10 days = 9 points Absent 11 days = 10 points ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 71 November 2016 24 Exams. If the student anticipates missing a scheduled exam, he or she needs to notify the instructor. A different version of the mis sed exam may be administered at the facu lty's discretion. Penalties for missing exams and quizzes will be applied as outlined in the course syllabi. If the student anticipates missing a scheduled exam, he /she needs to notify the faculty member prior to the exam, unless it is an emergency situa tion without phone access. A five percent reduction will occur on any course make -up exam, while a ten percent reduction will occur on any make -up for a comprehensive final exam. For example, if a student scores a 93% on a course make -up exam, he/she will achieve an exam score of 88%. If a student scores a 93% on a comprehensive final make -up exam, he/she will achieve an exam score of 83%. If a student has missed an exam, another version of the exam is developed at the faculty member's discretion. Student s who miss an exam are not allowed to participate in the exam review for the missed exam. All make -up exams are scheduled during Week 12 and after final exams. Clinical/Laboratory Time. A critical component of the nursing curriculum is that students demon strate clinical competency (meeting the clinical evaluation criteria, either on -site in a skills laboratory or off -site at a clinical site). \"Clinical Time\" means the time spent on -site at a clinical site or in a skills laboratory, including all required e xperiences, pre -/post - conferences and observations outlined by faculty. \"Clinical Absence\" means the time scheduled at a clinical site or in a skills lab that the student does not attend. Clinical Time schedules may be adjusted from time to time. Notice o f schedule changes will be given to students as soon as reasonably possible after a schedule change has been made. Attendance during the required amount of Clinical Time is mandatory in order to receive a passing grade. Accordingly, all Cli nical Absences m ust be made up in accordance with the requirements set forth below, or the student will not be deemed to have passed the course: Students must be making satisfactory progress toward all course competencies in order to be eligible to make up a Clinical Absence. If more than 20% of Clinical Time in a course is missed, the student will receive a failing grade. Tardiness and early departures constitute a Clinical Absence, and the time missed due to tardiness or early departure must be made up. For purposes of measuring the 20% of Clinical Time missed limitation, all missed Clinical Absences will be accumulated without regard to previous makeup time. (For example, if a student has missed 5% of the Clinical Time, has made up that 5%, and then misses another 16% o f Clinical Time, the student will have exceeded the 20% missed Clinical Time limitation and will not be permitted to make up additional time and will fail the course.) A student who has not previously exceeded the 20% of Clinical Time missed limitation wil l be eligible to withdraw and not receive a failing grade only (a) due to extenuating circumstances approved in advance by the Dean, or (b) in the event of a genuine medical emergency of the student or an immediate family member. [Vacations, weddings, fune rals (other than those of immediate family members), child care or other family care giving obligations will not be considered to be extenuating circumstances.] Faculty and course coordinators have the right to determine the nature of the experience that w ill be required for any Clinical Time that must be made up. Direct patient care is typically required in clinical instruction. If faculty and clinical sites are available, the student m ust attend the makeup Clinical Time at the clinical site on the schedul ed makeup day. If patient experiences are not available, alternative assignments will be offered for makeup time. Students are not guaranteed patient experiences for makeup Clinical Time. If makeup Clinical Time is scheduled at a clinical site, all student s with missed Clinical Time will be required to make up the missed Clinical Time on the scheduled makeup day and if they fail to attend, the student will not be allowed to make up the missed Clinical Time. All clinical makeup time must be completed before the end of the term. Accordingly, it may not be possible to make up Clinical Time missed near the end of the term. If the makeup Clinical Time scheduled does not fall within the times that faculty is regularly scheduled at a clinical location, the student will be required to pay a fee of $50 per hour for the makeup Clinical Time and the fee must be paid in advance of scheduled makeup time, and if not paid, the student will not be allowed to make up the Clinical Time. Makeup ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 72 November 2016 Clinical Time will be scheduled o nly to the extent that faculty and clinical space are available and there can be no assurance that makeup Clinical Time other than those scheduled by the college will be available. If there is an emergency or illness resulting in absence, the student shoul d notify his or her assigned clinical instructor at least one hour prior to the start of the scheduled Clinical Time. A student may be instructed to leave a clinical site if, if in the opinion of the clinical instructor or clinical supervisor, the students tardiness, preparedness, or other conditions render the student incapable of providing safe patient care or having been tardy to the extent that it adversely affects the students ability to achieve the intended educational objective of the clinical experi ence. In the event the student is instructed to leave the clinical site, the student will be deemed to have a Clinical Absence for portion of th e scheduled Clinical Time missed. Program Purpose . The purposes of the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursin g program are to provide undergraduate students with (1) Ability to practice professional nursing as a generalist, (2) the Academic foundation necessary to pursue graduate education. Philosophy of the A ccelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program . The ABSN program believes that: Baccalaureate nursing education is the basic preparation for professional nursing practice, and establishes the foundation fo r life - long learning. The faculty members believe that the baccalaureate graduate is a generalist, pre pared to provide clinical leadership in the assessment, planning, delivery and evaluation of health care for individuals, families and communities. The curriculum is structured to enable the student to demonstrate that they have developed an understanding and mastery of baccalaureate -level nursing and related concepts as they progress through their educational experience. Related concepts emphasized in the nursing curriculum include ethical decision -making, critical thinking, effective communication, leade rship and management. As envisioned by the faculty members of the University, the nursing paradigm includes: Person. Each person is a unique being with basic rights and choices who experiences multiple stressors from their continually changing internal an d external environments with varying degrees of adaptation. The ultimate goal that a person has is to find, establish and maintain balance with health. Clients of nursing care are composed of individuals, families, groups, and communities with diverse back grounds, sharing common goals and values. Perceptions, attitudes, values, and goals are influenced by culture, race, spirituality, age, gender, and abilities. Environment. The environment is a complex, open system existing in a dynamic state of change. Eco nomic, political, environmental, and technological factors exert their effects on society. The nurse promotes an environment in which the perso n's needs may be met, while respecting individual differences related to values, customs, and responses to life e xperiences. Health. Health is regarded as dynamic and multidimensional, with physical, mental, spiritual and social components that are all interrelated on the wellness -illness continuum, varying from a high level of wellness to varying degrees of illness. Health is influenced by both internal and external factors to the individuals' optimal level of functioning. When adaptive abilities ar e inadequate or stressed, the individual moves on the wellness -illness continuum toward a lower level of functioning. Al l people have the inherent right to make informed decisions regarding their health care, including self -determination. Nursing. Nursing is both an art and a science. Professional nursing provides comprehensive health care services to clients in an effort t o support them in attaining their optimal level of independence and wellness through the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health. The role of the nurse is multifaceted, conceptualized in three primary categories: provider of care, coordinator of care and member of the profession. Nursing education is an interactive process, allowing the adult learner to incorporate previously learned knowledge, building a foundation for providing holistic, outcomes -oriented care. The profession works collaborative ly with other members of the health care interdisciplinary team to facilitate optimal client outcomes. The faculty believes that the baccalaureate degree is the professional degree for nursing, providing the groundwork for the gradu ate degree. Learning. Faculty members of the University believe baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice as a nurse generalist, and offers preparation for professional development and life -long learning. Baccalaureate nursing education, based upon a liberal arts education, is the synthesis of knowledge from a variety of disciplines, including humanities, social, behavioral, and natural sciences. Learning is a collaborative partnership between the student and the faculty member, promoted by critica l thinking, problem - solving and effective decision -making. Learning occurs in a variety of settings, with each student responsible for maximizing his or her own experiences. Each student has unique life, educational and work experiences and therefore, has individual learning needs. Outcome assessments quantitatively and qualitatively measure achievement of programmatic goals ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 73 November 2016 Prerequisite Courses Applicants must have successfully completed all prerequisite courses, with no more than two being allowed to be i n progress at the time of application. A science prerequisite GPA of at least 2.75 is needed to apply to the program. Students not meeting the GPA r equirement may be considered for admission after review by the APG committee. Required prerequisite courses are: Anatomy and Physiology (8 semester / 12 quarter credits, Parts I and II, with labs) Social Science: Sociology or Psychology (3 semester / 4.5 quarter credits) Microbiology (4 semester / 6 quarter credits, lab included) Human Growth and Development or Developmental Psychology (3 semester / 4.5 quarter credits Chemistry (4 semester / 6 quarter credits, lab included) English (3 semester / 4.5 quarter credits) Statistics (3 semester / 4.5 quarter credits) Additional General Education Elective (3 semeste r / 4.5 quarter credits) Progression Policy A numeric grade of 75 or better is required in all nursing courses to graduate from the nursing program. In order to receive a passing grade in the course, students are required to pass the clinical, lab, and th eory portions of the course. Failure in the theory, lab, or clinical component requires repeating all aspects of the course. Academic progression in the nursing program is determined by a studen t's exam average in each course without consideration for any additional assignments. The benchmark for passing each course is an exam grade average of 75 or greater. Students who achieve a final course grade of less than 75 in any nursing course cannot enroll in su bsequent clinical nursing courses. If the student do es not pass the exam portion of the course with this average, other course requirements (such as papers and presentations) will not suffice to raise the grade to passing. Only one nursing course may be repeated to raise an unsatisfactory grade. Students m ay not enroll in any course for which they do not have the necessary prerequisites as a result of course failure or course withdrawal. A Student who is unsuccessful in a cours e may be allowed to reattempt that course the next time it is offered, based on a vailability. In order to be considered to repeat the failed course, the student must write a letter to the Dean/Chief Nursing Administrator requesting permission to repeat the course ECPI Universit y's Nursing Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committe e will determine reinstatements and reviews each case individually. Re -admission to the nursing program is not guaranteed. A student who fails more than one course, or who fails one course twice, will be dismissed from the program and will not be e ligible for re-enrollment. Student Evaluation. At the completion of certain courses, students are required to complete a computerized, national examination that tests the student's comprehensive knowledge of the course content. Any fees for these examinations are included in the program costs. Students are evaluated according to course -specific performance criteria designated on the syllabus. Students will receive a written evaluation in each clinical course at mid -term and at the completion of the clinical course . The instructor will review the evaluation with the student, and upon completion of the review, the student and the instructor will sign the evaluation. The student's signat ure does not constitute an acknowledgement that the student agrees with the instru ctor's evaluation, but serves as confirmation that the evaluation has been reviewed with and provided to the student. The student may make written comments in response to the evaluation, attachin g it to the evaluation. In the final quarter of the program, students are required to take a course entitled Senior Seminar and as a part of the course requirements, must pass a comprehensive computerized examination, the HESI Comprehensive Examination (\"HESI\"), that contains questions simi lar to those found on the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (\"NCLEX -RN\"). Students who fail to achieve a score of 850 or greater on the HESI, as graded by the testing service, will not pass the Senior Seminar course, and will not be eligible for graduati on until they pass the Senior Seminar course. During the Senior Seminar course, students will be given three opportunities to achieve a score of 850 or greater on the HESI. Students who do not achieve a score of 850 or greater on the HESI, during the Senio r Seminar course, will receive a grade of Incomplete (\"I\") and will be offered two additional opportunities to pass the HESI (H ESI Make - Up Exams) on dates designated by the University within the 12 week period following the conclusion of the quarter during which a student receiving an \"I\" was enrolled in the Senior Seminar course. Students who achieve a score of 850 or greater on one of the two HESI Make -Up Exams will have their \"I\" changed to a passing grade. Students who fail to achieve a score of 850 or greater on one of the two additional HESI Make -Up Exams will have their \"I\" changed to an \"F\" and will have failed the Senior Seminar course. Facilities Description . The physical location of the proposed branch campus consists of 19,200 square feet of leas ed space in a multi - tenant single story building located at 660 Century Point, Lake Mary, Florida.

SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS Note: the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy and Requirements described below are specific to the ECPI University Lake Mar y, Florida campus. All students must meet ECPI University's minimum standards of academic achievement and course completion progress requirements while enrolled at ECPI University. ECPI University's satisfactory academic progress standards (\"SAP\") have two primary compo nents: one is qualitative and the other is quantitat ive. The qualitative component requires certain minimum cumulative grade point averages be achieved as of certain measuring points and the quantitative component requires completing courses at a certain pace in order to complete an educational program wit hin the allowed maximum timeframe. The qualitative and quantitative components of SAP are evaluated as of each Minimum Measurement Point based upon grades, cred it or clock hours attempted and credit or clock hours completed as indicated on a student's transcript as of the end of the Grading Period ending contemporaneously with the most recent Minimum Measurement Point being reached. Minimum Measurement Points occur at th e end of each Financial Aid Payment Period and in addition thereto, at the applicabl e Minimum Measuring Point as a percent of Program Length indicated in the charts below. ECPI University's satisfactory academic progress standards are the same for all students without regard to whether they recei ve financial assistance under Title IV, HE A programs (\"Title IV\") or other financial aid and without regard to whether they are a full-time or part -time student. A student that fails to satisfy the SAP requirements at any Minimum Measuring Point and is not placed on either Financial Aid Warning o r Financial Aid Probation status shall no longer be eligible to receive assistance under the Title IV programs. Satisfactory Academic Progress Definitions \"Appeal\" means the appeal by a student of a determination by the School that a student has not meet the SAP requirements and is commenced by submitting an Appeal Request in compliance with the Appeal Procedures set forth below in the Satisfactory Academ ic Progress Appeals and Waivers section of this Catalog. \"Appeal Procedures\" means the procedures set forth below in the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals and Waivers section of this Catalog that a student must follow to Appeal a determination that a student has failed to satisfy SAP standards and to obtain Financial Aid Probation status. \"Appeal Re quest\" means a written document that contains the information required by the Appeal Procedures set forth below in the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals and Waivers section of this Catalog. \"CGPA\" means a student's cumulative grade point average calc ulated as set forth below in the Qualitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress section of this Catalog. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 76 November 2016 \"Grading Period\" is a period of instruction for which the student receives a final grade that is recorded on a student's tran script for a particular course. \"Financial Aid Payment Period\" means a period of time which generally consists of twelve (12) weeks of instructional time, bu t never less than ten (10) weeks of instructional time. \"Financial Aid Probation\" means the status assigned by th e School to a student who (i) is on Financial Aid Warning status and fails to make satisfactory academic progress at the end of the first Financial Aid Payment Period or other Minimum Measuring Point occ urring after student was placed on Financial Aid Warn ing status; (ii) has appealed the SAP failure determination made by the School and (iii)after considering the Appeal, the School has determined the student should be able to meet SAP requirements in the next Financial Aid Payment Period or the School has d eveloped an academic plan that if followed will insure the student is able to meet SAP requirements by a specific time. \"Financial Aid Warning\" means the status assigned to a student who is on SAP Met status and subsequently fails to satisfy SAP requireme nts at the end of a Financial Aid Payment Period or as of any other Minimum Measuring Point. \"Minimum CGPA\" shall have the meaning set forth below in the Qualitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress section of this Catalog. \"Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credit Hours Completed Requirement\" shall have the meaning set forth below in the Quantitative Component Of Satisfactory Academic Progress section of this Catalog and the specific Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credit Hours Completed Requirement as of each Minimum Measuring Point for various programs are delineated in the Minimum Credits Completed Requirements chart set forth below in the Quantitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress section of this Catalog. \"Minimum Meas urement Point\" shall mean the end of each Financial Aid Payment Period as defined herein for each program classification and in addition thereto the applicable Minimum Measuring Point as a percent of Program Length, Minimum Measuri ng Point in Credit Hour A ttempted, Minimum Measuring Point in Clock Hours Attempted and Minimum Measuring Point in Modules indicated in the charts set forth below. \"MTF\" shall have the meaning set forth below in the Quantitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress section of this Catalog. Qualitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress The qualitative component of SAP requires the achievement of specified minimum cumulative grade point average (\"Minimum CGPA\" ) as of certain measuring points which are defined abov e as the Minimum Measuring Points. Except as provided below, the cumulative grade point average, CGPA, is calculated using the grades for all courses for which a grade was received, other than a \"W\", o r \"I\" during the Grading Periods in which the courses were completed as of the time a Minimum Measurement Point is reached. If a student receives the temporary grade of \"I\", the grade received upon completion of the course or \"F\" if the course is not completed within tim e allowed for completion will be used to calculate the CGPA. However, if a student repeats a course, without regard to whether the previous grade was a failing or a passing grade, the new grade will be used and all prior grades for the repeated will not be included in the gr ades used to calcu late the CGPA. The grades received for credit hours from another institution, other than another ECPI University campus, tha t are accepted for transfer towards a student's program will not be included in the calculation of the CGPA but will be included in the determination of the Minimum Measurement Point. The grades received for credit hours from another ECPI University campus, th at are accepted for transfer towards a student's program will be included in the calculation of the CGPA and will be included in the of the determination of the Minimum Measurement Point. The Minimum CGPA Requirement chart below lists program lengths and the Minimum CGPA required at the end of the Grading Period wherein each of the Minimum Measurement Points is initially met or exceeded. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 77 November 2016 MINIMUM CGPA REQUIREMENT If a student's CGPA falls below the minimum required CGPA at any Minimum Measuring Point, the student will be notified in writing of the consequences of not maintaining satisfactory academic progress including if such failure will impact a student's Title IV eligibility, cause the student to receive a Financial Aid Warning or require student to Appeal the determination to be placed on Financial Aid Probation to have Title IV eligibility reinstated. Quantitative Component of Satisfactory Academic Progress The quantitative component of SAP requires the completion, as of the Minimum Measuring Points, of a minimum number of credits hours after attempting a certain number of credit hours. The number of credit hours required to be completed as of each Minimum Mea suring Point is measured as a percentage of the total credit hours required to complete the program that will have been attempted by a student as each Minimum Measuring Point is reached (the \"Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credit Hours Completed Requirement\"). The quantitative component of SAP measures whethe r a student is progressing through the program at a rate that will ensure the student graduates within a maximum timeframe. The maximum timeframe (\"MTF\") for completion of a program is one and one -half times the program length. The MTF is measured in cred it hours for credit hour courses and clock hours for clock hour courses. The number of credit hours required to be completed depends upon the length of the program. A credit hour is completed when a grade other than \"W\" or \"I\" is assigned to the credit o r clock hour. If a student receives the temporary grade of \"I\", the grade received upon completion of the course or \"F\", if the course is not completed within time allowed for completion, will be used to determine the number of completed credit hours used to measure whether the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credits Completed Requirement has been satisfied as of a Minimum Measuring Point. The credit hours assigned to courses for which a student receives a \"W\" will be in cluded in the determination of th e number of credit hours attempted that is used to measure whether the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credits Completed Requirement has been satisfied as of a Minimum Measuring Point. The credit hours from another institution, including another ECPI University campus, that are accepted for transfer towards a student's program will be included as both credit hours attempted and completed in the determination of whether the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credits Completed Requirement has been satis fied as of a Minimum Measurement Point. Courses repeated will be included the as both credit hours attempted and completed in the determination of whether the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credit Hours Completed Requirement has been satisfied as of a Minimum Measurement Point. The number of credit hours completed and attempted as indicated on a student's transcript at the end of the Grading Period ending contemporaneously with the most recent Minimum Measurement Point being reached will be used to det ermine if the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credits Completed Requirement has been satisfied as of a Minimum Measurement Point. The Minimum Credits Completed Requirement chart below lists program lengths and the Minimum Percentage of Total Program Credits Completed Requirement that must be satisfied as of each respective Payment Period for degree students. The Quantitative Component of SAP will be evaluated at the end of each Financial Aid Payment Period for degree Programs to de termine if the Mini mum Percentage of Total Program Credit Hours Completed Requirement has been satisfied. Program Length (Minimum # of Months Required to Complete Program) Minimum Measurement Point (as a percent of Program Length) Minimum CGPA Requirement Minimum Measurement Point in Financial Aid Payment Periods 25% 2.00 End of Payment Period 1 50% 2.00 End of Payment Period 2 12 75% 2.00 End of Payment Period 3 100% 2.00 End of Payment Period 4 and each Payment Period thereafter ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 78 November 2016 Minimum Credits Completed Requirement If a student cannot complete the program within the MTF, the student will be notified in writing that the student will not b e able to meet the SAP requirements and that as a consequence that the student will be dropped and such failure will impact a student's elig ibility to receive assistance under the Title IV programs. Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals Please see ECPI Un iversity Catalog Academic Polices for descriptions of the Satisfactory Academic Progress warning, probation, dismissal, and appeals processes. FINANCIAL AID POLICIES for the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing Refund Policy Definitions. As used in this Refund Policy, these terms shall have the following meaning: \"Quarter\" is the period for which students are charged. Each quarter consists of 12 weeks of instruction. Three quarters cons titute an academic year. \"Tuition and Fees\" means the stated prog ram price, together with any applicable fees charged by ECPI and sales tax. \"Trial Period\" - New students attending their first course are in a trial period, which is typically five weeks. During the trial period, the student may opt out and all tuition ch arges would be refunded less enrollment fees, otherwise they become a regular student. Title IV federal student assistance will not be disbursed during the trial period, but once completed and the student continues as a r egular student, disbursements will be made to include the trial period if otherwise eligible. Start Date Postponement . In the event of a program start date is postponed by ECPI, Student is entitled to a full refund of all monies paid to ECPI if requested by Student within fifteen days of St udent's receipt of notice of such postponement. The University reserves the right to discontinue a program of study for enrollment or other factors. In the event that a stud ent has not commenced study in the discontinued program, the student may transfer t o another program and all monies paid will be applied to the new enrollment. In the event that a student has completed coursework within the discontinued program of study, the student wi ll be provided an opportunity to complete all outstanding coursework a t the University and earn the appropriate credential for that program. Cancellation Policy : Student may cancel his/her Enrollment Agreement, without any penalty or obligation, within three (3) business days from the date Student signs the Enrollment Agreem ent. If Student cancels in accordance herewith, any payment made by Student under his/her Enrollment Agreement and any negotiable instrument executed by Student in connection herewith will be returned within 30 days following receipt by ECPI University of such cancellation notice excluding the non -refundable application fee, and any security interest arising out of the Enrollment Agreement will be voided. If cancellation is effected under this clause, Student shall have the right to apply for reinstatement within 12 months from the date signed by Student on page one of his/her Enrollment Agreement, at which time a credit ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 79 November 2016 will be given for all monies paid but not previously returned to Student, if any. To cancel the Enrollment Agreement, Student must mail or deliver a signed and dated copy of Student's written cancellation notice to ECPI University at the campus location noted on page one of his/her Enrollment Agreement no later than midnight on the third day after Student signs his/her enrollment agreement. Refund Calculation Florida Student Refund Calculation : If Student cancels during the trial period, ECPI will refund all money less the non -refundable application fee. Thereafter, the refund for each Quarter will be the larger of (a) the refund, if any, required by state law, or (b) the refund, if any, required by federal law, and (c) the ECPI Refund Policy. The table below indicates the amount of Tuition the applicant will be charged (the amount ECPI University has earned) if the applicant is matriculated and withdraws or is dismi ssed. Applicants not matriculated will receive a refund of all Tuition paid for the program. If student withdraws or is dismissed when scheduled classes have been held for: Student's tuition charges will be: 1-20% of the quarter * Equal corresponding pro rat a percentage, e.g. 7% = 7% tuition charges. More than 20% but not more than 30% of the quarter 30% of the Total Estimated Tuition More than 30% but not more than 40% of the quarter 40% of the Total Estimated Tuition More than 40% but not more than 50% of the quarter 50% of the Total Estimated Tuition More than 50% but not more than 60% of the quarter 60% of the Total Estimated Tuition More than 60% of the quarter 100% of the Total Estimated Tuition *New students attending their first course are in a five -week trial period. If a student opts out during the trial period, all t uition charges would be refunded less enrollment fe es, otherwise they become a regular student. The BSN (accelerated) program is 48 weeks long and instruction is scheduled five days per week. Days or parts thereof spent at clinical sites are considered days on which classes are scheduled. Exit Calculation and Refund Policies : Information regarding any applicable third party funding agency refund or return of funds policies (e.g., Title IV, WIA, etc.) may be obtained from the University Student Finance Department. The following is a brief and general explanation of rules, regulations and policies applicable to the making of the Exit Calc ulation. In the event that any conflict exists between this explanation and the rules, regulations and policies applicable to the various fin ancial aid programs, such rules, regulations and policies as modified and amended from time to time shall be applied. This exp lanation is not intended to be a complete and thorough explanation of all of the applicable components of the Exit Calculation, and should no t be relied upon as such. In the simplest terms, the Exit Calculation and refund process consists of four steps: Computing the amount of Tuition that a student is charged for a payment period in which the student withdraws or is dismissed in accordance with the institutional refund policy. (The method of determining the official date of termination is the date the student notified the University they were withdrawing or the last date the student attended class.) Determining what, if any, amounts from financial aid and/or other financial assistance programs are required to be returned t o the fund sources. For a discussi on of amounts required to be returned under Return of Title IV Funds regulations see \"Federal Return of Funds Requirement\" section below. Adjusting the student's account based on the calculations of (1) and (2), making the appropriate refunds, if any, base d on the calculations of (1) and (2) and determining whether the student owes ECPI University any additional monies as a result of the adjustments, or whether the student has a credit balance (amount owed to the student's account) after applying any additi onal institutional and non -institutional charges, including any prior year balances, against the credit balance. Refunding any credit balance to the student's lenders. Federal Return of Funds Requirement : The Return of Title IV calculation is delayed if S tudent provides written confirmation, on or before last day of attendance, of an expected re -entry date before the end of the current quarter. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 80 November 2016 The calculation for the return of Title IV aid funds is determined by Student's last date of attendance. The num ber of days completed is divided by the number of days in the payment period to identify the percentage of time Student has completed. This would be t he percentage of aid earned by Student. If Student withdraws at 60% or more of the current payment period, no return of the Title IV aid funds for that period is required as Student is considered to have earned 100% of the Title IV aid funds received. If Student 's last date of attendance is before completing 60%, this percentage is multiplied by the total amou nt of Title IV aid received or could have been received (for this period) to arrive at the amount of earned aid. The difference between the amount of earned aid and the amo unt of Title IV aid is the amount of unearned aid. Pell Grant awards will be recalcu lated to the eligible amount based on any changes to the enrollment status before being pro -rated as required by the U.S. department of Education, which often results in a significant reduction in Pell Grant eligibility. The amount of aid ECPI is responsi ble for returning : Institutional charges (tuition, books, and fees for the entire Quarter) are multiplied by the percentage of unearned aid to determine the amount ECPI is responsible to return. The amount ECPI is responsible to re turn is compared to the t otal amount of unearned aid; the lesser amount is then returned to the applicable student aid program (see below for refund order). This refund amount is then charged to Student's account and depending on the results of the Refund Policy, it is possible t o have a tuition balance owed to ECPI for the unpaid portion of tuition, books, and fees. *Unsubsidized Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) *Subsidized Direct Loans *Federal Perkins Loans *Direct PLUS Loans *Federal Pell Grants for which a return i s require *Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) for which a return of funds is required *Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, for which a return is required. The amount of unearned aid Student is responsible for returning : Student is responsible for returning any portion of the unearned aid that is not part of the required return from ECPI. Any unearned aid that came from Title IV loans, Student will be responsibl e for repaying those funds according to the terms of the promissory no te. Payment of Refunds : Any refunds due under the foregoing provisions to the Student who properly cancels, withdraws, is discontinued, or fails to return from an approved leave of absence, will be refunded within 30 days of the date of determination that the student has withdrawn either due to attendance or failure to return from an approved leave of absence . Refunds due per the U.S. Department of Education (not the student) will be made within 59 days of the last date of attendance or 45 days from the da te of official withdrawal, whichever is earlier. Refunds due by Student to other entities will be made within their required time-frames, but never more than 60 days after the last date of attendance. Special Cases : In case of prolonged illness or accident , death in the family, or other circumstances that make it impractical to complete the program, ECPI shall make a settlement that is fair. Students who have not visited ECPI prior to enrollment may withdraw without penalty within three (3) days following e ither their scheduled class orientation or following a tour of ECPI and its facilities, whichever is earlier. Students eligible for military benefits are charged and refunded according to funding source guidelines.

Students who are absent or tardy during their scheduled clinical/simulation hours must contact the Director of Nursing or designee, prior to attending their next scheduled class/clinical time. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 115 November 2016 Clinical Protocol. Clinical experiences are scheduled in various l ocal healthcare agencies and ho spitals and are subject to ch ange. Students are not to provide personal telephone numbers or addresses to clients. Students are not permitted to accept gifts from clients, patients, or their families. Visiting patients, other than friends and relatives, is not permitted. Students are not permitted to fraternize with any patient/agency employee while enrolled in school. Students may not visit any clinical facilities while wearing the student uniform (including the name pin) unless prior permission is granted by a Nursing faculty member. Students may not review any patient's chart except the patients assigned to them. Program Philosophy . The Nursing Department believes that each individual is a unique person having dignity and worth. Individuals, as members of the family and the communit y, are shaped by cultural, physiological, psychosocial, spiritual, and developmental forces. The family and the community influence early beliefs and values of individuals, and in turn individuals contribute to the effective functioning of the family and c ommunity. We believe that Nursing is both an art and a science grounded in a social context and related to experiences with people in n eed. It is based on a specific body of nursing theory and principles from behavioral and social sciences. Nursing is an interpersonal process and involves the application of knowledge, technical and collaborative skills, critical thinking, and creative problem -solving. The focus of nursing is on individuals, families, or client groups. By using the nursing process, nurses p romote, maintain and restore clients' health as well as provide compassionate care to the dying. As healthcare providers, nurses engage in a collaborative practice that f ocuses on outcomes and adheres to practice guidelines that ensure quality and access. We believe that professional values and value -based interventions are fundamental to nursing education. As the basis for professional nursing practice, values and value -based actions may be viewed as ethically reflective practice that the nursing student uses to interact with patients, healthcare professionals, and society. We believe that teaching/learning is a life -long interactive process through which active inquiry and participation result in a change in behavior. The teaching/learning process is faci litated when the learner and teacher share responsibility for outcomes. Learning is facilitated when content is presented in an orderly sequential manner, i.e. simple to complex, known to unknown, normal to ab normal, general to specific. We believe that cr itical thinking, clinical competence, accountability, and a commitment to the value of caring is necessary to maintain or restore clients their optimum state of health and to provide the support which allows death with dignity. As the provider of care, the nurse's commitment to client/family -centered care will facilitate successful preparation for practice in various healthcare settings where policies and procedures are specified and guidance is available. We believe it is essential that the nurse have curr ent knowledge in nursing concepts, principles, processes, and skills. Supportive of that knowledge is an understanding of health, acute and chronic health deviations, nutrition, pharmacology, communication, hu man development, teaching -learning principles, current technology, humanities, and biological, social, and behavioral sciences. We believe the nurse is the manager of care in various healthcare settings where policies and procedures are specified and gu idance is available. To be competent in the role a s a manager of care, the nurse must possess the knowledge and skills necessary to make decisions regarding priorities of care, to delegate some aspects of nursing care, direct others to use time and resources eff iciently, and to know when to seek assistanc e. Supporting this knowledge is an understanding of the principles of client -care management, communication, and delegation, legal parameters of nursing practice, and roles and responsibilities of members of the healthc are team. We believe that the entry l evel practice of a graduate from the Associate of Applied Science in Nursing program is characterized by collaboration, organization, delegation, accountability, advocacy, and respect for other healthcare workers. As a coordinator of care, the entry level registered nurse demonstrates caring and compassion and provides and coordinates holistic nursing care for groups of clients who have healthcare needs.

The Practical Nursing program at ECPI University (hereafter will be referred to as \"ECPI\") is a leading provider of practical nurse education. ECPI creates an environment that promotes effective teaching and successful learning. Transfer of credi t. The University will consider coursework for transfer for the Normal Lifespan course in which the student achieved a B or better as the final grade, that was completed within the past two years, and that is established to be equivalent in c ontent and objectives to course offered in the Practical Nursing Program. ECPI requires that a student complete all other courses in the Un iversity in order to receive the diploma. Attendance. A detailed record of student's attendance is maintained by the instructors an d becomes a part of their permanent records. Every absence from class, no matter what the reason, is recorded and counted as such by the instructor, beginning with the fi rst day of class. It is sometimes necessary for the school to give employment recommen dations for a student. The employer often takes attendance into consideration. Students MUST attend class regularly. CUTTING SCHEDULED CLASSES IS NOT PERMITTED. If, for any reason, an absence is necessary, day clinical students must call the school and the instructor no later than one hour before the scheduled start time. Students with course absences greater than 15 percent may have their records reviewed for purposes of possible probation, termination, or suspension. A student may be dropped from a course if the student is absent more than 20 percent of the scheduled course hours. Written assignments must be submitted on time. Tests must be made up on the student's first classroom day back to school afte r absence unless the student makes alternate arrangem ents with the instructor. Clinical Phase Absenteeism and Tardiness. Absenteeism on clinical days will not be tolerated. A student is expected to arrive at clinical prepared to administer patient care. If a student is unable to perform required duties due t o health or other reasons, the student should not attend clinical. If for any reason the student cannot attend the clinical, the student must talk to the assigned g roup instructor no later than one hour before the scheduled start time. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 128 November 2016 Emergency messages w ill be conveyed from the school to the clinical area. At no time should family or friends call the healthcare facility where the student is assigned . Students who are absent or tardy during their scheduled clinical/simulation hours must contact the Directo r of Nursing or designee, prior to attending their next scheduled class/clinical time. Any additional absence or tardiness in the term may result in failure of the course and may jeopardize the student's ability to remain in the program. Absence from the c linical site on the first or last day of a rotation requires prior approval from the Director of Nursing. Clinical Protocol. Clinical experiences are scheduled in various local healthcare agencies and hospitals and are subject to change. Students are no t to provide personal telephone numbers or addresses to clients. Students are not permitted to accept gifts from clients, patients, or their families. Visiting patients, other than friends and relatives, is not permitted. Students are not permitted to frat ernize with any patient/agency employee while enrolled in school. Students may not visit any clinical facilities while wearing the student uniform (including the name pin) unless prior permission is granted by a nursing faculty member. Students may not rev iew any patient's chart except the patients assigned to them. Purpose. The practical nursing program will: Prepare a competent, beginning practitioner of practical nursing to function effectively in a variety of healthcare settings. Provide a collabora tive learning environment in which the students will demonstrate the ability to apply concepts of systematic reasoning through critical thinking. Guide the student in the continuing process of personal and professional growth. Continue to achieve its pur pose through systematic planning and evaluation by fostering mutually beneficial relationships within the community. Prepare students, through didactic and clinical experiences, to be eligible to take the NCLEX -PN exam. Philosophy. The following belie f of ECPI's faculty provides a foundation that guides the program of learning: The individual is a unique being. Nursing focuses on the bio -psychosocial -cultural aspects of an individual or family regardless of age, race, color, or creed. Individuals, fam ilies, and communities form a society for the purpose of monitoring human needs. Individuals interact within larger interdependent systems of the family, community, and society. Practical nursing as a discipline assists patients/families in the achievemen t of optimal function. Practical nursing is conceptualized as a dynamic health care service that blends science and the humanities with a caring response. Practical nursing education utilizes instruction in the basic sciences, communication skills, care -giving activities, critical thinking, concepts of the nursing process and collaboration, and prepares graduates who can focus on safe, patient -centered care using evidence -based practice. Following licensure, the LPN functions as a member of the health car e team performing dependent practical nursing actions, commensurate with his/her education and demonstrated competencies within the statute defined scope. They provide care to patients in a variety of settings. Learning is a self -directed, life -long, pers onal process resulting in a change in affective, cognitive, and psychosocial behavior. A collaborative practice environment in which the teacher and student share responsibility for the educational process enhances learning. The faculty plans, implements, and evaluates the curriculum in cooperation with the student. The curriculum model, which utilizes information to emphasize and value individuality, respects and responds to individual and professional needs. Practical nursing education is the integration of planned theory, critical thinking, and evidence -based clinical experience through which the student progresses within the practical nursing practice. ECPI UNIVERSITY Program Information ECPI University 129 November 2016 Conceptual Framework. Practical Nursing Hours.

Preceptorship Hours: Clinical hours are scheduled to meet the staffing schedule of the Professional Nurse assigned and may include day, night or weekend hours. Student Evaluation. The faculty use the objectives of the Program of Nursing as criteria for student evaluation. The student's grades are dete rmined by a combination of written examinations, laboratory/simulation competence, and clinical performance. Nursing ability, attitude, and relationship with others are areas of clinical and laboratory/simulation evaluation. The achievement of the student in both theory and clinical performance is evaluated by the faculty at regular intervals and shared with the student. The student progresses to the next term when all prerequisite courses have been satisfactorily completed. Students must achie ve an 80 percent average in all courses and satisfactorily meet all clinical objectives. A final course grade of less than 80 percent or f ailure to meet laboratory/simulation competence and clinical objectives will result in failure of a course.

ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 142 November 2016 ACADEMIC POLICIES For policies specific to the Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing, please see its Program Information section The following academic policies apply to all students attending ECPI University. Additional policies f or students pursing a graduate degree are included in this Catalog under the Graduate Program Policies. Students purs uing health science programs at the ECPI University College of Health Science, Medical Careers Institute, must also refer to their program handbook for additional policies. The following health science programs have program -specific policy handbooks: Dental Assisting, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Health Information Management, Medical Radiography, Nursing (diploma, associate's bachelor's and master's degree programs), Physical Therapist Assistant and Surgical Technology . ECPI University reserves the right to make changes at any time to academic programs. Updates and changes in policies and procedures may occur during your studies at ECPI University. Changes that may materially affect all students in your program of study, including any changes as to your financial obligations, graduation requirements, or substantial changes in curriculum, will be communicated by official notification to your ECPI University email account which all students are expected to monitor, and will additionally be posted in the Learning Management System accessed in your courses and distributed in class. A signature acknowledgment may be requested for significant polic y changes. If your program of study includes a program -specific policy handbook, pertinent changes in instructional policies or procedures will additionally be communicated to you via addendums to the handbook. To support student success on licensure where applicable, and employability as you near graduation, some courses include score requirements on a predictor, preparatory exam, or other comprehensive test. If there is a change to a course requirement, such as a change in the required score, the Univers ity will notify you at least one semester in advance, and this advance notice will be delivered to all affected students' ECPI University email accounts, the Learning Management System, and distributed in class. If a policy change is necessitated by exter nal parties such as programmatic accrediting agencies, state agencies, or to meet any regulatory requirements, students in the affected program will also be provided notice of the change through notification to your ECPI University email account, the Learn ing Management System, and distributions in class with new or revised requirements and the effective date. Certain substantive program, policy or procedure changes are intended to apply only to new students, with currently enrolled students in good standi ng grandfathered. However, if a student changes their program or has a break in attendance, all current policies in place at the time are required, except when military orders or other hardships apply. Students that change programs, and are therefore sub ject to a change in tuition rates, will be asked to accept any such changes in the terms of their Enrollment Agreement, and will be asked to sign a new Enrollment Agreement. Academic Calendar/Year Definition The University operates on a semester system and instruction is typically offered in five-week terms. Three consecutive five-week terms comprise a student's semester. The ECPI academic year is 24 semester credits and 30 weeks. A week is defined as seven consec utive calendar days beginning on Monday at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time and ending on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Based on the University's calendar, a term ends on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time of the fifth week. All coursework must be completed and submitted by the term end date, or as otherwise required by faculty. Academic Course Load / Overload To complete the program requirements in a timely manner, students must carry a minimum load of 12 semester credit hours and a maximum of 18 semester credit hours per semester . This course load is considered full time. The following minimum course loads apply to undergraduate students: Full time students: 12 semester credit hours Three -quarter time students: at leas t 9 semester credit hours Half-time students: at least 6 semester credit hours The maximum course load recommended for students is 6 credit hours (approximately 2 classes) per term; however, Career Orientation (COR090, COR101, COR191) may be taken as a third course without being considered an overload. Taking an academic overload is highly discouraged; however, a student can request additional course s on a limited, case -by- case basis. To be considered for an academic overload, the student must meet the following criteria: Completed at least 18 semester hours Earned at least a 3.2 GPA Submit ted the Academic Overload Request Form If the student seeks to enroll in an online course as part of the overload, the student must demonstrate competency within th e online environment by either satisfactorily completing the online orientation or by demonstrating successful completion of a previous online course. Students who take an academic overload consisting of more than two courses in a term may reduce their eli gibility for financial aid assistance in future semesters, which may result in greater out -of-pocket expenses . There will be an additional ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 143 November 2016 charge in the semester that the overload course is taken if the student takes more than 18 credits . Therefore, each s tudent is responsible for checking with the Financial Aid office to determine the impact of schedule changes. Academic Freedom ECPI University supports the freedom of the faculty and students to exchange ideas, examine all aspects of issues, and question assumptions in order to develop the skills and understanding necessary for graduates to qualify for employment in appropriate occupations and to assume positions as responsible members of a democratic society. The ECPI University Bo ard of Trustees requires the exercise of responsible judgment to ensure academic freedom at the University. Academic Scheduling A student may begin most programs during any semester; restrictions typically apply in programs in which a maximum number of students are specified. The required courses , course prerequisites , and clinical requirements, where applicable, may be found in each program description section of the Catalog . ECPI University seeks to graduate students on a ti mely basis. In an effort to assist students as they progress toward graduation, a combination of on -campus, online , and hybrid classes are provided. All students will be scheduled for a full - time course load each semester, unless other arrangements are made in advance or other circumstances intervene. Low enrollments or other factors may require the school to cancel or reschedule on -campus courses. In addition, some courses may not be offered on -campus within an academic year. Students who need courses that are not available on -campus may choose to take courses delivered online or in a hybrid format, if available. ECPI reserves the right to adjust class schedules to meet student needs and the availability of faculty, classroom, equipment, parking, and facili ties. Add/Drop Period The add/drop period refers to the period of time during which a student may add, drop , or reenroll late in a given term without academic penalty. Add/drops may occur only during Week 1 of the current term. Students who wish to add/drop classes must consult with the Academic Program Director prior to making any schedule changes. Depending on the class size and/or schedule, changes to an individual student's schedule may not be possible. Attendance Policy ECPI believes students should follow a policy of regular attendance and punctuality to receive the maximum benefit from an ECPI education and to develop the work habits and personal qualities highly valued by employers. Therefore, student s are expected to attend all regularly scheduled class meetings. The student should attempt to notify the faculty member assigned to the course by telephone or email in advance of any anticipated absence. Faculty and staff may likewise contact the student if the student is absent. On the first day of class for each course, the faculty member will make the course syllabus available, which includes the specific attendance policy and opportunities, if any, to make up missed assignments for that course. Please see the Late Assignments and Make up Tests and Re -tests section of this Catalog or the College of Health Science program handbook for specific program policies. Faculty members may request an Academic Review Board for a student whose absences from class in terfere with the student's ability to meet course objectives. Action may result in the student being removed from the course, probation, or suspension. If a pattern of excessive absences is identified, an Academic Review Board review may be conducted. Late Arrivals and Early Departures. Students are encouraged to contact the faculty member for the course by telephone or email if the student anticipates being late for class. Being tardy is defined as student arrival after class attendance has been taken. Leaving prior to class dismissal is considered early departure. Students are not allowed to disrupt academic processes and, at the faculty member's discretion, admission to a class may be denied to tardy students until the next class break. Late arrivals a nd early departures may affect a student's record of at tendance. Online Courses . Students taking online courses at ECPI University are expected to participate every week of the course. A variety of learning activities and assessments are required for succe ssful completion of an online course. Activities may be graded or ungraded. Only graded items are counted toward attendance. Activities which are graded may include posting to a graded discussion forum, submitting an assignment, quiz or exam. Students shou ld expect to academically participate in a co urse at least two times a week. Please note that certain course activities may be required but are not graded. For example, an ungraded Introduction discussion is required for certain courses but does not qualif y for attendance because it is an ungraded activity. Earning attendance does not constitute earning a passing grade. Online Class - Attendance in the online courses occur from Monday 12:00 am EST to Sunday at 11:59 pm EST . A student who does not earn atten dance by Sunday of Week 1 (11:59PM EST), will be unregistered from his/her course(s) for non -attendance. In addition, students must meet ECPI's minimum attendance requirements. A student who has not attended a course for more than 14 consecutive calendar d ays will be withdrawn from the course. A student who has not attended all courses for which s/he is enrolled for more than 14 consecutive calendar days will be administratively withdrawn from the University . ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 144 November 2016 Awards and Recognitions Awards are periodically presented to undergraduate students for academic achievement. These awards become part of a student's permanent record that is available for release to prospective employers. Dean's List . A student may be named to the Dean' s List for exceptional academic performance covering three consecutive terms designated by the local campus. The student must be enrolled at least three -quarter time for the three terms and have achieved a minimum Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 3 .7 for those same three terms . Attendance Award.

Students auditing courses are expected to fully participate in the course and class attendance is required. Audited courses will be reflected with an 'N/A' grade on the transcript. Students may be required to purchase supplies, textbooks, or uniforms, for the audited course. Financial aid is not applicable. There is no charge for a course audit. Course Requirements Requirements for each course are included in the course syllabus, which is reviewed wit h the class by the faculty member on the first day of the course . ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 145 November 2016 Course Waiver/Substitution A prerequisite course or a required (for -credit) course for a program may be waived or substituted upon the recommendation and a pproval of the appropriate Academic Program Director, Campus Director of Academic Affairs or the approval of the Campus President. Documentation of the waiver or substitution must be filed in the student's academic record. Credit/Contact Hours A class contact hour consists of 60 minutes with at least 50 minutes of scheduled instruction in a class, lab, lecture, test, examination, externship/internship, clinical or preceptorship experience. Occasionally, additional class contact hours may be required for class completion without additional credit. Credit for most ECPI courses in degree and diploma programs in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina are calculated on a semester credit hours basis, using the following conversio n: One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 15 lecture clock hours . One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 30 laboratory clock hours . One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 45 externship/ internship, clinical or preceptorship clock hours . Cred it for ECPI courses in practical nursing diploma programs in Virginia and South Carolina are calculated on a semester credit hours basis, using the following conversion: One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 30 lecture or laboratory clock hours One ( 1) semester credit hour is awarded for 45 externship/ internship, clinical or preceptorship clock hours Credit for ECPI courses in practical nursing diploma programs in North Carolina are calculated on a semester credit hours basis, using the following con version: One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 32 lecture or laboratory clock hours One (1) semester credit hour is awarded for 48 externship/internship, clinical or preceptorship clock hours . Grades and Grading Policies ECPI utilizes the following grading scale: Letter Grade Numerical Grade Equivalent Quality Points A 93 - 100 4 A- 90 - 92 3.7 B+ 87 - 89 3.3 B 83 - 86 3.0 B- 80 - 82Note 1 2.7 C+ 77 - 79 2.3 C 73 - 76Note 2 2 C- 70 - 72 1.7 D 65 - 69 1.0 F 64 and b elow 0 Letter Grade Other designations Quality Points AS Advanced Standing Not computed I Incomplete Not computed ME Credit for Military Experience Not computed NP Not Passed Not computed P Passed Not computed T Transferred credit from academic institution Not computed TO Tested Out Not computed W Attempted/ Withdrawal during add/drop Not computed WF Attempted/Withdrawal failed 0 WP Attempted/Withdrawal passed Not computer Any previous grading scale(s) are identified on the Transcri pt Key. Notes: 1. A score of 80 is passing for graduate students, Practical Nursing, core courses and COR101 in Associate Degree Nursing, and medical BIO courses including BIO105/ BIO105L Microbiology, BIO111/111L Anatomy & Physiology I with Medical Terminolo gy, BIO116/116L Anatomy & Physiology II with Medical Terminology. Grades earned below the minimum of 80 in all of the above courses will be awarded an F. 2. A minimum of 73 is required for courses with the following prefixes: DEN (Dental Assisting), DMS (Dia gnostic Medical Sonography), HIM (Health Information Management), HCA and LTC (Healthcare Administration), RAD (Medical Radiography), PTA (Physical Therapist Assistant), and SUR (Surgical Technology) programs. NUR courses in the BSN program require a minim um grade of 73. A minimum of 73 is required for the following courses: MTP115. Grades earned below the minimum of 73 in all of the above courses will be awarded an F. Withdrawal Grades. A student may withdraw without academic penalty from any course during the add/drop period of each term. The assigned grade of \"W\" is not included in the calculation of any grade point average. A student ma y withdraw after the add/drop period. The grade of \"WP\" or \"WF\" will be assigned and is determined by the grade earned at the time of the student's last date of attendance . Incomplete grades. Incomplete (\"I\") grade may be assigned at the faculty member' s discretion to permit the student time to complete required coursework which s/he was prevented from completing in a timely manner due to mitigating circumstances. The faculty member may require the student to ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 146 November 2016 document the request to assist in the decisio n. The \"I\" grade should be considered only when the student has the potential to earn a passing grade if the missing work is made up. To be eligible for an \"I\" grade, the student must have a passing grade in the course at the time of the request , based upon the required coursework up to that point and must have completed at least 75 percent of the course work. All incomplete work must be completed within the first week of the following term; exceptions must be approved by the Campus Director of Academic Aff airs o r his/her designee. When the work is completed, the faculty member will submit a grade change form with the final grade earned. If the work is not completed within the prescribed time frame, the \"I\" will automatically change to a permanent \"F\" grade. The student will be informed of the final grade assigned. Final grades . Once the grades are posted, they will become final on the last day of the following term's add/drop period, unless a student appeals the grade. See the Grades Report Appeals and Gra de Report sections of this Catalog for information on appealing a final grade. Grade Report Appeals A student who wishes to challenge a grade on a test/assignment or the final grade in a course must follow the steps outlined be low to appeal the grade: The student must first try to resolve the difference with the faculty member involved (online students should email the faculty member). If the faculty member agrees to the student's request, the faculty member will make the approp riate change in the grade book or submit a grade change through the Campus Director of Academic Affairs. If the student agrees with the faculty member's decision, the matter is considered resolved and no further action is taken. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached between the student and the faculty member, the student may submit a written grade appeal to the Program Director by the end of the add/drop period of the subsequent term . Upon the determination of the Program Director, if a satisfactory solution is not reached, the student has a final appeal available through the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee. This appeal must be filed within five calendar days of the Program Director's decision. The Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee will investigate the facts of the case and make a decision in writing regarding the grade within seven days of receiving the appeal. The decision of the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee regarding a grade a ppeal is final. Grade Reports of Dependent Students. Parents or guardians of dependent students are an integral part of the enrollment process and subsequent educational process and success of their child/dependent. ECPI wants to maintain a relationshi p with parents and guardians while developing a supportive working relationship with the student, which will be important to the student's professional and personal growth and development. A dependent student may request that his/her grade reports be sent to his/her parents or guardians by submitting a written request to the Student Records Coordinator. Grade Reports of Independent Students. Grade reports for independent students are available to the student only. However, an independent student may req uest that his/her grade reports be sent to his/her parents, guardians , or any other third party by submitting a written request to the Student Records Coordinator . Graduation Requirements To meet graduation requirements, und ergraduate students must: Provide proof of high school/GED completion; Complete a Graduation Exit Checklist ; Comply with the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy standards; Meet program attendance and residency requirements; Earn required hours, by passin g each subject required for the program; Achieve all applicable skill proficiencies; Comply with the financial terms of enrollment; and Satisfactorily resolve any outstanding obligations on the student account or library account. The University has the rig ht to set or change all academic standards and students are required to meet those standards to be considered as successfully completing their program. It is important that students confirm completion of all graduation requirements with the Campus Student Records Coordinator. Students also should confirm if any awards or special recognition are due at commencement prior to the commencement ceremony. Students should not assume they are graduating until they have completed the Graduate Exit Checklist and are cleared for graduation. Degrees and diplomas are processed approximately six to eight weeks after completion of all graduation requirements; however, official transcripts, diplomas and degrees will not be released until all financial obligations are met. Please see the Commencement section of this Catalog for information regarding the commencement ceremony. Honor Code The honor code at ECPI is based upon individual integrity. This code assumes that each student accept s his/her role in the academic community with a feeling of self -respect and duty. The Honor Code states: I pledge to support the Honor Code of ECPI and will refrain from any form of academic ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 147 November 2016 dishonesty or deception, such as cheating or plagiarism. I am aware that as a member o f the academic community it is my responsibility to turn in all suspected violators of the honor code. I understand that any failure on my part to support the Honor System will be turned over to a Judicial Review Board for review. I will report to a Judici al Review Board hearing if summoned. Each student attending ECPI is required to sign the Honor Code as part of his /her Enrollment Certification. Therefore, it follows that work submitted by a student must be his/her own work. Suspected violations of the Ho nor Code should be reported either to the Academic Program Director, Campus Director of Academic Affairs, or the Campus President. If the Judicial Review Board (refer to the Catalog section that defines this board) determines that a violation of the Honor Code has occurred, the offending student will be disciplined, up to and including involuntary dismissal from the University. Independent Study Independent study is defined as a non -traditional format for learning. It is an option designed to meet the needs of a student who must complete a course that would not otherwise be offered during a specific term. An independent study course meets the same learning objectives as the traditional version of the course. A student may be schedul ed for an independent study for a particular course if the student has no prior failures or withdraws for that particular course. Independent study is utilized only when no other course offerings are available or extenuating circumstances exist that would prohibit regular course completion. Enrollment in an independent study course is subject to the approval of the Campus Director of Academic Affairs. Not all of the University's courses are available for independent study. It is recommended that the student have a CGPA of 3.0 or above to be eligible for an independent study. Meetings with the faculty member are at the faculty member's discretion. Grading are as outlined in the course syllabus. Examination dates are on a schedule agreeable to both the faculty member and student. Independent study must be completed during the term in which it is scheduled . A student may not receive an \"I\" grade for a course scheduled as an independent study. Prerequisites for each course, as listed in this Catalog, must be successfully completed prior to enrollment in an independent study course. Textbook s and other support materials for a course scheduled as independent study are the same as described in the course syllabus. Late Assignments A student w ho has a documented, approved absence will have the opportunity to earn full credit for any missed assignments that are submitted late. Assignments turned in late due to a documented absence will be graded as initially assigned . A reasonable deadline for c ompletion of the late work will be established by the instructor. Late assignments due to an undocumented absence will lose 10 percent for each day the assignment is late. For example, if a student has an undocumented absence for Monday's class and submits the assignment on Tuesday, the highest grade the assignment can receive is a 90. If submitted the following class meeting (Wednesday in this case or 2 days later), the highest grade the assignment can receive is an 80. In online classes, the late assignme nt policy is located in the Online Policy and Procedures section of the learning management system. Please see the College of Health Science program handbook for late assignment policies applicable to the following programs: Dental Assisting, Diagnostic M edical Sonography, Medical Radiography, Nursing (diploma, associate's and bachelor's degree programs), and Physical Therapist Assistant. Late Registration Students seeking late entrance into a class must do so within the add/drop period of the term. The student is responsible for all work missed but will not receive attendance for days missed . Leave of Absence Policy ECPI offers undergraduate students who are in good standing the opportunity to reque st an academic leave of absence. The academic leave of absence is designed for the student who must temporarily suspend his/her academic endeavors at ECPI for one or more terms/semester, but intends to return at a later date. Reasons for granting a leave o f absence may include, but are not limited to, serious student medical problems, pregnancy, military duty (see section below on military leaves of absence), or the death or serious illness of an immediate family member. Students must submit requests for le aves of absence in writing to the Campus Student Records Coordinator or Student Success Coordinator. All requests must be approved. Leave of absence status must be requested before the beginning of the term for which the leave is desired. A leave of absenc e may extend until the next scheduled term or a longer period if approved by the University, up to a maximum of 180 days. If an additional leave of absence is approved, the combination of these leaves may not exceed 180 days within an academic year. While on an approved leave of absence, the student retains the right to use certain campus facilities, such as the ECPI Library. Make -up Tests Tests are typically announced in advance so that a student may prepare. Students must complete the required tests according to the stated schedule. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 148 November 2016 Students who miss an original (first administered) test for sufficient and documented reasons may arrange with the faculty member for that course to take a make -up test and receive full credit. Make -up tests will normally be given the day the student returns to school. Examples of sufficient reason include third -party written documentation of illness, medical , or dental emergencies ; work schedule conflicts ; military duty assignments ; court appear ances ; funerals ; or family emergencies. A make -up test is an examination of equal or greater difficulty given in a subject area. Only one make -up test will be allowed per course. A student or faculty member may request an Academic Review Board review if sp ecial circumstances indicate that an exception to this make -up test policy warrants consideration. Please see the College of Health Science program handbook s for specific program policies. Online Delivery of Courses/ Programs ECPI offers courses through the online delivery format for students who choose to attend completely online or for on - campus students who choose to enroll in one or more online courses to progress toward program completion. Some courses are of fered only online. On -campus student enrollment in online courses is subject to the approval of the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee. The tuition rate for online and residential courses is the same. The online and on -campus courses h ave the same course outcomes. Online courses are designed to take advantage of technology, making the learning environment accessible at any time. As with on -campus courses, students are expected to complete all work and submit assignments within the time period required by the faculty member and as provided on the course syllabus. Online courses are offered in a five-week term format . Each week of the term runs from Monday to Sunday. Online students are required to participate in the discussion assignments during the week. All assignments are due each week no later than midnight Sunday (Eastern Time). Online Courses. The course textbook requirements are listed under the \"Course Text Book\" link in each online classroom in the learning management system . Online students should anticipate extensive online communication with both faculty members and other students. Faculty may be contacted via email, telephone , text, or Live Chat in designed Live Chat courses . Students needing additional help may also conta ct their faculty member to request a tutor. Students are required to be proficient in using the Internet and to have the ability to manage information on the computer. Online students may also visit www.ecpionline.c om to access essential information, including academic advising and student support coordinators; computer requirements; technical support; key contacts; library resources; and tutorials and demonstrations. Online Identification Verification Process . To m aintain the integrity of the online coursework, ECPI utilizes an identification verification system that periodically poses a series of challenge questions via the electron ic learning management system. The first time a student is prompted by the ID Verifi cation System, the student is required to establish individual challenge questions. The student must respond with the correct answers to the challenge questions to access the associated assignment or assessment. Failure to answer challenge questi ons correc tly will cause the associated asses sment/assignment to be locked. The student must then contact his or her designated Student Success Advisor/Online Point of Contact to access the locked assessment. Repeated failure of an ID verification attempt and/or ref usal to answer the questions will result in further investigation that may include a Judicial Review Board. In addition to the ID verification, other online activities are reviewed to maintain integrity; for example, attendance logs, IP addresses, plagiari sm detection tools, special security settings, and start/stop times for online learning activities. Students enrolling in an online course are also required to carefully review the Student Electronic Communications Policy, the Student Conduct Policy, and the Honor Code section of this Catalog . Online Orientation. All students registering for an online course, regardless of whether the student is taking one course or an entire program, are required to successfully complete an online orientation prior to beginning class. Online orientation ensures each student has an adequate Internet connection, the required computer equipment, sufficient computer proficiency , and has the knowledge to navigate an online course. Online Student Services. Comparable stude nt support services are available for online students, including access to learning resources, financial assistance, career advising, and academic advising. Online Requirements for Hardware and Software. Students may be required to upgrade hardware and/ or software if completing their program through online instruction. The PC requirements link in the online classroom learning management system provides details on hardware and software requirements. Medical Assisting and Surgical Technology programs: Students who relocate to states in which the University does not have approval to operate may be adversely impacted in ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 149 November 2016 their ability to complete the program, obtain credentials, or gain in -field employment.

Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy - Undergraduate Programs ECPI University's Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy for Undergraduate Programs measures whether eligible undergraduate students are progressing at a responsible rate towards the completion of their educational objectives. Students must be in compliance with this policy in order to maintain their federal financial aid program eligibility. However, t his policy applies to all undergraduate students, regardless of participation in federal financial aid programs. The evaluation points contained in the policy are designed to help identify students who would benefit from an early intervention and/or remediation. Most critical is a student's ability to enroll in and complete courses successfully and ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 150 November 2016 consistently . Failure to complete courses successfully for any reason may negatively affect satisfactory academic progress. Failing courses or withdrawing from courses could also result in the loss of financial aid and academic dismissal. It is very important that students attend all registered courses and complete them successfully. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy ECPI calculates Satisfactory Academic Progress using cumulative grade point average and measurements that include incremental completion rate and maximum time frame at specified evaluation periods. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Grade Point Average (GPA) is a measure of scholastic performance. Students transcripts will include a term GPA and a cumulative GPA, which includes all coursework within the program of study. To calculate GPA: a) Multiply the total semester credits assigned for each course by total quality points associated with the grade earned; b) Total the grade po ints earned for all the courses (see the Grading Policy for grade points assigned to each letter grade); and c) Divide the total grade points earned by the total number of academic credits. The CGPA is rounded up to the nearest hundredth if the last digit is 5 or greater. It is rounded down to the nearest tenth if the last digit is less than 5 (For example: 1.95 = 2.0, 1.94 = 1.9). Example: Cumulative Grade Poi nt Average calculation Course Grade Credits assigned to the course Grade Points Total quality point for the course CIS 115 B+ 3 3.3 3 x 3 .3 = 9.9 ENG 110 A 3 4 3 x 4 = 12.0 BUS 102 B 3 3 3 x 3 = 9.0 CIS 107 L C+ 1 2.3 1 x 2 .3 = 2.3 CIS 107 B- 3 2.7 3 x 2 .7 = 8.1 FOR 110 A- 3 3.7 3 x 3.7 = 11.1 Total 16 Total quality points = 52.4 CGPA = 52.4 (total quality points) divided by 16 credits = 3. 28 Incremental Completion Rate (ICR) A student's ICR is calc ulated by: of credit hours attempted; Totaling the number of credit hours successfully completed; and Dividing the total number of credit hours successfully completed by the total number of credit hours attempted and expressing that as a percentage. Credits attempted are those credit hours that the student transfers from another postsecondary institution and any credit hours the student is registered for at ECPI at the conclusion of the add/drop period of each five -week term. All ECPI co urses for which a student is registered after that date will be included as credits attempted . Completed course work is defined as the total number of hours in which a student receives a grade of A, B, C, or D, regardless of whether the grade received is c onsidered a passing grade for the student's program. For the calculation of the ICR, there is no rounding of the percentage; therefore, if a student receives a 66.665%, and the requirement is 66.67% the student would not satisfy this evaluation point. Exam ple 1: After four semesters, a student has attempted 66 credits and successfully completes 40. The ICR is calculated by dividing 40 by 66, which equals 60.60%. The ICR requirement at the end of four semesters is 66.67% and the student therefore would not m eet the ICR requirement at this evaluation point. Example 2: After two semesters, a student has attempted 30 credits and successfully completes 15. The ICR is calculated by dividing 15 by 30, which equals 50.00%. The ICR requirement at the end of two semes ters is 50%; therefore the student meets the ICR requirement at this evaluation point. Undergraduate students must successfully achieve and maintain a 66.67% incremental completion rate of courses attempted credits by the end of the fourth semester and thereafter. Maximum Time Frame A student may not attempt more than 150 percent of the credits in his/her program (or remaining credits in his/her program in cases where the student brings in transfer credits from another institution ). In the case of advanced standing due to transfer credits from another institution , challenge exams, etc., the number of credits will be reduced to reflect the transfer courses from another institution and the maximum time frame is then calculated based upon those credits. The minimum number of credit hours required for an undergraduate degree at ECPI varies; therefore the maximum number of credit hours that a student may attempt will vary. Example 1: In an associate's degree program consisting of 60 seme ster credit hours, the student must complete the program within 90 attempted semester credit hours. Example 2: In a bachelor's degree program of 120 semester credits, the student must complete the program within a maximum of 180 semester credit hours. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 151 November 2016 The maximum timeframe always applies, to the program of study in which the student is enrolled . Students who exceed 150% of the program credits will be dismissed from the University. Academic Progress Table The Satisfactory Acad emic Progress Policy evaluation points, required quantitative and qualitative measurements, and the corresponding actions required for failure to achieve and maintain the required academic achievements are summarized in the following Academic Progress Tabl e: Evaluation Period Semester Required Minimum CGPA* Required Incremental Completion Rate Completion % of Credits Attempted Required action Academic Status These statuses apply to both aca demics and financial aid 1 1.50 40% of credits attempted Warnin g 2 1.50 50% of credits attempted Warning or Probation (if on Warning) 3 1.75 60% of credits attempted Warning or Probation (if on Warning) or Dismissal (if on Probation) 4 and each semester thereafter 2.0 66.67% of credits attempted Warning or Probatio n (if on Warning) or Dismissal (if on Probation) Change of Program For students who initiate a change of program, all courses that apply to the new program will affect the student's CGPA, Incremental Completion Rate, and Maximum Time Frame. Students who c hange programs must sign a new program enrollment agreement. Course Withdrawals A student may withdraw from an individual course or group of courses. A grade of W is awarded for all course withdrawals that are requested during th e add/drop period if attendance is posted. Students withdrawing from a course after the first week of the term through the end of week four will receive a grade of WP or WF, which is determined by the grade earned on their last date of attendance. A grade of F will be awarded for all courses dropped during week five. If a student is administratively withdrawn from a course, their last date of attendance is used to determine the grade awarded. Student who drop a course and do not replace it with another may have financial aid eligibility, veteran's benefits, or other financial aid impacted. In addition, changes may affect the student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Therefore, the student is responsible for consulting with Financial Aid and Academic Ad ministration to determine any implications of course load changes to their financial aid package or SAP. Credits Attempted The credits attempted total includes all courses for which a student receives a grade ( letter grades of \"A\" through \"F,\" a passing grade of \"P\" for non -foundational courses, an incomplete grade of \"I,\" and withdrawal grades of \"W\", \"WP\", and \"WF\" . Courses for which a student enrolls but then drops during the add/drop period at the beginning of a session are not counted as credits attempted for the Satisfactory Academic Progress calculation. In addition, all credit hours transferred to ECPI for the current enrollment are included and counted as credits attempted. Evaluation Period An eva luation period is used to determine academic progress. ECPI uniquely defines the evaluation period for each student, as the University employs a student -based semester system. At ECPI, each student's semester is uniquely defined as three (3) consecutive terms, which is 15 weeks. All terms and semesters of a student's continuous enrollment, whether or not the student received financial aid, are also included in the SAP review. In addition, all credit hours transferred to ECPI for the current enrollment for program changes are included and counted towards a student's maximum time frame . Foundational Courses Foundational courses are remedial courses required as a result of the admissions assessment; these courses are graded Pass/ Not Pass . Students who are required to take foundational courses (i.e., ENG099 and MTH099) are required to complete each course successfully in order to progress in the program. These courses are exempt from the calculations included in this Satisfactory A cademic Progress Policy, including Cumulative Grade Point Average, Incremental Completion Rate, and Maximum Time Frame. However, any student who is required to complete foundational courses will receive a Foundational Course GPA, as determined by the follo wing: Pass grade = 4.0 Foundational GPA Not Pass grade = 0.0 Foundational GPA Grade Report Grade reports are posted in the ECPI Student Portal following the completion of each term. Students receiving a failing grade may be required to meet with a Program Director or designee to develop an Academic Success Plan This plan may include actions such as mandatory tutoring, periodic advising , or a reduced course load. Interruption of Enrollment When a stu dent withdraws prior to graduation, the student may re -enter ECPI within five years (two years for nursing, physical therapist assistant, diagnostic medical sonography and medical radiography students) and retain full academic credit provided the courses are still applicable to the program. Clinical courses may require passing competency evaluations. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 152 November 2016 After one year, examination may be required when skill proficiency and significant curriculum changes are involved. Re-entering students will be charged tuitio n and fees at the rate in effect upon their return . Re-entering students will take the curriculum taught at the time of re -enrollment . Minimum Academic Requirements to Graduate The minimum academic requirem ents for a student to graduate are: CGPA of 2.0, 66.67% ICR, and completion of the program in no more than 150% of total program credits. Please see Graduation Requirements in this catalog for the complete list of requirements. Repeated Courses Students who are required to take foundational courses (i.e., ENG 099 MTH 099 , MTH 090 ) are required to successfully complete each course on the first attempt, in order to progress in the program. A student who is dismissed for failure to successfully pass a foundational course may reapply for readmission to the University through the Academic Review Board . Repeated courses due to course withdraw or failure. A course may not be repeated more than once without approval of the Campus Di rector of Academic Affairs or designated academic official. Grades achieved in courses that are repeated due to course withdraw al (W, WP) or fail ure (F , WF) will replace previous withdrawal or failing grades in the CGPA calculation . A pattern of course r epetitions could cause a student to fall below the minimum standard for satisfactory academic progress. A student who is approved to repeat a course due to a failing grade (F, WF) must successfully pass the course by the third attempt. After three failed a ttempts the student will be academically dismissed. When a course is repeated due to a failure, credits accrue only when the student attains a passing grade for that cou rse. Withdraw n grades assigned for course attendance beyond the drop/add period and fai ling grades are included in the maximum allowable time frame and ICR. Additional tuition charges apply when a student repeats courses. Student s who withdraw or earn a failing grade in a course should register for the same course in the subsequent term to improve his/her academic performance. Repeated course to improve a grade. A student may repeat a course to improve the grade and subsequently, his/her CGPA. In the case of repeated courses to improve a grade, only the highest grade earned will be calcu lated in the CGPA while all the credits attempted will be calculated in the ICR and Maximum Time Frame. Students are eligible for Financial Aid for only one repetition of a previously passed course. Please see the College of Health Science program handbook for specific program policies concerning repeated courses. Warning, Probation or Dismissal The Academic Progress Table demonstrates the evaluation points for CGPA and ICR; failure to achieve these milestones will re sult in a status change that provides the student with an additional semester to improve his/her academic standing. A student who completes his/her first semester and fails to meet the minimum requirements will be placed on warning; a student on warning remains eligible for financial aid. If a student who is on warning fails to achieve the required progress at the end any subsequent evaluation point of a warning period, s/he will be placed on probation or dismissed from the University. Probation may on ly be granted with a student's successful appeal with an Academic Review Board (ARB). A student who is on probation remains eligible for financial aid, however, a student may remain on probation for only one semester . If a student on probation fails to a chieve satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation point, the student will be dismissed from the University. A student will be removed from academic warning or probation when s/he meets the requirements for satisfactory academic progress. Please note that a student may be dismissed for academic reasons without previous academic action. In addition, at any given evaluation point, if it is determined to be mathematically impossible for the student to meet the academic requirements for graduation, t he student will be dismissed . Appealing an Academic Dismissal In order to re -establish eligibility for Financial Aid, a student must appeal an academic dismissal by reque sting an Academic Review Board (ARB). The writ ten appeal must state the mitigating circumstances that contributed to the academic determination or dismissal. The written appeal must be supported with appropriate documentation of the mitigating circumstances with explanation on how the circumstances have been remedied or changed. Mitigating circumstances are events that are outside the students control and are unavoidable. Examples of events that may be considered a mitigating circumstance and which has negatively impacted academic progress include but are not limited to: death of an immediate family member, student illness requiring hospitalization, divorce proceedings, previously undocumented disability, work -related transfer or change in work schedule during the term, natural disaster, financial hards hip such as foreclosure or eviction, and others. The student may be asked to appear in person during the review process when deemed necessary by the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or request an ARB. The appeal process ends with the Campus President. Appeals may result in any one of the following actions: Reinstatement on probation with an academic plan where the student will be held to specific requirements which must be met by the end of the next semester. Reinstatement after dismissal will be grant ed only if mitigating circumstances exist. Denial of reinstatement. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 153 November 2016 A student may appeal each academic determination or dismissal one time. A student who is granted an appeal may be reinstated and, if otherwise eligible, receive financial aid. The student must meet with the Financial Aid Advisor on campus to determine any changes to the student's financial aid. The above minimum standards for satisfactory academic progress will continue to be applied to assess the student's academic performance. Proc edures for Reentry/Readmission a fter Academic Dismissal A student who is denied an appeal is not eligible for reentry to the University for a period of one year. A student who is academicall y dismissed must appeal in writing to the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or the ARB for reentry (if within three months of dismissal ) or readmission (if one year or longer). If applying for readmission, the student must meet with the Campus Director of Academic Affairs at least two weeks prior to the start of the term in which the student wishes to return. Also, any student who ceased attendance and whose grades in the last term of attendance caused him or her to not meet the standards for satisfactor y academic progress must go through the same appeal process. The appeal procedure described in the preceding section applies. The student must demonstrate resolution to any mitigating circumstances. A reentry/readmission student who is granted an appeal ma y be reinstated and, if otherwise eligible, may receive financial aid. The student will be placed on probation at the start of the next academic term or upon re -entry and may be required to meet certain additional academic conditions as specified by the Ca mpus Director of Academic Affairs or the Academic Review Board in their decision to grant the appeal. The above minimum standards for satisfactory academic progress will continue to be applied to assess the student's academic performance. A student who has been dismissed and wishes to transfer to another ECPI campus must appeal his/her dismissal at the originating campus and receive reinstatement prior to the transfer. A student is allowed one reentry/readmission appeal after each academic dismissal . Veter ans Administration - Requirements for Satisfactory Academic Progress Academic Dismissal/Reinstatement and Veterans' Benefits in South Carolina. Veterans who are reinstated for benefits after academic dismissal who fail to attain a GPA of at least 2.0 during that term will be placed on academic dismissal for one semester (three terms). Non-degree seeking students. Students taking a University course in a Non -Degree status and receiving veterans educational benefits must maintain a 70% or a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) in each course to be considered making satisfactory academic progress. If a student does not make a 70% or a 2.0 GPA in any course, the student will be dis missed from enrollment and will be reported to the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) for unsatisfactory progress. If a student is absent for 3 consecutive days in any course, the student will be dismissed from the University, assigned a failing grade, a nd will be reported to the Department of Veterans Affairs for Unsatisfactory Progress. If a student is dismissed due to Unsatisfactory Progress, the student must wait a period of 30 days to be eligible to re -enroll in a course. Classes that are successful ly completed may not be certified again for VA purposes if they are repeated. Transcripts Students and alumni may request official transcripts of the academic work completed at ECPI by submitting an Official Transcript Request Form or order online at www. getmytranscript. org. Due to federal privacy laws, a signed request is required to release a transcript. A ll requests must include the required processing fees. The following non - refundable fees apply to official transcript requests: Normal Processing $5. 00 per transcript, 7 -10 business days. Expedited Processing $10.00 per transcript, 3 -5 business days. Electronic Delivery $6.00 per transcript, 48 hours Transferability of Credit In the U.S. higher education system, transferability of credit is always determined by the receiving institution, taking into account such factors as course content, grades, and the school's accreditation and licensing. ECPI University is accredited by the Southern A ssociation of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate's, baccalaureate, and master's degrees and diplomas. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges is an accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education. However, the fact that a school is accredited is not necessarily an indication that credits earned at that school will be accepted by another school. Students considering continuing their education at or transferring to other inst itutions must not assume that credits earned at ECPI will be accepted by the receiving institution. An institution's accreditation does not guarantee that credits earned at that institution will be accepted for transfer by any other institution. A student who is considering a future transfer is encouraged to contact the receiving institution, as early as possible, to determine what ECPI credits, if any, the institution will accept. ECPI University does not imply, promise, or guarantee transferability of it s credits to any other institution. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Poli cies ECPI University 154 November 2016 Withdrawals - from the University The following definitions apply to the various types of withdrawals that ECPI uses in its policies: Academic Withdrawals. See Satisfactory Ac ademic Progress Policy in this catalog for information on academic withdrawals. Administrative Withdrawals. A student who has not attended classes for more than 14 consecutive calendar days will be administratively withdrawn. Student -Initiated Withdrawa ls. To officially withdraw from the University, the student must contact someone in Academic Administration to provide notification of his/her intent to withdraw . New students who withdraw from the University prior to the end of the first week of class will have no attempted courses shown on their academic record s. Student s officially withdrawing from the University during week one of a term will receive a grade of W for all current courses if attendance is posted. Students officially withdrawing after the first week of the term will receive a grade of WP or WF, which is determined by the grade earned at the time of the withdrawal. A grade of F will be awarded for all courses dropped during week five . Withdrawals and Veterans Benefits. The Veterans Administration will pay through the last day of attendance for a course from which the student withdraws . Veterans should consult with the Veterans Administration for more information. Graduate Program - Academic Policies All University policies ap ply to students purs uing a graduate degree, unless otherwise noted differently below. Academic Course Overload Due to the workload required for classes there are no course overloads permitted at the graduate level. Academic Load Classes are scheduled on a fixed -term, semester credit hour basis. For financial aid and academic progress purposes, an academic year is 30 weeks and 18 graduate credits. Full -time graduate students may take no more than nine (9) semester credit hours per semester. Enrollment status changes may affect the financial aid eligibility of students. Students are responsible for checking with the Financial Aid office to determine the impact of schedule changes. ECPI res erves the right to adjust class schedules to best meet student needs, faculty, classroom, equipment, parking, and facility availability. Attendance and Participation The expectations at ECPI are similar to the workplace where employees are expected to arrive at work each day prepared to add value. As such, attendance and participation in the class is critical to success in the course and students are expected to attend each regularly scheduled session. If the student i s absent, it is his/her responsibility to contact the faculty member and arrange for any make -up work assignments. Excessive absences may result in the termination of enrollment in a course and a grade will be assigned in accordance with the grading polici es. Grading Policies During the first two classes of a course, a student may voluntarily withdraw without grade penalty and the course will appear on the student's transcript as W (withdrawal). After the first three days, if the st udent drops a course, a grade of F is assigned. In cases where there are extenuating circumstances and the student can provide sufficient documentation, a late withdrawal may be permitted without grade penalty and assigned a W. The grade of I (incomplete) is only used in unusual circumstances where major projects are submitted at the end of the course. A grade of I is given for incomplete work. An \"I\" grade will remain until the work is completed and the grade is submitted by the faculty member or until on e week has elapsed after the end of the term in which the grade of \"I\" was received. At the end of the elapsed week, the \"I\" grade becomes a permanent \"F\" and will not be changed. When a failed course is repeated , only the grade in the repeated course counts in the student's grade point average. When a student drops a course and receives an F, the F is replaced by the higher grade earned. The grading policies and scale for graduate programs are identical to those for undergraduate programs, except as noted below. All Graduate courses require a \"B -\" or better to be considered applicable toward degree completion and students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of a 3.0 or better to remain actively enrolled in the graduate program. Students w ho receive two grades of \"C+\" or below, at any time during the program, will be dismissed. A student must re - take a course for which a grade of C+ or below was earned. ECPI UNIVERSITY Academic Policies ECPI University 155 November 2016 Graduation Requirements To meet graduation requirement s, students must: complete a graduation checkout sheet; be in compliance with satisfactory progress and academic standards with a CGPA of 3.0 or greater and have passed each course with a grade of B - or better; meet program attendance and residency require ments; earn required hours; achieve all applicable skill proficiencies; be in compliance with financial terms of enrollment and; have no outstanding obligations on the student account or library account . Transcripts, degrees, and diplomas are processed approximately four to six weeks after completion of all graduation requirements. Independent Study Independent Study is not available to be used in graduate course delivery. Late Registration Late registrat ion is not available for graduate courses. Repeat Status Students who have failed a course (or received a C+ or below) are eligible to repeat it once as scheduling permits. A repeat may be approved by the Dean when it is satisfactor ily determined that a student would benefit from repeating a class. When a failed course is repeated, only the grade in the repeated course counts in the student's cumulative grade point average and will appear on the student's transcript. Students who rep eat a course will be charged the current tuition for the course and must assume the responsibility for all associated fees. Repeating a course may interrupt the student's enrollment and may negatively impact financial aid eligibility and academic progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress - Graduate programs To be in good academic standing with the college and to be eligible to receive Title IV financial aid, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress. At the end of each semester, each student is evaluated on thre e components to determine if s/he is maintaining satisfactory academic progress: Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) Students enrolled in graduate -level programs must maintain a minimum CGPA of 3.0. Incremental Completion Rate (ICR) Students enrolled in graduate -level programs must complete a minimum of 66.67% of the cumulative credits attempted at the end of each semester to be making satisfactory academic progress. Maximum Time Frame Students must complete the entire program within 150% of the standard program length . Under no circumstances will a graduate student be permitted to continue past the maximum time frame or graduate with a CGPA of less than 3.0. Probation. A student will be placed on p robation if he/she fails to meet any one of the criteria listed above. The student will have one semester to meet the requirements for satisfactory academic and return to good academic standing. If at any evaluation point it is determined that it is mathem atically impossible for the student to meet the minimum requirements, the student will be dismissed from the University. Student Orientation The University is committed to student success; therefore, new students are required to attend a mandatory two -part orientation.

The student has one term (5 weeks) to provide the official high school transcripts; if official tran scripts are not received, the student will be dismissed. Students who have attended a postsecondary education institution that is accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and who have completed a associates degree or higher may use their official postsecondary school transcript to establish proof of high school graduation/GED. In cases where documentation of an applicant's completion of a secondary school education is unavailable, e.g., the secondary school is closed and info rmation is not available from another source such as the local school district or a State Department of Education, or in the case of homeschooling, the parent(s)/guardian(s) who provided the homeschooling is deceased, an institution may accept alternative documentation to verify the applicant's high school completion status. All applicants who have attended secondary school outside of the United States must provide a credential evaluation for all secondary (and if applicable, post -secondary) transcripts submitted to ECPI as part of the application process. ECPI will only accept credential evaluations completed by a credential evaluation organization which is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). For more informatio n concerning NACES member organizations, refer to their website at www.naces.org. If any applicable official academic records have not been prepared in English, a complete and official translation of the transcript is also required. Students who have obtai ned their secondary school (or postsecondary) education in any language other than English must provide evidence of English proficiency (refer to the English Language Proficiency Policy in this Catalog).

ECPI University does not accept experiential cred it earned through work or non -academic training for transfer academic credit. It may be necessary for students to forfeit some previously earned credit in the transfer process since college programs vary and programs outcomes may be modified. ECPI Universi ty makes no promise of acceptance of credits from or to other institutions. ECPI University requires that a student complete a minimum of 25% of their program of study at the University in order to receive the degree or diploma. Academic Coursework. ECPI U niversity welcomes applicants who have started their postsecondary academic programs at other schools and who have satisfactorily completed coursework that is applicable to the University's academic programs. The University has established the following po licy and procedures to ensure that appropriate academic experience is considered for applicable transfer credit. Official transcripts must be received directly from the former institution within a student's first semester or no transfer credits are granted . In rare situations, with the approval of the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee, an exception to the timeline may be granted. Transfer of Credit Procedures. Any student who wishes to have their previous academic coursework considered for transfer credit must provide the Campus Director of Academic Affairs with a written request or the Transcript Evaluation Form on or before the first day of the first term in which the student commences enrollment at ECPI. The letter must be accompanie d by a signed Request for Official Transcripts form and any fees required by the issuing institutions. The Campus Director of Academic Affairs will review the request with faculty, as necessary, to determine the transfer credit award. The University will c onsider the following academic coursework for transfer credit. Coursework from Regionally Accredited Schools. The coursework from a regionally accredited school is applied toward completion of the student's program as transfer credit. The University will c onsider coursework for transfer courses in which the student achieved a C or better as the final grade, that were completed within the past ten years, and that are established to be equivalent in content and objectives to courses offered at the University. Applicants may request an evaluation to determine general education credit transfer without a time limitation . Transfer credit is counted as both hours attempted and hours completed within the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. ECPI UNIVERSITY Admis sions Policies ECPI University 161 November 2016 Transfer credit does no t hold any qualitative points. Therefore, transfer credit is not included in the calculation of the grade - point average for the purpose of determining a student CGPA or the CGPA requirement of the satisfactory academic progress. Course work from Nationally Accredited and non -regionally accredited CHEA Recognized Schools. Credit for courses from nationally accredited institutions and CHEA recognized schools which are substantially equivalent in content to ECPI University courses and are applicable to an appl icant's program of study may be granted on a course -by-course basis or applied toward completion of the student's program as advanced standing credit . Transfer credits are granted only for courses in which a grade of C or higher was earned (2.0 on a 4.0 sc ale). Courses graded on a pass/fail can be considered for transfer credit if there is documentation that the passing grade is equivalent to a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Advanced standing credits reduce the overall timeframe for program completion. Advanced standi ng credit does not hold any qualitative points. Therefore, advanced standing credit is not included in the calculation of the CGPA for the purpose of determining a student's satisfactory academic progress. Technical and other c oursework, regardless of accr editation. For technical coursework and selected arts and sciences courses , regardless of accreditation, applicants may seek advanced academic standing through faculty assessments that involve demonstrations of knowledge, proficiency, and skill. Faculty me mbers determine what program goals have been achieved by applicants and the comparability to course learning objectives. In lieu of faculty assessments, applicants may take challenge examinations , and study guides are available to assist in the preparation for testing. The coursework accepted from non -regionally accredited or non-CHEA recognized institutions are applied toward completion of student's program as advanced standing credit. Advanced standing credits reduce the overall timeframe for program comp letion. Advanced standing credit does not hold any qualitative points. Therefore, advanced standing credit is not included in the calculation of the CGPA for the purpose of determining a student's satisfactory academic progress. Upon successful completion of assessments related to the relevant coursework, students are awarded advanced standing credit toward the completion of their program. These advanced standing credits are not counted as hours attempted nor as hours completed within the Satisfactory Acade mic Progress Policy. Advanced standing credit does not hold any qualitative points. Therefore, advanced standing credit is not included in the calculation of the grade -point average for the purpose of determining a student's satisfactory academic progress. ServSafe Certification. Students pursuing a degree or diploma within the College of Culinary Arts may apply for advanced standing credit for ServSafe Certification. The student must have completed formal sanitation training and received a ServSafe\u00ae Food Handler Certification from the National Restaurant Association within two years of expected start date of the program and apply for advanced standing prior to matriculation. Students who meet this requirement will be given advanced standing credit for C AA 115 Kitchen Essentials. Students who receive this advanced standing may be required to demonstrate the knowledge, proficiency, and skill required in the course. The advanced standing credit will be awarded to the student's transcript upon successful completion of the pre - or co -requisites of the course. Advanced standing credits reduce the overall timeframe for program completion. Advanced standing credit does not hold any qualitative points and, therefore, is not included in the calculation of the C GPA for the purpose of determining a student's satisfactory academic progress. Coursework from International Institutions . Upon receipt of an official transcript, transfer credits from non -U.S. colleges/universities are evaluated and granted on a course equivalency basis. The Campus Director of Academic Affairs or his/her designee must receive an evaluation of official transcripts by a credential evaluation organization which is a member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACE S; see www.naces.org) attesting that the courses are equivalent to courses earned at a regionally accredited institution of higher education in the United States. Transfer credits are granted only for courses in which a grade of C or higher was earned (2.0 on a 4.0 scale). The course s from international institutions are assigned a transfer credit grade and are accepted toward completion of student's program. Transfer credits from international institutions are not counted as hours attempted nor as hours completed within the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. Transfer credit grades do not hold any qualitative points. Therefore, transfer credits are not included in the calculation of the grade -point average for the purpose of determining a student's satisf actory academic progress. Prior to granting transfer of credit for any course, the University reserves the right to test applicants or request that they successfully pass an examination administered by an ECPI University faculty member.

The University notifies the student and the Department of Veteran's Affairs regarding the credit granted and the amount of time the education/training period has been shortened proportionally. American Council on Education (ACE) credits . The American Council on Education (ACE) was created in 1942 to recognize the educational value of military training and experience. Since that time ACE has continuously evaluated military schools, correspondence courses and occupations to determine the amount an d level of academic credit each should be awarded. Through ACE, academic credit may be available for most of the military training received, including Basic Training. The ACE military evaluations program is funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) and coo rdinated through DANTES. Visit the ACE Military Programs website, http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/default.aspx for more information. ECPI UNIVERSITY Admissions Policies ECPI University 164 November 2016 The first step to claiming the credits is a formal request for a transcript from the appropriate military service. Each military service will provide unofficial personal copies and send to ECPI an official copy of the transcript at no charge. Each service branch has their own system for recording military education and expe rience credits: Army. The Army uses the Joint Service Transcript (JST) system, which automatically captures academic credits from military training and standardized tests. The JST system is available to enlisted soldiers only. Army Officers must use the form DD 295 (Application for Evaluation of Learning) to report their military training and experience. Navy and Marine Corps. The Navy and Marine Corps use the JST system. This system automatically captures training, experience and standardized test scor es. The Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) automatically captures training, experience and standardized test scores. Transcript information may be viewed at the CCAF web site. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard Institute (CGI) requires each service member to submit documentation of all training (except correspondence course records), along with an enrollment form, to receive a transcript.

ECPI UNIVERSITY Financial Aid Policies ECPI University 166 November 2016 FINAN CIAL AID POLICIES For policies specific to the Accelerated Bachel or of Science in Nursing, please see its Program Information section Financial aid is available to help qualified students pay for their education. ECPI offers many financial aid options to help students and their families determine the best way to pay for an education. ECPI is committed to helping each student find the best solution to meet his/her needs and pursues this educational investment. Student aid is awarded based on the applicant's need and factors such as income, assets, and benefits. Financial aid applications and a guide to financial aid are available from the Financial Aid Department. The guide provides general information regarding eligibility, application processes, and Federal financial aid programs. Financial aid application forms are to b e completed and submitted to a Campus Financial Aid Administrator. Students receive a financial aid award letter when their application for financial aid has been processed that states the type, amount, and conditions of financial aid offered. The number of credits a student attempts each term also affects financial aid eligibility. Students are required to apply for financial aid each academic year (two semesters). Forms are available in the financial aid office. Students receiving financial aid must main tain satisfactory academic progress (p. 150) as indicated in this Catalog in order to retain eligibility for both Federal and ECPI financial assistance. Most ECPI students make monthly in -school payments to the University. The in -school payments reduce the amount of money students borrow and must repay after they graduate or withdraw. Definition of Financial Need Financial need is defined as the difference between the cos t of attending school and the student's (and/or the family's) expected family contribution (EFC). A Central Processor to whom the student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is submitted conducts determination of the EFC, based on federal gu idelines. The School's Financial Aid Director or staff then determines the student's Cost of Attendance, which generally consists of tuition and fees and average living expenses based on nationally published data . The federal need formula can be stated as follows: Cost of Attendance - EFC - estimated financial assistance not received under Title IV = Financial Need . Financial need determines eligibility for different sources of student aid. Eligibility Requirements In gen eral, an applicant to ECPI is eligible to apply for Federal Title IV financial assistance if the following criteria are met: Be a United States citizen or national; U.S permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen; or a citizen of the Freely Associated States. Have a valid Social Security Number or, for citizens of the Freely Associated States, a pseudo SSN assigned during the FAFSA application process . Have financial need, for some sources of student aid . Have a high school diploma ; a recognized equiv alent of a high school diploma, such as a General Education Development (GED) or certificate; or have completed secondary education in a homes chool settings . Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student at ECPI for the purpose of obtaining a degree, or certificate offered by ECPI University. Make satisfactory academic progress as outlined in the school policies herein. Sign a statement on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) certifying that you 1) will use federal and/or st ate student financial aid only to pay the cost of attending an institution of higher education, 2) are not in default on any Federal Student Aid loan and do not owe an overpayment on any Federal Student Aid grant, or have made satisfactory arrangements to repay them, 3) will notify your college if you default on a federal student loan and 4) will not receive a Federal Pell Grant from more than one college for the same period of time. Have not exceeded annual or aggregate loan limits. Males must be register ed with the Selective Service, unless exempt under Selective Service guidelines . For the Pell Grant program eligibility, the student may not have previously earned a bachelor's , master's, or first professional degree. For Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized a nd Direct PLUS Loan program s, the student must be enrolled at least half-time Applicants under the age of 24 are considered to be dependent by federal definition and are required to have parental participation in completing the financial aid forms and the financial aid process. An applicant has the right to appeal all financial aid decisions. Such appeals must be in writing, made to the Director of Financial Aid within 10 calendar days of the date of the decision. The Financial Aid Director and the Campus President will review all appeals and inform the applicant of ECPI UNIVERSITY Financial Aid Policies ECPI University 167 November 2016 the University's decision within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the appeal. Financial Aid Received Prior to Attending ECPI Federal regu lations require an institution to determine all previous Federal Title IV aid received by the student prior to disbursement of funds. When a FAFSA is processed, Central Process System matches students against the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). ECPI will review all NSLDS data reported by each school at which a student was previously enrolled. Financial aid awarded at other schools could limit the amount of financial aid available at ECPI. Loan Default Prevention Students are responsible to repay, in full, all loans used to pay for their education. Repayment of student loans helps ensure the availability of loan funds for the future. Borrowers are encouraged to take the responsibility of loan repayment seriously. Some helpful hints on avoiding delinquency are as follows: Send in the required payment each month even if a bill was not received. Send in larger or additional payments to reduce the amount of interest paid on the loan. Be sure to indicate that the extra a mount should be applied to the principal or used as a future payment. Remember that overpaying one month does not mean that the next month's payment can be skipped or that it will be reduced. Call your lender/servicer immediately if the payment will not be made on time or in cases of financial hardship. The lender/servicer may be able to work out an alternative plan. Know the deferment rights. After sending in the necessary forms, follow up with the lender/servicer to confirm that the appropriate loan(s) has been deferred. Understand the borrower's rights and responsibilities under each loan program. Keep all paper work such as promissory notes, lender correspondence, cancelled checks, etc. Always call to resolve a discrepancy. Never ignore correspondence or requests for payment from the lender/servicer. If a default does occur on the loan(s), in spite of all the arrangements available to prevent this from happening, one or more of the following repercussions may occur: The default status may be reported t o a national credit bureau and have a negative effect on credit ratings for seven years. Deferment possibilities may be lost. Wages may be garnished. Federal and state income tax refunds may be withheld. Ineligibility status for any further federal or stat e financial aid funds. The entire unpaid amount of the loan, including interest and cost of collection, may become due and payable immediately. Students may obtain additional information about loan repayment and default prevention guidance from the Financi al Aid Office.

The Return of Title IV calculation is delayed if Student provides written confirmation, on or b efore the last day of attendance, of an expected re -entry date before the end of the current semester. The calculation for the return of Title IV aid funds is determined by Student's last date of attendance. The number of days completed is divided by the n umber of days in the Semester to identify the percentage of time Student has completed. This would be the percentage of aid earned by Student. If Student withdraws at 60% or more of the current Semester, no return of the Title IV aid funds for that period is required as Student is considered to have earned 100% of the Title IV aid funds received. If Student's last date of attendance is before completing 60%, this percentage if multiplied by the total amount of Title IV aid received or could have been receiv ed (for this period) to arrive at the amount of earned aid. The difference between the amount of earned aid and the amount of Title IV aid is the amount of unearned aid. Pell Grant awards will be recalculated to the eligible amount based on any changes to the enrollment status before being pro -rated as required by the U.S. Department of Education, which often results in a significant reduction in Pell Grant eligibility. Amount of aid ECPI is responsible for returning. Institutional charges ( tuition , books a nd, fees for the entire Semester) are multiplied by the percentage of unearned aid to determine the amount ECPI is responsible to return. The amount ECPI is responsible to return is compared to the total amount of unearned aid; the lesser amount is then re turned to applicable student aid program (see below for refund order). This refund amount is then charged to Student's account and depending on the results of the Refund Policy, it is possible to have a tuition balance owed to ECPI for the unpaid portion o f tuition , books, and fees. Unsubsidized Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Direct Loans Federal Perkins Loans Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) for which a return of funds is required Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, for which a return is required ECPI UNIVERSITY Financial Aid Policies ECPI University 169 November 2016 Amount of unearned aid Student is responsible for returning. Student is responsible for returning any portion of the unearned aid that is not part of the required return from ECPI University. Any unearned aid that came from Title IV loans, Student will be responsible for repaying those funds according to the terms of the promissory note . Payment of Refunds. Any refunds due under the foregoing provisions to the Student who properly cancels, withdraws, is discontinued, or fails to return from an approved leave of absence, will be refunded within 60 days of the last date of attendance or within 60 days of the date Student failed to return from an ap proved leave of absence. Refunds due per the U.S. Department of Education will be made within 59 days of the last date of attendance or 45 days from the date of official withdrawal, whichever is earlier. Refunds due by Student to other entities will be mad e within their required timeframes, but never more than 60 days after the last date of attendance. Special Cases. In case of prolonged illness or accident, death in the family, or other circumstances that make it impractical to complete the program, ECPI U niversity shall make a settlement that is fair. Students who have not visited ECPI University prior to enrollment may withdraw without penalty within three (3) days following either their scheduled class orientation or following a tour of ECPI University a nd its facilities, whichever is later. Students eligible for military benefits are charged and refunded according to funding source guidelines. Credit Balance/Refund. ECPI University will not issue a check for a credit balance or a refund that is less than $1.00. Renewal Applications Students must reapply for financial aid in each new academic year. In some cases , this may require the completion of a Renewal FAFSA. Renewal -eligible students automatically receive a renewal remin der by e -mail if they provided an e - mail address in the previous application year.

Tuition and direct academic costs are assessed for one academic year. Living expenses are estimated using nationally approved living expense guidelines. These components of the cost of attendance are estimat es and will vary from student to student depending on the program, course load, and the student's living arrangements (students living with parents or living on their own). For specific details on calculating cost of attendance, contact the Financial Aid D epartment. Verification Requirements for Verification. Federal regulations require that application data be matched against several databases: those of National Student Loan Data Service (NSLDS), Central Processing Service (CPS) , The D epartment of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). An unsuccessful match to any of these databases will require students and/or parents provide documentation to validate their current status. For any failed database match, your Financial Aid Administrator will advise you of the documentation required and which must be provided to be eligible for financial aid. Some student aid applications are al so subject to a process called verification. This process involves documenting the information submitted on the student's Free Application for ECPI UNIVERSITY Financial Aid Policies ECPI University 174 November 2016 Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and verifying that the information is correct. The procedures governing verification are as follows: School Policy for Timeline in Completing Verification - The School will complete the \"Notification of Verification Document Required Form\" and email or meet with students in person to explain what is required. Verification is required t o be completed before the start of a program or within 30 days of notification . Under extenuating circumstances the Institution may, at their option, accept completed verification documentation after the above deadline. Other federal deadlines may also apply. Students who do not complete verification in the above time frame may have a delay or loss of subsidized financial aid and may be prevented from registering for subsequent classes. Acceptable Documentation: The Department of Education publishes an annual notice announcing the FAFSA information that an institution and an applicant may be required to verify for an applicant selected for verification by the Department, and the acceptable documentation for that information. If an application is selected for verification by the Central Processing System (CPS), the resulting Student Aid Report (SAR) will indicate that verification is required. In addition to this, ECPI University may choose to select an application for verification. In either case, stude nts will be notified of the documentation required to complete the verification process by their Financial Aid Administrator. Applicant's Rights and Responsibilities in Regard to Verification. Each applicant has the right to be informed that s/he has been selected for verification and the responsibilities associated with verification selection. Consequences for not meeting those responsibilities, are explained in detail orally, and when deemed necessary by the University or if requested by the applicant, presented in writing. Correction to Information. All conflicting data must be resolved and if, as the result of verification or another documentation process, it becomes necessary to correct any of the information on an ISIR, the student may be required t o make a correction or the Financial Aid Department , with acceptable documentation will submit the corrections electronically to the U.S. Department of Education. A new ISIR, showing the corrected information is then generated. Applicants may be required t o verify correctness and sign the revised ISIR. If corrections result in a change in eligibility, students will be advised and a revised award letter will be reviewed for approval. If ECPI has reason to believe that any application has been intentionally s ubmitted under false or fraudulent pretenses, such application will be referred to the Federal Office of the Inspector General. Note: Failure to provide required information could result in a new student being denied admission to ECPI University, and a student already attending classes could be dismissed for failure to meet financial obligations to the school .

Each student is responsible for investigating the details of the certification or licensure laws in any state(s ) and/or municipalities where s/he is considering employment. These laws typically require that an applicant possess good moral character and report any prior criminal convictions. Any student or graduate who has a prior criminal conviction may experience limitation or denial of employment opportunities, professional licensure, or externships. Academic Program Directors and Career Services can provide resources to facilitate the student investigations. Externships Externships are career -related work experiences that result in academic credit upon completion. Externships are usually non-paid work experiences that occur at locations similar to where students may be employed upon graduation and require advanced approval by the Academic Program Director. Externships provide students the opportunity to dress appropriately and to perform wo rk professionally while demonstrating achievement of program -related learning objectives. Students are encouraged to begin working with the Academic Program Director and/or Academic Advisor at or prior to the beginning of the student's last semester in or der to facilitate timely scheduling of their externship.

The Infection Control Manual for the Health Sciences Division is available for reference. Published policy and procedures are available at campus. Computer Usage , Electronic Device, and Software Policy Cell phones and other portable electronic de vices must be turned off during class time to minimize classroom disruptions and protect the integrity of test -taking situations. Exceptions to this policy will be made for faculty -initiated technology and for emergency personnel who are on call, such as police, fire, EMS. These emergency personnel must notify their faculty member of their need for such devices at the beginning of the term and provide documentation verifying their occupation. In the event that a student is emergency personnel and is on -call during the test leaves the classroom and returns to the classroom, the student may not complete the examination. In these cases, the faculty member will make arrangements for re -testing. The use of personal laptop computers, tablets, and other note - takin g devices are acceptable during class. The instructor may, however, require laptop computers or tablets to be turned off at certain times. Computer users are expected to maintain standards of academic ethics. Users are not to access the private files of others. Using another student's user ID, password, program, or application constitutes invasion of privacy and may be considered grounds for enrollment termination. University computers and equipment are to be used only for ECPI applications related to edu cation. Access to computers and equipment must be approved by appropriate academic personnel . Only ECPI personnel are authorized to install programs on the computers. Students are prohibited from installing or using an unauthorized program on ECPI computer s.

Software P rotection. ECPI generally obtains the right to use computer programs written or distributed by third parties pursuant to license agreements with the vendors, who retain ownership of the programs. These agreements usually prohibit copying of the licensed material, with very limited exception. Software programs are usually restricted to use on only one machine at a time. If the University wishes to use a program on more than one piece of equipment concurrently, it typically must pay additional fees to obta in additional licenses. The same requirements generally apply to manuals and other printed materials that accompany such software. Computer programs and related printed materials also are afforded copyright protection under Federal law. The Federal Copyrig ht Act specifically prohibits copying or distributing software without the owners' prior consent (except copying for archival purposes). Individual Responsibility. Unauthorized duplication, distribution, or disclosure of software or its accompanying printed materials can be both a violation of the applicable license agreement and a violation of Federal law. Individual employees and students, as well as the University, can be held liable for violations and be required to pay substantial damages. It is th e responsibility of each employee and student to respect the intellectual property rights of the owners of the software programs used by the University and to ensure that no breaches or violations of the University's software control procedures occur. Com pliance Policies. It is the policy of the University that only properly acquired and licensed software be used on the University's computer equipment.

Although expected professional dress varies by field, students should dress professionally when engaging in job search activities such as interviewing, networking, externships, or professional events including career fairs. Each campus of ECPI University has a designated Professional Dres s Day. By focusing on personal appearance, the required professional dress days will help students learn what constitutes professional dress attire and become more comfortable in professional dress attire . Drug -Free Workplace and Campus In accordance with Public Law 101 -226 (Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989), ECPI pursues and promotes a comprehensive program to prevent and correct the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students. The use of illicit drugs and alcohol can lead to physical and psychological dependence and damage, behavioral changes, and possible death.

Family Educa tional Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education record s. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are eligible students. As noted above, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student once the student turns 18 years old or enters a postsecondary institution at any age. However, although the rights under FERPA have now transferred to the student, a school may disclose information from an \"eligible ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 186 November 2016 student's\" education records to the parents of the student, without the stu dent's consent, if the student is a dependent for tax purposes. Neither the age of the student nor the parent's status as a custodial parent is relevant. If a student is claimed as a dependent by either parent for tax purposes, then either parent may have access under this provision. Parents and Eligible Students Rights include The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day ECPI receives a request for access. A parent or eligible student should submit to the Campus President a written request that identifies the record(s) the parent or eligible student wishes to inspect. The ECPI official will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspec ted. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the parent or eligible student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the parent or eligible student's privacy rights under FERPA. A parent or eligib le student who wishes to ask ECPI to amend a record should write the ECPI official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the parent or eligible student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If ECPI decides not t o amend the record as requested, ECPI will notify the parent or eligible student in writing of the decision and the parent or eligible student's right to a hearing, conducted within the procedures established for Academic Review Boards in ECPI's catalog, r egarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any inf ormation from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99.31): School officials with legitimate educational interest; Other schools to which a student is transferring; Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes; Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student; Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school; Accrediting o rganizations; To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law. A school offi cial is a person employed by ECPI in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom ECPI has contracted as its agent to provide a se rvice instead of using ECPI employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting an other school official in performing his or her tasks; and in order to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena or court order. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for ECPI. Upon request of another school, ECPI also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. ECPI has designated the following types of i nformation as directory information: the student's name, address, telephone number; date and place of birth; honors, awards and certifications; and dates of attendance. Parents and eligible students may request that the school not disclose directory inform ation about them by contacting the Campus President of the ECPI location that the student is currently attending or has previously attended. Written consent must state the purpose of disclosure, specify records to be disclosed, identify those to whom the d isclosure may be made, and must be signed and dated. ECPI Presidents will provide direction for these requests. The student has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by ECPI to comply with the requi rements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202 -8520 Phone 1.800.USA.LEARN (1.800.872.5327) Individuals who use TDD ma y use the Federal Relay Service http://www.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen Fire Emergency The fire alarm will sound if there is a fire or other emergency necessitating building evacua tion. Upon hearing the alarm, everyone is to leave the building by the nearest exit. In multi - story locations, use stairwells (not elevators).

Instructional Resources Each program requires that students use certain textbooks and supplies as part of the enrollment in the program and are issued to students as they begin each course. Students are responsible for their books and must purchase an additional book in the event of damage, loss, or theft. If students change a course for any reason, the student is responsible for any additional charge necessary if a different textbook is required. Required textbooks , including e -texts, may be included in the student's financial aid. Each student is responsible for providing his /her own supply of notebooks, copy paper, calculator, pens, pencils, etc. as needed. Certain programs require program -specific supplies.

Intellectual Property Subject to the following c onditions, a student will retain ownership rights to works created by the student as a class assignment or as part of a pro -bono commission approved as a student project by an instructor. A pro -bono commission is work that an instructor may approve for st udents to undertake as a skill -building opportunity. Students may receive nominal consideration provided by the person or group that commissions such a work. For purposes of clarification, the University agrees that all rights of intellectual property and other ownership rights in a work created by a student will belong, as between the University and the student, to the student only if all of the following conditions respecting such work are met: The work is not derivative of or otherwise infringe upon any other University -owned intellectual property right.

The Verbiage/definition of each offense comes directly from the VAWA amended version of the High er Education Act (revision made in 2014).

ECPI University (the \"University\") is a user of many communications and information technologies. These technologies, when properly used, support educationa l activities and enable closer and timelier communications within the University and with employers. There is a continuing evolution of associated laws and conventions governing acceptable use of electronic communication tools and careless use can have dra matic consequences, harming the University, our students, employers, and employees. The policies outlined below are intended to minimize the likelihood of such harm by educating our students. These policies address the appropriate use of electronic communi cations tools at the University. These tools include the following: University -supplied software Email accounts University -supplied fax machines, modems, and servers University -supplied computers University -supplied network tools (like browsers and Interne t access facilities) Use and Misuse of Communications Tools Access . Access to University communications tools is provided in conjunction with the University's academics and the student's responsibilities. U se of these tools is subject to this policy and to other University policies and procedures. University communication tools may be made available to individuals who are not University students (e.g., visitors). Use of these tools by such persons is subject to this policy and to applicable agreement(s). Communication tools and all messages produced, stored, or carried by such tools are University properties, and are subject to reasonable University inspection. Acceptable Use . In the course of the student's academic study, each student may use communications tools to communicate internally with University faculty, staff, or students or externally with students, employers, and other business acquaintances. The University provides these electronic communication s tools to facilitate educational communications and to enhance the learning experience. While these resources are primarily used in academics, there may be occasion to use these facilities for personal purposes. Personal use is permitted so long as it doe s not interfere with the academic process, consume significant resources, interfere with the activities of other students or faculty, or violate these policies. Under no circumstances shall such facilities be used for personal financial gain, or to solicit others for activities unrelated to the University's academics, or in connection with political campaigns or lobbying. The Campus President may make available or otherwise authorize special -purpose bulletin boards and web pages in connection with Universit y-approved social events, sporting events, and other sanctioned activities. When making use of these University -provided facilities for personal use, always remember that there is a very limited expectation of privacy (see discussion in 3 below). In additi on to other restrictions and conditions discussed here, ECPI communications tools may not be used for any of the following: To carry any defamatory, discriminatory, or obscene material; In connection with any infringement of another person's intellectual p roperty rights (e.g., copyrights and trademarks); In a manner that violates the terms of any applicable telecommunications license or any laws governing trans -border data flow (e.g., laws dealing with data collection, protection, privacy, confidentiality, and security); In connection with any attempt to penetrate computer or network security of any University, company, or other system, or to gain unauthorized access (or attempted access) to any other person's computer, email or voicemail accounts or equipme nt; or In connection with the violation or attempted violation of any other law. The University understands that web \"surfing\" may be academic -related and serve a legitimate academic function, but the potential for abuse exists. The Internet provides acces s to a huge amount of information and resources that can greatly enhance our ability to deliver services efficiently to our students. Today there is no single, comprehensive directory of resources available for the Internet and users sometimes must \"naviga te\" through much unneeded information to reach useful material. The University encourages exploration of the Internet for legitimate academic -related or professional activities, but students may not \"browse the web\" during class (unless authorized), create personal \"Home Pages,\" or otherwise use University facilities to access Internet sites for reasons unrelated to the University's academic requirements. Representing the University in Personal Postings . The information you publish electronically (sometime s called a \"Posting\") reflects on the University in general. Despite all disclaimers that a student may make (e.g., that the views are personal and do not reflect those of the University) readers elsewhere will make the association between these personal postings and the University. The student should know that true anonymity is very difficult to obtain when using these tools. While Internet relay chat (\"IRC\"), newsgroup visits, and net surfing sometimes appears to be done anonymously (e.g., by employing ps eudonyms), accessing such services/servers through the University's network facilities normally leaves an audit trail indicating at least the identity of the University proxy server (and may leave a trail pointing directly to the ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 191 November 2016 student). Inappropriate us e of University facilities may damage the University's reputation and could give rise to University and individual student liabilities. Accordingly, each student should make every effort to be professional in all usage of University communications tools. Because readers may interpret personal postings to newsgroups as an official statement of the University, posting any article in a newsgroup related to the University's academics is strictly prohibited unless approved in advance by the Campus President. Unacceptable Content . Although the University does not regularly monitor email or electronic messages, please be aware that even personal email messages may be viewed publicly or by University administration without further notice. Under no circumstances may any posting, voice mail or email originating at the University be in violation of the letter or the spirit of the University's Equal Employment Opportunity or Student Non -Harassment policies. Examples of unacceptable content include: Sexually explicit mes sages, images, cartoons, or jokes; Propositions, requests for dates, or love letters; Profanity, obscenity, slander, or libel; Ethnic, religious, or racial slurs; Political beliefs or commentary; or Any other message that could be construed as harassment o r disparagement of others based on their sex, race, sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability, or religious or political beliefs. Everyone should be aware that sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, or other unwelcome conduct (including comments) of a sexual nature. The standard for sexual harassment is whether the recipient could reasonably consider the message to be offensive \u2014the sender's intentions are irrelevant. In addition to prohibitions on sending or uploading offensive materials, University communications tools (email, browsers, newsreaders, etc.) also shall not be used to access or download obscene materials or other content that may be illegal under local law. Electronic Forgery . Elec tronic forgery is defined as misrepresenting the student's identity in any way while using electronic communications systems (e.g., by using another's email account without permission, by so -called IP spoofing, or by modifying another's messages without pe rmission). For example, messages written by others should be forwarded as - is and with no changes, except to the extent that the student clearly indicate where you have edited the original message (for example, by using brackets [ ] or by using other charac ters * * * to flag edited text). Electronic forgery is not allowed for any purpose. For email messages, the student may not take any action to misrepresent the identity of the person responsible for the message. A student may send email messages using anot her person's account, but only with prior express approval from the account owner, and only when the text of the message indicates that the author is different than the email account holder. For newsgroup postings, you may not misrepresent the identity of the sender, but you may (as may sometimes be appropriate) make postings on an anonymous basis. (Keep in mind that true anonymity may be quite hard to obtain, and that most such attempts at least leave an audit trail that identifies the University as the so urce of the posting.) Intellectual Property . The Internet offers a universe of information, useful in conducting and furthering business operations. The student must always respect copyrights and trademarks of third parties and their ownership claims in images, text, video, and audio material, software, information and inventions. Do not copy, use, or transfer others' materials without appropriate authorization. Be aware that downloaded software and other copyrighted material may be subject to licensing ob ligations or restrictions. In cases where it is possible that the software might be used by University administration or faculty in curriculum or service development or might be incorporated into final curriculum or services, it is critical that these lice nsing obligations be understood and strictly observed. Even when software is labeled freeware or shareware, there may be licensing restrictions that prohibit or limit the usage or commercialization of such items. Any questions may be directed to the Campu s President. Transmitting Confidential Information . Confidential information (whether owned by the University, its students, its vendors, or other persons) is not to be disclosed to unauthorized persons without prior authorization. The question of authoriz ation will be a function of the type and ownership of the confidential information (e.g., different authority may be required for disclosure of University -owned information than for student -owned information). Also, authorization for disclosure may be limi ted to certain specific individuals within the University (e.g., on a need -to-know basis). In some cases, posting or emailing confidential information that relates to new curriculum, teaching methods, research, or University services can constitute a \"publ ication\" and prevent the University from applying for approvals or later treating the information as \"proprietary.\" These consequences can follow even from postings or distributions that are not to the general public. Generally, absent encryption or other security measures, confidential information should not be contained in email sent to outsiders or posted to newsgroups, and should not be placed on University communications tools that are available to third - parties. Encryption . Only authorized encryption tools (software and hardware) may be used in connection with any University communications tools. Except with the prior written consent of the appropriate IT manager, all such tools must implement ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 192 November 2016 key-recovery or key -escrow techniques to permit the Univer sity to access and recover all encrypted information. Remember that possession and use of encryption tools may be subject to complex laws or outright prohibitions in certain localities. Also, the export and import of computers carrying such tools may be su bject to local regulation. Limits of Privacy Retention and Security of Messages . Email and voicemail messages, and computer -stored items all are University property and business records, and may have legal and operational effects identical to that of traditional, hard -copy documents. Accordingly, all email messages should be treated as though they may later be viewed by others (while confidential information may be contained in such messages, they should be created with the same c are would be used in creating hardcopy documents). Remember that no electronic communications facility is completely secure. This means that information stored on or carried over University communications tools may be the subject of accidental or intention al interception, mis -delivery, attack, or authorized University review. When stored on computers, email messages and other files typically are subject to routine backup procedures. This means that copies of these files may be retained for long periods (in accordance with backup recycling and document retention procedures). Also, many site -wide backup systems do not guarantee privacy of backup copies (e.g., system administrators may have access). A Limited Expectation of Privacy . The University respects the personal privacy of its students. However, because communications tools are provided for the University's academic purposes, student rights of privacy in this context are quite limited. Students and others should have no expectation that any information tr ansmitted over University facilities or stored on University -owned computers is or will remain private. These systems are owned and/or controlled by the University and are accessible at all times by the University for maintenance, upgrades, or any other business or legal purposes. Students who use University communications tools should be aware that our firewall (and other security tools) creates an audit log detailing every request for access in either direction by each user. Also, in the course of their duties, system operators and managers may monitor student use of the Internet or review the contents of stored or transmitted data. The University permits personal use of all these communication tools on the express understanding that it reserves the righ t (for its business purposes or as may be required by law) to review student use of, and to inspect all material created by or stored on, these communications tools. Use of these tools constitutes each student's permission for the University to monitor com munications and to access files that are made on or with these communications tools. University Access to Computers, Voicemail, and Email Systems. University administration may routinely examine students' communications or files. Such examination generall y may be expected to occur in the following circumstances (which are not intended to be all -inclusive): Ensuring that University systems are not being used to transmit discriminatory or offensive messages, or in connection with the infringement or violatio n of any other person's rights; Determining the presence of illegal material or unlicensed software; Counteracting theft or espionage; Ensuring that communications tools are not being used for inappropriate purposes; Responding to legal proceedings that ca ll for producing electronically stored evidence; Locating, accessing, and retrieving information in a student's absence; and Investigating indications of impropriety. Consequences of Violating Policies. Misuse of any University communications tool or v iolation of these policies may result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension and dismissal from the University. Questions/Changes to Policies. Questions regarding these policies may be directed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the University President. The University intends generally to observe these policies but also reserves the right to change them at any time without prior notice. The University will make reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes. Student Cond uct Policy A student is subject to disciplinary action up to and including withdrawal/ termination for: Acts of dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating on quizzes, tests, papers, hands -on homework documentation, or other assignments; or plagiarism. Fraudulent activities including but not limited to willful misrepresentation by a student concerning qualification for admission, continuing eligibility as a student, eligibility for financial aid, current enrollment information, status or position at ECPI. Forgery, alteration or misuse of school documents, records or identification. The unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit or prescription drugs on campus. Possession, use, intoxication, or being under the influence of alcohol while on campus. Possession of firearms or other weapons on campus. Gambling on campus. ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 193 November 2016 Any act or threat of physical assault or intimidation directed toward any member of the school community or any other individual on campus. Sexual h arassment or hazing as described in the Student Non -Harassment Policy and Anti -Hazing Policy. Theft or attempted theft of ECPI property, or any theft on campus. The defacing or destruction of ECPI property. Use of indecent, illegal, disruptive language and /or actions Insubordination in carrying out instructions of faculty or staff. Any refusal to abide with or violation of federal, state, or local regulations. Smoking in unauthorized areas. Continued violation of the ECPI dress code. Furnishing false inform ation to/for or against any student, faculty member, or ECPI employee. ECPI believes in the use of progressive discipline (verbal warning, written warning and dismissal). However, depending upon the circumstances (i.e., collective student history, serious ness of conduct, issues of safety, facts surrounding the conduct, etc.), ECPI University reserves the right to use or not use progressive discipline. Student Consumer Information The Student Consumer Information regulat ions of the United States Department of Education require colleges to provide students with access to information they are entitled to as a consumer. Our goal is to provide each student with complete and easy access to this information and to inform you an nually of the availability of this information. This information may also be found on the ECPI University website, www.ecpi.edu/consumers/and other links on the website, requested from our campus staff, and provided in paper form on request. Any requests f or information under this service should be sent to info@ecpi.edu . Student Contact Information Each student is provided with an ECPI email address to facilitate communication between the University and the student. It is essential that students notify the campus Student Records Coordinator immediately of any changes to their name, address, telephone number or email address. Upon graduation, it is mandatory that students who have loans through Title IV funding to notify ECPI of any changes to their address and phone number. Student consents to receiving notifications regarding all required consumer information (safety reports, curriculum updates, receipts for federal assistance, academi c progress, financial aid counseling, etc.) via his/her ECPI assigned email account which can be access from any PC at ECPI and elsewhere Student Grievance Procedures ECPI University is committed at all times to providi ng an educational experience which is conducive to the personal and professional growth of each student in a comfortable, student - oriented environment. As part of that commitment, the University has developed procedures designed to ensure that its students have a meaningful and fair opportunity to pursue any grievance they may have, whether the grievance relates to an academic matter, a non -academic matter or any other facet of their University experience. These procedures are as follows: Students are encou raged to make every possible effort to resolve a grievance on an informal basis through discussion(s) with the faculty or staff member whom the student believes will be most knowledgeable about the matter at hand. If for any reason the student is not comf ortable pursuing those discussions with such faculty or staff member, the student may choose to discuss the issue with another faculty or staff member chosen by the student or recommended to the student by his or her Department Head, the Campus Director of Academic Affairs or the Campus President. All University faculty and staff members are required to treat each student grievance in a professional manner and to endeavor to resolve all grievances fairly and swiftly. Students at all times have available to them on a 24/7 and unlimited basis access to the MySafeCampusTM resource. MySafeCampusTM is a third -party anonymous and confidential incident reporting service available to all University students. A student may contact MySafeCampusTM by telephone at 80 0- 716-9007 or online at www.MySafeCampus.com. More information on MySafeCampusTM may be found in the Student Services section of the Catalog. If following the pursuit and conclusion of the procedures described in the immediately preceding paragraphs the grievance remains unresolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the student, the student is invited to submit a written request (formal grievance) for further review. Any such written request must be submitted by the student no later than fifteen days foll owing the conclusion of the informal procedure described above and must be directed, at the student's option, either (a) to the student's Campus Director of Academic Affairs or to the Campus President or (b) to the University President. ECPI University wi ll strive to keep all grievances confidential but cannot guarantee confidentiality. Under some circumstances, a release in respect of confidentiality may be needed in order for a grievance to be properly investigated and resolved in a timely manner. Unle ss submitted through the MySafeCampusTM system, anonymous grievances will not be acted upon. ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 194 November 2016 Contact information for the University President is as follows: By mail: President, ECPI University5555 Greenwich Road; Virginia Beach, VA 23462 By email: president@ecpi.edu The following minimum details must be included in any such written request: a description of the issue, including all relevant details such as dates and identities of other individuals involved a description of the student's efforts to r esolve the subject dispute prior to the written submission, such as details including dates of, locations of and other individuals attending meetings conducted in the course of the informal procedure described above reason(s) why the result of the informal procedure described above is unsatisfactory to the student the student's name, student identification number and contact information The individual to whom such submission is directed will be required to ensure that any such submission be reviewed and that a written decision with respect to such submission be rendered as promptly as practical and made available to the student in question. The student will be required to cooperate with all reasonable requests of such individual should additional informati on or meetings with the student or other appropriate individuals become necessary in the course of this review. If after the taking of all of the above steps the student remains dissatisfied with the resolution of the student's grievance, the student has a vailable to him/her the resources of the applicable external organizations and agencies to which further pursuit may be addressed. Contact information for all such entities is available in the University Policies section of the Catalog and varies dependin g on the specific physical or online campus location of the University attended by the student. Students are referred to their Enrollment Agreement for information regarding Arbitration through the American Arbitration Association. The complete Arbitratio n policy (p. 181) also may be found in the University Policies section of the Catalog. Student Non -Harassment Policy It is the ECPI University policy to promote an educa tional environment that is free of harassment, including sexual harassment, in any form. Sexual harassment (including sexual discrimination) of students occurring in the training environment or in other settings in which students may find themselves in con nection with the school is unlawful and will not be tolerated. Further, any retaliation against an individual who has complained about sexual harassment or retaliation against individuals for cooperating with an investigation of a sexual harassment complai nt is similarly unlawful and will not be tolerated. Please note that this policy sets forth our goals of promoting a training environment that is free of sexual harassment and discrimination. The policy is not designed or intended to limit our authority to discipline or take remedial action for conduct that ECPI deems unacceptable, regardless of whether that conduct satisfies the definition of sexual harassment. In addition, the school reserves the right to dismiss any student who willingly and knowingly ma kes false allegations of sexual harassment. Definition of Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment means sexual advances, sexual discrimination, requests for sexual favors, and verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: submission to or rejection o f such advances, requests or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of enrollment or as a basis for education or training; or such advances, requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a s tudent's education by creating an intimidating, hostile, humiliating or sexually offensive environment. Under these definitions, direct or implied requests by a staff or faculty member for sexual favors in exchange for actual or promised grades or status c onstitute sexual harassment. No member of ECPI faculty or staff, or any designated agent or third party of ECPI , or student at ECPI shall in any form or to any degree, engage in sexual harassment. The legal definition of sexual harassment is broad. In add ition to the above examples, other sexually -oriented conduct, whether it is intended or not, that is unwelcome and has the effect of creating an environment that is hostile, offensive, intimidating or humiliating to male or female students may constitute sexual harassment. While it is not possible to list all those additional circumstances that may constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples of conduct which if unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment depending on the totality of the ci rcumstances and/or the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness: Unwelcome sexual advances, whether they involve physical touching or not; Sexual epithets or jokes; written or oral references to sexual conduct; gossip regarding one's sex life; comment on an individual's body; comment about an individual's sexual activity, deficiencies, or prowess; Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons, or graphic verbal commentaries about an individual's body, dress or habits; Unwelcome leering, w histling, brushing against the body, sexual gestures, or suggestive or insulting comments; Inquiries into one's sexual experiences; and, ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 195 November 2016 Discussion of one's sexual activities. Other Forms of Harassment. Verbal abuse, insulting comments and gestures, and other harassing conduct are also forbidden under this policy when directed at an individual because of his or her race, color, sex, sexual orientation, familial status, age, religion, ethnic origin, or disability. It is the responsibility of each employee and each student to conduct him or herself in a professional manner at all times and to refrain from such harassment. Complaint Procedure . Students who feel they have been harassed should follow the Student Complaint Procedure (outlined in this catalog. All complaints regarding harassment of any kind should be directed to either your Campus President or the ECPI Title IX Coordinator: Cheryl Salter, Human Resources, csalter@ecpi.edu; 757-671-7171, ext. 55223 Promptly after learning of such alleged conduc t, ECPI will conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether prohibited harassment has occurred. Efforts will be made to ensure confidentiality to the extent consistent with the goal of conducting an appropriate investigation. Students who initiate or participate in such investigations in good faith will be protected against school -related retaliation. In the case of allegations of sexual harassment, the University will promptly investigate to determine what has occurred and will take necess ary steps to eliminate the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and correct its effects, regardless of whether the person who was harassed files a formal complaint or otherwise requests action. The investigation will be conducted in such a way as to maintai n confidentiality to the extent practical under the circumstances, and will be conducted in a fair and expeditious manner. The investigation will include a private interview with the person filing the complaint and with witnesses. The school will also inte rview the person alleged to have committed sexual harassment. In addition, ECPI will inform the person filing the complaint that federal regulation prohibits retaliation and that if s/he is afraid of reprisals from the alleged harasser, the school will tak e steps to prevent retaliation and will take strong responsive actions if retaliation occurs. All allegations of sexual harassment will be investigated within 10 business days of the initial complaint. The Title IX coordinator will notify the student who h as filed a complaint of sexual harassment of the findings within five (5) business days upon making a final determination by sending a written copy of the findings by certified mail to the student's address that is on file with the School. Disciplinary Act ion. If it is determined that inappropriate conduct has been committed by an employee or student, ECPI will take such action as is appropriate under the circumstances. Such action may range from counseling to termination of employment or dismissal from school, as applicable, and may include other such forms of disciplinary action as appropriate under the circumstances. State and Federal Remedies. In addition to the above, if a student believes s/he has been subjected to sexual harassment, s/he may file a formal complaint with the federal or state government agency set forth below. Using the ECPI student complaint process does not prohibit a student from filing a complaint with these agencies. Each of the agencies has a six - month time limit for filing a claim .

Grade reports are furnished at the end of each term. Student Responsibilities ECPI students are considere d to be responsible adults and are expected to maintain the standards of conduct appropriate to an academic and business environment. It is the student's responsibility to: Conform with ECPI policy, procedures, and regulations ; Maintain security and academ ic integrity, Maintain academic progress and satisfactory attendance, Submit course work on time, and Pay tuition as scheduled. Student Rights Students in good academic standing have access to all instructional facilities and service s, including classes, laboratories, library, tutoring, advising, etc. Students have the right to inquire about, and to propose, improvements in policies, regulations and procedures affecting the welfare of students through student surveys, MySafeCampusTM , campus clubs and organizations, and University offices. ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 196 November 2016 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 provides safeguards regarding the confidentiality of, and access to, student records, and this Act will be adhered to by the University. See the heading Family Education and Privacy Act (FERPA) for more detailed information. Students may appeal results of tests, examinations, or other grades by the end of the add/drop period of the subsequent term. ECPI decisions affecting a student may be appeale d by requesting a review board hearing. Students may record class lectures only with the approval of the faculty member assigned to the course. Students with Disabilities Policies and Procedures ECPI University does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in admission or in access to our programs, services and activities, in accordance with our obligations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. Admission of Students with Disabilities The University will make admission decision s using criteria which do not consider an individual's disability, but rather, the student's individual qualifications, to meet the essential elements of the program, service or activity being offered, assuming the incorporation or use of the appropriate a cademic adjustments/ auxiliary aids and services, if necessary. Students with disabilities desiring to enroll in any program, service or activity of ECPI University must be able to meet the minimal standards of the University and of the particular program , service or activity to which admission is sought. Definitions A person with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including, but not limited to, caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, learning, walking, seeing, hearing, breathing, and working; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment. Although disclosure of a disability may not be necessary or appropriate for some person s, those who seek academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services from ECPI University must follow the procedure outlined below. Procedure for Requesting Academic Adjustments/Auxiliary Aids and Services Students requesting academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services must take the initiative to seek assistance, comply with deadlines and agreements, and participate in the following procedure: 1. Contact the Campus President or Campus Director of Academic Affairs (\"CDAA\") ECPI University students requestin g academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services should contact their Campus President or CDAA. The Campus President or CDAA will meet with the student to discuss the student's disability, the impact and functional limitations of the disability in the ac ademic setting, and the proposed academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services. 2. Provide Medical or Other Diagnostic Documentation The student will provide acceptable medical or other diagnostic documentation that supports the request for academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services. Acceptable documentation includes a report from a qualified professional explaining the disability, the impact or functional limitations in an academic setting, suggested academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and servic es, and the expected duration of the disability and requested academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services. The documentation provided should be current (e.g., within 3 years of the student 's enrollment in the University.) Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and 504Plans generally do not contain sufficient information. In all cases, the University may request additional diagnostic information and assessment when, in its opinion, such additional information is needed to document the existence of a disability or the need for academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services in the educational or clinical settings of ECPI University. Review of the Academic Adjustments/Auxiliary Aids and Services Request All requests for academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services (e.g. extra time and/or separate room for exams, etc.) are evaluated on a case -by-case basis, using an interactive process. This evaluation includes the review of medical or other diagnostic documentation and a determination of the reasonablen ess of the academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services . Medical or other diagnostic documentation provided by the student is kept confidential and is released to a third party only with the student's written permission or as required by law. General i nformation about a student's disability and, academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services may, however, be shared with other ECPI University administrators or third parties with a legitimate need to know (e.g. clinical sites, externship sites, etc.) Th e student's disabilities file is maintained by the Campus President and is held separately from the student's official academic record. Students with disabilities may request academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services at any time, however, the Campus President or CDAA must have time to review and approve the request (generally 2 -3 weeks) although some requests for academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services take more time to review than others. Therefore, students requesting a cademic adjustments/ auxiliary aids and services request s are encouraged to contact their Campus President or ECPI UNIVERSITY University Policies ECPI University 197 November 2016 CDAA as soon as possible after they have enrolled with the University. Academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services will not be made on a retroactive basis. Beca use practical training in many of our programs may take place in a variety of settings - classroom to clinical - academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services granted on admission may not be appropriate for all settings; the Campus President or CDAA, in collaboration with other University administrators with a legitimate need to know, may review with the student, as needed, academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services for each class or setting as the student progresses through the curriculum, to avoid compromising or fundamentally altering the essential components of a particular course or program. Although a student's academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services histories are important, other factors are considered as well in determining what, if any, academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services are appropriate now at ECPI University. The receipt of particular academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services in a previous setting does not automatically mean that identical academic adjustment s/auxiliary aids and services will be provided here. The Campus President or CDAA has the responsibility to review each student's documentation conscientiously and diligently in carefully considering the student's request for academic adjustments/auxilia ry aids and services. When the Campus President or CDAA has completed the evaluation and has determined that the student's disability has a current functional impact on his or her academic work or ability to participate in ECPI University's programs, the Campus President or CDAA will work the student to determine what academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services are reasonable and appropriate. Academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services initially recommended for a student may be modified as directed by a change in the student's needs or the nature of course requirements. It is the student's responsibility to request the modification and to provide support for said change. Implementation of Academic Adjustments/Auxiliary Aids and Services Reques t The student will be provided with a Faculty Notification Form from the Campus President or CDAA at the conclusion of the review/verification process. The student, CDAA and Campus President will sign the Faculty Notification Form, acknowledging the acade mic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services that have been approved. The student must provide the Faculty Notification Form to faculty members at the beginning of each term to receive academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services. A copy of the Facult y Notification Form will be retained in the student's disabilities file. Appeal In the event that there is a disagreement between the student and the University regarding the outcome of the Campus President's or CDAA's evaluation (including whether the student is a qualified individual with a disability, the adequacy of the student's documentation regarding the student's disability and decisions regarding academic adjustments/auxiliary aids and services), the student can file an appeal with the University's Equal Opportunity Officer and Title IX/504Coordinator: Ms. Cheryl Salter Vice President of Human Resources (757) 213 -3523 csalter@ecpi.edu .

The program is dedicated to providing educational opportunities for qualified registered radiographers from diverse backgrounds in caring for individuals, families, and communities and preparing graduates for the practice in a variety of hea lthcare settings. A foundation for lifelong personal and professional learning is built upon a broad base of liberal arts and science s, humanities, and radiologic technology theories to help students develop ethically reflective radiography skills that wil l uphold the ideals of today's healthcare delivery system. Through evidence -based clinical decision -making in radiography practice, the development of leadership skills, the professional radiographer will be educated to serve and benefit a multicultural so ciety across the lifespan. Philosophy of the Bachelors of Science in Radiologic Sciences Program. The BSRS program believes that: Every person has value due to the unique experiences and knowledge that s/he brings to the community. The community is enriche d by its members and the differences that they contribute to making a diverse and heterogenous culture. Since every patient is different and rich in their history and background, so, too, must be the members of the healthcare team. Radiography is both an art and a science, dynamic due to the technology that supports the field and the many members that aid in providing optimum patient care. Radiography is grounded on many theories and principles from radiologic biology and physics, to incorporating compassi onate care for all stages of illness, both acute and terminal. As vital members of the health care team, radiographers assist in providing answers to the questions asked from the initial diagnosis to the ongoing care for the chron ically ill. Professional v alues and value -based interventions are vital to radiography education. Professional and social skills are needed to provide and receive proficient communications with patients, other members of the allied health team, and physicians from all services. The radiographer will be prepared to effectively and professionally communicate with all patients and their families. Critical thinking, clinical competence, and accountability are necessary to provide optimum patient care in an ever -changing environment. Rad iographers work in radiology, surgery, the emergency department, as well as other areas of a healthcare facility and need a multi -dimensional skill set to provide care to the patients in those areas. Lifelong learning is part of the radiography profession due to the continuing education credits required by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). The process and mindsets related to lifelong learning were initiated in the associate's degree program and will be continued in the BSRS curricul um. Learning ideally mixed with enjoyment, is what will provide skill sets that will continuously evolve throughout the course of a radiographer's career. Moving to advanced modalities, a career path taken by many radiographers, will enrich the learning pr ocess, and will enhance the profession by adding dimensions and employability for the dually registered radiographer. CATALOG ADDENDUM Issued 04/21 /2017 Page 15 of 24 Progression. Students must achieve a grade of C or higher in all courses to progress. Students must pass all general education classes with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. If a student fails a radiography course, they must meet with the radiography program dir ector. If a second failure occurs in any course in the program, the student will be placed on probation. If a student fails the sam e course a third time, they will be dismissed from the program. Student Evaluation. The faculty uses the objectives of the overall program and individual courses as criteria for student evaluation. A development student portfolio is created across the curr iculum and submitted as evidence of accomplishment of the program outcomes in the final radiography course. Student grades are determined by a variety of formative and summative evaluation methods.
