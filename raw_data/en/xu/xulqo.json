Dogs and cats are susceptible to hidden (or visible) toxins that can build up over time to create an overburdening for the eliminatory organs. When the organs become overburdened and are no longer able to function efficiently, the skin - being the largest organ of elimination - can become a sign of a deeper issue and a need to detox the body. How toxins affect overall health As we know, homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain balance. Toxins disturb the natural flow of homeostasis forcing the immune system to defend against them, creating imbalance and dis-ease while damaging the [microbiome](https://ivcjournal.com/mbrt-immune-system/). A healthy immune system that is not overloaded with toxins can fight this off at first sign, but a weakened immune system due to a heavy load of toxins cannot eliminate them as nature intends, therefore, presenting varying symptoms. When the body receives the right balance of minerals, trace minerals and vitamins to nourish the liver enzymes, it functions well and is able to eliminate or process the toxins. Unfortunately, much of the pet food available, some vaccines, and chemicals contain heavy metals like mercury, creating an environment that hinders the normal structure and function of the liver and kidneys. Older animals are more susceptible to the burden of toxins and heavy metals but their overall health can benefit greatly by cleansing the blood, organs, lymphatic, and neurological systems, giving them a new lease on life. There are many other toxins that wreak havoc on the neurological and lymphatic systems that can be safely removed with organic herbs and superfoods in a short period of time. Protect and rebuild Below is a list of [herbs](https://sustenanceherbs.com/) and superfoods that are game-changers for pet health and longevity. They nourish the body with minerals, trace minerals and vitamins for optimal function by, naturally detoxifying and strengthening the organs, blood, GI tract, lymphatic and neurological systems, creating homeostasis. Bladderwrack Bladderwrack cleanses the digestive tract. A primary source of alginic acid, it binds with heavy metals that may be found in the intestines, such as barium, cadmium, lead, mercury, zinc, and even radioactive strontium. These metals will not be absorbed by the body when alginic acid is present, thus helping to bind and draw out toxins stored in the body. Schisandra Berry Schisandra Berry contains about 40 lignans and enhances glutathione production in the liver, a very important cellular antioxidant that helps rid the body of heavy metals and other toxins. This very unique adaptogen has an affinity not only for cleansing, protecting and strengthening the liver but also the central nervous system which is vital when neurotoxins are present. Broccoli Sprouts Broccoli Sprouts support all phases of detox including activating, neutralizing, and eliminating contaminants. They are high in vitamin C and antioxidants that help detox enzymes in the GI tract, and support all detox processes, i.e., activation, neutralization and elimination of contaminants. Dandelion Dandelion (leaf & root) is a powerhouse of essential nutrients. It contains manganese, vitamins A, C, K, E, folate, zinc, potassium and selenium, along with antioxidants for cleansing the digestive tract, urinary tract, and the kidneys. Calcium Bentonite Calcium Bentonite performs like a magnet in the body by absorbing and pulling toxins from the digestive tract out of the intestines, stomach, and colon. Important minerals in Calcium Bentonite include copper, iron, magnesium, silica, and potassium.
