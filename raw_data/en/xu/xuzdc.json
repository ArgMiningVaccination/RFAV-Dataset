I've tried most of the others, but this tulsi is summer in a spray bottle. I use mine with an oil finish and my skin feels so hydrated. The rose petal hydrosol has the most beautiful rose fragrance! It is hydrating, fragrant and comforting on my sensitive skin. I totally love it! Best product I've ever found for a daily moisturizer. I've been using it for over 20 years. The only face moisturizer that keeps my dry skin hydrated. In all the years I've been using this lotion no other lotion has come close! This Neroli perfume smells so alive and uplifting! I think it's perfect to wear in the summer months, but also in the coming months to cure the winter blues The blue cactus beauty elixir is special and works well with any of the hydrosouls. Frankincense is healing to the soul so they pair nicely together. Love love love this balm. Smells amazing and provides enough moisture without feeling or looking greasy. I adore this mask so much. It is active & deeply cleansing. Pulls extra oils from my pores & leaves them immediately visibly tighter. Skin tone dramatically improved. I spray this on right after washing my face in the morning & evening. It feels very natural & refreshing. I have extremely sensitive skin and this never caused a reaction - in fact it is very soothing, firming, and hydrating. Beautiful soothing and grounding essential oil based perfume blend. Projection is intimate and close enough to the skin to wear to bed to feel cozy and not stimulated. This is far from a wildly projecting fragrance. Within a few days of getting used to this, it became ritual and life. Spritzing this on my face each day is revitalizing in a way words don't quite capture. I love this product makes my eyes feel like it's getting replenished with so much moisture. It's not to heavy just right! I'm 44 years old and have never worn foundation or powder because I don't like the way makeup looks on skin. HOWEVER, I love this! It neutralizes my skin tone, blends beautifully, and takes a few years off. Great product. Organic Certification We view 'purity' as the starting point.
