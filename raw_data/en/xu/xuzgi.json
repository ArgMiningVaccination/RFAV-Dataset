Many have been improving their practices for years. They are modernizing programs, revisiting requirements andrewriting regulations about licensing in the regulated professions. Here are some examples of recent improvements. The Ontario Association of Architects no longer requires its interns to complete the required 940 hours of work experience within specific architectural categories. Instead, the hours may be in any category. The College of Chiropractors of Ontario uses a national board to run exams for internationally trained chiropractors. In November, 2009, this board decided to exempt some candidates withmore than three years of work experience from the exam about chiropractic knowledge, and it rescheduled exams to make them more convenient. The Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario worked on a national process to streamline the assessment of internationally trained general dentists. Starting in spring 2010, such dentists have two routes\u2014not just one\u2014to get their licences. The second (new) route is to prove competencythrough a series of exams and assessments. This path requires only a few weeks over a one-yearperiod and costs less than the existing two-year program. The Council of the College of Dental Technologists of Ontario proposed amendment to its registration regulation to the Ontario government in December 2009. The amendment would remove the need for Canadian experience, which is often difficult for internationally trainedindividuals to get. The College of Dietitians of Ontario has proposed a new class of certificate that allows applicants to work in areas of demonstrated competence while completing further training. It is also lookinginto ways to better acknowledge dietitians' previous education and work experience. The Association of Engineering Technicians and Technologists posts extensive frequently asked questions for applicants about requirements, the application process, timelines, costs and appeals. Applicants to the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario can now complete the registration application and pay all application fees online. Online services help streamline the licensing process. The Law Society of Upper Canada no longer makes internationally trained lawyers go through a mandatory articling program if they were called to the bar in a common law jurisdiction and have 10 months or more of legal experience that addresses its articling competencies. 1| Office of the Fairness Commissioner | Fair Registration in the Professions: Regulators Make Improvements The College of Medical Laboratory Technologists of Ontario signed a formal agreement with the Canadian Society for Medical Laboratory Science, stating that the society's work will complywith Ontario's fair access law. The society assesses learning and administers exams for the college. The College of Medical Radiation Technologists of Ontario, like most regulatory bodies, requires competence in English or French. The college evaluated its language proficiency requirements forinternationally trained applicants, to ensure that the requirements correspond to the language levelthat is actually needed to practise the profession. As a result, it increased the number of tests itaccepts to demonstrate proficiency from one to three, and it confirmed the scores applicants must get. The College of Midwives of Ontario has drafted a formal agreement with the International Midwifery Program to ensure assessments comply with the fair access law. The College of Nurses of Ontario gives detailed reasons to internationally trained applicants who are denied a licence because their program is not deemed equivalent to a Bachelor of Nursing degree. The College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario signed agreements with two key bodies that do assessments \u2014 the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and World Education Services\u2014 to ensure that their assessments are fair. The College of Opticians of Ontario created separate registration and appeals committees and provides orientation and training for committee members every year. The College of Optometrists of Ontario revised its website to ensure that registration information, application packages and frequently asked questions are complete, easy to find and easy to understand. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario recognizes the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) as the body that offers national exams, certifies family doctors and accredits trainingprograms. The CFPC will no longer require medical graduates with family medicine certification from Australia, the U.S., and Ireland to write the CFPC exam. Candidates must still meet provinciallicensure requirements or be practising in Canada. The CFPC is reviewing the training and certificationprograms in other countries. The College of Physiotherapists of Ontario and Ryerson University launched a bridging program for internationally educated physiotherapists in January 2009. The Ontario College of Teachers launched a web-based application system that enables individuals from all jurisdictions and programs to apply online for certification. It uses telephone caller ID so that,when an applicant calls, the staff person has the necessary info at hand.
