Wonder. Together. Our highest priority remains the health and wellbeing of all visitors to the Ordway. Following months of preparation and planning for the return of in-person programming, the [Arts Partnership](https://artspartnership.org/) has updated its policies to protect against the spread of COVID-19. This page will be regularly updated with new safety protocols as they are announced, with guidance from the City of Saint Paul, the Minnesota Department of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Commitment to safety We are thrilled to be able to experience live events with you. Below are the steps we are taking to ensure we operate in the safest way possible. The Arts Partners do not require proof of vaccination or negative COVID test results in order to attend performances at the Ordway. Masks are not required, but will be welcomed and encouraged. The Arts Partners are continuing to evaluate the latest guidance from the CDC, MDH, and its medical advisors, and will adjust its health and safety policies accordingly. The Ordway's air system brings in fresh air from the outside to help limit the spread of airborne viruses like COVID-19. In addition, several updates have been made to further improve air safety inside the Ordway: Upgraded the heating, ventilation, and air-condition (HVAC) filtration to a high-efficiency MERV 13 filters, following Minnesota Department of Health best practices. Added HVAC controls and sensors to improve air velocity within the building and provide additional monitoring and control of the system by our facility engineers. Removed forced air hand dryers in all restrooms, which have been shown to disperse a high quantity of bacteria into the air, and replaced them with paper towel dispensers. In addition to the robust cleaning practices that were already in place, we have: Increased the frequency of cleaning throughout the building for high-touch areas in the front of house and back of house areas of the Ordway Added state-of-the-art practices including self-cleaning anti-microbial covers in high touch areas where possible Set up hand-sanitizing stations throughout the venue Trained all employees in critical hand washing and cleaning guidelines Replaced waste receptacles with open top units so guests can throw out items without touching any surfaces Guest responsibility We ask that guests stay home if they are sick or exposed to COVID-19.
