I was unhappy that I can't help them myself and can't check their progress, anymore. Now, I am happy that as an \"Osteopathic manual practitioner\" I can assess my patients, help them without medications, and evaluate their progress. It's a wonderful feeling to see after a few sessions of osteopathy and hands-on practice, my patients can walk properly, get back to the activities they love, and are able to hug their beloved ones, once again.'

While not every case warrants chiropractic adjustment, Terry believes that such treatments can be used beneficially for therapeutic and as well as preventative purposes. As a North Vancouver chiropractor, Terry's method of practice reflects his strong belief in the effect of structural, chemical and psychological influences, as well as environment and lifestyle, on overall good health. Areas of Practice Chiropractic treatment is useful for a variety of health concerns including relieving musculoskeletal problems, sports injuries, repeated overuse syndromes like rotator cuff strains & tendonitis injuries, multiple types of headaches and much more. Chiropractic care, as part of a holistic and preventative regime, is a useful tool in improving overall health. A North Vancouver chiropractor, Terry's approach is based on the needs and desires of his clients. Patients are adjusted only with their express consent and within their comfort level. Mobilization and soft tissue techniques are often used either in addition to, or instead of, audible manipulations. If patients prefer not to hear an audible sound or crack during adjustments, he will employ other methodologies to help their condition. Terry is trained in other soft tissue treatment techniques such as ART\u00a9 (Active Release Techniques) and Trigenics which expand his frame of reference. As a North Vancouver chiropractor and diagnostician, Terry assesses each individual to determine whether chiropractic is the best modality of treatment and is qualified to recommend clients to other, or complementary, forms of treatment such as acupuncture or massage therapy. With the patient's consent, Terry will then consult with or co-manage treatment with other health care providers. (Direct Billing to Pacific Bluecross,ICBC,RCMP) Educational Background Terry pursued his interest in a career as a chiropractor while at Simon Fraser University where he took multiple courses in human kinesiology, biology and other pre-medicine prerequisites as part of his Bachelor of Science degree.

Dr. Dickson then returned to North Vancouver to practice as a chiropractor. After working in multiple clinics and settings, he has found his home as a chiropractor and director of the North Shore Wellness Centre. Personal History Terry's passion for chiropractic methodology was fueled as a patient first. Following personal injury in multiple motor vehicle accidents and unable to do many of the things he had previously taken for granted, he was forced to live with a new level of pain and discomfort. After exposure to many health care disciplines, he found his greatest recovery after chiropractic treatment. This treatment enabled him to return to his love of sports and pursue an active role as a member of the SFU Varsity Football team. It also crystallized his resolve to benefit others by pursuing chiropractic as a profession. Terry was born on the North Shore and has been involved in athletics his entire life.

I played high level ringette and ended up injuring my knee badly and needed to go to physiotherapy. It opened me up to this world that allowed me to encompass what I loved, sports and science, into one career. I was then lucky enough to be able to take a kinesiology class in high school and knew it was the program for me. I applied to UBC for Kinesiology and graduated from there in 2018 with my degree in Kinesiology. After I graduated, I moved to Edmonton and worked as a kinesiologist at a gym and at a physiotherapy clinic while also working as an athletic therapist with a hockey team. I was unsure of what I wanted to do and if I wanted to go back to school. I spent a couple years working and realized that integrating myself fully in the healthcare world was a passion I wanted to pursue. When covid hit, I moved back to Vancouver, started working at a high-level athletic gym and started my application for massage therapy, where I will graduate from in August 2022. Personally, I have always been active, playing sports when I was younger, hiking through the beautiful BC mountains, playing recreational team sports (especially now that covid is calmer!!!) and Olympic lifting and functional training to allow me to continue to keep the mobility and strength I need to do the activities I love. My goal for the near future is integrate massage therapy with my current knowledge and experience in kinesiology and biomechanics to help people create, or regain, a lifestyle that they want. As someone who has suffered from injuries, I thought may take away my quality of life, I understand the importance of getting back to the level of activity that you want, both for mental and physical health. With massage I like to utilize active stretching and muscle activation to help reteach movements and elicit better muscle responses. With kinesiology I use free weights, body weight and core to help create a great base of support to allow people to get back to the activities they love. I am a firm believer that creating a concrete base of support is the key to recovery, correct movement, and resiliency as we age. I can't wait to help you reach your goals!

Although this quote by Buddha can be interpreted in so many ways, Danielle Tabo likes to use this extraction to nourish the philosophy of her practice. Danielle reveals that the philosophy of massage is simply the power of touch, and the strength of the clients mind bonding with their body. Danielle deems that the success of pure contentment is the trust between therapist and client. When the client can provide trust they can surrender their mind and body to relaxation, which then synthesizes with the therapists ability to massage deeper and more thoroughly. Danielle has the understanding and skills of the human body to create balance, and she will do her best to communicate with the client by learning their lifestyle to provide the best therapeutic protocol thus leading to optimal health. Danielle's extensive knowledge acquired from the University of British Columbia and West Coast College of Massage Therapy have equipped her with the gift of treating patients with exceptional finesse. Educational Background In 2007 Danielle successfully accomplished her Human Kinetics degree from the University of British Columbia, simultaneously playing for the UBC Varsity Women's Soccer Team. During her first years at UBC Danielle suffered a potentially ruinous injury and was referred to a massage therapist. Within a short period she was back to her best health, and had a new career path in mind. It was through this frustration that she found inspiration and the desire to become a massage therapist. In the fall of 2007 she was accepted to North America's Premier Massage Therapy Training Institution, The West Coast College of Massage Therapy's 3000 hour program. Now, with a degree and a certificate under her belt Danielle is eager and driven to expand and update her knowledge further. Areas of Practice During Danielle's journey through massage education she has had the pleasure of working with a vast clientele. Danielle has had the opportunity of treating conditions such as sports injuries, headache/migraine, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, pregnancy, multiple sclerosis, respiratory conditions, orthopaedic conditions and many more. She has found the utmost success through the use of modalities such as athletic treatment and rehabilitation, myofascial release, trigger point release, muscle energy techniques, and general Swedish. From the pain of desk workers to the agony of an athletes sports injury, Danielle has witnessed first hand the restoration of health from minor everyday aches to chronic pains. Personal History Danielle was born and raised, and continues to live in Burnaby. She is close enough to the excitement and dancing of the city, yet near the natural beauty of the outdoors; which she so often takes advantage of. Danielle's athleticism and craving for adventure takes her too many heights, literally. Not only has she spent more than twenty years playing soccer, but she continues to play at a premier level. Her daring nature has taken her cliff jumping, hiking, skiing and bungee jumping.

Counselling provides an opportunity for self-discovery and a space to safely explore historical patterns, identify goals and move toward desired change. My approach is holistic and integrative and the beliefs which most directly inform my counselling practice are; I believe that everyone has the capacity for wellness. I believe the body holds immense wisdom and there is a complex interplay of biopsychsocial factors influencing distress and well-being. I believe health and wellness is not passive but a practice and that what you are thinking is what you are becoming. I also believe that change is not possible but inevitable. I believe you can feel better and by approaching issues with curiosity and openness your natural inclination toward optimal health and functioning will unfold. Educational Background I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor with the British Columbia Association of Clinical Counsellors (BCACC), and I hold a Master's Degree in Counselling from City University of Seattle.
