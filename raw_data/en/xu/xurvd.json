Bureau of HealthProfessions.PUB DATE 85CONTRACT Health Promotion\"series.PUB TYPE GuidesClassroom Use - as a necessary componentof educational programs for physicians. This is to be valued in thatof all factors affec'ing health in the United States, none is moreimportant than nutrition. This can be argued from variousperspectives, including health promotion, disease prevention, andtherapeutic management. In all cases, serious consideration ofnutrition related issues in the practice is seen to be one means toachieve cost-effective medical care. These modules were developed toprovide more practical knowledge for health care providers, and inparticular primary care physicians. This module is designed as aresource which will assist the primary care physician inunderstanding the functions of vitamins and trace minerals.Manifestations of deficiency and excess are presented as are conceptsrelevant to the evaluation of patient status. Information is providedto assist physicians in counseling their patients regarding themultitude of claims made concerning dietary supplements. Included arelearning goals and objectives. A self-check of achievement withregard to goals references, and lists of resources for patients andphysicians. Appendices include tables of recommended dietaryallowances, safe and adequate dietary intake of selected vitamins andminerals, clinical nutrition examination findings, laboratory testinterpretations, plasma and urine nutrient levels, healthy foods, anda food composition table for dietary analysis.

This money could be used to a better advantage bybuying a variety of foods that would supply the vitamins and minerals and othernutrients for human nutrition.' Proper storing, preparing, and cooking of meats,fruits, and vegetables will provide adequate nutrients giving more for the money. Themedia often promote questionable practices that have not adequately answered thebasic questions, \"Is it more effective than a placebo?\" and \"Is it safe?\"2 Patientsshould be warned that following the advice of health food faddists can often result inserious illness.Why do so many people take extra supplements that they do not really need?Common reasons given are to provide nutritional insurance, to increase strength andenergy or \"itality, to improve health, to compensate for stress, to prevent disease, andto treat illness. In the words of Herbert and Barrett3:Some people would argue that the apparent benefits of 'believing' in foodsupplements outweigh the risks involved. Do you think that people need falsebeliefs in order to feel healthy or to succeed in life? Would you like to believethat something can help you when in fact it is worthless and may be harmful?Do you want our society to support an industry that is trying to mislead us?Can't Americans do something better with the billions of dollars being wastedeach year on food supplements? The goal of this module is to provide a resource which will assist the primary carephysician in understanding the functions of vitamins and trace minerals. Additional-ly, manifestati2ns of deficiency and excess are presented, as are concepts relevant tothe evaluation of patient vitamin and trace mineral status. The information providedis intended to assist the physician in counseling patients regarding the multitude ofclaims currently being made concerning vitamins and trace minerals. Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:1.Demonstrate currency in knowledge regarding vitamins and trace minerals.2.Identify basic vitamin and trace mineral needs for a variety of patients..3.Specify dangers of megavitamin therapies for fat- and water-soluble vitaminsand for trace minerals.4.Refute erroneous or unproven claims about trace minerals and vitamins.S.Counsel patients regarding basic vitamin / trace mineral needs for their medicalcare and recommend supplementation if necessary. 0 Clinical.Trial2 Vitamins Vtamins are organic substances which are es-sential for normal metabolism. growth, anddevelopment.

Theycannot be made in the body and must be obtainedthrough the diet.After absorption from the foodingested, itamins are carried in the blood to cells whosefunctions depend on them. After entering the cell, vita-mins combine w ith elm> ihes, called apoenzy mcs, a hulo.:nzy catalyses reactions inside thecell. The quantity of apoenzymes is limited. Theapoenzymes are usu .11y saturated and, therefore, are at Figure 23-1Sequence of Events Leading to Clinical Nutrition .esion Technique for Study Dietary in Level ofMetabolites f rum Pearson, W.N.. \"Biohernmal Appraisal of the Vitamin Nutritiunal Status in Man.-Journal u/tha Ameruan Ale,;180:49-55, 1962.

But untilscience proves thccasc for mega% itamins, cxcept for SOUKmedical conditions, Laking larger doses for real or fanciedills not only wastes money but may endanger health.Many articles in popular magazines, newspapers, books,and other publicat.ons encourage use of vitamins, butonly a fey., discuss the possible toxicity which can resultfrom their excessive use. Generally a megadose is con-sidered to be about ten times the RDA. It is important tounderstand the difference 'Jaw= treatment or preven-tion of a specific dcficicncy disease and the use ofvitamins as pharmacologic agents. The efficacioustreatment of disorders with megavitamins will be dis-cussed later in this module.Fat - soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are all soluble inlipids, and have varying functions in the body. Researchhas provided extensive information concerning the ac-'ions of vitamins D and K, but limited evidence isavailable concerning the actions of vitamins A and E. Ingcneral, itis difficult to develop deficiencies of fatsoluble v itamins resulting from dietary intake unless theindividual has developed a malabsorption syndrome.Simi: fat - soluble vitamins arc stored in the liver, toxicitycan be induccd by mcgadoscs, especially of vitamins Aand D.Watcr-soluble vitamins include the members of theB-cumplex family and ascorbic acid vitamin C. Thc,cvitamins are stored in the body but not in as largequa.nities as fat-soluble vitamins. It was once believedthat these v itamins must bc consumed daily or deficiencywuuld occur, but now we know that this is not true. Marginal or mild cases of vitamin deficienciesoften occur in growing children, adolescents,and the elderly. These groups may not be wellfed because of insufficient income, lack ofknowledge, poor dietary habits, or disease.

These guidelines may begiven to patients and will enable them to check thenumber of servings of various foods each day for dif-ferent age groups. The recommended food intake forgood nutrition, according to food groups, and theaverage size of servings at different age levels for childrenfrom 1 year to 15 years are presented in Appendix A; thisis an excellent patient handout. Trace MineralsTrace minerals are essentialin very smallamounts in the diet because they are notsynthesized by the body. Trace minerals areparts of many enzymes necessary for metabolicactivity. As the American diet changes to includemore and more highly refined, processed, andfabricated foods containing fewer micronutri-ents, there is increased concern that deficienciesmay result. This concern is not valid, however,if a variety of foods is consumed and caloric andprotein needs are met. The gastrointestinal tract is the site of absorption oftraceminerals and important interactions betweenminerals. For example, medications with iron maydepress the absorption of copper. Copper in turn maylower iron and molybdenum absorption. For transportvia blood, minerals are usually bound to a protein. Ingeneral, foods of animal origin arc superior to grain,vegetables, or fruits as sources of trace minerals sinceconcentrations tend to be higher and the minerals areoften more bio- available. Manganese is an exception; itis readily available from plant sources.Trace elements are not evenly distributed in foods suchas grains. Milling technology removes the germ and outerlayers which contain the most minerals. When foodssuch as grain are highly processed, trace minerals are lust.Most brad and cereal products today are fortified withbioavailable B-vitamins and iron, and sometimes withtrace minerals. Loss of trace minerals with processing isnot a major nutrition concern because a well-balanced,varied diet which includes foods from the basic foodgroups will supply adequate trace minerals. Only smallamounts of trace minerals are needed by the body; there-fore the term \"trace\" elements.Use of This ModuleIn order to assess the adequacy of a patient's diet, youmight ask your office nurse or secretary to assist a patientin answering the questions in Table 23-2. If answers tothese questions alert you to a potential nutritionproblem, a more thorough nutrition history and evalu-ation of the dietary intake may be needed.

Vitamin A toxicity is seen most frequently inchildren and adolescents. The toxicity of thevitamin depends on age, dosage,,and duration ofadministration. The following amounts are knownto be toxic intake levels for individuals (in somecases toxicity can occur at lower levels):Infants less than 1 year of age: 18,000-60,000IU daily (13 to 43 times the RDA)Children age 1 to 5 years: 80,000-500,000 IUdaily (40 to 250 times the RDA)Adults: 200,000-275,000 (40 to 55times the RDA)2. Brain (pseudotumor cerebri) develops fromdoses of 90,000 to 700,000 IU of vitamin A.3.

Excess vitamin A reduces absorption of vitamin Kleading to possible hemorrhage.3. Mineral oil and excessive use of laxatives decreaseabsorption of vitamin A.Questions and AnswersQ.Will eating carrots, carrot juice, broccoli, orspinach in excessive amounts cause my skin to turnyellow?A. Excessive intake of carotene may give the skin anorange appearance (hyperbetacarotenemia) butdoes not cause the toxic effects of vitamin A. Onecup of cooked carrots provides 16,000 IU ofvitamin A, and including 1 cup of carrots dailywould provide more than S times the aDA.Will vitamin A relieve acne?Use of oral vitamin A for acne has not been shownto be ef fective in relieving acne, however, Accutane(13-cis-retinoic acid), a vitamin A analog, hasbeen approved for treatment of severe cystic acneWill a diet high in cod liver oil protect me fromheart disease?A. Eskimos have a diet high in fatty types of fish andalso demonstrate reduced platelet aggregability,and a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease.This does not, however, prove a cause-effect rela-tionship, and there are no data to indicate that fishoils efficaciously prevent or treat heart disease.High doses of fish oils should not be eaten becauseof the possibility of vitamin A toxicity.Q. Should I take extra vitamin A if my skin and hairare dry?A. Heredity chiefly determines skin and hair textureand oil content. Vitamins, including vitamin Aand minerals, along with other nutrients, arenecessary for healthy skin and hair. Nutrientdeficiencies may result in poor skin and hairtexture; replacement with supplementation is im-portant if documented deficiency occurs. Vitamin/mineral supplements are not helpful in preventingor treating dry skin and hair if a varied adequatediet is ingested.Can vitamin A prevent cancer?Q.A. Q. Q.A. Vitamin A is essential in maintaining epithelialcell integrity, including mucous lining cells of theGI tract and lung. A deficiency could theoreticallyallow epithelial-type cancers to develop. Whethervitamin A or beta-carotene will prevent or treatepithelial-type cancers is unknown.The NRC/NAS Committee on Diet, Nutrition,and Cancer recommends that people consumecitrus fruits and dark green and deep yellowvegetables daily.

Barzel' concludes that vitamin D deficiency is arisk in old age because of insufficient intake andlack of exercise. Many elderly are often house-bound or chronically ill and are deprived of sun-shine. In addition, many elderly individuals do notlike to drink milk or eat foods high in vitamin D.Barzel recommends that elderly patients at risk beevaluated for osteomalacia and treated accord-ingly.Is vitamin D beneficial for individuals sufferingfrom rheumatoid arthritis?Q.A. Excessive doses of vitamin D will not alleviatesymptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and will mostlikely cause hypervitaminosis. On the basis ofavailable information, it appears that 2 to 3 timesthe RDA for vitamin D is safe for children andadults.What is the role of vitamin D in osteopOrosis?Supplementation of vitamin D above the 1000IU/day could result in toxicity, hypercalcemia,and hypercalciuria. There is no proven benefitwith the use of excessive vitamin D in the treat-ment of osteoporosis. Adequate intake of vitaminD is necessary for proper calcium metabolism, andthus it is one factor in the prevention of osteo-porosis. The RDA of 400 IU of vitamin D daily isprovided by one quart of milk. (See Module 21,Protecting Bone and Teeth, for more informationand discussion of calcium, E is alpha-tocopherol)Functions 111.

How-ever, in people factors other than vitamin E defi-ciency cause muscular dystrophy. Further attemptsto demonstrate benefits of vitamin E supplementa-tion have been unsuccessful.3Does vitamin E protect against cancer?Animal studies have shown that vitamin E is not aprotection against cancer, nor does a deficiency ofvitamin E increase the incidence of cancer.Will vitamin E protect against effects of airpollution?A. Studies on rats have shown that vitamin E mayprotect against damage to the polyunsaturated fatsin lung membrane caused by high concentrationsof nitrogen dioxide and ozone.4Will vitamin E improve an athlete's ability?Most reports are anecdotal and not supported byscientific studies. Investigations with vitamin Esupplements showed that performance was nobetter than with a placebo.5Q. Will vitamin E heal burns or cuts?A. Vitamin E liquid or ointment applied to burrs orcuts is claimed to have healing properties, but noconclusive evidence is currently available. Clinicalstudies are underway to investigate this claimIs there a relationship between selenium andvitamin E?A. Vitamin E helps to maintain the functionalintegrity of subcellular membranes, although thisis only part of the cell's defense against peroxida-tion of vital phospholipids. Even with adequatevitamin E, some peroxides are formed. Selenium,as a part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, isconsidered to act as the second line of defense,destroying these peroxides before they have anopportunity to cause membrane damage.'Q.A.

Q.What is the role of ascorbic acid in cancer?There is very limited evidence in poorly designedand controlled studies which suggests that vitaminC can inhibit formation of some carcinogens andthat vitamin C-containing foods are associatedwith a lower risk of cancer of the stomach andesophagus.'Will megadoses of vitamin C lower blood levels ofcholesterol and protect against heart disease?A. As of 1982, the bulk of scientific research offers nohope that extra vitamin C affects blood levels ofcholesterol.Will excess ascorbic acid cause renal stones?Vitamin C has been implicated in the formation ofurate and oxalate stones,2 but recent evidenceshows that massive ascorbic acid intake of 9 b'daily produces only a small increase is urinaryoxalate concentration and no change in urate';ascorbic acid is metabolized to oxalate. Massiveascorbic acid intake can cause diarrhea, which mayincrease absorption of oxalate.Does vitamin C combat the nitrate hazard?Vitamin C inhibits the oxidation of nitritc tonitrate. More research is needed to determine ifhigher levels of vitamin C are efficacious in preven-tion of cancer caused by nitrates. (See Module 19,Risk Factors and Disease Prevention, for addi-tional discussion.)Q.A. Q.A.Q.Wi.: taking megadoses of vitamin C prevent orcure a cold?A. At present, there is no scientific evidence thattaking megadoses of ascorbic acid prevents colds.There is some evidence that vitamin C may cause aslight improvement in cold symptoms (vitamin Cmay act as an antihistamine), but not enough tojustify megadoses that may be harmful. If an anti-histamine effect is desired, available antihistaminedrugs are far more useful.Is a good source of vitamin C needed daily?Vitamin C is stored in the body. A good source ofvitamin C, 3 to 4 times a week, is adequate to meetthe needs of healthy non-smokers. Smokers willbenefit from a good source of vitamin C daily.Do megadoses of ascorbic acid enhance athleticperformance?A. Controversies exist as to whether ascorbic acidintake enhances athletic performance. A recentstudy reported that a 300-mg ascorbic acid dailysupplement appeared to have little effect onphy5:,...1! performance of healthy male subjects.'Will megadoses of vitamin C cause diarrhea inrunners?A.

The benefits of long-term use (3 to 6 gm/day) maybe worthwhile for hypercholesterolemia; however,the side effects and possible toxicity may limit itsuse for this purpose to a \"second step\" drug.

Nicotinic acid is more useful for hyper-cholestrolemia and causes the release of histamine.Histamine causes dilation of blood vessels, flush-ing of skin, and other symptoms, which can occurwithin 15 minutes after taking as much as fivetimes the RDA. A prostaglandin blocker, such asaspirin, plus niacin may decrease the toxic effect ofniacin. The side effects of nicotinic acid may alsobe limited by starting at a low dose, such as 100 mgb.i.d., and increasing gradually to a more effectivedose. It should not be used by patients withdiabetes or gout.Will niacin aid in the treatment of schizophrenia?Niacin was one of the first vitamins to be used inmegadoses for schizophrenia, because some of themental disturbances of schizophrenia resembledthose seen in pellagra.

Will iron-fortified cereals provide my daily re-quirement for iron?A. If the cereal has iron-rich raisins, prunes, orapricots, it will provide additional iron to meetdaily needs. Nearly all (90%) cereals are fortifiedwith ferrous iron which is well-absorbed.32 Vitamins and Trace Minerals 25 Q.Is it necessary to take additional iron duringmenstruation?A. Not unless iron-deficiency is diagnosed. Iron lossin normal menses may amount to 10 to 30mg/month. Added to loss of iron from sweat,urine, and feces, the total iron loss in non-pregnantwomen averages about 43 mg/month. If losses areexcessive, iron deficiency anemia can result; how-ever, prophylactic iron therapy is not warrantedunless diagnosis of anemia is made.2Do babies and young children need iron supple-mentation?A. Normal-term infants should receive 1 mg ofsupplemental iron per kg of body weight per daystarting at about 4 months of age to meetrequirements during rapid growth. Infants of lowbirth-weight should receive up to 2 mg/kg of bodyweight of supplemental iron per day about 5 to 6weeks after birth; dose then is gradually reduced to1 mg/kg body weight per day.3Should women participating in athletics take ironsupplements?A. Even though there is a decrease in serum iron,hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels in manywomen athletes, this is usually not a true de-ficiency, and iron supplementation should not begiven unless serum ferritin is decreased. A lowserum ferritin indicates iron storage to be low andprobably iron deficiency. A decreased hemoglo-bin/hematocrit occurs with exercise because train-ing tends to increase red blood cell mass byapproximately 18% and plasma volume by about31%,4 thus, creating a hemodilution effect. There-fore, it is important to check storage of iron inorder to tellif iron deficiency has or has notoccurred before prescribing iron supplements.5Q. Q. MagnesiumChemical NameMagnesiumFunctions1.

Q.What is the relationship of zinc to vitamin Ametabolism in the patient with liver disease?A. Evidence for zinc and vitamin A interaction issomewhat conflicting, but the need for zinc in themobilization of liver vitamin A stores and in theultilization of vitamin A in vision is reasonablywell established. Patients with cirrhosis are notable to metabolize the vitamin A needed for dartadaptation, and zinc is excreted in large quantitiesin the urine. It is important to be aware of the lossof these nutrients in the treatment of liver disease.' Q.A.Is hair analysis a good test for zinc status?The most practical way to measure zinc status is tomeasure zinc levels in plasma or serum samples.When individuals are ill or have serious deficien-cies in several nutrients, the hair growth ratedecreases. Hair zinc levels have not been found tocorrelate with plasma zinc levels.' 97 30 Nutrition in Health Promotion Related Topics Concerning Vitamins andTrace MineralsHair AnalysisHair analysis is not a valuable method forassessing the nutritional status of individuals.Many factors affect the interpretation of hairanalysis, such as age, sex, hair treatments, andair pollution.IMMMWISAdvertising for hair analysis to determine nutritionaldeficiencies is receiving a great deal of attention in the laypress.If a clipping of hair is sent to a commerciallaboratory for analysis, a report is sent to the clientprescribing vitamins and minerals that one should take.Because vitamins are found only in the roots of hairbelow the skin, a clipping of hair will not give a reliablevitamin analysis.'Hair analysis for heavy metals may be somewhatuseful. There appears to be usefulness inforensicmedit.inc as a screening dcv it.c in Lumparing differentpopulations' exposures to heavy metals. It may be pos-sible, using hair analysis, to estimate the body ,ontent oflead, arsenic, mercury, and other heavy metals inpopulations suspected of metal intoxication.The practices of hair analysis laboratories that pre-scribe nutritional therapy are most disturbing. Overall,hair analysis is of little value in determining vitamin ormineral status or the need ft,r supplementation. Tech-niques for analyzing the hair for nutritional status arcnot yet perfected. Much research is needed before hairanalysis may (if ever) be a worthwhile diagnostic test.2 MegavitaminsThose who take large doses of vitamins andtrace minerals may be contributing to medicalproblems rather than solutions.

Iftoxi- symptoms should appear from excessive intake,immediate withdrawal of thc offending vitamin isnecessary, with the exception of vitamin C, which shouldbe tapered over at least a three -day period. Lorge doses ofvitamin C cause an increase in degradation of thisvitamin. This process continues when massive doscs aredecreased, and a transient case of scurvy may result iftapering occurs faster than 3 days.Thc same problem can occur in thc new born infant ofa mother who has taken mcgadoscs of vitamin C, thuscrcating a dangerous situation for thc infant. Orthomolecular psychiatry, promulgated initially byHoffer and Osmund in the 1950s, involves the use ofmegavitamin C therapy (ascorbic acid plus B6, B12,andniacin) as an adjunct to conventional therapy in thetreatment of schizophrenia. A task force of the AmericanPsychiatric Association reviewed the uses of mega-vitamins and rejected the therapy. The proponents didnot conduct controlled experiments or report thcirresults satisfactorily. Massive doses of these v itamins canproduce liver disease, and other toxic conditions, andmay reverse the effects of somc medications useful in themanagement of psychiatric illnesses. Megavitamins are now being claimed to en-hance the functioning of the immune system.Many studies have been undertaken to test theseclaims and are controversial.IriMPINW11M,Megavitamins are claimed to enhance thc functioningof the immune system. Many studies have been undertaken to test these claims and animal studies have shownthat r-egav itamins at kw attempts havc also beenmade to study this relationship in thc cider!). The agingprocess has long been associated with a progressivechange in immune competence. Thc efficacy of vitaminand mineral supplementation in thc cldcrly and its effecton immune function havc yet to bc substantiated.Thcrc are a great many questions to be answeredpertaining to nutrition and immunity in general, apartfrom those related specifically to meganutrient supple-mentation and thc immune response in the clderly. .Mostlong -term meganutrient therapy is not safe. Limitsshould bc placed on mcgadoscs until safe levels arcestablished through further clinical and animal studies.In summary, Hodges states:Megavitamin therapy arose from a naturalinclination for people to believe that \"if a little bitis good, a lot may be better.\" In the vast majorityof instances, this philosophy has misled physiciansand lay persons alike into a useless and sometimesdangerous form of therapy. On the ether hand,there arc somc in which mcgadoscs of a vitaminmay accomplish a desired purpose. In any event,self - medication by lay persons is always unwise andmay, in extreme situations, lead to serious injury ordeath.' Non-Vitamins There are many substances sold in health foodstores which are claimed to be vitamins or\"miracle drugs.\" Some substances may appearto have vitamin-like activity in microorganismsor animals but are not essential nutrients forman. In order for a nutrient to b: classified as a vitamin forhumans it must meet one or more of the followingcriteria:1. must have an essential biological role based onpresent knowledge;2. the human cannot sy nthesizc it at all cannotsynthesize it in sufficicnt dmuunts EU meet meta-bolic needs; or :Q9 32 Nutrition in. Health Promotion 3. a deficienL, disease results when it :s omitted fromthe diet, and the deficiency is corrected only withits replacement in the diet.Examples of Non-VitaminsBis (pangamic acid) and Biz (laetrile) are two non-vitamins that have received a great deal of recentattention in the media. Herbert' writes that pangamicacid has no nutritional worth, no vitamin properties, andmay be harmful because of dangerous chemicals itmay contain, such as dic.hloracetate or dimethylglycine.Since there is no standard of identity, the c.henuLalcomposition of pangamic acid varies from year to year.No c. idence of its safety as a food additive has beenoffered nor hasbeen approved by the Food and DrugAdministration.Laetrile (sold as vitamin Bi,, but it is not a vitamin)has been widely advertised as a treatment for cancer. Thisdangerous substance is a cyanogcnic glycosidc. It is foundin the seeds or pits of fruits such as peaches, plums, andapricots. When laetrile is digested in the intestines, itbreaks down to cyanide, a lethal substance.'Moertel3 of the Mayo Clinic's Cancer Center treated178 patients with laetrile, plus a program consisting ofdiet, enzymes. and vitamins. All subjects were patientswith cancer who were still in generally good health.One-third had not received any previous chemotherapy.Laetrile did not cure, or lessen, any of the cancer-relatedsymptoms.A new product, superoxide dismutase (SOD), is thenew \"wonder\" supplement which some claim can delayaging and enhance physical beauty. SOD functions as afree - radical superoxide scavenger, an important processfor maintenance of cellular integrity. rhe \"catch\" here isthat the enzyme is a protein and is digested and cannot beabsorbed intact.'Cholinc is not a v.ce it can be synthesized inthe body. Thcrc islittle evidence that cholinc willimprove the failing memory of older persons, and it hasnot been shown to be associated with a specific de-ficiency disease in man. Cholinc may play a role inpreventing fatty livers in experimental animals.Para-aminobenzoic Acid (PABA) is a growth factor forbacteria. Although it is an anti-ercy -hair factor in blackrats and mice, it is not effeLtive in man. PABA inhibitsthe effectiveness of sulfa drugs, and may acrua\".stimulate the growth of Lettain microorganisms. Patientstaking antibiotiLs should be advised against the con-comitant use of PABA.Inositol has not been determined to be a vitamin forman. In plants, inositol is found as phytic acid, whichinterferes with absorption of calcium and iron. It wasinitially called a vitamin because of its anti-hair-losseffects in mice.' The application or ingestion of inositolis not known to prevent the loss or thinning of hair inhumans.Coenzyme Q (Ubiquinonc) is a constituent of phos-pholipids of the mitochondrial membrane. It can besynthesized in the cell and is therefore not a true v itamin.Bioflavinoids (\"vitamin** P) ;s extracted from lemonpeels and red peppers. The substance citrin has beenfound to be umlogically active in maintaining normalcapillary fragility in animals suffering from scurvy. Useof this product is of no value in prevention or treatmentof colds. The vitamin C-like effect of bioflavinoidsappears to be due to an antioxidant effect which protectsascorbic acid from oxidative destruction.6Carnitinc participates in the transfer of long-chainfatty acids into the mitochondrial membrane for oxida-tion and initiation of beta-oxidation. Carnitinc was firstconsidered to be a vitamin and was named vitamin Bt.However, itisnot a dietary essential(it can besynthesized from lysine and methionine) and has norational use as a supplement for adult humans. Attentionis currently being given to the role of carnitine in.nalnourished patients, infznts receiving commercialinfant formulas, and in patients receiving long-termTPN.7 SummaryAs part of the food intake history for every patient, itis important to know if supplemental vitamins and traceminerals are being taken and why. Ingestion of amountsgreater than five to ten times the Recommended DietaryAllowances on a daily basis can be toxic and dangerous,and such practices should be discouraged. Malabsorptionsyndromes and some inborn errors of metabolism may,however, be corrected or alleviated by large doses ofspecific nutrients.If a patient is taking over- the- counter vitamin andtraLc mineral supplements that contain nutrients equalto the RDAs, it should be emphasized that supplementsdo not LotreLt pu4 dietary habits. A variety of foods 4 0 Vitamins and Trace Minerals 33 selected from the basic food groups will supply nutrientsin adequate amounts for most people. If it is necessary touse a supplement, suggest 1-2 tablets daily of genericbrand supplements equal to the RDAs. Natural andsynthetic vitamins and minerals have the same potency.It is important to evaluate and be wary of exaggeratedclaims made for rare vitamins and:or nutritional sub-stances extolled by heals'food stores and in laymagazines. More researt.h is needed to substantiate theseclaims before recommending nutritional products.

Please complete the activity and then discuss the activity with other residents, faculty, and, if available, a nutrition specialist.A 38-year-old white female presents herself for a routine check-up and yearly pap smear. Because of your newfound understanding of the importance ofvitamins and trace minerals, you decide to include some nutrition-relatedquestions in your evaluation (see table 23-2). You find OM that your patientseldom drinks milk and does not like most milk products;eats a large amount of fruit, especially grapefruit, as part of a diet she is trying;views herself as overweight (actually less than 5% above average weight for herheight, age, and sex);avoids starchy foods, red meats, fatty foods, and salt; andoccasionally binges on sweets.1. What further questions should you ask this patient?2. Given what little information you have, what deficiencies (or excesses) in vitaminsand minerals might this person be experiencing?3. Upon further questioning, you find that your patient takes megadoses of vitamins A,C, E, and Bu. What possible side effects should you look for?4. What counsel would you give your patient with regard to her\"grapefruit diet?\"disdain for milk and milk products?megadose-usage of vitamins?perceived need to diet?
