In the busy, stressful world that we live in today, it's easy for the mind and body to become overstimulated, this in itself, can lead to the accumulation of toxins and harmful waste. The buildup of these unhealthy materials can weaken the immune system and cause deterioration of other bodily functions such as the lymphatic and parasympathetic nervous systems. An unhealthy lifestyle can also lead to repeated dietary indiscretions and poor exercise patterns which can throw off our agnis which regulate the body's internal homeostasis causing us to be imbalanced. The ultimate Ayurvedic detox, Panchakarma, is a therapeutic yet pleasurable way to fully cleanse the mind and body of accumulated toxins, excess dosha and waste material on a deep cellular level. Panchakarma in Sanskrit translates to \"five actions\" which are treatments that are integral to purifying the full body. Excess toxins and waste material are known as ama in Ayurveda. Ama, is a foul-smelling, sticky, harmful substance that needs to be completely evacuated from the body. According to Ayurveda, it's recommended to cleanse and rejuvenate the body seasonally to dislodge toxins and flush them from the body. The preventative and rejuvenative health benefits of this detoxification process are beneficial for body types of all ages. The treatments that are performed during Panchakarma help restore the body's natural state of health and help reverse negative effects of daily living and stress. All of the therapeutic treatments are both nurturing and nourishing. Here are a list of some of the treatments included... Warm oil massage (abhyanga) Herbal steam treatment (swedana) A dosha balancing treatment as determined by the practitioner, which may include an: Udvartana (herbal scrub), Nasya (ear, throat and nose clarifying treatment), Netra Basti (eye treatment) or one of our many treatments Shirodhara Ayurveda recommends Panchakarma as a seasonal treatment to maintain positive mental, physical and spiritual health.", "sitename": "VEDA", "date": "2019-06-26", "cleaned_text": "The Ancient Science of Ayurveda believes our natural state is one of health, happiness and a sense of well-being, which in Sanskrit is known as \"Sattva\" or \"Sattvic\" mind.
