This research sought to explore the application of aromatherapy for the improvement of physical and mental health and stress levels, as well as other issues, that concern the elderly in the community. The research was based on intentional sampling. A pre- and post-test design with unequal groups was employed. The experimental treatments were divided into five groups: Group A (compound essential oil massage plus sniffing), Group B (compound essential oil massage), Group C (pure base oil massage), Group D (compound essential oil sniffing), and control Group E (without any aromatherapy intervention). To explore the effects of aromatherapy on physical and mental health and stress relief among the elderly in the community, the self-completed Mental and Physical Health Scale for the Elderly and the Stress Index Measurement Scale were used to collect data. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and by paired sample t-test. It was concluded that aromatherapy can improve the physical and mental health of the elderly in the community and can significantly reduce stress. The experimental results on aromatherapy in this study can provide a basis for home application to help the elderly in the community. They also provide a foundation for the organization of health promotion courses for the elderly and other practical applications in social welfare group planning.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-05-10", "cleaned_text": "Effects of Aromatherapy on the Physical and Mental Health and Pressure of the Middle-Aged and Elderly in the Community [https://doi.org/10.3390/app12104823](https://doi.org/10.3390/app12104823) [Emerging Industry - Promoting Human Performance and Health]( /journal/applsci/special_issues/Emerging_Industry_Human_Performance_Health )) Abstract: 1. Introduction 1.1. Research Background and Motivation [1](#B1-applsci-12-04823)] (Chen Hongshun, 2010). The middle-aged and the elderly have a high demand for relaxation, stress relief and healthy living. Therefore, they will seek ways to help them achieve harmony between body, mind and spirit. Among these, aromatherapy is one of the most popular alternative medical treatments. Having emerged in modern times, aromatherapy has been shown by numerous studies to be able to improve people's emotional condition, sleep, and physical and mental health problems caused by stress. The method is simple and the effect is good. Widely accepted by the public [ [2](#B2-applsci-12-04823), [3](#B3-applsci-12-04823), [4](#B4-applsci-12-04823), [5](#B5-applsci-12-04823), [6](#B6-applsci-12-04823), [7](#B7-applsci-12-04823), [8](#B8-applsci-12-04823)], aromatherapy is viewed as an auxiliary and natural therapy. Users can simply use essential oils extracted from plants as a means of preventing health problems and regulating their physical and mental health condition. [9](#B9-applsci-12-04823)]. With the fast-paced and busy life of modern society, people experience pressure from all directions. When the pressure exceeds the psychological capacity to cope, there will be maladaptation. In severe cases, it may even cause mental illness (Department of Psychiatry, Hospital Affiliated to National Taiwan University School of Medicine, 2020). Ref. [ [10](#B10-applsci-12-04823)] pointed out in the article Stress and Modern Life that, over five million years of human evolutionary history, the modern way of life now involves fewer activities than at any other times. The way people live and work has never been more stressful, while doctors suspect that as many as 70% of diseases are related to high blood pressure. Pressure-related headaches and migraines are the most common physical symptoms experienced by people who are stressed or anxious, though there are many other stress symptoms [ [10](#B10-applsci-12-04823)]. [11](#B11-applsci-12-04823)]. The health of middle-aged and elderly people is a most important concern and requires attention in the future. Therefore, how to ensure that middle-aged and elderly people live a healthy and happy life is a most important issue for our aging society. To achieve successful aging, older adults need to maintain positive emotions to enhance mental health. However, in recent studies, late-stage depression and anxiety have been found to be prevalent and have become major problems in society [ [11](#B11-applsci-12-04823)]. Therefore, how to reduce stress and relieve physical and mental health problems is the most important physical and mental health care issue for middle-aged and elderly people. [12](#B12-applsci-12-04823)]. Our country has become an aging society. Aging is accompanied by an increase in chronic diseases. As a result, more and more middle-aged and older Chinese people are paying attention to the maintenance of their physical and mental health and are actively seeking health care. Aromatherapy is becoming more and more important. It is one of the health care methods used by the elderly in modern society. It can be integrated into home health care to promote physical and mental health and to improve quality of life [ [13](#B13-applsci-12-04823), [14](#B14-applsci-12-04823)]. 1.2. Research Purpose 2. Literature Review 2.1. Aromatherapy [5](#B5-applsci-12-04823)] also pointed out in his research that aromatherapy involved the use of essential oils extracted from plants through massage, bathing, inhalation, and tea drinking to improve the body's self-defense ability and to prevent or treat diseases. Ref. [ [15](#B15-applsci-12-04823)] stated in the book Aromatherapy that the term aromatherapy comes from the essential oils that are extracted from plants and have a natural aroma. The effect is to achieve a natural and safe curative effect, and provides comprehensive therapy. Ref. [ [16](#B16-applsci-12-04823)] also proposed in the book Aromatherapy and Body Care that aromatherapy can be interpreted as \"a therapy that uses the aroma of natural plants to heal physical and mental diseases\". In addition, Ref. [ [17](#B17-applsci-12-04823)] stated in Aromatherapy-Basic Mechanisms and Evidence Based Clinical Use that aromatherapy is a practice that utilizes the health properties of therapeutic plants and essential oils. Ref. [ [18](#B18-applsci-12-04823)] pointed out that aromatherapy is defined as the absorption of aromatic essential oils through breathing or massage to relieve emotions, relax the mood, or improve physical diseases, etc. Ref. [ [19](#B19-applsci-12-04823)] also stated in the Cochrane Collaboration that aromatherapy is the extraction of pure essential oils from aromatic plants to help solve health problems and to improve quality of life; they stated that it is a branch of herbal medicine involving the extraction of pure essential oils from the roots, stems and leaves of plants [ [14](#B14-applsci-12-04823), [20](#B20-applsci-12-04823), [21](#B21-applsci-12-04823), [22](#B22-applsci-12-04823)]. 2.1.1. Weiner's Pain Management\u2014A Practical Guide for Clinicians\u2014Aromatherapy for Pain Relief stated that essential oils can be diluted in a bathtub or diffused into the air through a burner, massaged with a small amount of oil, or simply inhaled from a burner, and that this may be much safer than the use of oral complex oils. Aromatherapists use various means of extracting aromatic essential oils from plants. They aim to use pure essential oils to keep their composition as constant as possible so that the oils have predictable properties. Aromatherapy is a method of physical and mental relief that is accepted by the public involving the use of essential oils extracted from natural plants, supplemented by massage, inhalation, bathing, and aromatherapy [ [24](#B24-applsci-12-04823)]. The most used aroma conditioning methods are the massage method and the inhalation method. Common inhalation methods are: (1) the inhalation method; (2) the aromatherapy method; and (3) the spray method. Aromatherapy uses essential oils for conditioning purposes and uses odor therapy. The aroma molecules of essential oils are transmitted to the brain and affect the emotions. Through the emotional response of the brain, physical and psychological problems can be improved. The main route for absorption is through the nose or through the skin. Absorption of the oils helps regulate physical and mental conditions and prevent diseases. 2.1.2. Aromatherapy for the Elderly [25](#B25-applsci-12-04823)] pointed out that aromatherapy can be quite helpful to silver-haired people who seek to relax, relieve stress and live a healthy life. The elderly often use natural preventive medicine therapies, and subscribe to the view that \"prevention is better than cure\". Silver-haired people emphasize the harmony of body, mind and spirit in search of anti-aging and eternal youthful vitality. They are also very interested in spiritual and emotional healing courses. Ref. [ [26](#B26-applsci-12-04823)] pointed that there are many modern studies on aromatherapy for the elderly. In one study, it was found that, if used properly, aromatherapy can improve depression and cardiovascular diseases, which can not only reduce medical costs, but also improve the quality of life of silver-haired people. Ref. [ [12](#B12-applsci-12-04823)] pointed out in her study The Application of Aromatherapy in Elderly Care Institutions that aromatherapy can relieve stress and depression, lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular function. At present, many elderly care institutions in Taiwan make extensive use of aromatherapy to help the elderly relax and improve the physical and mental conditions of the disabled through aromatherapy. [14](#B14-applsci-12-04823)]. 2.1.3. Essential Oils [15](#B15-applsci-12-04823)]. Plant essential oils can be divided into two types: (1) the essence extracted from plants, i.e., essential oils, which are extracted from different parts of plants; (2) the base oil, including sweet almond, grape seed, soybean, wheat germ, jojoba oil, etc. [ [27](#B27-applsci-12-04823)]. 2.1.4. Single Essential Oils and Base Oils Used in This Study - (1) - Lavender - (2) - Bergamot essential oil - (3) - Marjoram essential oil - (4) - Sweet Almond Oil 2.2. Middle-Aged and Elderly People, Physical and Mental Health, Stress 2.2.1. Age Definition of Middle-Aged and Elderly People - (1) - Middle-aged and elderly refers to persons between the ages of 45 and 65. - (2) - Elderly refers to persons over 65 years old. [28](#B28-applsci-12-04823)]. [14](#B14-applsci-12-04823)]. 2.2.2. Physical and Mental Health [29](#B29-applsci-12-04823)]. - (1) - Good health [30](#B30-applsci-12-04823)]. As people grow older, more and more problems arise in terms of physical function, with daily activities and physical health causing varying degrees of distress to the elderly in the community. - (2) - Mental health [31](#B31-applsci-12-04823)]. In Young's Help Yourself Towards Mental Health (2018), mental health is defined as having the ability to self-realize, which implies activity, a high degree of authenticity, and a capacity to be inward-looking and self-reflective. Mental health can be conceptualized as a state of well-being in which individuals can realize their abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can perform productive work and can contribute to their community. - (3) - Social participation [32](#B32-applsci-12-04823)]. Participating in community activity courses can increase interaction between people, enhance emotions, promote interpersonal relationships and provide a sense of identity, increase self-confidence, and make people spiritually satisfied. - (4) - Overall physical and mental condition 2.2.3. Pressure [33](#B33-applsci-12-04823), [34](#B34-applsci-12-04823)]. The so-called internal constant is the optimal range required to maintain the body's operation; the term stressor refers to the factors that generate a stress response, which may be internal or external. [33](#B33-applsci-12-04823)]. Stress, which implies tension, refers to a state in which individuals often feel oppressed [ [35](#B35-applsci-12-04823)]. Stress refers to a certain reaction of an individual when faced with a stressful event and the resulting comprehensive psychosomatic state [ [36](#B36-applsci-12-04823), [37](#B37-applsci-12-04823)]. 2.2.4. Research on Aromatherapy and Physical and Mental Health and Stress [35](#B35-applsci-12-04823), [38](#B38-applsci-12-04823)]. Ref. [ [39](#B39-applsci-12-04823)] researched the use of 3D VR immersive reality, through an interactive course, to improve the promotion of aromatherapy education, and to verify the impact of aromatherapy on the physical and mental health of the elderly using scientific methods. The results showed that the 3D VR aromatherapy course was able to effectively promote the health of the elderly through the combination of reality and virtual reality. Ref. [ [40](#B40-applsci-12-04823)] researched the effect of an aromatherapy acupoint massage course on the perceived health of silver-haired people. The results showed that: (1) The aromatherapy acupoint massage course was able to improve the perceived health of silver-haired people; (2) With the intervention of aromatherapy and acupoint massage courses, the mental health status of silver-haired people in community care was significantly improved; (3) Through the intervention of aromatherapy and acupoint massage courses, the perceived health status of silver-haired people in community care was significantly improved; (4) Through the intervention of aromatherapy and acupoint massage courses, the perceived social health status of silver-haired people in community care was significantly improved. [41](#B41-applsci-12-04823)]. Aromatic essential oils have a fragrant smell. The chemical molecules of plants enter the human brain through the olfactory system with the aroma, thereby regulating the nervous system, helping the normal secretion of human hormones, and reducing physical discomfort. These aromas can also have a strong relaxation effect, regulating emotions. Therefore, more and more people are willing to accept this technique to relieve various pressures [ [42](#B42-applsci-12-04823)]. Ref. [ [9](#B9-applsci-12-04823)] explored the effect of aromatherapy on the stress of middle-aged and elderly people. They found that the experimental group receiving compound essential oil massage showed a significant improvement in stress, while the control group showed no significant improvement in stress. It has been shown that aromatherapy can effectively relieve and improve the stress of middle-aged and elderly people. Ref. [ [43](#B43-applsci-12-04823)] study pointed out that aromatherapy has a wide range of applications. In addition to palliative care, it is also very helpful for the relief of symptoms such as stress, insomnia and anxiety. It has also developed into a new leisure and health culture for Chinese people in Taiwan. Research has shown that most people have physical and mental stress symptoms from various stress sources, and the greater the level of physical and mental stress, the greater the awareness of the degree of stress relief provided by of aromatherapy. 2.2.5. Research on the Physical and Mental Health and Stress of Middle-Aged and Elderly People [44](#B44-applsci-12-04823)]. Ref. [ [45](#B45-applsci-12-04823)] explored the impact of middle-aged and elderly learners' participation in senior learning on their physical and mental health. The results showed that the physical and mental health performance of senior learners was not affected by gender, age or education level, but was affected by health status and economic status. Nor was the physical and mental health performance of senior learners affected by different course types. Rather, the more courses pursued and the longer the elderly participated in learning activities, the better they performed in terms of physical and mental health. [46](#B46-applsci-12-04823)] pointed out that aging, disability, and mental or physical diseases are factors that affect the long-term use of sleeping medication by middle-aged and elderly people. Studies show that middle-aged and elderly people are worried about a range of problems, including health problems, the inconvenience caused by disease, and how they are getting along with their family members. All of these might increase the possibility of using sleeping pills. Ref. [ [47](#B47-applsci-12-04823)] studied the factors that affect the work stress of middle-aged and elderly workers. It was found that 40- to 60-year-olds had the highest work-related stress, 40- to 50-year-olds had the highest work-related stress response, and middle-aged and elderly workers had higher work-related stress than non-middle-aged and elderly workers. The stress response was higher than that of the middle-aged and the elderly. Middle-aged and elderly people in non-management positions had higher work stress and higher work stress response. 2.3. The Use of Aromatherapy in Combination Therapy [48](#B48-applsci-12-04823)]. At present, combination therapy mostly uses a combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine. In a study by [ [49](#B49-applsci-12-04823)], concerning the clinical application of Chinese and Western medicine to cancer patients, it was pointed out that the comprehensive treatment of Chinese and Western medicine includes conventional treatment, function rehabilitation, psychiatric and psychological support, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, and tranquility care. The purpose is to restore the patient's physical health and spirits, so that the patient can return to social life. Combination therapy is also seen as a modern approach to the comprehensive rehabilitation of older adults, affecting stress, and cognitive and motor function. Aromatherapy is regarded as an adjunctive therapy that can help middle-aged and elderly people to improve their physical and mental health and stress. Through experimental research, aromatherapy has been shown to be an excellent choice for a comprehensive rehabilitation approach. 3. Material and Methods 3.1. Research Design [Table 1](#applsci-12-04823-t001)). After the experiment, the physical and mental health and stress scores were calculated to evaluate the difference in the improvement of physical and mental health and stress of each subject receiving compound essential oil massage and compound essential oil inhalation. 3.2. Research Subjects 3.3. Research Tools 3.3.1. Physical and Mental Health Scale for Middle and Old Age 3.3.2. Pressure Gauge [50](#B50-applsci-12-04823)]. 3.3.3. Essential Oils 3.3.4. Data Analysis - (1) - Descriptive statistics - (2) - Paired-sample t-test 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Results 4.1.1. Difference Analysis of the Overall Pre- and Post-test of \"Physical and Mental Health\" among the Elderly in the Community before and after the Aromatherapy Intervention [Table 2](#applsci-12-04823-t002)and [Table 3](#applsci-12-04823-t003), the difference analysis results for the pre- and post-test of the \"physical and mental health\" of the elderly in the community were as follows: there were significant differences in \"physical and mental health\" between the pre-test and post-test in Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D, and only Group E did not show a significant difference. 4.1.2. Before and after the Aromatherapy Experiment: Difference Analysis of the Pre- and Post-Test of \"Stress\" among the Elderly in the Community [Table 4](#applsci-12-04823-t004)and [Table 5](#applsci-12-04823-t005), the difference analysis results of the pre- and post-test of the \"stress\" construct of the elderly in the same group of communities were as follows: Group A, Group B, and Group D showed significant differences in \"pressure\" before and after the intervention, but there was no significant difference observed for Groups C and E. 4.2. Discussion 4.2.1. Difference Analysis of the Overall Pre- and Post-Test of \"Physical and Mental Health\" among the Elderly in the Community before and after the Aromatherapy Intervention - (1) - The average scores for \"physical and mental health\" in Group A were 3.678 and 4.465, respectively, before and after the test.

The t value of the paired sample test was 5.003, p < 0.05, which was significant. It showed that there was a difference in the satisfaction level of \"physical and mental health\" in Group D before and after the test, and that the post-test (M = 4.011) score was slightly higher than the pre-test (M = 3.653). - (5) - The average scores for \"physical and mental health\" in Group E were 3.878 and 3.868, respectively, before and after the test. The t value of the paired sample test was 0.164, p > 0.05, which did not reach significance. It showed that there was no difference in the satisfaction of the \"physical and mental health\" in Group E before and after the test. 4.2.2. Difference Analysis of the Overall Pre- and Post-Test of \"Stress\" among the Elderly in the Community before and after the Aromatherapy Intervention - (1) - The average \"pressure\" of Group A was 5.400 and 2.933, before and after the test, respectively. The t value of a paired sample test was 5.533, p < 0.05, reaching a significant level, indicating that the satisfaction of Group A in the pre-test and post-test was different, and that the post-test (M = 2.933) was lower than the pre-test (M = 5.400). - (2) - The mean values of \"pressure\" in Group B were 2.867 and 0.867 in the pre-test and post-test, respectively. The t value of the paired sample test was 4.369, p < 0.05, reaching a significant level, which showed that the satisfaction of Group B in the pre-test and post-test was different, and that the post-test (M = 0.867) was lower than the pre-test (M = 2.867). - (3) - The mean values of \"pressure\" in Group C were 2.267 and 1.867 in the pre- and post-test, respectively. The t value of this paired sample test was 1.247, p > 0.05, which did not reach a significant level. It showed that there was no significant difference in the satisfaction of Group C before and after the \"stress\" test. - (4) - The mean values of \"pressure\" in Group D were 3.533 and 1.933 in the pre- and post-test, respectively.
