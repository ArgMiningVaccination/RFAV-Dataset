No need to fall into a Google black hole trying to figure that one out, let me break it down for you! Naturopathic medicine is a system that focuses on a holistic approach to health care through a more natural lens. Everything from nutrition to herbal remedies to even physical exercise are simple, and natural ways to help your bodies heal and function as it is meant to. Naturopathy emerged from a combination of 19th century European traditional and conventional healthcare approaches. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are trained to diagnose and manage conditions with a focus on therapeutic order. Six core principles Naturopathic doctors adhere to six core principles and these are what drew me to becoming a naturopathic doctor: 1) Do no harm 2) The healing power of nature 3) Identify and treat the causes 4) Doctor as teacher 5) Treat the whole person 6) Prevention Do you have more questions on naturopathic medicine? Check out our Frequently Asked Questions on Naturopathic Medicine. Naturopathic medicine with Dr. Sarah Long before I became a naturopathic doctor, I knew that I wanted to help people achieve optimal health naturally, which is why this field really called out to me. Applying over ten years of clinical experience as a naturopathic doctor, acupuncturist, and herbalist I love being able to work with each patient individually to bring ancient medicinal practices into this century and really help them heal in a healthy, natural way. My approach with naturopathy differentiates me from others in the area due to my focus and passion for herbal medicine. I enjoy personalizing botanical formulations and appreciate that when herbals are combined they can create such wonderful solutions for patients with chronic, complicated, and challenging health issues. Eastern and Western herbal medicine traditions play a huge role in my practice. Each patient is different, and being able to make personalized teas, formulas, and plans for them brings me great joy and purpose. I make it my goal to go above and beyond to help support each and every one of my patients on their healthcare journey, including keeping up to date with research to provide evidence informed assessments and plans. In addition to herbals, I also focus on environmental factors that most conventional approaches may overlook. For example, heavy metals, mold/mycotoxins, and environmental toxins can play a huge role in how our bodies function and run and when these are addressed I've seen amazing improvements in patient's health. When it comes to naturopathic health, you're never too young or old. I absolutely LOVE working with patients of all ages, but have a huge passion for working with the 65+ population on healthy aging. As we age, our bodies go through so many different changes. In early childhood we experience growing pains, then go through adolescence and deal with a handful of hormonal changes. Once we're older, our bodies eventually start to recede and not expand as much as they used to, but that doesn't mean we have to give into it! Working with seniors to age well and live active and healthy lives brings me so much joy. My ultimate goal is to support and heal your body by working with it as a whole, not just through the symptoms. I always create an individualized plan that is not only specific to YOU, but also teaches you how to prevent future illness and stay healthy long after our time together.
