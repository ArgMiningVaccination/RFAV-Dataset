The Sun Lodge Village Elders say, \"Our traditional ceremonies are older than time. They are the ways that our ancestors used for countless generations to connect to the spiritual realm, and to find guidance on how to live in the physical world. Ceremony is the centre of an Anishinaabe spiritual way of life. Ceremony brings us back to who we are, and holds the key to finding our strength and well-being. The sacred fire holds open the doorway for our spirits to connect with the spirit realm of our ancestors and spirit guides. Ceremony brings together traditional teachings and personal engagement with spiritual energies. Ceremonies strengthen us and they clear our path so all our doubts and fears, worries and concerns can be addressed. That's what the ceremonies guarantee.\" Traditional and Cultural Services ensure children, youth, and families are able to connect to Indigenous culture and practices. Our Elders are dedicated to sharing the strength, beauty and wisdom of our Anishinaabe spiritual life ways. We understand that these traditional ways of being provide the healing and guidance needed to regain our original strength as Anishinaabe people. We are committed to providing opportunities for every child, youth and family served to reconnect with these traditional ways. We can anticipate less need for child protective services as our family circles become stronger. Traditional ceremonies include but are not limited to Full Moon Ceremonies, Sweat Lodge, Naming Ceremony, Medicine Picking, Sundance, Ghost Dance, Warrior Dance, Winter Solstice, New Year's Eve Memorial Round Dance, and Wiindigo Ceremony.
