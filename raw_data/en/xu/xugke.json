Organic ingredients such as chamomile from Weleda's farming partners in Kosovo, rosemary from Portugal and the finest organic sunflower seed oil from Hungary provide precious oil extractions. Skin Food is a much-loved multi-tasking and multi-award-winning product to care intensively for hands, face or body.

Ideal for oily or combination skin, it includes skin-healing calendula, soothing chamomile, smoothing viola tricolor and revitalising rosemary. The addition of organic cocoa seed butter from farming partners in Peru together with organic shea butter from Burkina Faso, means this silky skin saviour glides on beautifully. Suitable for everyday use on the face and body, and a lighter option in warmer weather.
