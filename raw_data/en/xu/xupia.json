These standards are based on currently available evidence based information, Alberta Health (AH) policy, and provincial and national guidelines. Immunizers must be knowledgeable about the specific vaccines they administer. Background & General Information The Canadian Immunization Guide provides the following guidelines which informs Alberta's policy on the reporting of AEFI as part of comprehensive vaccine safety surveillance: Vaccine pharmacovigilance has bee n defined as the science and activities related to the detection, assessment, understanding and communication of adverse events following immunization and other vaccine -related or immunization -related issues, and to the prevention of untoward effects of th e vaccine or immunization. Health care providers have essential and pivotal roles to play in gaining and maintaining public confidence in the safety of vaccines. These include providing evidence -based information on the benefits and risks of vaccines; help ing clients and patients to interpret media and Internet vaccine safety messages; and identifying and reporting adverse events following immunization. Any single occurrence of an unusual event following immunization may be coincidental or caused by the vac cine. An accumulation of reports, sometimes as few as four or five, may signal a risk due to the vaccine. Thus, each and every report submitted by vaccine providers is important. Alberta Health (AH) developed the Adverse Event s Following Immunization (AEFI) Policy for Alberta Immunization Providers (October 2019 ) to provide guidance for AEFI reporting for surveillance. This provides a process to monitor vaccine safety, and to detect emerging signals or trends within our province and across the country. The Adverse Events Following Immunization Policy for Alberta Immunization Providers is provided under the authority of the Public Health Act (Act) and Part 2 of the Immunization Regulation which outlines the requirements for the reporting of adverse events following immunization. In Alberta, the management of AEFIs includes analysis of the event and interpretation for subsequent immunization. Individuals who have experienced an AEFI may unnecessarily be advised to avoid subsequent immunization, which may have important adverse personal and population health consequences. Data from AEFI reports contribute to provincial immunization program evaluation as well as to the national AEFI surveillance. AHS reports AEFI data nominally to A lberta Health (AH) Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 2 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health for entry into the AH Immunization and Adverse Reaction to Immunization Reporting (Imm/ARI) system . AH submits monthly electronic non -identifiable AEFI data to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) , which is compiled nationally to assist in monitoring emerging safety signals that may not be detected at a provincial or local level. In Alberta, it is the responsibility of all immunizers who provide provincial ly and non - provincially -funded vaccines to be aware of possible adverse events following immunization and to follow provincial processes for assessing, reporting and monitoring of AEFI. As part of the immunization program, s creening must be in place to assess for previous AEFI. This is a component of determining fit to immunize. There should be s ystems in place to alert immunization providers to previous AEFI s. Reporting an adverse event with a temporal association to a vaccine does not imply causality. Causality assessment involves the consideration of vaccine attributable risk (whether there is a causal association betw een a vaccine and an adverse event) and determining whether the vaccine(s) caused the adverse event or whether the event would have occurred anyway. Health practitioners are encouraged to consult the following as companion references to this document: o Alberta Immunization Policy o Canadian Immunization Guide o Canadian Communicable Disease Report o Public Health Agency of Canada User Guide to Completion and Submission of the AEFI Reports Applicability This standard applies to : Health practitioners who provide immunization and a ll health practitioners who become aware of an AEFI following immunization. Immunization Competency In November 2008, the Public Health Agency of Canada published the Immunization Competencies for Health Professionals with a goal of promoting safe and competent practices for immunization providers. The following competency outlined in that document is applicable to this standard: Vaccine Development and Evaluation: i ntegrates into practice knowledge about the main steps in vaccine development and evaluation . Adverse Events Following Immunization: a nticipates, identifies, and manages adverse events following immunization, as appropriate to the practice setting . Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 3 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health Definitions Adverse Event Following Immunization (A EFI): An adverse event following immunization is defined as an unfavourable health occurrence experienced by a patient that: (a) follows immunization, (b) cannot be attributed to a pre -existing condition, and (c) meets one or more of the following criteria, as determined by a health practitioner: (i) the health occurrence is life threatening, could result in permanent disability, requires hospitalization or urgent medical att ention, or for any other reason is considered to be of a serious nature; (ii) the health occurrence is unusual or unexpected, including, without limitation, an occurrence that (A) has not previously been identified, or (B) has previously been identified but is being re ported at increased frequency; (iii) the health occurrence cannot be explained by anything in the patient's medical history, including, without limitation, a recent disease or illness, or consumption of medication Adverse Event Reporting Form: the on-line electronic form used by non-Public H ealth practitioners to report AEFIs to the AHS Provincial AEFI team . Brighton Collaboration: a global research network that collaborates to facilitate the development, evaluation, and dissemination of high -quality information about the safety of human vaccines. The primary aim of the Brighton Collaboration is to develop globally accepted and implemented standardized case definitions of adverse events following immunizations. https://www.brightoncollaboration.org/ Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active ( IMPACT ): \"a pediatric, hospital -based network funded by PHAC and administered by the Canadian Paediatric Society. IMPACT conducts a national surveillance network for adverse events following immunization, vaccine failures and selected vaccine preventable diseases in children. The 12 IMPACT hospitals encompass approximately 90% of tertiary care pe diatric beds in Canada. Nurse monitors actively search for children admitted to IMPACT hospitals with neurologic and other high priority adverse events. The nurse monitors determine whether these events have followed immunization within a timeframe that could implicat e vaccine as a possible cause. All such AEFI are reported to PHAC as well as to local public health officials. \" Canadian Immunization Guide https://www.cps.ca/en/impact Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System (CA EFISS): a collaborative post-marketing federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) surveillance system that continuously monitors the safety of marketed vaccines in Canada, identifies increases in the frequency or severity of previously identified vaccine -related reactions , identifies previously unknown AEFI that could possibly be related to a vaccine, identifies areas that require further investigation and/or research and provides timely information on AEFI reporting profiles for vaccines marketed in Canada that can help inform immunization related decisions . Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 4 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health Section 1: Reporting AEFI to Alberta Health Services Provincial AEFI Team When to Report an AEFI to Alberta Health Services ? All Health practitioners are to report an adverse event following immunization to the AHS Provincial AEFI team within 3 days of determining or being informed that a patient has experienced an adverse event following immunization unless it has already been reported. What to Report to Alberta Health Services ? A) Public Health Pr actitioner s report AEFI based on criteria outlined in part 5 (pages 8 -43), Reportable Adverse Events Following Immunization in the Adverse Events Following Immunization Policy for Alberta Immunization Providers . B) Non-Public Health Practitioners report based on the following: Any adverse event following immunization is defined as an unfavourable health occurrence experienced by a patient that: (a) follows immunization, (b) cannot be attributed to a pre -existing condition, and (c) meets one or more of the following criteria, as determined by a health practitioner: (i) the health occurrence is life threatening, could result in permanent disability, requires hospitalization or urgent medical attention, or for any other reas on is considered to be of a serious nature; (ii) the health occurrence is unusual or unexpected, including, without limitation, an occurrence that (A) has not previously been identified, or (B) has previously been identified but is being reported at increased frequency; (iii) the health occurrence cannot be explained by anything in the patient's medical history, including, without limitation, a recent disease or illness, or consumption of medication. If unsure or have questions , contact AHS Provincial AEFI team at AEFI@ahs.ca or 1-855- 444-2324 . The following data elements must be reported in respect of the adverse event following immunization: a) patient first name and last name; b) patient personal health number or unique lifetime identi fier; c) patient date of birth; d) patient sex at birth; e) description of the adverse event, including, without limitation, any applicable symptom or diagnosis listed in the Immunization Regulation Schedule as reported by the patient or observed or diagnosed by th e health practitioner, as the case may be, and the onset and duration of the adverse event; f) vaccine code of the vaccine used in the immunization preceding the adverse event following immunization, if available; g) lot number of the vaccine used in the immuniz ation preceding the adverse event following immunization, if available; h) manufacturer of the vaccine used in the immunization preceding the adverse event following immunization, if available; i) date of the immunization preceding the adverse event following im munization; Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 5 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health j) delivery management site code for the immunization preceding the adverse event following immunization, if available; k) first name, last name and telephone number of the person reporting. How do Health Practitioners Report AEFI 's? There are numerous ways an AEFI can be reported : Client reports AEFI to any health practitioner (e.g., public health , physician, pharmacist, emergency department ) directly Client reports AEFI to Health Link who then contacts the client's home Public Health Centre or the Provincial AEFI team , dependent on who administered the vaccine External provider ( e.g., physician, pharmacist) reports AEFI to the Provincial AEFI team Internal partner ( e.g., AHS WHS) reports AEFI to the Provincial AEFI team IMPACT reports AEFI to the Provincial AEFI team AH reports AEFI to AHS Provincial AEFI team (e.g., for AEFI submitted directly to Public Health Agency of Canada or phone calls received from external providers ) Reporting AEFIs - Zone AHS Public Health Vaccine administered by Public H ealth : 1. Public Health Nurse (PHN) receives report of suspected AEFI from Client, Parent/Guardian, Provincial AEFI Team, Health Link or other Health Practitioner resulting from vaccine administered by Public Health . 2. PHN collects required information (demographics, location of immunization, vaccines administered, symptoms) from Client, Parent/Guardian, Health Link or other Health Practitioner . Gathers supporting documentation as required to provide as complete a picture of the AEFI as possible. 3. Completes appropriate documentation in AHS electronic immunization database (PCS in Meditech). 4. If the vaccine was administered by AHS Public Health, and the PHN determines that symptoms meet Alberta Health reporting cri teria for an AEFI, PHN completes \"AdvEventtoImm\" Immunization module in AHS electronic immunization database (Meditech) . 5. PHN sends an email to AEFI@ahs.ca with client demographic information (Name, DOB, ULI) indicating that an AEFI was completed for the Provincial AEFI team to follow -up. Include any supporting documentation not included in Meditech (e.g., emergency/urgent care records, physician visit notes, photos taken by parent, specialist consults). When required, following the Health Information Act (HIA) include supporting documentation for those categories requiring diagnosis by a physician (e.g., laboratory reports, summary notes). Vaccine administered by N on-Public Health P ractitioner: 1. If PHN determines that the vaccine was administered by a non-public h ealth practitioner: PHN completes report of suspected AEFI on AHS webpage reporting form or by calling the toll-free phone number at 1 -855-444-2324 . 2. If a PHN receives report of suspect ed AEFI from a non -public health practitioner (e.g., physician, pharmacist, long term c are, WHS, etc.) : PHN should refer the health practitioner to the AHS webpage reporting form or the toll -free phone number at 1-855-444-2324 . Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 6 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health Reporting AEFIs - All Non-Public Health Practitioners : (including but not limited to: physicians, pharmacists, acute care, occupational health , non -public health nursing, physiotherapists , etc. ) Complete and s ubmit the AHS Provincial AEFI report form found at Adverse Event Following Immunizati on (AEFI) Reporting for All Health Care Practitioners in Alberta or call 1 -855-444-2324. Section 2: AHS Provincial AEFI Team Responsibilities AEFI reports submitted to the AHS P rovincial AEFI team by public health or non -public health practitioners are followed up by a team of public health nurses in consultation with zone Medical Officers of Health to provide immunization recommendations and submission of the AEFI report form to AH . The Provincial AEFI team : Gather s supporting documentation ( e.g., emergency/urgent care records, physician visit notes, photos taken by parent, specialist consults) as required for non -public health administered vaccine. When required, following the Health Information Act (HIA) include s supporting documentation for those categories requiring diagnosis by a physician (e.g., laboratory reports, summary notes) w hen the AEFI is submitted to AH. Assess es and provide s recommendations for further immunization . Consult s zone MOH as appropriate. Communicate s recommendations t o the client verbally or by letter depending on zone processes. Consult s and request s recommendations from the CMOH/designate at Alberta Health in those rare circumstances when the event is unusual and not included in the Adverse Event Following Immunization Policy for Alberta Immunization Providers document. Indicate CMOH advice is requested in the MOH/ MOH designate comments field of the AEFI form if a response or reply is required. If an allergist referral is required, follow s zone processes . Submit s the AEFI to AH . If the investigation of the AEFI will take greater than 2 weeks, a preliminary report should be submitted . The final AEFI report can be submitted once the investigation is complete. When an AEFI is reported and the client received care in another province, or the vaccine was given in another province, collaboration with AH is necessary to gather further information. What is reported by AHS Provincial AEFI team to Alberta Health (Chie f Medical Officer) All AEFIs that meet the criteria for the reportable categories outlined in the Adverse Events Following Immunization Policy temporally related (e.g ., related in time) to an immunization, with or without clear evidence of causality within 4 days of making that determination . The two exceptions to this: Anaphylaxis (including allergic reactions where epinephrine is administered) following a provincially funded vaccine; and Death temporally linked to a provincially funded vaccine These are to be reported to AHS immediately/as soon as possible. AHS will report to AH within 24 hours. Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 7 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health Data elements that must be included: patient first and last name identifiers, patient PHN or ULI, DOB, sex at birth, vaccine code lot number, vaccine manufacturer, immunization date, the adverse event, the recommendation provided, if any, and the delivery management site. Additional data elements to be included if available; dosage, route, site, number of previous doses of antigen. All antigens given on the same immunization date regardless if the AEFI appears to be related to one antigen in particular. Multiple AEFIs associated with one or more vaccines given on th e same immunization date using one AEFI report. For example, if a client reports a severe local reaction and a convulsion following the administration of vaccine(s) given on the same immunization date, use the same AEFI report. Events that do not meet spec ific case definitions but are felt to be significant (i.e., serious or unusual) under Other Severe or Unusual Events. Alberta Health Services Standard #11.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Version 2 Page 8 of 10 Population, P ublic and Indigenous Health Section 3: Non -Reportable Adverse Events Following Immunization Fever Fever, by itself, is no longer reportable. It is an expected reaction following immunization. Fever is also a common occurrence in children with illnesses unrelated to immunization. Do not report the occurrence of fever unless it accompanies one or more reportable AEFI. Local inflammation, swelling, and/or pain (moderate severity) Do not report less severe local reactions. Mild or moderate local reactions are expected reactions to immunization. See Swelling with/without pain to see if reaction meets reporting requirements. High pitched unusual crying This reactio n was almost exclusively related to whole cell pertussis vaccine, which is no longer used; this category is no longer reportable. Unusual crying episodes should be considered under Screaming episode/persistent crying. Screaming episode/persistent crying (l ess severe) Do not report an episode of consolable but persistent screaming or crying with duration between one and three hours. This is likely related to discomfort from the injection. It is considered an expected reaction in children less than two years of age. Allergic reaction (mild) Do not report using this code. Mild and severe allergic reactions have been combined into one category: Report allergic reactions meeting the criteria Allergic reaction. Excessive somnolence Excessive somnolence or prolonge d sleeping with difficulty rousing is not considered to be an adverse reaction. Irritability Responses to pain and the assessment of the level of irritability are highly variable. Irritability is considered to be an expected response of infants to fever, d iscomfort, or disruptions in schedule. It may also be an indication of an intercurrent condition or illness, unrelated to immunization. Coma Do not report coma using this code. Please use code Other Unusual Events (if appropriate). Apnoea Do not report apn oea.
