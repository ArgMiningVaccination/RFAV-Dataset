A Sladen Librarian will work with you to research your topic and find information in a timely manner. A librarian is available Monday-Friday 8:30am-4:30pm on K-17 in Henry Ford Hospital. Sladen databases and electronic resources are available for Henry Ford Health team members and affiliated students. If you are using a computer at a Henry Ford Health facility or on the Henry Ford Health network, you will not need an ID and password to access online resources. For access from home or off-network, you will be prompted to login to remote access. Most users can login to the library remotely using their Henry Ford Health Corp ID and password (it's the same as your Henry Ford Health Outlook ID and password). Contact the Sladen Library if you do not have a Henry Ford Health Corp ID and password. Please visit our web page [Sladen Remote Access](http://henryford.libguides.com/remoteaccess) for further information. The following is a list of Sladen Library databases that will be helpful in locating articles and information. If you would like search help or research assistance from a Sladen librarian, please contact the library or fill out the [Literature Search Request](http://henryford.libwizard.com/lit-search-request) form.
