Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information April 2 2, 2023 COVID -19 Updates from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Terminated for monovalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer) On 4/18/2023, the FDA terminated Emergency Authorization (EUA) for monovalent mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Novavax and Johnson & Johnson vaccines is not affected by this change. Updates from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Updated: OHA COVID -19 Vaccine Pr otocol On 4/19/2023 following FDA regulatory action, the CDC acted to simplify its COVID -19 vaccine recommendations and allow more flexibility for people at higher risk who want the option of added protection from additional bivalent COVID -19 vaccine doses . The CDC also updated its guidance to no longer recommend the use of the original (monovalent) COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. On 4/21/ 2023, the OHA Public Health Division Immunization Program updated the COVID -19 Vaccine Pharmacy Protocol for Immuni zation . The major changes to the protocol since include: Removal of the monovalent mRNA vaccines. Authoriz ation of current bivalent vaccines to be used for all doses administered to individuals 6 months of age. Authori zation of an additional bivalent vaccine dose for adults 65 years of age 4 months after their previous bivalent dose. This dose is optional but may be administered at the recipient's request. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 8 Authorization of an additional bivalent vaccine dose for certa in immunocompromised persons 1 or 2 months after their previous bivalent dose, depending on age. Additional doses may be administered at their provider's discretion. Persons 6 years of age are up -to-date if they have received a single dose of bivalent CO VID-19 vaccine, regardless of any previous COVID -19 vaccination history. Persons who are unable or choose not to receive a bivalent mRNA vaccine, are up- to-date if they have received the recommended number of Novavax doses. Board of Pharmacy Statement on Serv ices Provided Under DHHS Guidance On March 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) issued a Declaration Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID -19 to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID -19. There have been 10 amendments as well as various General Counsel advisory opinions and DHHS guidance documents concerning the PREP Act. For a PREP Act emergency determination, the Secretary must specify an end date; in this case, it is currently October 1, 2024, in most cases (although there are some exceptions). On April 1 4, 2023 D HHS noticed an intent to extend certain provisions of the act to December 31, 2024. Advisory Opinion 20 -02 on the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act and the Secretary's Declaration under the Act , (May 19, 2020), set forth the PREP Act's legal framework for identifying a ''qualified person'' (which include pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy interns) and preemption of state law that is different from, or is in conflict with, that designation. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has determined that it will not take disciplinary action against licensees and registrants who act in accordance with DHHS guidance considering DHHS's position that state law is preempted. The Board does not take a position on whether DHHS's position on the preemption of state law is valid. If a complaint is received by the board relating to activities covered under DHHS guida nce, the board will expect the licensee and registrant to provide documentation of full compliance with provisions of the PREP Act and DHHS Guidance. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Info rmation March 14, 2023 Updates from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Oregon will lift mask requirement for health care settings on April 3, 2023. Workers, patients and visitors in health care settings will no longer be required to wear masks starting April 3, 2023. OHA is rescinding provisions in Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 333 -019-1011 that require workers in health care settings - including pharmacies - to wear masks. The requirement has been in effect since August 2021. In addition, Executive Order 22 -24 expired on March 6, 2023. The emergency gave hospitals needed flexibility to respond to a surge in respiratory infections, including COVID -19, R SV and influenza. OHA's decision to end statewide health care mask requirements aligns with decisions in other states, including Washington. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 9 End of the Federal COVID -19 National Emergency and COVID -19 PHE on May 11, 2023 On Jan. 30, 2023, the Biden Administration announced its intent to end the national emergency and public health emergency declarations on May 11, 2023, rel ated to the COVID -19 pandemic. These emergency declarations have been in place since early 2020, and gave the federal government flexibility to waive or modify certain requirements in a range of areas, including in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs , and in private health insurance, as well as to allow for the authorization of medical countermeasures and to provide liability immunity to providers who administer services, among other things. FDA's EUAs for COVID -19 products (including tests, vaccines, and treatments) A separate emergency declaration pursuant to Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act was issued by the Secretary of HHS in February 2020 . Based on this determination, on March 27, 2020, the Secretary declared that circumstances existed to justify emergency use authorization (EUA) of medical countermeasures for COVID -19.

Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Pauses Shipping of Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab Together, Etesevimab Alone, and REGEN -COV On 12/23/2021, it was announced that circulating SARS -CoV -2 viral variants, including Omicron, may be associated with resistance to monoclonal antibodies. Health care providers should review the Antiviral Resistance information in the Healthcare Provider Fact Sheet for each authorized therapeutic for de tails regarding specific variants and resistance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes information about circulating variants in the United States by region. The frequency of the Omicron variant is increasing throughout the U.S. and health care providers should refer to these frequency data as they choose a therapeutic option for their patients. FDA updated the Health Care Provider Fact Sheets for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together , REGEN -COV , and sotrovimab with specific information regarding expected activity against the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529/BA.1). These da ta show that it is unlikely that bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together or REGEN -COV will retain activity against this variant . Based on similar cell culture data currently available, sotrovimab appears to retain activity against the Omicron var iant.

NAN Alert on Age -Related COVID -19 Vaccine Mix -Ups The National Alert Network (NAN) has issued an alert about Age -Related COVID -19 Vaccine Mix -Ups . Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FD A) authorized the emergency use of a specific formulation (10 mcg/0.2 mL) of the Pfizer -BioNTech coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 years, reports of mix -ups with the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine formulation inte nded for individuals 12 years and older (30 mcg/0.3 mL) have been pouring in. Most of the mix-ups occurred in outpatient or ambulatory care settings such as public health clinics, community pharmacies, physician practices, and outpatient clinics. Based on reports sent to the ISMP National Vaccine Errors Reporting Program (ISMPVERP) involving hundreds of children, and the fact that adverse event reporting programs do not re ceive all the actual cases, it is likely that thousands have been impacted. Some children ages 12 and older received the formulation intended for children 5 to 11 years, resulting in underdoses. Other The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 30 children ages 5 to 11 years received the formulation intended for individuals 12 years and older, resulting in overdoses. Some errors are due to vial or syringe mix -ups. In other errors, healthcare providers incorrectly thought it was acceptable if only 10 mcg of the formulation intended for individuals 12 yea rs or older was administered to children 5 to 11 years, either as 0.1 mL (10 mcg) or by diluting the 10 mcg dose in a syringe to 0.2 mL.

Recent COVID -19 Vaccine Updates COMIRNATY \u00ae On 8/23/2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first COVID -19 vaccine. The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as COMIRNATY \u00ae (koe -mir' -na-tee), for the prevention of COVID -19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA ), including for individuals 12 through 15 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. There is not an anticipated update to the OHA Pharmacy Immunization Protocols due to this approval. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 39 Interchangeabil ity of FDA authorized and FDA approved COVID -19 Products The FDA -approved Pfizer -BioNTech product COMIRNATY\u00ae (COVID -19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the FDA - authorized Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine under EUA have the same formulation and can be used interchangeabl y to provide the COVID -19 vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns.

CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreements and Off -Label Use of the Vaccine Providers of COVID -19 vaccine via a CDC agreement are responsible for adhering to all requirements outlined in the agreement. Specifically, providers are reminded that they must administer COVID -19 vaccines in accordance with all program requirements and recommendations of CDC, the Advisory Committee on Immu nization Practices (ACIP ), and the U.S Food and Drug Administration ( FDA). This applies to both EUA and FDA -approved COVID -19 vaccines. Accordingly, use of these products outside of those that have been approved and authorized by FDA (often referred to as \"off-label use\") is not recommended as it would violate the provider agreement and could expose providers to the following risks: Administration of the product off label may not be covered under the PREP Act or the PREP Act declaration; therefore, providers may not have immunity from claims. Individuals who receive an off -label dose may not be eligible for compensation under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program after a possible adverse event. CDC has d efined the scope of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program in terms of how the USG - provided vaccines may be used in the program. Providers giving off -label doses would be in violation of the CDC Program provider agreement potentially impacting their ability to remain a provider in the CDC program. Administration fees may not be reimbursable by payers. COVID -19 Booster Shots for all Americans Receiving mRNA vaccines On 8/18/2021, public health and medical experts from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a media statement related to COVID -19 booster shots for the mRNA vaccines. \"Based on our latest assessment, the current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especial ly among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout,\" read the statement. \"For that reason, we conclude that a booster shot will be needed to maximize vaccine- induced protection and prolong its dura bility.\" The current administration is prepared to offer COVID -19 booster shots for all Americans starting the week of Sept. 20 and eight months after an individual's second dose of an mRNA vaccine series. (HHS expects more data on the need for a potentia l Johnson & Johnson booster shot in the coming weeks.) Before any booster shots are distributed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must first review the safety and effectiveness of administering booster doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will then review the FDA's evaluation. When the FDA and ACIP complete their reviews, the Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup will asses s the The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 40 recommendation .

The temporary rule is in response to the significant increase in COVID -19 cases and the significant decrease in hospital bed capacity in Oregon as a result of spread of the Delta variant. COVID -19 undergoes frequent mutations as it repl icates, which over time has resulted in variants that are more transmissible, cause more severe disease, or have other features of public health concern such as decreased vaccination effectiveness. At the time of this rule adoption, the Delta variant made up the vast majority of sequenced specimens in Oregon. The Delta variant is approximately two to three times more infectious than early wild-type COVID -19 variants. There is emerging evidence that people infected with the Delta variant have similar viral loads regardless of vaccination status suggesting that even vaccine breakthrough cases may effectively transmit this variant. COVID -19 infection is transmitted predominately by inhalation of respiratory droplets generated when people cough, sneeze, sing, ta lk, or breathe. Studies show that masks and face coverings block the release of respiratory droplets into the environment and can reduce the wearer's exposure to droplets. COVID -19 viral particles spread between people more readily indoors than outdoors. In the interest of public health, individuals are required to wear a mask or face covering when in indoor spaces defined as follows: \"Indoor spaces\" mean anywhere indoors, including but not limited to public and private workplaces, businesses, indoor areas open to the public, building lobbies, common or shared spaces, classrooms, elevators, bathrooms, transportation services and other indoor spaces where people gather for any purpose. An indoor space does not include a private residence, or a private automo bile used for personal use that is not used for ride sharing.

COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information August 10, 2021 COVID -19 Updates from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) New Rule Require s Workers in Health Care Settings to be Fully Vaccinated or Tested Weekly OAR 333-019 -1010 helps to prevent and slow the spread of COVID -19 by requiring health care personnel and healthcare staff who work in healthcare settings to either be fully vaccinated against COVID -19 or be tested for COVID -19 on at least a weekly basis. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 42 Healthcare per sonnel includes individuals, paid and unpaid working, learning, studying, assisting, observing, or volunteering in a healthcare setting who are providing direct patient or resident care or who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients, residents, or infectious materials. This includes but is not limited to any individual licensed by a health regulatory board as defined in ORS 676.160 (which includes Pharmacists, Interns, Certified Oregon Pharmacy Technicians, and Pharmacy Technicians ), unlicensed caregivers, and any clerical, dietary, environmental services, laundry, security, engineering, and facilities management, administrative, billing, student, and volunteer personnel . Healthcare settings covered by this rule include any place whe re health care, including physical or behavioral health care is delivered, including, but not limited to any health care facility or agency licensed under ORS chapter 441 or 443, such as hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, birthing centers, special inpatient care facilities, long -term acute care facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, inpatient hospice facilities, nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, adult foster homes, residential facilities, residential behavioral health facilitie s, pharmacies , hospice, vehicles or temporary sites where health care is delivered (e.g., mobile clinics, ambulances), and outpatient facilities, such as dialysis centers, health care provider offices, behavioral health care offices, urgent care centers, c ounseling offices, offices that provide complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic and osteopathic medicine, and other specialty centers. An employer of healthcare providers or healthcare staff, contractors or responsible parties must have and follow a policy for: (a) Requesting and obtaining proof of vaccination from every healthcare provider and healthcare staff person. (b) Requiring COVID -19 testing on at least a weekly basis for any healthcare provider or healthcare staff person who is unvaccinated or has an unknown vaccination status. (c) Maintaining documentation of weekly COVID -19 test results for any healthcare provider or healthcare staff person who is unvaccinated or has an unkn own vaccination status. Full compliance with the rule is required no later than September 30, 2021. Off-label Use of COVID -19 Vaccine is Not Allowed IMPORTANT REMINDER: The COVID -19 vaccine provider agreement does NOT allow for off -label use of the vaccine, including additional doses such as a second dose after a Johnson & Johnson or a third dose after a Pfizer or Moderna series. Oregon Health Authority continues to endorse CDC and ACIP recommendations for COVID -19 vaccine dosing. Under current conditi ons, CDC and ACIP do not recommend administering booster doses of the COVID -19 vaccines. Administering a booster to an individual is outside the scope of the FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). Providers writing prescriptions for additional doses of vac cine should note that this practice is outside of the EUA and not recommended. Boosters recommended by a physician beyond the EUA scope should be discussed directly with the manufacturer and FDA. Vaccines given according to the currently recommended schedu le continue to be highly effective in reducing the risk of serious illness from COVID -19. Observational data confirm that currently available vaccines are effective against new variants, including the Delta variant. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 43 Expired Pharmacy Immunization Protocols Online Many of the currently posted immunization and pharmacy protocols expired on July 31, 2021. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is in the process of reviewing these expired protocols for updates and putting the most commonly used protocols into an updated format. The OHA anticipate s having this complete by September 15th. Until that time, with the approval of the Immunization Program's medical director, Dr. Paul Cieslak, the OHA is extending the expiration date to September 30, 20 21. The OHA does not anticipate that the needed updates to these protocols are significant or that following the currently published protocols as written will cause any issues. If you have any questions, please contact Amanda Timmons at amanda.j.timmons@dhsoha.state.or.us . Ivermectin Prescriptions for Treating or Preventing COVID -19 The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID - 19 in humans and it has not been proven to be safe or effective for this indication . Pharmacists receiving prescriptions for ivermectin for the treatment or preventi on COVID -19 should use their professional judgment in determin ing whether to fill them. If you have concerns related to the prescribing practices of a practitioner, it may be appropriate to reach out to their licensing board. The following rules may apply: OAR 855-019 -0200 General Responsibilities of a Pharmacist ORS 689.025 states that \"the practice of pharmacy in the State of Oregon is declared a health care professional practice affecting the public health, safety and welfare\". Pharmacy practice is a dynamic patient -oriented health service that applies a scientific body of knowledge to improve and promote patient health by means of appropriate drug use, drug-related therapy, and communicati on for clinical and consultative purposes. A pharmacist licensed to practice pharmacy by the Board has the duty to use that degree of care, skill, diligence and professional judgment that is exercised by an ordinarily careful pharmacist in the same or simi lar circumstances. OAR 855-019 -0210 Duties of the Pharmacist Receiving a Prescription (2) A pharmacist receiving a prescription is responsible for: (a) Using professional judgment in dispensing only pursuant to a valid prescription. A pharmacist shall not dispense a prescription if the pharmacist, in their professional judgment, believes that the prescription was issued without a v alid patient -practitioner relationship. In this rule, the term practitioner shall include a clinical associate of the practitioner or any other practitioner acting in the practitioner's absence. The prescription must be issued for a legitimate medical purp ose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of their professional practice and not result solely from a questionnaire or an internet -based relationship; The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 44 COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information June 25 , 2021 Executiv e Order Rescinding All Remaining COVID -19 Restrictions; Continuing State Efforts to Support Ongoing COVID -19 Vaccination, Response and Recovery Efforts. In a press conference held on 6/25/2021, Governor Brown signed a recovery -focused Executive Order 21 - 15 that will lift all remaining COVID -19 health and safety restrictions issued under Oregon's emergency statutes when Oregon achieves a 70% first dose adult vaccination rate or on Wednesday, June 30, whichever occurs sooner . With restrictions lifted, the state will shift to a focus on helping Oregonians and communities recover from the impacts and the economic toll of the pandemic. With the repeal of the set of executive orders (20 -66, 20-22, 21-06, 20-28, 20-19) that placed COVID -19 related restrictions on Oregonians, the recovery order extends the emergency declaration for the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. The governor's remaining emergency authority will be limited in focus to COVID -19 recovery efforts. Under the new recover y order, masks will no longer be required statewide, but they will still be required in some places under federal guidance, including airports, public transportation and health care settings . For pharmacies, the recovery order will maintain all of the COV ID-19 emergency rules that are currently in place for pharmacies (remote work, temporary pharmacies, out of state licensees, PREP Act, etc.) and it is anticipated that there will not be a change from previous OHA interpretations pertaining to pharmacies and health care settings (see COVID communication update from 6/4/2021). Please view the governor's press release for additional information. COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information June 4 , 2021 COVID -19 Updates from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Updated OHA Guidance Documents As a reminder, per OAR 855 -007-0086 during a declared emergency, unprofessional conduct includes failing to comply with Oregon Health Authority (OHA) guidance implementing an Executive Order. Pharmacies are responsible for keeping up to date with the most recent guidance. The updates below are provided for pharmacy convenience. o On May 18, 2021 the Oregon Health Authority issued a new Statewide Reopening Guidance - Masks, Face Coverings, Face Shields Under the updated guidance, people who are fully vaccinated will no longer be required to wear a mask indoors, in most public settings where vaccination status is checked. In public settings where vaccination status is not checked, masks will still be required. Businesses remain free to establish their own, more restrictive policies regarding mask usage. If a business or employer chooses to no longer require masks and physical distancing, the business or employer must require visitors to show proof of vaccination and review the proof of vaccination. In that case, a business would need to have a policy for checking the vaccination status of customers and employees if they are not wearing masks. Fully vaccinated individuals would need to provide proof they are vaccinated if they want to remove face coverings and not observe physical distancing gui delines. Fully vaccinated individuals are required to continue wearing a mask and observe physical distancing on public transportation and in schools, healthcare settings, homeless shelters, youth and adult correctional facilities and long -term care facilities. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 45 Statewide, masks, face coverings or face shields are required to be worn by all individuals at all times unless the individual is fully vaccinated, UNLESS the individual is in: any setting where the owner or operator continues to require masks, face coverings or face shields in accordance with the Statewide Mask, Face Coverings, Face Shields Guidance health care settings o On May 20, 2021, the Oregon Health Authority issued revised Statewide Reopening Guidance - Retail Stores (includes pharmacies) Statewide Reopening Guidance - General Guidance for Employers o On May 25, 2021, the Oregon Health Authority issued a revised Minor Consent S tatement Pharmacists are not on the list of providers who can treat minors 15 and older without parental consent under Oregon law ( ORS 109.640 ) and so most pharmacies will require parental or guardian consent, which can be verbal or written. Some pharmacists may operate at the direction of a provider listed under ORS 109.640, and in this case the pharmacist is prohibited from requiring parental or guardian consent for a minor 15 or older who is consenting to a COVID -19 vaccination. OHA Interpretation of H ealth Care Setting as it Relates to Pharmacies The board has received questions from licensees requesting clarification of the updated mask guidance. We understand that OHA interprets health care settings as they relate to pharmacies as indicated below: Q*: Does a health care setting include a pharmacy department in a retail store? A*: The pharmacy \"area\" is a health care setting but the entire retail store is not considered a health care setting. If there is a pharmacy inside a retail store, the following areas related to the pharmacy are considered a health care setting: Any area where pharmacy staff are engaged in the pharmacy activities, including but not limited to preparing prescriptions, interacting with patients, administering vaccines. Any area where patients are waiting to interact with pharmacy staff, including but not limited to waiting in a line or in a designated waiting area for the pharmacy. Any area where a patient is interacting with pharmacy staff, including but not limited to dropping off /picking up a prescription or consu lting with the pharmacist. As an example, if there is a pharmacy within a retail store, the retail store after checking for proof of vaccination, could allow an individual to enter the retail store without a mask, face covering or face shield. If that fully -vaccinated individual goes to the pharmacy to pick up a prescription, the individual would have to put their mask, face covering or face shield back on when waiting in line or in a waiting area, and when interacting with pharmacy personnel. Q*: Is a \"closed door\" pharmacy, such as a mail order pharmacy or a pharmacy in an office setting that does not directly serve or interact with the public or patients a health care setting ? The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 46 A*: If a pharmacy is in a stand -alone building or office setting/suite within a building where the public or patients are not directly served nor interacted with, it would not be considered a health care setting. If a pharmacy is in a part of a health care facility or medical office that is a health care setting where the public or patients are not dir ectly served nor interacted with in the pharmacy \"area\" and it is physically separated from areas where patients are allowed or health care is delivered, with walls from floor to ceiling and a door that remains closed when not being used, that space would not be considered a health care setting. If fully vaccinated individuals are permitted to be in these non- health care setting areas without a mask, face covering or face shield, they must still wear a mask, face covering or face shield within any area that is a health care setting. COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information May 13 , 2021 COVID -19 Updates from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) Updated OHA COVID -19 Vaccine Protocol On 5/12/2021, the OHA Public Health Division Immunization Program updated the COVID -19 Vaccine Pharmacy Protocol for Immunization to: o Expand the age indication for Pfizer vaccine to children 12 -15 years of age in addition to persons 16 years of age and older. o Removed the 14 -day interval between COVID vaccine and other vaccines. o Added Polysorbate-80 has moved from contraindication to pr ecaution for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

Phone Scam The board has become aware that licensees are receiving scam phone calls from individuals impersonating Oregon Board of Pharmacy staff members. Licensees should be cautious of giving confidential or payment information over the phone without verifying that the source is legitimate as board staff will never ask for o r accept payment for any fees by phone. Scammers, claiming to be Oregon State Board of Pharmacy staff members, are calling pharmacists and saying that their facility or individual license is under investigation. Scammers may also state that they are working with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on a case, and further claim that the licensee is under investigation for suspicious activity or drug trafficking. In either case, the scammers claim that licensees will fac e disciplinary action, a revoked license, or arrest if they do not immediately pay a fine over the phone. Additionally, many scammers are \"spoofing\" the phone number used to call the pharmacist. Spoofing involves disguising the caller's true phone number a nd making it appear that the phone number is from a legitimate source. Scammers may even give a fake name and a The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 48 fraudulent inspector identification number as \"proof\" of identity.

This recommendation is made in the wake of reports of six cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in women 18 -48 years of age, with approximately 6.8 million doses of J&J va ccine administered to date. Symptoms in these patients began 6 -13 days following vaccination. CDC is convening its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) April 14, 2021 to review the relevant data. This pause in vaccination is recommended until ACIP and FDA review are completed. Today, CDC and FDA will provide additional information and answer questions at a media briefing. These cases were flagged in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), a component of national p ost-licensure vaccine safety monitoring. People who have received the J&J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider.

Subject to certain limitations, a covered person is immune from suit and liability under federal and state law with respect to all claims for loss resulting from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure if a declaration under the PREP Act has been issued with respect to such countermeasure. On 11/30/2020, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy issued a statement that it will not take disciplinary action against persons who act in accordance with DHHS guidance considering DHHS's position that state law is preempted. The Board does not take a position on whether DHHS's position on the preemption of state law is valid. If a complaint is received relating to activities covered under DHHS guidance, the Board will expect the licensee to provide documentation of full compliance. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action.

COVID -19 UPDATE - Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) Information December 4, 2020 Oregon OSHA Regulations Oregon OSHA recently adopted a Temporary COVID -19 rule (OAR 437-001-0744) that combats the spread of coronavirus in all workplaces by requiring employers to carry out a comprehensive set of risk-r educing measures. The rule was effective 11/16/2020, with certain parts phased in, and is expected to remain in effect until 05/04/2021. It is a continuation of the guidance produced by the Oregon Health Authority and enforced in the workplace by Oregon OSHA, including physical distancing, use of face coverings, ventilation, exposure risk assessment, infection control plan, information/training, notification/testing/medical removal, and special measures for high risk jobs (i.e. direct patient care). The ru le is intended to further improve the current structure for reducing risks in the workplace by requiring several measures many employers have voluntarily implemented. For example, it requires employers to notify employees of a workplace infection and provi de training to workers on how to reduce risks. Likewise, employers must formally assess the risk of exposure, develop infection control plans, and address indoor air quality within their current capability. A fact sheet is available that outlines the provisions of OAR 437 -001-0744. In addition on 11/25/2020, Oregon OSHA published a COVID -19 Workplace Advisory Memo: Application of COVID -19 Rule to Direct Patient Care within Retail Pharmacies that includes a distinction between the rules for all workplaces and those additional requirements that apply to work activities defined as involving \"exceptional risk.\" One of the triggers for exceptional risk is \"direct patient care.\" The Temporary COVID -19 The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 57 rule's def inition of \"direct patient care\" includes the following statement: \"Direct patient care does not include customer service activities provided in retail settings that have embedded healthcare offices, such as retail pharmacies.\" While that language clearly excludes all activities in a retail pharmacy that do not directly involve the treatment of patients, it does not exclude the provision of services such as vaccinations. However, in the interest of ensuring that the rule does not discourage vaccinations and any health screening services provided by retail pharmacies or similar establishments, Oregon OSHA will not be enforcing most of the \"exceptional risk\" requirements found in Subsection 4 of the temporary rule in relation to such activities. Click on the link above to read detail on what will and will not be enforced.

The DHHS guidance lists requirements that qualified pharmacy technicians and State -authorized pharmacy interns must satisfy. The declaration states that the authorization preempts any state and local law that prohibits or effectively prohibits those who satisfy requirements as set forth in the declaration from administering COVID -19 or routine childhood vaccines. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy will not take disciplinary action against persons who act in accordance with this DHHS guidance considering DHHS's position that state law is preempted. The Board does not take a position on whether DHHS's position on the preemption of state law is valid.

These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for doctors to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID -19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID -19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. The SNS will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to ship donated doses to states. As this situation evolves, the Board continues to reassess temporary rule OAR 855 -007- 0085. Related note: The FDA issued a letter to stakeholders, warning people to not use chloroquine phosphate intended for fish as treatment for COVID -19 in humans.

People should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider and is obtained through a legitimate source.

This temporary policy impacts 21 CFR 1306.11(d) , related to emergency schedule II prescribing, that states a pharmacist may dispense a schedule II controlled substance (CII, CS) upon receiving oral authorization of a prescribing individual practitioner, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. The DEA announced two tempor ary exemptions to the criteria of 1306.11(d) in order to enable greater flexibility on oral prescribing, during the PHE: The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 64 1. DEA grants practitioners 15 days within which to provide the follow -up paper prescription to the pharmacy (extending from 7 15 days) 2. DEA recognizes that during the PHE there may be times when providing the follow -up paper prescription to the pharmacy may prove very challenging or impossible. Therefore, in these instances, DEA permits the practitioner to send the follow -up prescription t o the pharmacy via fax, or to take a photograph or scan of this follow -up prescription and send to the pharmacy in place of the paper prescription (Note: practitioner shall maintain the original paper rx in the patient file). a. It is the responsibility of th e practitioner to ensure that the rx contains all requirements of 21 CFR 1306.05 and 1306.11(d) , including the statement \"Authorization for Emergency Dispensing\". b. Pharmacists continue to hav e a corresponding responsibility to ensure that any CS rx filled/dispensed was issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of his/her professional practice, per 21 CFR 1306.04(a) . Note: DEA does not assign a numerical limit to the amount of CII CS to be prescribed. Rather, the quantity prescribed and duration of the emergency oral CII rx is to be determined by the practitioner's \"sound medical discretion\", and shall be limited to \"the amount adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period.\" Prescription Refills - Options for Oregon Pharmacists to Issue Emergency Fills/ Continuation of Therapy As p reviously stated, the Division 007 rules are \"in effect\", allowing pharmacists the ability to address individual patient needs to provide timely access to safe care, while actively working to minimize the burden on clinics for the routine refills needed. The OBOP appreciates every single effort made by each pharmacist, intern, and technician working steadfastly on the \"frontlines\" of this global coronavirus crisis. The state of Oregon's emergency situation is or will soon be entering the next wave of this pandemic - it is anticipated that our hospitals will potentially begin admitting a surge of patients, struggling with advanced stages of the COVID-19 infection. The following options are provided for Oregon pharmacists to issue emergency refills, continuat ion of therapy of patient's maintenance medications, and respond to other patient needs. As a reminder, Division 007 ( OAR 855-007-0090 ) refill rules permit a pharmacist to dispense a refill of a prescription drug without a valid prescription provided that: In the pharmacist's professional judgment, the drug is essential to the maintenance of the patient's health or the continuation of therapy; and The pharmacist provides no more than a 30 -day supply; and The pharmacist records all relevant information and indicates that it is an Emergency Prescription; and The pharmacist informs the patient or the patient's agent that the drug is being provided without a prescriber's authorization and that a prescriber authorization is required for any additional refill. Note: The DEA has not suspended any regulations related to the scheduling of CS drugs, therefore a pharmacist may not dispense a refill of any CS medication without prescriber authorization. Oregon licensed pharmacists and pharmacies should consider creating P&Ps and training staff to provide the pharmacy services and medication access permitted by Division 020 - Pharmacist Prescriptive Authority , such as prescribing o f: Any post -diagnostic drugs and devices listed in the Formulary Compendium The Oregon Board of Pharmacy serves to promote and protect public health, safety and welfare by ensuring high standards in the practice of pharmacy and through effective regulation of the manufacture and distribution of drugs . 65 Medications/patient care services listed in the Protocol Compendium o Continuation of Therapy A pharmacist may prescribe any non -controlled medication to extend a patient's prescription therapy to avoid interruption of treatment; and in such cases, a pharmacist shall only prescribe a drug quantity sufficient for the circumstances, not to exceed a 60 day supply, and no more than two extensions in a 12 month period per medication. Note: For patients seeking > 30 day supply of certain psychotherapeutic drugs, seek prescriber authorization, par ticularly in consideration of the potential risk for suicide. Suicide Prevention Lifeline call 1 -800-273-8255 or chat online at www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org Oregon Health Authority - Crisis Lines o Cough and cold symptom management Pseudoephedrine products for patient s 18 years of age and older, verified by positive identification, not to exceed 3.6 grams or a 60 count quantity per prescription, whichever is less, or a total of three prescriptions in a 12 month period.

All pharmacists may additionally cons ider the use of Collaborative Drug Therapy Management practice agreements with available clinicians and Local Public Health Authorities, identifying a va riety of ways that pharmacists can address local needs (of patients, health systems and various care facilities in communities throughout the state). Having proactive strategies in place, having anticipated unique needs is a critical element of preparednes s.
