The committee appointed by the Speaker escor ted the Elected Officials to the House Chamber where the y were p resented to the Joint Session. The committee appointed by the Speak er escorted the Governor to the House Chamber. His Excellency, the Governor of the State of Idaho, Dirk Ke mpth orne, was introduced by the Speaker and the following State of the State Message and Budget Address was delivered by Governor Kempthorne: Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguish ed mem bers of the Legislature, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished members of the Judiciary, fellow Constitutional Officers, my fellow Idahoans;Two hundred year s ago this August, the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery first entered what is now the Stat e of Idaho . As we look back at their j ournals and accounts of the journey, we see a team of men, helped by a you ng Native American woman, dedicated to the mission of find ing new tr ade routes to the Pacific Ocean for the fledgling United States of America. Through tough winters, the soari ng Rocky Mountain peaks, and cascading rivers, the Corps of Discovery persevered. Across unfamiliar terrain, fighting hunger and the uncertainty of what laid around the next bend, Captains Lewis and Clark and their expedition were the very embodim ent of t he new nation's sense of wonder, excitement, and exploration. They opened up the West; and along the way, they left a legacy that current generations study and long to experience. What is the state of our state 200 years after this magnificent journey? Tonight I will aff irm to you that the state of our state is strong, and Idaho is poised for new and great opportunities. At the outset, I want to be very clear on an issue that has been the subject of a lot of speculation. I've heard some f olks say , \"There's never been a temporary tax increas e.\" Well I have news for them. On June 30th, the temporary sa les ta x will expire! It's a matter of credibility. We made a promise to the people of Idaho and I intend to keep it. I have some more good news to report: Individual pers onal income in Idaho is growing faster than any other stat e in the Northwest. Idaho continues to outpace the nation in our Gross State Product, the gr owth of the value of all our goods and services, and for the 19th month in a row, Idaho's unemployment rate is below the national average. We've been successful in attracting new businesses, retaining existing companies and pr oviding the new upgraded infrastructure to boost our rural communiti es. Empire Airlines is taking off, with a new hangar and corp orate offices at the Coeur d'Alene Airport. Jayco, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of recreational vehicles, is on the move to Twin Fall s. Macka y has hooked a winner with Gone Fishin' in a new business park we helped build through our Rural Initiative, and the list can go on and on. I'm recommend ing that we increase our effort in rural Idaho. I'm asking you to fund an additional $950,000 fo r the Rural Initiative , bringin g the total funding to $4.7 million, so we can continue this momentum. We've launched the Office of Science and Technology and they have spent the past year working with companies, Idaho's universities, and t he Idaho National Laboratory to expand high- tech opportunities in Idaho. We will open a new Tech Connect office in the Magic Valley. This will be our fourth Tech Connect office to help e ntrepreneurs in high-tech, start-up companies get off the ground. [January 10 HOUSE JOURNAL 9 I'm askin g for $375,000 in additional funding to support these science and tech initiatives, including a coordinated effort to attract millions of new federal research dollars to Idaho. We continue to diversify our state's economy by t apping into international markets. In just the first two quarters of this year, the value of Idaho products shipped abroad has jumped 50 percent to $1 .4 billion. We have momentum; now we must sustain it. We will continue to improve the infrastructure that allows us to sell Idaho goods and services to the world. That's why tonight I'm announcing an extraordinary opportunity to enhance Idaho's highways, improve safety, and expand c ommerce. It's a vision I call \"Connecting Idaho. \" Who wou ld have thought that in our lifetime that we could be talking about a safe, multi-lane highway from the C apital city, all the way to the Canadian border? This revolutionary idea of \"Connecting Idaho \" get s us a long way down that road, and includes long-awaited a nd much anticipated safety and highway improvements to each and every region of this state. Up north, we fix the instant bottleneck o n Highway 95 when you first enter Idaho from Canada. Then, from Sand point all the way to Coeur d'Alene - a four-lane freeway - and those four lanes continue south all t he wa y to Worley on that heavily traveled portion of Highway 95. We will finish constructio n on the decades old vision of a safe, multi-lan e highway from Moscow down to Lewiston. My plan is to eliminate dangerous curves and signific antly realign hazardous stretches of 95, and we're going to restore critical riparian areas and en vironmentally sensitive habitat. As we continue sout h, you c ome to Highway 55, where traffic often gets stalled along the beautiful Payett e River. Accidents and dea ths are an all-to-frequent occurrence on this stretch of two-lane highway. As a stud ent at the University of Idaho, I experienced the hazards of Highway 55 first hand when our car rolled six times, and would h ave ended up in the river had it not been for a snowbank. With the canyon walls and the river, there's no room to expand and add lanes, but why would we impact that be autiful , scenic environment when we can go around it? I'm proposing we fund a brand new 56-mile, f our-lane divided highway through I ndian V alley, a project that has been talked about for years. This will be a significant new artery to facilitate travel between north and south Idaho. It wi ll also get many of the heavy trucks and commercial traffic off of Highway 55 in the mos t safe and efficient manner possible. This will enhance Hig hway 55 to become one of the premier, pristine, scenic by-ways anywhere in the world and improve the recreation al expe rience for residents and visitors who use this magnificent river. In the Treasure Vall ey, there are solutions to the growing traffic concerns. But those solutions are years away and thecong estion will only worsen unless we take advantage of the opportunity that is before us. We can bring Highway 16 from Emmett all th e wa y to Interstate 84 with a four-lane divided highway. We can build six lanes between Caldwell and Meridian, upgrade existing interchanges and add new ones to improve safety and ease congestion. We can add new la nes an d replace all the interchanges from Orchard past Micron. In the Magic Valley, residents have long talked about the need for a new S nake River bridge that will get commercial traffic off Blue Lakes Boulevard and help communities on both sides of the river. Without this aggressive effort , that project is probably 30 years away from being completed. North of the Magic Valley, we'r e going to improve Highway 75 from the intersection with Highway 20 all the wa y to Ketchum and Sun Valley, a dding lanes and allowing for public transit opportunities in the future. We'll continue improvements on Highway 30 from McCammon to Soda Springs. Not only wi ll we have a four-lane highway that will showcase Lava Hot Springs as a destination resort, but the project will also restore the Portneuf River and wetlands in the area. Finally, Highway 20, the gatew ay to Yellowstone as well as world renowned recreational opportunities in Idaho will get the attention it deserves, a four -lane highway and new bridges over county roads, and completing the freeway fr om Idaho Falls to Ashton. As I ment ioned, many of these projects have been talked about for years, but never built because of a lack of funding. W e will issue r evenue bonds for the projects, using what are commo nly known as Garvee Bonds. But wait a minute. We don't use bonds for building road. Well, let's look at hist ory. In 1890, the year we became a state, Idaho bonded for roads. Lawmakers did it again thr ee years later. Seven times since statehood, Idaho has used this tool to build roads. Let me als o remind you that we will soon have new buildings on each of our college and univer sity cam puses, which normally would have taken us over a decade to construct had we not issued bonds. It works. I was just in Lewiston last Thursday to celebrate the opening of the Lewis-Clark State College activities center. That building is a tremendo us asset for the college, the community, and the entire state. We're going to be just as aggressive for our transportation system. The state w ill issue the bonds, and the principle, interest, and other costs will be paid off by using future federal highway dollars. This will have no impact on the state General Fund, nor our bond rating, and wi ll still allow for construction and maintenance projects on the Idah o Tr ansportation Department's priority list.10 HOUSE JOURNAL January 10] Over the course of the next ten years, we're going to build three decades' worth of highways. I'm proposing we invest $1.6 b illion, and we do it now. It's time we stop talking and start building. This matches the vis ion and tenacity of what Lewis and Clark did 200 years ago, and w e're still celebrating their accomplishments today. Where wou ld we be as a country if they had stayed in Missouri? President Thomas Jefferson sent the Corps of Disc overy to find a new route to the Pacific Ocean. He had the vision of what a united country - east and west - meant to our nation. President Dwight Eisenhower, the founder of our nation's Interstate System once said, \"Together, the united forc es of ou r communication and trans portation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we bear - Uni ted States. Without them, we would be a mere alliance of many separate parts.\" That same sentiment holds true for Idaho today. With my vision for \"Connecti ng Idaho,\" all of Idaho's 44 counties will benefit and we will realize that north, south, east, and west are more than just compass points. We will unite Idaho. Are we not one Idaho? We've already taken a major step to tie our communities together with hundreds and hu ndreds of miles of fiber optics and other high-speed telecommunication lines linking souther n Ida ho. We're doing the same thing in the north. Whether you're in New York or New Plymout h, yo u can instantaneously do business with the rest of the world. The investment in high-speed telecommunications is the result of our tax incentives and the improved six percent Investment Tax Credit for Broadband. It's helped expand the economic base of our state. Tonight, I'm proposing another innovative strategy to attra ct new corporations an d bring high paying jobs to the state of Idaho. And, more importantly, this strategy will help us retain our base. Idaho is home t o a n umber of Fortune 500 companies, but in a time of corporate mergers and consolidations, w e can never take that for granted. How do you n urture your existing base and attract new corporations? Here's how: I have spent the past s everal months developing a progressive tax incentive package designed to retain and attract corporate headquarters in Idaho. I'm asking for your support of an incentive package that will grab the attention of For tune 500 companies around the country. To qualify, companies will need to c reate at least 500 new jobs in Idaho, at a minimum starting s alary of at least $50,000 year, plus benefits, invest at least $50 million in a new office building or plant, and they must do this all within a five-year time period.If a company is willing to make these kinds of signifi cant investments, and create these ty pes o f jobs in Idaho, I'm proposing the following tax incentives: Doubling of the investment tax cred it to six percent for a five- year period, removing the 50 percent limit on the Investment Ta x Credit, an enhanced Jobs Tax Credit, a new income tax credit for real property improvement, property tax abatement on quali fied new construction, and sales tax abatement on construction materials. As you can see, this is a very aggressive package and I am confide nt that it will spur a great deal of interest among compani es here in Idaho and throughout the country. This is an investment that will pay for itself with new, high-paying jobs and increased tax revenue to the state. With your support of th is package, I will send Commerce and Labor Dire ctor, Roger Madsen, out to meet with leading companies and encourage them to look at Idaho as a potentia l new home. Who are t he benefi ciaries of these types of efforts? It is Idaho's families and children. It provides both the jobs, but also the revenue to provide the essential services of educat ion, he alth care, and public safety. Long before a child enters school, the learning process begins. We all recognize that if we c an prov ide a solid foundation in early childhood health, educ ation, and development, our children will grow up with more op portunities and chances to succeed. First Lady Patricia Kempthorne and Dr. Jerry Hirsc hfeld and the Governor's Coordinating Coun cil for Families and Children have achieved an impressive record of success in getting communities to work togeth er for the benefit of families and children. My \"Generation of the Child\" initiati ve co ntinues to be successful. We've provided extensive training for more than 3,000 volunteers, communities across the state are wo rking together and sharing ideas on how to promote the well-being of families and children. Our \"Parents as Teachers\" demonstration pro ject i s an acknowledged national leader in measuring the positive difference parents can make as their child's first teacher. Our \"Red Flag\" program is traini ng school personnel how to identify the warning signs of teen suicide. Our efforts are also helping to provide grant opportunities to fund locally-ba sed in itiatives which have benefitted more than 65,000 children, and that's only for 2003.[January 10 HOUSE JOURNAL 11 Not very long ago, less than half of our yo ung stu dents were reading at gra de level. Since its establishment early in my first term, the Idaho Reading Indicator has shown that we're making steady progress in improving reading skills b y the th ird grade - an important barometer when measuring future success. The Idaho Standards Achievement Test, or ISAT, is being implemented as a graduation req uirement beginning with the Class of 2006. Eighty percent of the students of that class who have taken the test have already passed the ISAT. Now, we can focus our attention on those 20 percent of the students who need more help in certain areas. They have multip le opportunities to pass, and based on the initial results, I'm confident we're on the right path to ensuring our high school gr aduates have a good grasp of the fun damenta l skills they'll need to be successful. An important aspect of the test is that it helps meas ure th e effectiveness of our schools. Last session, we made great strides in improving accountability and providing transpar ency in the largest, single item in the state budge t, the public school allocation. Once again, I am recommending an increa se in general funds for public schools. School districts will be pleased to see an increas e in the funding level of support units this year over last ye ar. I am recommending a General Fund appropriation of $999 million for K-12. We're hovering at our first $1 billion budget for public schools in Idaho. Our State Board of Educat ion ha s also launched an initiative to improve the high school curriculum and bolster the opportu nity for accelerated and advanced learning. The Charter School legislation I proposed and you app roved last year has proven to be successful. F our new charter schools were approved and given the freedom to innovate and strive for higher academic achievement. I've suggested to our university presidents that they should consider forming a charter school. Imag ine th e results if one of our colleges of education, in a charter school setting, enc ouraged those who teach the teachers to ha ve new opportunities to be even more imaginative, creative, and innovative. As new charter schools come on-line, we're not forgett ing the facility needs of our sch ools. Just last Thursday, the new Bonners Ferry High School celebrated its grand o pening. I had a great interest in the opening of that new school, and eac h of you here had a great i ntere st in that school. Here's why. The State of Idaho paid $1.3 million in interest on the bonds to construct that new building. It is part of an incentive crafted b y the state to help local communities meet their school building needs. My budget proposal this yea r enh ances that concept, making $5 million a vailable to districts that need help building new or renovating existing school facilities. Since we first institut ed th e program, voters in 31 districts have appro ved bond levies to address their most critical needs and to take advantage of this partnership with the state. I applaud our teachers, schools, and parents who work e very day to help children learn. So much is going right in education and we must celebrate our successes while we keep our focus on improvement. I have always been an advocate for acknowledging and rewarding grea t achiev ements. For too long, there's been a disconnect between the quali ty of t he teacher and the pay they receive. For that reason , I s upport the State Board of Education's examination of merit pay. T he committee is still working on a plan, but already, there are schoo l districts interested in a pilot project where compensa tion is based on performance and how well a teacher teaches in the classroom. We have a record nu mber of students attending Idaho colleges and universities and, as a state, we have com mitted to help Idaho stude nts in their education through our scholarship programs. This year, 7,600 students are taking advantag e of the Robert Lee Promise Scholarship. For our men and women in the Idaho National Guard, I'm recommending an additional $1 00,000 in General Fund support for the Military Division's tuition assistance program. My budget proposal increases General Fund support for higher education by $14 million, wh ich incl udes the full amount requested to address the costs related to the record number of students enrolled. At Idaho State University, th e beautiful new Stephens Performing Ar ts Center will open this spring. This state-of-the-art facility is the result of g enerous gifts and private donati ons. My budget contains the funds necessary to operate this world-class educational and pe rformance center that will also host some of the top touring orchestras and performers. Another important part of our culture is ou r history. In October, the new P hase Two of the Idaho History Center will open. This building will house the historical library, and will provide public areas for research and educ ational programs and help us preserve Idaho's legacy for generations to come. I'm also pr oposi ng funding for design and engineering work for a new wing on the Idaho History Museum in Boise. Every year, thousands of students, scholars and sightseers visit the public displays of our heritage. It's time we expand the museum to allow more of Idaho's rich past to be displayed and interpreted. When the design is completed, we'll partner with the private sector to build the new wing. Idahoa ns have a long tradition of stepping forward and supporting public projects like the Stephens Center and Historical Museum. I want to acknowled ge th e generous gift to the state by Jack and Esther Simplot , who l ast month donated the home they loved for more than 20 years and the 36 acres that surround it, for use as a Governor's residence. Isn't that a most outstanding gift by an Idaho legend?12 HOUSE JOURNAL January 10] J.R. Simplot is known all over the world. His company was one of the first to understand the benefit s of expanding into new overseas markets. On one of my trade mi ssions, I had the honor of dedicating a Simplot potato processing facility in China. While on trade missions I market Idaho as a world- class tourist destination to our friends ab road. Last month, the first all-season resort to op en in Nort h America in a quarter of a century opened on the shores of Lake Cascade near Donnelly. Tamarack Resort will add prestige and an economic shot in the arm for Valley County and the rest of Idaho and was just featured in a full-page story in the New York Times. The resort has already paid five years' worth of rent for the use of state endowment land s, a to tal of $ 1 million, a significant increase over the $40, 000 per year the Endowment Fund used to receive from the property. Recreation plays such an important part of the overall quality of life for Idahoans and hel ps attra ct new businesses as well as tourist dollars. When other states were cl osing parks, we were opening parks. We now have 31 state parks. I'm proposing a significan t reinvestment in one of Idaho's most popular destinations, Ponderosa State Park. Future visitors to Pondero sa can expect more campsites, new RV hookups, improved access to Payette Lake beaches and bike path s. We will make Ponderosa Park a year-round destination. A former private facility that is now part of the park will be renovated and opened to the public. We'v e ident ified the funds to begin this renovation. The cent erpiece of the park's renaissance is a new multi-use building that will house park offices, m eeting rooms, public common areas, and 30 guest rooms . This rustic lodge, which will be built among soaring Ponderosa pines, will provide Idahoans with a new and special place to enjoy and experience the beauty of Ponderosa Park. I've spoken to the Mayor o f McCall, Valley County Commissioners, resi dents and park users, and the y enthusiastically support this vision for Ponderosa. What I've talked about tonight are some unique opportunities for Idaho. There are some challenges, however, that every state in the nation is struggling to deal with. Across the country, Medicaid, the he alth i nsurance program for our low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled, has experienced conti nual, exponential growth over the past decade. Just ten years ago, Medi caid represented seven percent of our total s tate budget. Today, it represents 15 percent. Nationally, the same trend holds true, with Medicaid approaching 23 percent of state budgets - in some states even exceed ing spending on public schools. But not in Idaho, where we maintain a funding ratio of 3 -to-1 of public schools over Medicaid. We are all aware of the problems many states ha ve experienced by cutting eligi bility for their Medicaid recipients. It's resulted in mor e emergency room visits, more expensive treatment, and more lawsuits. Compare that to what we've done in Idaho. When ou r budge t problems forced holdbacks, we looked for w ays to reduce spending with a minimal impact on our citizens. We f ocused on improvi ng the management of Medicaid. What have been the results ? More than $150 million in savings over the past two and a half years and better care for patients. The Medicaid budget that I have submitted to you tonight anticipates that we will find additional ways to contain rising costs. Next week, I wil l join fellow Governors in Washington, D.C., as we begin wo rking with the administration and Congress on Medicaid reform. I am optimistic, but I am also a realist . A bsent federal reforms in the Medicaid system, or drastic and even devastating reductio ns in vital services, we will have to revisit this year's Medicaid budget next se ssion. There is money in reserve accounts if we need to cover those costs. I recently complet ed my term as Chairman of the National Governors Association. During the year, I focused on the growing issue of long-term care and its impacts on state budgets and the health and self-esteem of our seniors and their families. This year, my budget provid es increased funding for home and community based services, like home delivered meals and personal care serv ices fo r elderly citizens who, with just a little extra help around the house, are able to stay in their hom es longer. This saves money, improves care, and preserves dignity. We must enc ourage future generations of Idahoans to plan for their own financial and health care needs. Tonight, I'm anno uncin g a new partnership between the State of Idaho and the Federal Department of Health and Human Services that will encourage individuals to do just that. Over the course of the next week, more th an 12 5,000 letters will be mailed to Idahoans between the ages of 50 and 70, providing information on where to get help in planning for their long-term care needs. Idaho is one of five states chosen to launch this new initiative. We also will encourage all Idaho public employees to purchase long-term care insurance under a new group pla n available through the state. By making this option available through a payroll deduction, we will make it easier to purchase long-term care insurance. [January 10 HOUSE JOURNAL 13 These options, combined with the 100 percent tax deduction for long-term care insurance that we approved last ye ar, have made Idaho one of the most progressive states in helping our citizens prepare for their long-term health care needs, you are to be congratulated for your wisdom. In our adult correction system, we have an inmate po pulatio n pushing 100 percent of capacity. Numbers like this cause me great concern, especially fo r th e safety of our corrections officers. To address that, we will purchase a new structure to house medium-secu rity inmates within the perimeter of the Idaho State Correctional Institution. This building will help a lleviat e some of the crowding without th e full -scale investment in a permanent facility. It's time we take a good, hard look at the number of inmates as well as those on probation or parole. Today I signed an Executive Order establishing the Criminal Justice Commission to help solve critical problems in the crim inal justice system. In particular, I have a sked the Commission to focus its attention in several key areas, including: Reducing our incarcerated offender population, continuing our fight against the plague of methamphetamine abuse, manufacture and trafficking, and cre ating partnerships and collaborative efforts to protect our communities agai nst gang activity. There has been a lot of att ention recently to the growing gang problem in Idaho. Tragically, lives h ave b een lost and the very safety of communities has been threatened. The combined efforts of local and sta te law enforcement have been effective throughout the state. We will continue to commit the resources of the Idaho State Police in partnership with local government. Idaho will not be a haven for gang activity. Another area where the ISP and local law e nforcement agencies have a proud tradition of coopera tion and teamwork is in the battle against methamphetamine. Sin ce 1999, we have busted 741 clandestine labs around the state. We've be en aggressive in going after the manufacturers of meth, but now these drugs are being imported in and thr ough our state. Working with federal authorities, we continue to battl e against foreign gangs intent on using Idaho as a pipeline for their poison. I've been very direct and to the point. We have zero tolerance for this type of activity. Another step we're taking is an innovative approach to protecting children endangered by the toxic filth of meth labs. We're working on strategies to get these children out of danger, medically assessed, and into a safe environment. When a home, apartment, or motel room is use d to cook meth, we will establish cleanup guidelines to ensure the safety and health of unsuspecting residents after the lab is shut down.While we continu e to aggressively eliminate the availability of drugs in our communities, we recognize the need for substance abuse treatment for those who are addicted to these powerful chemicals. Idaho has received a $22.8 million feder al grant that will allow us to create a system to help more addicts gain \"Access to Recovery.\" Doesn't it make sense to get meth off the streets, addicts into care, and families reunited? Let me now address one of the key issues this Legislature will face: Water. One of the major issues for years has been the Snake River Basin Adjudicati on, which determines water rights throughout much of Idaho. To give you a se nse of th e magnitude of this, when completed, thi s will be the largest adjudication ever in the United States. When I first took office, I made it clear t hat I would not support any negotiations in the SRBA involving the Nez Perce Tribe and the water users that did not protect our state sovereignty and existing water rights. The historic agreement we announced l ast May in Idaho with Interior Secretary Gale Norton affirms those prin ciples. Over the past five years, and at times when it looked like negotiations were at an impasse, I urged all si des to retu rn to the table - often in my office. I told the water users when they reached an agreement, I would take it to the White House and Capitol Hill. They did their part, and I did mine. Thanks to the work of our ou tstanding Congressional delegation, Congress and the President have now approved our landmark agreement. Mil lions in federal dollars have been set aside for Idaho, and are waiting for this Legislature to now act. I'm proud of what we've acc ompl ished. I'm proud to have stood with the water users, the Speaker and the Pro Tem, as well as many of you here tonight to announce th e agreement. Here's what we h ave achieved; sovereignty, certainty, and the opportunity for Idaho to chart its own water destiny. This is a solution reached by water users, th ese are their water rights. Listen to them and ratify this agreem ent. Isn't it better for us to decide issues about our water than to have a court do it? Throughout the summ er a nd fall, a Legislative Interim Committee met on another pressing water issue - the Ea stern Snake Plain A quifer - a problem that has been decades in the making. The Speaker and the Interim Committee should be commended for their efforts to develop a consensu s soluti on and mechanism for the users to pay for it. I've directed Departmen t of Water Resources Director, Karl Dreher to send out requests for proposals to find willing sellers for the 60,000 acre feet necessary to m eet the requirements of the SRBA. This water will remain i n stat e14 HOUSE JOURNAL January 10] ownership. I will also sign the application for Idaho to enroll over 100,000 acres of land into the Conservati on Res erve Enhancement Program to reduce water demand. This is a complex problem that has confronted Idaho water users sinc e the 195 0's. By continuing our collective efforts and working together, we will find a solution. The State of Idaho is on the leading edge in addre ssing endangered species issues in a positive way. Last week, at our request, the Secretary of Interior signed an histo ric rule that will change the way Idaho' s wolves are managed. The ne w rul e affords Idaho an opportunity unparall eled i n the 30-year history of the Endangered Species Act. Idaho will be the first state to manage wolves under its own plan. We also get increased flexibility for private landowners and permittees to deal with aggressive wolves hara ssing or attacking livestock and pets. The establish ment of the Office of Species Conservation five years ago was key for this unprecedented change in management. The new rule is the culmination of a partnership with the federal government that shows greater respect for property ri ghts and reflects our responsibility to maintain healthy big game herds. Once again, here in thi s very bu ilding, we crafted an Idaho solution that puts us in the driver's seat toward the ultimate goal of de-listing the wolf! One hundred years ago, in 1905, construction began on t he Idaho State Capitol Building. On any day durin g the legislative session, this bui lding is filled with people. Lawmakers, citizens, the news media, lobbyists, students, and the people who work in the offic es are all in this building. Thousands of children vis it this building every yea r. Yet t he only part of the Statehouse that has fire sprinklers is the area that caught fire several years ago. If you h ave a heart attack or any sort of a medical emergency, the paramedics' gurney will not fit into either of the small, outdated elevators. There are no emergency exits. We spend a lot of money promoting high technology and equipping state go vernm ent with the latest tools to improve efficiency and constituent service. Yet those modern computers are plugged into 191 7 electrical wiring. I really hesitate to go on with the safety problems that exist because of the liability i t raises. In good conscience, we can't put this off any longer. Not only are we the stewards of thi s treas ure called the State Capitol, but we are also the gua rdians of the safety of the people who come here. I am prop osing to night that we will do the necessary restoration and safety upgrade s of this building, and finally address the issue of the Capitol Annex across the street. Our work here is an open democracy. Idahoans can visit their capital city to watch their elected representatives in action. But too often, they have to stand in the halls, because there's no space in a committee hearing room. Y et, when they leave this building,they pass by a large, boarded up structure and they wonder why lawmakers can't meet there? Utilizing that building will allow more citizens to participate in their government. I'm propos ing we combine these two projects, and by continuing the current rate on the cigarett e tax and redirecting those resources to the Permanent Building Fund, we'll be able t o pay for them. We'll also increa se th e funding available each year from $14 million to $20 million to address the backlog of maintenance needs at the State Hospitals, on our college and university campuses, and public safety buildings. My FY 2006 budget recommendation is for $2.2 billion, a six percent increase in regular appropriations over last year. Just like last year, I'm combining my State of the State speech and Budge t Address to give you an early start on the session. There's no need to wait until Wednesday for budget details. They're all right here. It represents a conservative spending plan that addresses our critical concerns and meets our ongoing needs. My budget also recognizes the contributions of our dedicated and tremendous state employees in making I daho a great place to live, work, and raise a family. I am pr oposing t hat we fund a one percent salary incre ase for state employees and teachers. In addition, I'm recommending funding for the increase d employer costs of our state health insurance plan that was recently redesigned to address the effects of health care inflation. Over the past few months, we have seen the economy perform better than ex pected, and our revenue collections have exceeded our pred ictions. My budget projects a $117 million surplus in the current fiscal year. This might lead some to the false conclusion that there is n o longer a need for budgetary restraint. I would caution against that. Even with a conservative spending plan, and the benefit of year-end surpluses, we may very well find ourselves with a shortfall in FY 2007. We can agree that there's a structu ral problem in our budgeting process that relies too much on one-time money. How much of that one-time money will we need in Fiscal 2007? That depends on how much we stimulate the state's economy. If not, we use the reserves. I f the structural problems continue, then be fully prepared to have me come back next year with suggestions on reforms and a simplification of our tax structure. For some of you Legislators, this is your first experie nce with being elect ed to pub lic office. I can tell you it is a rewarding and noble service to be elected by the people to make important decisions on their behalf. For thos e wh o have spent time in this Legislature, think of all that we have accomplished together. It has been truly outstanding. I am grateful for the partnership I have ha d with t he Legislature - for your friendship, support, counsel, and ideas. [January 10 HOUSE JOURNAL 15 Tonight, I have presented to you a conservative budget and bold initiatives that I believe position t his legi slative session as one that will be s een as a de fining moment in Idaho's history by future generations. I will work with you to ensure t hat t his happens. Right now, 2,000 Idahoans are halfway around the world trying to make democracy work. The men and wo men of the 116th Brigade Combat Team are in northern Iraq, working to stabilize that nation as it heads towards elections later this month. It's to ugh, dangerous, and exhausting duty, but the 116th is one of the finest-trained and finest-equippe d forces our country has, and I'm confident that they'll do the job with dist inction. They make every Idahoan proud. I had the honor of spending Thanksgiving with the troops in Alexandria, Louisian a, bef ore they departed for the Middle East and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The night before Thanksgiving, the troops were treated to a USO type concert from Paul Revere and the Raiders and an outstanding Idaho vo calist, Nancy Roche. These talented m usicians and their bands volunteered to give up their h oliday with their families to be with our troops. It was a memorable scene, to see the faces of the soldiers turn from stoic to smiles as they laughed and sang along. We served Thanksgiving dinner to the troops, and soon thereafter during the next three days, the soldiers began to board the planes that would t ake t hem to the Middle East. I looked each of them in the eye, shook their hands, and wished them Godspeed. In fact, for the pre-dawn flights, I had vehicles reposition on the tarmac with their headlamps on high beam so that I could look into the soldiers' eyes and mentally record each face. One of the most indelible images I have of their depa rture i s of battle-ready soldiers, carrying their weapons and dressed in desert camo fatigues, body armor, and h elmets with their blood type stenciled on the side. Many of these soldiers had little stuffed animals , given by loved ones, poking their heads out of their backpacks. The se sol diers are the most caring and genuine of human beings. My message to each of them was that they had a job to do, and they are equal to that task. I also told them that the citizens back home would be looking out fo r their families while they carried out their business. As those airplanes took off, each carrying its pr eciou s cargo, I couldn't help but think of how wonderful a reunion we'll all have a year from now when these fellow Idahoans come home to their families. This evening, in nearly every county in our state, th ere is a child going to bed with out Mom o r Dad to tuck them in becausethat parent is o n active duty. A son or daughter, as we speak tonight, may be getting read y for early-morning patrol in a potentially hostile territory. What is our responsibility? It's to ens ure t hat that soldier can remain focused on his or her mission, and not be worrying abo ut family needs back home. The ir families' needs must become our needs. If we take care of the family, then the soldie r can take care of their mission, until the reunio n occurs. That is our responsibility. This holds true for the 89 outstanding Marines of Charlie Company whi ch I wished Godspeed to this past weekend as they begin their journey to Iraq. I also ackno wled ge the members of the Idaho Air National Guard's 189th Airlift Squadron, the 124th Aerial Port Flight, and the 124th Air Support Operations Squadron, who are also deployed in Iraq. Let's do our part for the families of these bra ve so ldiers, and let's pray for their safe return. Tonight, join me in saluting the soldiers of the 116th Combat Brigade, the Idaho Air Guard, Charlie Company, and all Idahoans in uniform. God bless them for their service. Let me also salute General Jack Kane for his 42 years of service to our country and our mil itary. His service as Adjutant General of the Idaho National Guard has been exemplary. It's been an honor and privilege to w ork with him. On January 15, we will have a change of command as General Kane retires, and General Larry Lafrenz takes over the command of the I daho National Guard. Well done, General. Let's als o acknowledge those Idahoans who wear the uniforms of our police, firefighters, and param edics. Tonight I ask all Idahoans, to say a prayer for Coeur d'Alene poli ce offic er Michael Kralicek who was shot in the line of duty and lies critically wounded. We have a tremendous opportunity this legislative session to do some great things for Idaho. The Ida ho National Guard, in the single largest deployment of our troops in state history, is giving Iraqis the opportunity for peace and democracy. Lewis and Clark took advantage of the opportunity to link our nation, east to west, and forever changed the course of history for the United States of America. When you look at your budget books, you' ll see that on the cover we depict these oppor tunities, Lewis and Clark in 1805, the construction of the State Capitol in 1905, and our tr oops overseas in 2005.16 HOUSE JOURNAL January 11] You have it within your g rasp to b e regarded as one of the greatest legislative bodies in the history of the state. If you'r e bold, and if you're ready to aggressively reach for our future, all the ingredients are here. The opportunities are waiting for us. God Bless Idaho and God Bless America.

Motions, Memorials, and Resolutions HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 1 BY RESOURCES AND CONSERVATION COMMITTEE A JOINT MEMORIAL TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEM BLED, AND TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGA TIONS REPRESENTING THE STATES OF IDAHO, UTAH AND WYOMING IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. We, your Memorialists, the House of Representat ives an d the Senate of the State of Id aho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislatur e, do hereby respectfully represent that:WHEREAS, the ongoing drought in the state of Idaho has had a profound impact thr oughout the state, including the area of southeastern Idaho known as th e B ear River Basin. Although inadequate, during times of high water such as spring runo ff, Bear Lake is the major reserv oir for containing flood waters of the Bear River within the Bear River Basin. The effects of drought in the Bear River Basin would be significantly reduced in the event alternative storage sites were available; and WHEREAS, the Bear River Basin encompasses 7,400 square miles with 2,700 square miles in the state of Idaho. Originating in Utah' s Uintah Mountains, the Bear River crosses state boundaries five times, has tributari es in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, and ultimately discharges into the Great Salt Lake; and WHEREAS, the Bear River did not naturally divert in to Bear Lake. The Utah Sugar Company and the Telluri de Power Company first pr oposed diversion of the Bear River into Bear Lake for water storage in 1898. That project was taken over by Utah Power and Light Company for the pur pose o f producing hydrop ower. The project, which included a diversion dam on the Bear River, a canal, and a pumping station was co mpleted in 1918; and WHEREAS, a multistate compact between the states of Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, known as the Bea r River Compact, was entered into in 1958 and amended in 1980. The Compact governs the operation of the Bear River and, for management purposes, the Compact divides the r iver in to three segments. The three segments are known a s the Upper Division, located in Utah and Wyoming, the Central Division, located in Wyom ing and Idaho, and the Lower Divisi on, located in Idaho and Utah. The Bear River Commission, made up of thr ee members from each of the Compact states, a chairman appointed by the Pre sident of the United States, and an e ngineer/manager, manages the day-to-day operation of the river; and WHEREAS, as a result of two lawsu its against Utah Power and Light Company during the 1970's, which claimed damage to crops due to flooding along the Bear River, the power company is under court order to keep t he Bear River within its banks. Based on the court order, in the event the irrigati on season ends with Bear Lake above 5,918 feet in elevation, water is released downstream to make room in Bear Lake for the sprin g runo ff; and WHEREAS, sinc e the 1970's, millions of acre feet of water have been released to provide capa city for flood control. Releases carry the river as well as the surface water removed from Bear Lake downstream to the Great Salt Lake where the principal bene ficiary is the Great Salt Lake ecosystem. The most rec ent releases were in 1997, 1998 and 1999; and WHEREAS, lowering the elevation of Bear Lake in the Lower Division for flood co ntrol also impacts water users in the Upper and Central Divisions. Un der the Compact, Woodruff Narrows Reservoir lo cated in the Upper Division is not allowed to fill whenever the elevation of Bear Lake is below 5,911 feet above sea level, a ffecting both ground and surface water in that area. In addition, when Woodruff Narrows Reserv oir is not full, no water is available for irrigation in a ten mile str etch o f river in the Central Division leaving irrigators in that area without water for their crops; and WHEREAS, dredging ha s bee n necessary to provide water for irrigation due to low lake levels; and[February 1 HOUSE JOURNAL 53 WHEREAS, studi es to date have shown that use of Bear Lake for flood control has resulted in tons of suspended sediment solids to be deposited in the lake during the spring ru noff. This is highly detrimental to the ecosystem. Increases i n algae blooms on Bear Lake due to nitrates being ca rried in have been documented; and WHEREAS, in the event the water had not been released in the interest of flood control, it is likely that Bear Lake would now be full or nearly full. In that event, i t is probable that there would be no need to pump water out of Bear Lake for irrigation because there would be enough capacity to allow the water to flow out by gravity, there would be no need to dredge i n Bear Lak e in that the elevation of the lake would be high e nough to make dredging unnecessary, and an el evation above 5,911 feet would allow upstream storage at the Woodruff Narrows Reservoir; and WHEREAS, extremely low levels in Bear Lake could cause a water emergency to be declared by the state of Utah. The declaration would lead to closer scrutiny of the natural flow rights administer ed u nder the interstate accounting system. The lack of adequate storage water to supplement n atura l flow could result in the curtailment of rights in Idaho; and WHER EAS , if alternate storage sites were available, several hundr ed thousand acre feet of water would still be in Bear Lake to miti gate the e ffects of the drought. Pursuant to the Bear River Compact, Idaho is entitled to store approximately 125, 000 acre feet of water annually and Utah about 390, 000 acre feet annually. Provide d adequate storage, this water, which is usually available during the spring runoff, could be stored to prevent any flooding of the Bear River. The water could then be used fo r irrigation, domestic and commercial development and recreation. A reservoir above Bear Lake would allow chemicals to be neutralized and suspended solids t o sett le out that are now entering Bear Lake. Alternative storag e sites would provide for the cons ervation, preservation and best utilization of the water to which the state is enti tled. This storage is desperately needed to allow residential, commercial and municipal development in the Bear River dra inage without reducing irrigated agricultural lands; and WHEREAS, flood control above Bear Lake wo uld make possible a po licy t hat Bear Lake would be the first to fill and the last to empty. This would provide more water for irrigation, minimize fluctuations of lake levels, improve spawning habit at for Bear Lake cutthroat trout, provide boat-launching c apabil ity at Idaho state parks, and allow the f illing of Woodruff Narrows Reservoir. Flood control above Bear Lake would greatly benefit the economy of all three states in the Bear River drainage; and WHEREAS, the Unite d States Army Corps of Engineers is the federal agency responsible for flood control. The Corps has indicated a willingness to conduct a feasibility s tudy of possible water storage sites upstre am from Bear Lake which could be used for flood control of the Bear River. Costs of th e study could range from $600,000 to $2,000,000 depending on the area s the study would include. The study will require an e qual ma tch of federal and nonfede ral funds. However, with congressional approval, past local expenditures may be used as the local match; and WHEREAS, past local expenditures that have been made include $174,000 by the state of Wyoming for t he Cokeville Reservoir project on Smith ' s Fork, $350,000 by the state ofWyoming for the Bear Ri ver P lan and over $2,000,000 of state funds from Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah through the Bear River Commission for stream gaging; and WHEREAS, concerned citizens of th e Bea r River drainage, includ ing the Bear Lake County Commission, the Bear Lake Regional Commission, Bear Lake W atch, Inc., and Love Bear Lake, Inc., are asking f or C ongressional approval to recognize past expenditures as the local match to make the Corps of Engineers feasibility study possible. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the memb ers of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we respectfully urge the Congress of the United States and our Idaho delegation, as well as the Utah and Wyoming delegations in Con gress, to support, work to pass and vote for legislation that will authorize and fund a feasibility stud y by the United States Corps of Engineers relating to the possibilities, benefits and costs of providing flood control above Bear Lake. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVE D that we urge Congress to allow and approve past local expendi tures, equivalent to fifty percent of the total cost of the study, as the required local match and that local expenditures to be allowed and approved include $174,000 by the state of Wyoming for the Cokeville Reser voir project on Smith' s Fork, $350,000 by the state of Wyoming for the Bear River Plan and $2, 000,000 of state funds from Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah for stream gaging. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegations representing the states of Idaho, Utah and Wyoming in the Co ngress of the United States. HOUSE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 2 BY STATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE A JOINT MEMORIAL TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBL ED, AND TO THE C ONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIO N REPRESENTING THE STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. We, your M emorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assemb led i n the First Regular Sessio n of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, on October 15, 1990, Congress passe d the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides for compassionate paym ents to persons or to their beneficiaries who developed diseases as a result of exposure to rad iation from U.S. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing; and WHEREAS, currently, a study is underway by the National Acade my of Sciences and a report will be filed with Congress to address the adequacy of the initial geographic coverage provided in RECA; and WHEREAS, compelling anecdotal evidence has been accumulated at public meetings and in written reports, to indicate54 HOUSE JOURNAL February 1] the impact of atmospheric testing on the downwinder populations in Idaho; and WHEREAS, preliminary e vidence suggests that scientific documentation being gathered and assessed for inclusion in the report will find that risk factors present in Idaho equal or exceed the factors present in area s previously included in RECA coverage; and WHEREAS, members of Idaho' s congressional delegation have worked and will continue to press for responsible legisla tive action to address the claims of Idahoans based upon r adiatio n exposure; and WHEREAS, it i s ap propriate that members of the Idaho Legislature, speaking o n behalf of the citizens of the state, express support for the efforts of Idaho' s congressional delegation in their representation of downwinders in Idaho. NOW, THERE FORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Sessio n of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we anticipate the findings of the National Academy of Sciences will verify the impact of testing on residents of Id aho, and we conclude that it is appropriate to compensate thes e downwinder s in the same manner and to the same extent as those individuals previ ously compensated for similar exposures. We urge the members of Idaho' s congressional delegation to continue in their endeavors on behalf of Idaho's citizens. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that th e Chief Clerk of the House of Representative s be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the Presiden t of the Senate and the Spea ker o f the House of Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the S tate of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.

We, your Mem orialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in t he First Regular Session of the Fi fty-e ighth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, the state of Idaho is very diversifie d in its agricultural production; and WHEREAS, in January 2002, the federal gover nmen t announced that it was initi ating ne gotiations on a free trade agreement involving the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. These negotiations concluded in December 2003. Negotiations with Costa Rica and the Domini can Republic were subsequently compl eted and are now included in the agreement. Congress must now decide whether to ratify the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); and WHEREAS , the federal government is also negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) agreement; and WHEREAS, both CAFTA and the FTAA would allow these foreign countries to export com modities to the United States, harming Idaho agricultural industry in the process; and WHEREAS, the agricultural producers of the United States cannot be expected to compet e with these foreign countries under free trade agreem ents due to the labor practices, lack of environmental regul ations and subsidized agricultural production of these foreign countries; and158 HOUSE JOURNAL March 1] WHEREAS, sugar is an import-sensitive commodity w hich will be negatively impacted by CAFTA. Idaho is our nation' s second-largest producer of sugarbeets and a rece nt University of Idaho study concludes tha t the d emise of the sugar industry in the state would also have a serious im pact o n market prices relating to other Idaho crops such as potatoes and onions which would be grown in place of sugarbeets; and WHEREAS, the CAFTA nations already enjoy preferential, duty-free access into the United States market for 311, 700 metric tons of suga r. The United States is presently the world' s fourth- largest net importer of sugar under existing trade agreements and its sugar market is already oversupplied, resulting in our region' s sugarbeet processing company recently announcing the temporary closure of one of its factories due to the existing low sugar marketing allocations for United States producers; and WHEREAS, the United States International Trade Commission in August 2004, concluded that the Central American Free Trade Agreement w ould actually increase the U. S. trade deficit with the region by $100 million a year to $2.4 billion a year; and WHEREAS, concerns over f ree trade agreements face the agricultural industry at a time when the domestic cons umption of United States agricultural products is declining, forcing domestic producers out of business; and WHE REAS, the state of Idaho stands to lose thousands of jobs and millions of dollars if t hese free trade agreements are implemented, potentially devastating the state's agricultural industry, moving pr oduc tion into other supply-sensitive crops, and severely harming the state' s economy as a whole; and WHEREAS, the economic impact of any trade agre ement must be recognized and considered to maintain vi able economic health of agricultural industries, as well as all industries, with an emphasis on fair trade, rather than free trade; and WHEREAS, the provisions of CAFTA and the FTAA should be renegotiated to limit expo rts from foreign countries to a needs- based access, allowing the United States agricultural policy to properly function and fairly treat agricultural producers in the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOL VED by the members of the First Regular Session of the F ifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that in negotiating any nat ional trade agreements, the federal government is urged to recognize the econom ic impac t of such trade agreements on the states and consider those impacts in order to maintain the viable economic health of agricultural industries, as well as all in dustries, with an emphasis on fair trade, rather than free trade. BE IT F URTHER RESOLVED that the federal government is urged to renegotiate the pro visions of CAFTA and the FTAA to limit exports from the involved foreign countries to fairly protect agricultural producers in the United States. BE IT FURTHER RESO LVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives be, and she is hereby a uthorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Repre senta tives of Congress, and the congressional delegation repres enting the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.HJM 4 was introduced, read the fi rst time by title, and referred to the Judiciary, Rules, and Administration Committee for printing.

Nationally, bioscience is a $50 bill ion industry with nearly 150,000 em ployee s and 1,500 companies and it is an industry that is attracting significa nt vent ure capital. States across the country are trying to capture a piece of the bioscience industry and its high paying jobs; and WHEREAS, the field of bioscience is expected to have an average annual employment growth between now and 2012 t hat is 13 percent greater than the average annual growth rate for all employment and, in 2003, jobs in bioscience had salarie s tha t were at least $26,600 higher than the national average; and WHEREAS, bioscience research and product development is already underway in Idaho at state research universities, the private industry sector and the Idaho National Laboratory and the collective efforts of the indus try have laid a solid foundation for strengthening Idaho' s knowledge-based economy. Idaho' s science and technology s ector is growing faster than the national average, ranking first in the nation in patents per capita and I daho' s funding for university-based research and deve lopme nt continues to grow; and WHEREAS, BioIdaho, the Idaho Bi oscience Association, is a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 that brings tog ether corporate, academic and political leaders to educate the public and to promote bioscience activities in the state.

KEMPTHORNE Governor OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR Boise March 30, 2005 Dear Mr. Speaker: I hereby advise you that I have transmitted to the Office of the Secretary of State, with my approval, the following House Bill, to wit: H 231 within the time limited by law, the same having arri ved i n the Office of the Governor at the hour of 2:45 p.m. o n March 24, 2005. I. INTRODUCTION Today I signed H 231 -allowing tuition at institut ions of higher education-into law. Beginning July 1, 2005, this law wil l authorize the State Board of Educa tion to set fees, including tuition fees, at Boise State Univer sity, Idaho State University, and Lewis Clark State College to cove r any and all educational costs, including instruction. H 231 does not apply to the University of Idaho because of the constitutional charter of the u niversity, which prohibits tuition, or a charge for instruction for full-time resident students I realize that the enactment and implementation of a ny new legislation may cause anxiety or concern, which is why I felt that it was important to explain the need for this legislation. II. DISCUSSION I would l ike to explain my rationale for signing H 231 , which is outlined below.368 HOUSE JOURNAL March 31] 1. Higher education is on e of the few, if not the only service, in which the fees that are paid cannot be used to provi de the primary service that is demanded. Th e curren t structure restricts how fees collected from students can be spent and prohibits the use of fees for instructi on. H 231 allows the State Board of Education, universiti es and colleges the flexibility to use student fees to support the educational and instructional process. 2. Some opponents have suggested that this legislation will allow unregulated inc reases in student fees. Under H 231 , the amount charged t o stude nts whether called matriculation fees or tuition will conti nue to be reviewed and approved by the State Board of Education through an open process that includes input from students, re commendations from the presidents of these institutions, State Board staff, and the public. 3. I believe that this legislation will help Idaho's universities and colleges meet the needs of our students. Under H 231, Boise State University, Idaho State University, and Lewis Cla rk Stat e College will be able to use t he fees collected from students to help fund instructional costs, including addition al classes and programs desir able to students and local businesses. Too often when courses are filled t o capac ity due to high demand or new programs are desir ed, the current fee structure does not support the immediate addition of additional courses. 4. The proponents of H 231 are wide and vari ed. An overview of the distribution of supporters can be demons trated through the following examples: \"I want to explain my pos ition on this legislation and assure you that this, in and of itself, will not affect the am ount o f fees that stude nts will pay . What it will do is help us respond to our students and provide the classes required for t heir m ajors and graduation. This change will allow us to open up new sections as new students sign up for classes and use their fees to pay for the cost of instru ction, something that we cannot do now and something that no w contributes to the extended graduation rates...\" Robert Kustra, President Boise State University \"Even thoug h [the legislation] does not apply to the University of Idah o, I am supportive of the legislation, House Bill 231 is a significant tool that can be used by our sister ins titutions to help ensure that funds paid by students are used in the most efficie nt and cost-effective manner and in ways that will ensure that students receive the greatest benefit from the funds they pay.\" Timothy White, President University of Idaho III. CONCLUSION As you know, Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides flexibility for some of our public institutions of higher educationto meet the expanding needs of students. This flexibility is important for maintaining the qual ity of education that Idaho offers at our state universities and colleges. Very truly yours, /s/ DIRK A.

KEMPTHORNE Governor OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR Boise April 15, 2005 The Honorable Bruce Newcomb Speaker of the House Dear Mr. Speaker: I have the honor to advise you that I am returning herewith, without my approval, disapproved and vetoed: H 254 , as amended in the Senate within the time limited b y law , the same having arrived in the Office of the Governor at the hour 9:55 a.m. on April 7, 2005. At the outset, I feel it is my obligat ion to discl ose that I own one building lot in a subdivision intended for a future retiremen t site that could be impacted b y this legislation, however, that does not affect my decision.[April 6 HOUSE JOURNAL 411 It is my j udgment that, while H 254 , as amended, is an improvement over H 488 from t he 200 2 Session of the Idaho Legislature, I cannot, in good conscience, allow this bill to become law. While reviewing H 254 , as amended, it has become cle ar that this amended b ill creates an unfair and unrealistic time frame for compliance by owners of ru ral property. Under this legislation, those eligible landowners who want to receive the bene fit of t he partial property tax ex emption must file an application with their county assessor by April 15, 2005, today. Implementing a law that has financial implications on citizens, and expecting those citizens to respond within hours, is not good public policy. With passage of this bill coming on the last day of the legislation session, property owners were not given sufficient time to file the appropriate paperwork with the county assessor. The April 15 deadline is insufficient, and undoubtedly some individuals will unfairly mis s the deadline and not be eligible for the exemption. I have had the opportunity to review this legislation, and know that I would have had to file an appl ication by the April 15 deadline, which I could hav e done. But what of the hundreds, if not thousands, of landowners who have not had the same opportunity? Since H 254 , as amended, contains no grandfat her clause, many of the current recipients of this exemption will be forever precluded, simply becaus e they we re not made aware of this new and practically impossible requirement. The State Tax Commission brought this issue of fairness to the attention of members of the legislature before H 254 , as ame nded, was voted upon. After reviewing several of the proposed amendments to this legislation, I found that most of t hem i ncluded a May 15, 2005, deadline. I have concluded that the legislature inadvertently failed to add ress the issue of a realistic time frame for property owners to file an application for partial exemption. This issue lends itself t o further refinement during the next legislation session. Therefore, I hereby withhold my approval from, disapprove, and veto H 254 , as amended. Very truly yours, /s/ DIRK A.
