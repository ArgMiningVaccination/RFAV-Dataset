As a highly sensitive child she could feel and sense striking information about people around her. Julia knew it was her destiny to care for others and has assisted with healing energy most of her life. Her creative design talents flourished while attending Sheridan College. In 1982 Julia Grace McCammon earned her 3-year Applied Arts diploma in Crafts and Design - Ceramics Studio. Julia's next level of awareness arrived with her young children and incidents of quick healing. When either child was injured, she would instinctively hold her hands over the painful area and it would clear. In seconds her daughter or son would go from screaming in pain, to silent and fine, as if nothing had happened. Julia's natural healing ability was an automatic response. Her love of creating with her hands in many mediums now shifted to easily reading body energy fields and creating better outcomes for all who received this universal energy. Julia's thirst for knowledge and desire to expand her talents for best results, led to learning with some of America's top transformational leaders and Energy Healers. Julia achieved Yuen Method Certified Master, Matrix Energetics Certified Practitioner, Certified Medical Intuitive, Certified Quantum Practitioner, Reiki Master and trained in Channelling higher wisdom, BodyTalk, Energetic Transformation, Garcia Innergetics, German New Medicine, Mediumship, Munay-Ki, Oneness blessing giver and Past life regressions. She also studied Anatomy and Physiology to gain more knowledge and understanding of the physical body and how it functions. Her interests include Complimentary health, Energy medicine, Functional medicine, Holistic health, Holistic medicine, Integrative medicine, Intuition, life coaching, personal development and other alternative medicine and complementary medicine modalities. It is important to note that mind/body conditioning has its limitations, any methods used are merely tools to analyse people's needs. The true essence of this powerful transformational universal energy flows freely. No tools are needed and none are used during Biofield Energy Transmissions. Biofield Energy Healing works with every human body's natural ability to heal itself and restore balance. It stimulates the healing process and improves energy flow within the entire body, including cells, tissues, organs and systems. Julia assesses her clients' intuitively or with her hands, tracking imbalances in their human energy fields. She is a highly sensitive empath with a natural desire to optimise all human potential. Hundreds of clients in Canada and around the world have benefitted from her caring and enthusiasm combined with unstoppable determination for the best outcome in all she observes. Julia reads the information available through her awareness of higher consciousness and many resources as a genuine healer with exceptional intuitive gifts. It flows clearly and quickly to identify more of the underlying influences behind symptoms or situations in people's lives. Julia has observed many physical issues connected with her clients' mental/emotional health. Consciously raising our frequency and vibration accelerates our healing process and assists with achieving a balanced state of health and wellness.

Biofield Energy Healing occurs when life force energy is transmitted into the energy field of anything living or non-living. Biofield energy treatments transmit life force energy into humans' biofield, simultaneously working with their mental, emotional, physical and spiritual imbalances. Biofield Energy Healing is a term accepted and approved by USFDA, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Alternative & Complementary Medicine field. In April 2011 Julia Grace was introduced to Guruji Mahendra Trivedi and the Trivedi Effect remotely through a live webcast. She felt the Energy Transmission deeply and enjoyed a calm, restful sleep that night. Trivedi Effect brought clarity, focus and heightened Julia's capabilities as an Energy Healer. She became stronger with more protection and less absorption of humans' toxic energy. Mr. Trivedi's Biofield Energy Transmissions boosted Julia's capacity to harness and transmit greater amounts of universal life force energy. Julia Grace McCammon has the remarkable ability to harness the energy from the universe and transmit it across the world, optimising the potential of every person, plant or thing infused with this intelligent energy. Julia transmits universal life force energy in person or at a distance. Remote Biofield Energy Healing takes place with people in any location. Living beings and non-living materials receive powerful Biofield Energy Healing treatments up close or from any distance. Mahendra Kumar Trivedi is the founder of Trivedi Effect, the world-renowned phenomenon which benefits recipients according to their unique needs. These Biofield Energy Transmissions intelligently transform living organisms and nonliving substances at the atomic, molecular and cellular structures. Over 4,000 scientific studies were conducted in agriculture, biotechnology, cancer, genetics, human health, livestock, microbiology and materials science. Nearly 200 papers have been published in leading international peer-reviewed scientific journals documenting measured results of the Trivedi Effect, thereby excluding the possibility of the placebo effect. These publications have been adopted by more than 900 U.S. Universities and hundreds of top universities internationally. From a study to assess Trivedi Effect biofield energy treatments on a mixed sample of cancerous and noncancerous cells at California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute: \"The results suggest that the biofield treatment administered in the laboratory can induce cell death of brain cancer cells from a distance while at the same time promoting viability of normal brain cells. Such selective efficacy against cancer cells is the sought after \"holy grail\" for novel experimental anti-cancer agents and makes this work all the more exciting.\" - Dr. Garrett L. Yount, Ph.D. Julia Grace McCammon participated in published science experiments in which she provided a Biofield Energy treatment remotely from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to products held in an International Research Institute across the world at an unknown location in India.
