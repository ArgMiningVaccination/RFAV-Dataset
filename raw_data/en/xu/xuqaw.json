He uses atmospheric landscape painting layered with obscured, abstracted writing to explore the mental shifts and psychological resonance that can linger from engagement with and memory of certain environments. Nick is breaking new ground in these paintings, making work that exhibits the mystery and gravity of the unknown, tinged with notes of the familiar. His work has been selected for exhibits like Georgetown College's \"State of Fine Art\" and \"The Next Generation\" at the Kaviar Gallery in Louisville, as well as for student and regional exhibits and annual student scholarships. He was also awarded a competitive artist residency in 2016 at the New York Academy of Art Summer Residency Program in Manhattan. Nick has been a dynamic and full contributor to our department (including as President of our student-run Art Guild and as one of the best Painting Studio Techs we have ever had) and we all congratulate him for this well-deserved award. www.nicholasjosephsmith.com. -Yvonne Petkus Kaylynne Jones , Bowling Green, Kentucky Visual Studies | Senior Awards and Honors: Dean's List, President's List, National Society of Collegiate Scholars officer of PACE Clubs and Organizations: National Society of Collegiate Scholars, Hillview Heights Sunday School Teacher, Volunteer with 4-H of Kentucky, VSA of Kentucky, WKU Super Saturdays Kaylynne is one of the most dedicated, sincere, and hardworking art teacher candidates, who undoubtedly will bring enormous promises for the children and youth she will come to know and teach. Over the last three semesters, I have grown to appreciate her pleasant and creative nature, her extensive hunger for knowledge, as well as her willingness to try something new. Kaylynne participated in Cuban art exchange program, \"Mirror: Memories and Identity, \" and volunteered for SmArt HeArt after school ESL art program at Warren Elementary School in spring 2016. I was thoroughly impressed by her enthusiasm, her teacher \"with-it-ness, \" and commitment to the teaching of those ESL students. Kaylynne spares none to learn and expand her professional growth, and attended the 2017 National Art Education Association conference in March 2017. Aside from her uncompromising commitment to going above and beyond any tasks presented to her, Kaylynne is conscientious, optimistic, and motivated student who always makes the best of her natural gift of art and teaching. Thank you for the opportunity for Kaylynne's future educational career and encouragement this award will endow for her heart and soul. -Miwon Choe 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 3Sarah Linder , Louisville, Kentucky Art History | Junior Awards and Honors: 1906 Founders' Scholarship, Honors Scholar, Dean's ListClubs and Organizations: Honors College, Alpha Delta Pi, International Justice Mission, Volunteer at Kentucky Museum As an Art History major, Sarah Linder has a plan to combine art and science in a way that demonstrates the practical application of a humanities major to an in- demand occupation. We are excited about her plans to enter the world of art conservation! Her knowledge and expertise will come in handy as she cares for, preserves, and restores our common cultural and material heritage. Sometimes even the best works of art show their age. When they do, Sarah will be there to help keep them looking the way their creators intended. Sarah has been a joy to teach. While we will miss seeing her around the art department, we look forward to following and supporting her future endeavors! -Guy Jordan COMMUNICATION Cathryn Ellis , Danville, Kentucky Communication Studies | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Student of the Department of Communication's Joint Undergraduate-Master's Program (JUMP), Session winner of the 46th Annual Student Research Conference at WKU, Assistant and Intern for Dr. Blair Thompson for the Central States Communication Association conferences (2016 and 2017), Lambda Pi Eta (Communication Honors Society), Honors College Student, Study Abroad (Spain, summer 2015 and 2016) Clubs and Organizations: WKU Spirit Masters, Alumni Relations and Rituals Chairs for Rho Chapter of Omega Phi Alpha National Service Sorority, Peer Mentor with Best Buddies, Public Relations intern for the Southern Kentucky Choral Society, Member at Eastside Church of Christ Cathryn Ellis is one of best students any faculty member could hope to work with due to her creativity, energy, intellect and leadership. She is a leader in and out of the classroom. From her presentations at the WKU research conference to her work with the Central States Communication Association, her contributions to the Communication discipline are noteworthy at WKU and beyond. She is an exemplary example of the success of WKU's JUMP program as she will graduate from WKU next year with both her undergraduate and master's degrees in hand. Time will only tell the amazing accomplishments she will achieve during her future career. -Blair Thompson 4 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsAshley Hickman , Valparaiso, Indiana Corporate and Organizational Communication | Senior Awards and Honors: Summa Cum Laude, President's List (2012-2016)Clubs and Organizations: Lambda Pi EtaMentor: Charlotte Elder Gavin Kirkwood , Orange County, California Organizational Communication | Graduate StudentAwards and Honors: Teaching Assistantship at WKU Clubs and Organizations: WKU Graduate School (fall 2016-present), Student Council Member (fall 2016-present), President of the Communication Organization for Graduate Students It is difficult to capture all of Gavin Kirkwood's positive qualities, but the key words that come to mind are bright, motivated, organized, and genuine. Gavin is a graceful academic who always helps others, seeks to find understanding of difficult material, and pushes himself to succeed all without being self-absorbed or pretentious. From a study of a commune to an analysis of a satirical Facebook site, Gavin's research explores alternative bureaucratic forms and organizational resistance, topics that are provocative and understudied in the Communication discipline. Top doctoral programs in Communication across the country such as Purdue University, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Arizona, and University of Colorado, Boulder have recognized his talent and offered him full funding to pursue his Ph.D. Gavin and I don't always see eye to eye, for example the topics of Reba McEntire and Dollywood might trigger some debate, but those conflicts aside we have developed a great working relationship where we push each other to explore alternative meanings and understandings of communication phenomenon. Although I will miss him dearly when he graduates, I know that we will be lifelong colleagues and friends. -Holly Payne 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 5ENGLISH Grace Collierville, Tennessee Literature | Senior Awards and Honors: Cherry Presidential Scholarship, President's List (fall 2013-present), WKU Honors College Intern, Teaching Assistant in WKU English Department (spring 2015) Clubs and Organizations: WKU Open Bible Ministry- Bible study co-teacher (fall 2016) and social media contributor (fall 2016-present), Student worker at WKU Office of Admissions (fall 2015-present), WKU Academic Advising and Retention Center (spring 2016-present) Grace Therrell stands out among many of the English majors at WKU for her thoughtful attention to detail, clear and effective communication, critical thinking, and her ability to make connections between texts and traditions. Most English majors are inquisitive and open-minded, but Grace is markedly so. In all my interactions with her, she has proven herself to be a bright, responsible, and dedicated student, possessed of a keen intellectual curiosity that informs all her studies. At the same time, she is personable and down-to-earth, and a generally delightful human being. -Alison Langdon Tori Wigginton , Louisville, Kentucky English for Secondary | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Scholarships: Regents Tuition, College Heights Foundation, Mary L. Scott, and SAGL World Topper Clubs and Organizations: WKU Track and Cross Country, Spirit Masters, Honors College, Honors Freshman Retreat (H4) Counselor, Study Abroad, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Bridges International Ministry Tori Wigginton changed my life! This young lady is a fierce runner and a gifted creative write r. She has developed a set of qualities - persistence, self-control, curiosity, consciousness, self-confidence, resilience, and most importantly, grit. Tori is a member of the WKU Spirit Masters, the ambassadors of WK U. While they may be referred to as leaders, there is a deeper value to their presence among us, because they are the storytellers of this campus. Storytelling is an art and Tori masters the subject while appreciating her audience with her 'light up the roo m' contagious smile! On her campus tours, she wouldn't only talk about the history of a building, but rather share her, as well as her friends, ' experiences in the classrooms and how professors encouraged them to pursue their goals . She always volunteered for the challenging tours. The tours with high school students deemed 'at risk' or the student whose parents worked long hours and couldn't arrive until four-thirty on a Friday afternoon. Tori is a rare individual; the likes of whom I doubt we'll see on this campus for many years. She's a fireball. Soon she will be sprinting towards her hometown of Louisville to teach English to high school students and change their lives, too! -Lucinda Anderson 6 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsConor Scruton , McKenzie, Tennessee English | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: TN Center of Excellence for the Creative Arts Summer Research Fellow, Rachel Maddux Baker Award for Excellence in Creative Writing Clubs and Organizations: Society for the Study of the American Short Story, Center for the Study of the French Language in the Americas Conor took classes with me four semesters in a row, I chaired his oral exam committee, and I co-directed his thesis. For the last two years, Conor has been EVERYWHERE--the classroom, my office, the hallway, the elevator, the copy room--waiting to ask a question, turn in a draft, clarify a point, or reminisce about his (least) favorite Melville novel. He earned the nickname \"the repressed\" because he RETURNS. Fortunately, he's a talented student. It took me three semesters, but I finally found the only Conor-free refuge in Cherry Hall--the women's bathroom! -Sandra Hughes Leigh Cheak , Versailles, Kentucky MFA in Poetry | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: Maintained 4.0 GPA in Poetry MFA, Poetry featured in The Harpoon Review, Voicemail Poems, A Narrow Fellow, Crow Hollow 19, and McNeese Review, Founder and Editor-in Chief of Lost River (est. 2016), Co-editor Anthology Lavender Bluegrass: LGBT Writers of the South, Moderator and Co-Chaired a workshop at the Kentucky Writer's Conference, Featured reader for the Flying Out Loud series in Louisville, Kentucky Clubs and Organizations: Volunteer Workshop Leader for WKU Students with a Goal (SW AG) Camp, Volunteer Reader for Steel Toe Books (2015), Crossland Community Church I first met Leigh during her freshman year at WKU, when she volunteered to intern for my small poetry press, Steel Toe Books. It has been an absolute joy to watch her grow and flourish. Whether serving as President of the English Club, fronting a rock band, studying in Costa Rica for a semester, or placing her poems in prominent journals such as Still and Louisville Review, she puts her all into whatever she does. Now that she is teaching freshmen of her own, I hope that she finds some that are as smart, as enthusiastic, as special as the Leigh Cheak I encountered six years ago, but I doubt that she will. -Tom Hunley 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 7FOLK STUDIES AND ANTHROPOLOGY Mollie Todd , Flemingburg, Kentucky Anthropology & Arabic | Senior Awards and Honors: Critical Language Scholarship: ArabicClubs and Organizations: Honors College Student, WKU Anthropology Club, Phi Sigma Pi National Honors Fraternity, WKU Arabic Club, Qatar International Arabic Debate Competition Team, Intern for Community Action of Southern Kentucky, Refugee Services Mollie Todd is an extraordinary student. I've had the pleasure of teaching her in 3 classroom-based courses and one directed-study course. I'm currently serving as the chair of her honor's thesis committee. What impresses me most about Mollie is her academic prowess and drive to achieve. This, in part, is why the anthropology faculty chose her as the outstanding senior anthropology student. She is completing her anthropology major with a cultural anthropology concentration. She has served in leadership positions in the Anthropology Club. She is also completing a major in Arabic. She brings her experiences and training from both majors to her work in the larger Bowling Green Community where she has worked as a volunteer at the International Center and currently works as an intern at Community Action of Southern Kentucky in refugee services. I know she'll continue to use training from both majors in the future since she hopes to pursue a career in the foreign service. She awaiting responses from three graduate programs and has already taken (and passed) the Foreign Service exam. She is at the beginning of an interesting journey and I look forward to seeing where it takes her. -Kate Hudepohl Rachel Haberman , Caldwell, Idaho Folk Studies | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: Folklore Trivia QueenClubs and Organizations: Intern at Kentucky Museum in collection management, Intern at Downing Museum in archival management, Volunteer with the Kentucky Folklife Program, American Folklore Society, Kentucky Museum and Heritage Alliance, Founding board member for the non-profit organization Believe in Haiti Rachel Haberman is perhaps best known in our department as the Folklore Trivia Queen, a coveted title among students taking the Folklore Theory course. She has been outstanding as a student, assistant, intern, and member of our community. In classes she's shown herself to be very bright, very conscientious, and creative. One of her professors especially remembers her paper for a Folk Art class about her father's carpentry. He recalls, \"she did a wonderful job looking not only at his artistry, but at the way it serves as a kind of communication in the family. \" In her graduate assistantship, she has worked on everything from processing fieldwork data and compiling reference works, to guest lecturing on graffiti in Haiti and witchcraft in Kentucky. She has a wide range of skills and a willingness to help as needed. After her assistantship cataloging, organizing, and inventorying Kentucky Museum collections, her supervisor wrote \"Rachel is a real keeper and will do well anywhere she lands\"\u2014we certainly agree and wish her well as she decides where that might be. -Michael Ann Williams 8 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsHISTORY McGAvinn Brown , Franklin, Kentucky History | Senior Awards and Honors: Lowell H. Harrison History Award, Angie Norcia Spirit Masters Award, Outstanding Sophomore in Political Science (2015), WKU Homecoming King (2015) Clubs and Organizations: Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, Phi Alpha Theta, WKU Spirit Masters McGavinn's curiosity cannot be satiated and is matched only by his outgoing personality. This combination makes for a rare treat in a professor's life - a conversation partner who poses probing questions, pushes back on debatable points, and advances thought-provoking hypotheses. In that sense, talking to McGavinn is like enjoying a dramatic and emotionally charged game of chess: there's advance, there's recalculation, there's retreat and then, ultimately, preparation for the next encounter on the field of ideas and arguments. Engaging McGavinn is the best kind of mental exercise: the kind that refreshes the mind and obliges to reexamine truths long accepted as settled. When I first met McGavinn he seemed an unlikely candidate for a Russian history enthusiast, but this is exactly what McGavinn does best. He unsettles expectations and challenges accepted rules of engagement. He excels in this regard to the extent that I suppose he even surprises himself on a regular basis. -Marko Dumani Robert Bunch , Edmonton, Kentucky Social Studies | Graduate Awards and Honors: Graduated Summa Cum Laude with Bachelor of Arts in History & Religious Studies (fall 2013), Graduated Summa Cum Laude with Bachelor of Arts in Social Studies & Teacher Certification (fall 2016); Currently teaching in Louisville, KY 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 9JOURNALISM & BROADCASTING Nikki Gross , Lexington, Kentucky Advertising | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Dean's List, Recipient of the John B. and Clarence M. Gaines Journalism Scholarship Fund Clubs and Organizations: Co-President of WKU ADFED (Advertising Federation)Nikki is so deserving of this recognition. She is talented and creative-what you expect in a competent designer. What sets her apart is her leadership abilities and work ethic. Nikki is refreshingly direct and organized. She demands a lot from her peers because she works to her own full potential. She has the uncanny ability to cut through the challenges of a case and identify the clear path to solution. She is also able to coalesce a team around a plan-no easy task in a creative environment. Nikki will be successful at anything she focuses on and the WKU Advertising Program looks forward to lauding her many future successes. -Kelley Coppinger Alana Watson , Nashville, Tennessee Broadcasting | Junior Awards and Honors: President's List, Dean's List, Charles M. Anderson Fellow (spring 2017) Clubs and Organizations: Member of National Broadcasting Society, Potter College Dean's Council of Students, News Director of WWHR News 91.7, Ambassador for the School of Journalism and Broadcasting, President of Multicultural Journalist I wish all of my students were as dedicated to their professions as Alana Watson is to the broadcast news industry. She seizes every opportunity that comes her way and commits 110-percent to her endeavors. In addition to excelling in her classes, Alana volunteers to practically apply her lessons in nearly every aspect of student media and across multiple platforms. Alana Watson is a shining example of why the spirit makes the master. -Jeanine Howard Cherry 10 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsJon Meyers , Bowling Green, Kentucky Film | Senior Awards and Honors: O'Neill-Lochen Scholarship for Film Studies (2015), Western Kentucky Film Festival Finalist (2016) Clubs and Organizations: Hourly Host of Scott Myer's Monthly 24 Hour Screenwriting Marathon, Frequent Contributor to Lucy V . Hay's Bang2Writers Online Screenwriting Community, Multiple Screenwriting Submissions To National Competitions (results to be announced in May 2017) Jon is one of the most dedicated and hard-working screenwriting students I have had in any writing class. Most students study film because they want to be directors or work in some technical aspect of filmmaking. Jon has known from the outset that his interests lie in screenwriting, and he has done everything in his power as a student to become the best screenwriter that he can be. He consistently seeks out opportunities (or creates his own) to write extracurricularly. This, to me, is the hallmark of a serious writing student. He doesn't just put in the work because he wants the grade, even though he does well in that area. He puts in the work because he genuinely enjoys the process and wants to learn. -Travis Newton Nicole Ares , Versailles, Kentucky News/Editorial Journalism | Senior Awards and Honors: Division-1 College Athlete, President's List, Dean's List, Gilman Alternative Scholarship Recipient for Study Abroad, Spirit Makes the Master Scholarship Recipient Clubs and Organizations: Digital Managing Editor, Assistant News Editor, Features Editor and Staff Reporter for College Heights Herald (spring 2014-spring 2017); Member of the WKU Swimming and Diving Team (2013-2015), Study Abroad- Danish School of Media and Journalism (spring 2016) I first met Nicole in my news editing class. I asked if anyone worked at the Herald, and Nicole raised her hand. I asked her what her job entailed, and Nicole said she served as features editor. I asked how long she had worked at the Herald, and Nicole said about five weeks as a reporter. She got quite a promotion in a very short time, but clearly \u2014 even in the early stages of her pursuit of a degree in journalism \u2014 she was up to it. Since that time, she has continued reporting and editing for student publications. She studied journalism abroad in Denmark, and reported from Denmark and other countries. And she excelled in the classroom.But what makes Nicole stand out goes beyond academic and journalistic acumen, is that she leads by example and has the respect of fellow students and faculty. She is learning-driven, and so she excels academically. She displays maturity and professionalism, and possesses a great sense of responsibility. She performs under pressure with a level head. She treats all people with respect. She takes every opportunity to learn more and do more to better herself personally and professionally. Nicole represents the best in the SJ&B. -Mac McKerral 2017 PCAL Redmond, Washington Photojournalism | Senior Awards and Honors: Hearst Championship Multimedia -2nd Place (2016), Hearst Award for Multimedia News - 1st place (2016); College Photographer of the Y ear - Spot News - Bronze Clubs and Organizations: Treasurer for National Press Photography Association, Video Editor for College Heights Herald With an adventurous spirit that has been a consistent theme in her time at WKU, Alyse Young left her home in Seattle, Washington, four years ago to travel across the country to join our Photojournalism program. It is has been most gratifying as a teacher to observe Alyse Young find her niche as a storyteller, using still photographs, video, and the written word with equal adeptness. She has told unique stories about international students on campus and has traveled abroad to pursue international stories that she has brought back to share with us on campus. In the true spirit of giving back to our program, Alyse has volunteered her time in a leadership role for the National Press Photographers Association Student Chapter, and she has put in countless hours of hard work in various roles for WKU's publications. Now Alyse embarks on a new journey, one that I am confident she will embrace with all of the enthusiasm and determination she has demonstrated since arriving at WKU. I imagine she will take the photojournalism profession by storm. -James Kenney Angela Petkovic , Bowling Green, Kentucky Public Relations | Senior Awards and Honors: National Gold Key Award, Guthrie/Mayes Public Relations Student of the Y ear (2016) Clubs and Organizations: Public Relations Student Society of America, President Kappa Delta Sorority Kappa Tau Alpha As faculty and PRSSA advisor, I have had the pleasure of knowing Angela for three years. A natural leader, her clear focus on understanding public relations is always evident. Constantly interested in gaining experience, as a freshman she began earning internships and has worked at a different internship site each summer. Her internship success led to being hired part-time by one employer before she finished her degree, and she has already received calls from others about returning as a professional upon graduation. We are not alone in recognizing Angela's talent. Guthrie/Mayes Public Relations, Louisville, selected Angela as Kentucky's PR Student of the Year in 2016. As a junior, she earned the prestigious national PRSSA Gold Key Award and was inducted in SJ&B's Kappa Tau Alpha National Honor Society. Angela has always brought a high level of leadership and professionalism to the public relations major. We look forward to her many future accomplishments. -Vicki Bagwell 12 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsMODERN LANGAUGES Mollie Todd, Recipient of Arabic and Anthropology Outstanding Student Awards Courtney Tucker , Clarkson, Kentucky Chinese | Senior Awards and Honors: William Ralph Walls Jr. Scholarship, International Travel Award, World Topper Scholarship, Confucius Institute Scholarship, Studied Abroad (Beijing, China) Clubs and Organizations: Treasurer of Lambda Phi Eta, Chinese ClubCourtney is an amazing student leader in the Chinese Major & Minor Program. She not only sings beautifully in Chinese, and but also is good at Chinese calligraphy. Courtney has successfully hosted several major events for the WKU Chinese Club. She studied abroad in Beijing for a semester, which brought transformational changes to her life. Courtney also invests her time in helping and supporting children in the community by sharing her multicultural talents and stories with them. -Ke Peng Lily Woosley , Big Reedy, Kentucky French | Senior Awards and Honors: Regents Scholar, William Ralph Walls Jr. International Travel Award Recipient Clubs and Organizations: Intern at the Health and Fitness Lab in Preston Center, French tutor in the Modern Languages Lab Lily Woosley has big dreams, and now she is about to make them come true. Over the past few years, Lily has consistently said that her academic and personal interests extend much beyond this campus. Being well-learned, intellectually curious and open-minded is one thing, but there is, after all, a whole world out there and she gladly makes it her number one mission to go explore new countries and cultures. In, or out of class, her contributions will always be insightful, sometimes hilarious, and certainly noteworthy. Lily is a driven and persistent young woman whose future achievements, both personal and professional, everyone is very eager to hear about. Good luck in all your endeavors; Modern Languages will be poorer for losing you. -Karin Egloff Crystal Belcher , Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.Crystal Belcher is a true star. No matter what comes her way, her light of positivity never extinguishes. It has been a pleasure serving as her mentor here at Western Kentucky University. Ms. Belcher makes mentoring easy because she is highly motivated and ambitious. I've had the pleasure of mentoring numerous students over the years, but Crystal stands out as one of the most intellectually driven individuals I've encountered in my professional career. Her ability to engage in strategic planning is a skill that will take her far in graduate school and into her ideal career field. When crystal enters my office, she is prepared and ready to propel herself to the next level. Knowledge is power, and Ms. Belcher is a power house ready to embark on her next academic adventure. She makes me a better mentor because her \"outside of the box\" approach makes me look at things from more of a forward thinking perspective. I have no doubt that she will excel in graduate school and then go on to pursue a career where she can fuse modern language, sociology, and criminology. Crystal is an exceptional young woman who will make extraordinary changes in society. -Kristina Gamble Michael Goedde , Owensboro, Kentucky Spanish | Senior Awards and Honors: Regents Scholarship, Ogden Foundation Scholarship, Acceptance to UofL School of Medicine, President's List Clubs and Organizations: Alpha Epsilon Delta, American Chemical Society Chemistry Club (Vice President), Summer Study Abroad in Madrid, Tutor/TA for WKU Physics Department Michael is one of those students you wish to have in your classes, over and over again. I am convinced that Michael will be a dedicated doctor, who would treat his patients with humanity and sympathy. -Inmaculada Pertusa 14 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsMUSIC Andrea Gray , Hopkinsville, Kentucky Music, Education | Senior Awards and Honors: Presidents List, 4.0 cumulative GPA, Governor's Scholar, Principal Trumpet WKU Wind Ensemble, Kent Campbell Award, Big Red Marching Band Outstanding 1st Y ear Member, Big Red Marching Band Drum Major, Music Grant recipient Clubs and Organizations: Delta Omicron Professionals Music Fraternity President, Nationals Band Association President, Big Red Marching Band Drum Major, National Association for Music Education Vice President. I was fortunate enough to become aware of a fine trumpet player from Hopkinsville, Andrea Gray a little over 4 years ago. In the Music program, we must be familiar with students who have the combination of tremendous musical talent, good academic numbers who would contribute and succeed in the Music program at WKU. Andrea processes all of the qualities. We were fortunate enough to get Andrea to attend Western against may other competing college music programs and the contribution has gone both ways. It has been a joy to provide her with a good learning environment with a wide variety of musical experiences. In turn, Andrea has been an extremely valuable musician and leader in our department. She has strong drive, integrity and the support of a wonderful family and strong Faith. Andrea has a bright future ahead of her and will represent WKU proud. -Marshall Scott Luc DiGuiseppe , Franklin, Kentucky Music, Liberal Arts | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List (fall 2013 - spring 2016), Dean's List (fall 2016), Guitar Performer of the Semester (fall 2014, spring 2015, fall 2015), Dr. Samuel & Jeane Tinsley Scholarship (fall 2015 - spring 2017) Clubs and Organizations: WKU Marching Band (Section Leader), WKU Pep Band, WKU Jazz Band, WKU Guitar Ensemble and Quartet, WKU Choral Society, WKU Modern Dance, II/III Accompanist, WKU American String Teacher's Association (Secretary), Musician's Pro (Sales Associate, Guitar/Bass Teacher) Luc DiGiuseppe is a natural leader without even trying to be one. He's the kind of leader that doesn't realize how much influence he has on others around him, and he is the kind of leader that leads by example, not by description. Luc has consistently been the bar that others in the guitar program try to reach. He is the best example of a professional attitude, work ethic, discipline, and has immeasurable compassion for others. And, as if that weren't enough, Luc is just a heck of a great guy to be around and a super friend to everyone! -John Martin 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 15Angela Cook , Greenville, Kentucky Music, Conducting/Teacher Leader | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: WKU Big Red Marching Band, Kent Campbell Award, WKU Big Red Marching Band Drum Major (2014- 2015), KY Intercollegiate Band (2012-2014) Clubs and Organizations: Coach of WKU Big Red Marching Band Colorguard. Mentor: Gary Schallert PHILOSOPHY & RELIGION Kate Hart , Princeton, Kentucky Asian Religions and Cultures | JuniorAwards and Honors: Freeman ASIA Scholarship, Outstanding Junior in International Affairs, FUSE Grant Recipient, Elk's Most Valuable Scholar, Kentucky Colonel Clubs and Organizations: Student in the Chinese Language Flagship Program, President of HOLAS (Hilltopper Organization of Latin American Students), Executive Vice President of the Student Government Association, Community Advisor in the Chinese Language Immersion House, Member of Phi Mu Fraternity Mary \"Kate\" Hart is the student you hope to find in the front of your class on the first day. She has a zest for learning combined with an exemplary work ethic and a desire to serve others. This combination has made her not only an excellent student in the classroom, but a curious, conscientious student of the world. Kate has effectively combined her study of religions, cultures, and languages at WKU with immersive, intensive study abroad experiences and a strong commitment to service within the campus community. Her ability to weave her classroom knowledge with tangible learning experiences has allowed her to craft a mind-set of life-long learning and open the door to endless post-graduation options. When the spirit has made the master and Kate leaves WKU, I will genuinely miss knowing she is only a coffee break away. Kate is the type of student we all hope to work with, she is the student who makes our jobs worthwhile and reminds us why we are here. -Jennifer Markin 16 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsLillian Nellans , Des Moines, Iowa Philosophy | Junior Awards and Honors: Jeff Zimpleman Iowa Sister States Scholarship for Research in Kosovo (2015- 2016), National Semi-Finalist in Impromptu Speaking and National Quarter-Finalist in Extemporaneous Speaking at the National Forensic Association National Tournament (2016); Foundation for Global Scholars Scholarship Winner (2015) Clubs and Organizations: WKU Forensics Team, Director of Organizing for the Coalition for Social Justice Model, United Nations, SGA Senator I first met Lily as a student in my \"Why Are Bad People Bad?\" class, in which she excelled (academically...she was very bad at being bad, thank goodness). Lily continued to take my Social Ethics class in a men's maximum-security prison, where she continued to apply what she knows about philosophy to public engagement. This inspired Lily to join Students Teaching Students, a group of undergraduates who teach philosophy lectures in the Warren Regional Juvenile Detention Center. In her \"free time, \" Lily can be found in Bosnia researching the 1995 Srebenica genocide for the International Commission on Missing Persons or volunteering with refugees here in Bowling Green. Despite her natural brilliance and good will, she is occasionally the target of bigotry, whereby my colleagues and I have happily published testimony assuring the misinformed that she is neither a neo-Nazi nor a child-abuser guilty of war crimes simply because she participated in the Women's March in Washington, D.C. (see \"Opinion\" page 4A of BGDAILYNEWS.com, February 14, 2017). I consider such mindless attacks on Lily a sign of her \"fierceness, \" as haters routinely use such tactics in futile attempts to stifle the inevitable rise of a shining star. Indeed, as Laurel Thatcher Ulrich famously said (first) that, \"Well-behaved women seldom make history, \" Lily is on her way to make her contribution to history, and she has my vote for POTUS as soon as she is eligible and able to fit it into her very busy schedule. -Audrey Anton Kenneth Nauert, J r., Louisville, Kentucky Religious Studies | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Governor's Scholar Award, Jamie Parsley Family Foundation Scholarship, A. M. Stickles Award, Fraternal Order of Police Scholarship, Kentucky Clergy Economic Education Foundation Scholarship Clubs and Organizations: Golden Key International Honor Society, President of Theta Alpha Kappa Religious Studies Honor Society, Phi Alpha Theta History Honor Society, Honors College at WKU, St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Center What an amazing student! Kenny is the kind of student we all want to have in our classes and around our department. He is a triple major (Religious Studies, Asian Religions and Cultures, and History) and in his second semester of our Joint Undergraduate-Masters Program in Religious Studies. If given the time, I'm sure he would like to major in several other programs as well. That kind of intellectual curiosity is a gift\u2014one that Kenny shares with fellow students and faculty. And he understands the importance of making the most of that gift. He not only is smart as hell, but he works hard\u2014achieving a perfect 4.0 in WKU courses. Kenny is just as good a person as he is a student. Personable, considerate, easy-going, and thoughtful. Our department has been fortunate to have him as a student worker the last couple of years. He truly has become part of our family. 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 17-Eric Bain-SelboChristopher Brugh , Richmond, Virginia Religious Studies | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: American Academy of Religion, 2017 SECSOR Conference presenting \"The Abhidhamma: An Applied Ethics Shaping the Daily Lives of Burmese Theravada Buddhist Monastics in the United States\"; Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship at University of Wisconsin (summer 2016), SEASSI Joint Student Conference presented paper \"Theravada Buddhist Monastics\u00e2 Experiences: Twenty-First Century Missions and Role of the Abhidhamma\" (summer 2016) If I could use a just four words to describe Scott, it would be enthusiastic, passionate, hard-working and talented. Having entered our MA program after a 13-year hiatus from higher education, Scott quickly excelled as a scholar and as a teaching assistant. He is a talented researcher with regard to both textual research and fieldwork. Indeed, in addition to completing recently a research paper that is worthy of publication in a top-tiered Buddhist studies journal, he has undertaken field work that has uncovered aspects of Burmese Buddhism in its American contexts that would not have been readily available to most ethnographers. Alongside his scholarship, Scott has been an excellent teaching assistant in our program. He is sensitive to the needs of students, readily available to them, and genuinely open to their own perspectives. His passion for the study of religion is infectious. As someone who eats, drinks, and breathes the study of religion in general and Burmese Buddhism in particular, Scott is most deserving to receive the best graduate student award from the Department of Philosophy and Religion. -Jeffrey Samuels POPULAR CULUTURE STUDIES Alissa Kendrick , Lexington, Kentucky Popular Culture Studies | Senior Awards and Honors: Graduating Summa Cum LaudeAlissa has been a delight as a Pop Culture Studies student and advisee. Although I only had the opportunity to teach her in one of my classes, American Studies \u2014 Crime, Punishment and Justice in America, it was a memorable experience. She offered great insights about the readings and discussions and her research paper considering the way the internet meme of Pepe the Frog became reimagined as a hate symbol was original and nuanced. I am pleased she is presenting her paper at the 18 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsWKU Student Research Conference this spring. As a Broadcasting and Popular Culture Studies double major with an astute understanding of the way the media works and why it matters, I am confident she will be a great success in her forthcoming career behind and or in front of the mic and camera. -Anthony HarkinsPOLITICAL SCIENCE Noah Stevens , Franklin, Kentucky International Affairs | Senior Awards and Honors: Lowell H. Harrison History Award, Angie Norcia Spirit Masters Award, Outstanding Sophomore in Political Science (2015), WKU Homecoming King (2015) Clubs and Organizations: Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity, Phi Alpha Theta, WKU Spirit Masters Noah Stevens is an exemplary student who has designed a major in Middle East Studies by coordinating with faculty across Potter College. He is highly motivated in understanding more about the strategic importance of the Middle East, its society and politics. He is one of the key student leaders of WKU's Model Arab League. He has studied abroad in Morocco successfully. And he has been awarded a United States Foreign Service Internship! Noah Stevens is a great role model for PCAL students. -Soleiman Kiasatpour Jocelyn Porter , Louisville, Kentucky Political Science | Junior Awards and Honors: WKU President's List, WKU Truman Nominee, WKU Outstanding Junior in Political Science Clubs and Organizations: Study Abroad and Global Learning Student Representative, Study Abroad and Global Learning Exchange Student Mentor, Multicultural Student Journalists Member Articulate. Poised. Intellectual. Intentional. These are the characteristics that best describe this quiet and reserved young woman. I first became acquainted with Jocelyn when she enrolled in my Women in Politics course. I was surprised that she was not more vocal in our class discussions. But I watched as she listened to all sides of the discussion and at the most opportune time she would offer her insights and critiques. Her comments were always insightful and demonstrated an ability to apply theoretical concepts to contemporary issues and problems. The papers that she submitted pondered issues of social justice that she experienced as a young African American woman on a predominantly white campus; she wrestled with institutional inequality and effectively applied theories and concepts to find meaning in an unjust social order. Jocelyn has a unique style of \"quiet\" that embodies strength and deliberateness. She never raises her voice or grows impatient with her classmates. Jocelyn is always on task and her gentleness commands attention that make her a persuasive leader. This is the kind of demeanor that will make her an effective civil rights advocate in a not for profit organization or in the halls of Congress. 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 19-Saundra ArdreyAshleigh Barker , Nashville, Tennessee Public Administration | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: Distinguished Minority Fellows, NASPAA Student Simulation Challenge, NCBS Conference Presenter Clubs and Organizations: Distinguished Minority Fellows of WKU, UT Black Alumni Association, Urban League Y oung Professionals of Middle TN It is a joy to know Ashleigh. She is diligent, intelligent, and always professional. She has assisted me with research and continues to impress me with her curiosity and commitment to learning. The desire to do much more than the basic requirements for the degree is the hallmark of an excellent graduate student. Ashleigh excels at seeking extra opportunities to grow and develop, including serving as a participant in the NASPAA Student Simulation Challenge, attending the Kentucky City and County Managers' Association meeting, and presenting research at an academic conference. I am so proud to have the opportunity to know this strong, capable, genuinely nice woman who will be a fantastic addition to public service. -Shannon Vaughan SOCIOLOGY Sarah Burnett , Louisville, Kentucky Criminology | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List (fall 2013-fall 2016)Clubs and Organizations: WKU Honors College, Coordinator of Membership for the Honors Toppers, Kappa Delta Sorority Bridges International, Alpha Kappa Delta (Sociology Honors Society) Sarah is an excellent student - a double major in Criminology and Arabic with a minor in Sociology AND an Honor Student AND she has maintained a 4.0 GPA!

He is a top student who represents the best of higher education. He excels in the classroom and beyond. I know this because I have written a slew of letters of recommendation (e.g., graduate schools, Fulbright Award, study in Europe, etc.). In fact, I have a whole folder on my computer just for his letters. The thing is, I'm honored to do it. In addition to earning top grades in classes, Jonathan is engaged in meaningful and timely research, looking at such things the application of Moral Disengagement Theory to interracial conversations and public perception and police violence. As if that weren't enough, he is a member of the recently-crowned 2017 National Champion Forensics team. If only he could do something about the budget cuts at WKU. -James Kanan Cody Sutton , Somerset, Kentucky Criminology | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: Graduated a semester early with a 3.8 GPA.Cody Sutton was my student in two courses in our criminology graduate program, and I chaired his capstone research project. Cody is one of the most dynamic and engaged students I have ever met. He loves learning, and he loves discussing new ideas and concepts with his professors and colleagues. He has a passion for the study of criminology, and his scholarly work and collegial spirit has earned him the respect and praise of his colleagues and the faculty in our department. He embodies all of the qualities we hope to see in our students and the graduates of our program: a commitment to critical thinking and scientific inquiry; a deep sense of curiosity, the pursuit of new knowledge, and a commitment to lifelong learning; using theory and empirical research to identify solutions to complex problems; and personal integrity and professionalism. Our graduate program in criminology is stronger and better off because Cody Sutton was one of our students and is now one of our alumni. -Jerry Daday 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 21Jessica Simpson , Nicholasville, Kentucky Sociology | Graduate Student Awards and Honors: B.A. in Sociology, Dean's ListClubs and Organizations: Alpha Kappa Delta; Intern and Volunteer at Kelly Autism Program Jessica is a joy of student who is committed to her education, not only for the degree but due to her love of learning.

She is a great addition to our program and we are excited to see the impact on the world that she will surely make. -Amy C. Krull THEATRE & DANCE Kelby Auten , Louisville, Kentucky Dance | Senior Awards and Honors: Two-time recipient of the Jeffrey Mildenstien Dance Scholarship, Jack E. Lunt Dance Scholarship Clubs and Organizations: President of the National Dance Education Organization, WKU Student Chapter Member of the National Honors Society for Dance Arts, Honors College student Kelby Auten continues to be the reliable leader in this last semester of her undergraduate career as she was her freshman semester. Not as meek, and a bit more bold, Kelby has found her voice to take charge, creatively problem solve, and develop her stylistic movement, signature, and approach. She has continued to excel in all areas of the dance degree program. Through her roles in the WKU Student Chapter of NDEO (National Dance Education Organization), Tap Technique Teaching Assistant, Dance Company Rehearsal Assistant, Dance Project Rehearsal Director, WKU Dance Company dancer, Honors College, and featured dancer in The Stephen Foster Story; Kelby does not shy away from a challenge or learning experience. She approaches each task with enthusiasm, commitment, preparedness, and an amazing memory. It is this memory and attention to detail that has allowed her to go from an understudy in many dance pieces to being cast; basically every single time! She's come a long way since her sparkly black and white tap shoes, to truly becoming a Thinking Artist. -Meghen McKinley 22 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsBailey Vincent , Macon, Georgia Performing Arts, Music Theatre | Senior Awards and Honors: President's Scholar (fall 2013) Dean's List (spring 2014-spring 2015), Dean's List (spring 2016), President's Scholar (fall 2016) Clubs and Organizations: National Society of Collegiate Scholars Member of Chi Omega Executive Member of Alpha Psi Omega Bailey Vincent is an exceptionally intelligent, talented and generally delightful young woman. What's more, she's mastered the ability to bring those same qualities fully to the stage in every role she plays. As an actress and musical theatre major, Bailey has appeared on our stages many times, most recently as Audrey in Little Shop of Horrors. She has a beautiful singing voice with a remarkable range, and every time she's on stage you can't stop watching her. Her solo show, which she wrote and performed, was a hit of our New Works Festival. And we're not the only ones who have noticed her talent. She has performed in two New York Showcases and garnered praise from agents and casting directors both times. Aside from being a fantastic performer, she's also a favorite in our classrooms. She's frequently asked by professors to be a teaching assistant. In fact, we're pretty sure she holds the record for most courses TA ' ed. No surprise, since Bailey is always more than willing to help. Bailey can learn, teach, act, dance, sing, and write. She's way more than a triple threat. Remember her name! -David Y oung Ellie Archer , Louisville, Kentucky Theatre | Senior Awards and Honors: Regent's Scholarship, President's List, Dean's ListClubs and Organizations: Secretary of Alpha Psi Omega, Happy Gas ImprovEllie has spent the past four years as kind of an unsung hero in our department. She's one of those quiet, competent people who doesn't ask for a lot of recognition - but she absolutely deserves it. A partial list of the things you can always count on Ellie for: Thoughtful, creative, carefully prepared coursework; Insightful and well-written dramaturgy; Excellent acting in everything from children's shows to mainstages to classmates' directing scenes to improv; Willingness to do whatever needs doing, from stage managing tour show (including driving the van at 5:30 in the morning) to working on the department script library to helping run the honor society Alpha Psi Omega; Being a generally upbeat, positive, helpful and funny human being that's a pleasure to have around. In short, Ellie is a fantastic student, a multi-talented and hardworking theatre artist, and a great person, and we've been lucky to have had her in our department for four years! -Michelle Dvoskin 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 23DEAN'S COUNCIL OF STUDENTS AMBASSADORS Karina Bruce , Lexington Park, Maryland Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: Dean's List (2016)Clubs and Organizations: Potter College Dean's Council of Students ambassador, $100 Solution member, Topper Orientation Program Student Leader Karina is one of the most extraordinary students I have ever met. She has passion and drive for diversity and higher education unlike I have seen before. When a challenge is presented to Karina, she not only faces the challenge, but tackles it. While knowing Karina the past year, I have watched her grow into a strong and admirable leader. She has taught me and others around her so much about the importance of diversity and equality. Karina successfully planned and implemented WKU's largest fall 2016 recruitment event. Karina was in charge of facilitating an event for 2000+ guests, while also coordinating and supervising dozens of her superiors. She did so with grace, humility, and professionalism far beyond what was expected of an undergraduate student. I would not have trusted any other student, faculty, or staff member with this event. Karina will be successful in whichever path she takes. She has left a monumental impression on myself, the Office of Admissions, and Western Kentucky University. Ashlee Manley Ann Lundy Games , Louisville, Kentucky Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: Student Teaching Art in Germany (April 2017), Dean's List (spring 2014), President's List (fall 2014-spring 2015) Clubs and Organizations: Student Services, Vice-President of Potter College Dean's Council of Students Ann Lundy is the kind of student our institution loves to educate and then brag about upon their graduation. Like all students her time at WKU has been full of academic challenge and growth. She's even been involved in serving the institution and her community in her work with the Dean's Council and the campus ministry, RUF. What sets her apart, and will make her a great art educator, is her empathy and zeal. Ann Lundy's personality is such that she longs for those around her to see the beauty in visual art. As is evidence in her growing collection of tattoos and her ability to proselytize others to the joy of having meaningful art displayed on their bodies. Her career in education will be defined by her ability to make others as excited as she is about visual art and empathize with others when it is more difficult than they would have wished. This and the fact that she already has the art teacher hair style down will allow her to thrive in educating kids about the power and beauty of visual art. -Bryan Lemon 24 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsBryson Keltner , Edmonton, Kentucky Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Kentucky Colonial, Published in Zephyrus, Kentucky Governor's Scholar Clubs and Organizations: Honors Topper Ambassador, Dean's Council of Students ambassador, President of SAGL Student Representatives, Reporter for The College Heights Herald, Committee Member for Relay for Life, English Department Student Advisory Team Bryson has taken three classes with me and was a star in all three. The semester after he took Creative Writing with me I asked him to bring a friend and act out the play for another class as example of what I was looking for. He was always prepared for class, for tests, for extra credit assignments though he never needed them. He had a wonderful sense of humor, was always kind and polite and appreciative of others' work. For the next few years, I will be saying, \"Why aren't you more like Bryson Keltner?\" And my students will say, \"Who is that?\" Just for a few years though. After that, they will know; they will know; and they will say, \"You had Keltner in class!\" -Mary Ellen Miller Trent Marcum , London, Kentucky Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: FUSE Grant Recipient, Dean and President's List (2013-Present) Kappa Tau Alpha National Society; Honoring Scholarship in Journalism and Mass Communication Clubs and Organizations: Participant in WKU Theatre & Dance Productions, President of the Potter College of Arts & Letters Dean's Council of Students, English Student Advisory Council, Student Appeals Committee for Potter College, School of Journalism and Broadcasting Ambassador Trent embodies the ambitious and interdisciplinary spirit of Potter College. He's a student, an actor, a writer, a filmmaker, a tour guide, a teaching assistant, an event planner, a slow devourer of challenging texts, and a mentor and role model for others. The (sometimes) quiet exterior that he presents contains (sometimes) a raging torrent of curiosity, ambition, frustration, creativity, accomplishment, tattoos, and a pretty impressive range of cursing. In short, he has what it means to be a student in Potter College figured out. -Ted Hovet 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 25Kelly McGee , Louisville, Kentucky Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: President's List, Outstanding Theatre Student (2016)Clubs and Organizations: Alpha Psi Omega - Treasurer, Potter College Dean's Council of Students, Heavy Involvement with the Department of Theatre & Dance productions No one is more valued in our field than a good stage manager. They are the glue that holds a production together. And Kelly, a most excellent stage manager, has been the glue holding our department together for four years. I think she has been involved in some way with virtually every show or event produced by Theatre & Dance since she arrived. Her skill set incudes organization, problem solving, coordinating, collaborating, communicating, budgeting, rumor squashing, dialing down panic, and providing therapy sessions for actors, when necessary. Our conversations usually go something like this: Me: \"Hey Kelly, I think we probably need to -. '' At which point she says: \" Already taken care of. \" Along with stage managing, she also excels at directing, writing, youth theatre, and arts activism. She is an exceptionally bright young woman who will always be in demand in the business of show business. She is a gifted leader, scholar, critic and craftsperson. -David Y oung Kenneth Nauert, Jr., Recipient of Religious Studies award & Senior Student Ambassador 26 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsHannah Neeper , Morehead, Kentucky Student Ambassador | Senior Awards and Honors: FUSE Grant RecipientClubs and Organizations: Administrative Vice President, Student Government Association, Family Leader- Potter College Dean's Council Students, Coalition for Renters' Rights I have been grateful over the last couple of years to work with Hannah as a Dean's Council of Students (DCS) ambassador and as a Dean's Office student worker. Watching Hannah flourish as an articulate, driven, and passionate leader has been a joy to witness. Whether it's taking charge to advocate for students through Student Government, gleaming with pride as she speaks to prospective students about her love for Potter College, or taking the lead in coordinating a task for the office; Hannah's leadership shines with grace. Her work ethic, poise, drive, and kindness are unmatched as a student. On top of having three majors, she is the Administrative VP of Student Government, Family Leader in DCS, recipient of a FUSE grant, and a student worker\u2014all while maintaining a stellar GPA. Her quote of advice to DCS this year was from Cinderella, \"Have courage and be kind\". This quote perfectly describes the essence of Hannah. She has the courage to take on the tough challenges of the world, not for acknowledgement or self-gain, but rather to make it a better place for all and spread kindness as she goes along. Hannah has been a pleasure to us all in DCS and the Dean's Office. Her genuineness and love for all things are an inspiration. It will be bittersweet to say goodbye, but I am looking forward to all the great things that she will do. I'm confident that Hannah will go on to be the good that she sees in the world. -Cierra Waller 2017 PCAL Student Award Recipients 27NOTES 28 2017 PCAL Student Award RecipientsNOTESPotter College of Arts & Letters Student Awards Ceremony Program "}
