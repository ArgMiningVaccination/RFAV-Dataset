This study used a nationwide pop- ulation database to examine whether the HZ risk is increased after receiving the influenza vaccination.Methods: This population-based retrospective self-controlled case series evaluated the association between influenza vaccine exposure and HZ risk. Data were collected from Taiwan 's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2015 and 2017. Patients with HZ diagnosed within 6 months before and after receiving the influenza vaccination were included. After receiving the influenza vaccine, the first 15 and 30 days were defined as risk intervals, while the other periods were defined as control intervals. Poisson regression was used to compare the incidence rate ratio(IRR) for HZ during the risk interval vs. the control interval. Results: In total, 13,728 patients were diagnosed with HZ before and after receiving the influenza vaccine. The IRR for days 1 -15 was significantly higher (IRR =1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 -1.20), but 1 -30 (IRR =1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 -1.10). In a subgroup analysis, the IRRs were significantly higher in par- ticipants, including 50 -64 years old (1.16; 95% CI, 1.02 -1.33), males (1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28), and healthier individuals (i.e., no history of cancer or autoimmune diseases). Conclusions: There was a slight increase in risk of HZ in people receiving influenza vaccine in the first 1 -15 days after vaccination. KEYWORDS herpes zoster, influenza vaccine, side effect 1|INTRODUCTION Herpes zoster (HZ), also commonly known as shingles, is caused by reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), and occurs morecommonly in the elderly and immunocompromised people. 1HZ is not a deadly disease; however, its such as herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), can exert a seriousimpact on the health and quality of life of patients with HZ.2More- over, HZ usually causes unnecessary panic among patients. HZ was not listed as a side effect of any vaccines (except for occasional case reports) before the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) pandemic. 3There are, however, many reports of increased risk for HZ in people who received the COVID-19 vaccine,4-6especially mRNA-based vaccines.

In this study, we used a nationwide population database to explore whether HZ risk increases after receiving the influenza vaccine. 2|MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 |Background information In Taiwan, a single-payer mandatory enrollment National Health Insur- ance (NHI) program was launched in 1995, which covered more than 99% of citizens of Taiwan.8The policy of free influenza vaccination for all people aged 65 years and older was implemented in 2001.Other vaccination targets were gradually added, including medical staff, epidemic prevention workers, young children, patients with cat- astrophic illness, pregnant women, etc. In 2016, in order to protectthe health of adults aged 50 -64 years, this group was further included in the target of public-funded vaccines. The vaccine used in Taiwan is composed of viral strains updated according to the World Health Organization 's annual recommenda- tions for the Northern Hemisphere, and its protective efficacy is the same as that of other countries. The publicly funded influenza vaccine used in Taiwan is a trivalent vaccine containing three inactivatedviruses: A H1N1, A H3N2, and influenza B. The viral strains for the 2016 -2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine were an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)-like virus, and ). 2.2 |Data source This population-based study was a secondary data analysis using nationwide data from Taiwan 's NHI research database (NHIRD). The data were released by the Health and Welfare Data Science Center,Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan (HWDC, MOHW). The NHIRD of this study was covered during the 2015 -2017 period and comprised the detailed information of beneficiaries enrolled in theNHI program, including clinical records on outpatient visits, hospitali- zations, and prescriptions. According to the policies of Taiwan 's NHI, medical claims are sent to the Bureau of NHI for cross-checking andvalidation to ensure the adequacy of diagnosis coding. Hospitals or clinicals found to have fraudulent coding, overcharging, or malpractice will be penalized or restrained of the treatment fees. Several valida-tion studies have been performed to support the validity of diagnosiscodes in the NHIRD. 8Owing to the anonymity of the database, the requirement for informed consent was waived. This study was approved following an ethical review conducted by the InstitutionalReview Board of the Taichung Jen-Ai Hospital, Taiwan (Institutional Review Board No. 108-83). 2.3 |Study design and populations We used a self-controlled case-series design to evaluate the associa- tion between influenza vaccination and HZ. The study population comprised patients who had been diagnosed with HZ within 6 monthsbefore and after receiving the influenza vaccine in 2016. After exclud-ing patients (1) receiving influenza vaccine more than once (atypical way for influenza vaccine), (2) died within 6 months after receiving influenza vaccine, and (3) with missing value of confounding factors(age, sex, premium-based monthly salary, and urbanization level), we identified 13,728 patients who were enrolled as study subjects. A schematic algorithm detailing the study selection procedures is shownin Figure 1. Theoretically, if the HZ was not related to influenza vacci- nation, the incidence of HZ for our selection subjects would presum- ably be distributed equally across the entire observation period. Thefirst 15 and 30 days after receiving the influenza vaccine were definedas risk intervals, and the other periods (6 months before and 5 months after receiving influenza vaccine) were defined as control intervals. 2.4 |Definition To increase the accuracy of diagnosis, HZ was defined as having a primary diagnosis ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]: 053.x, and Tenth Revision FIGURE 1 Schematic of study design. \"Herpes zoster (A) \"represented the elderly who is diagnosed with herpes zoster at any time during the 15-day and 30-day risk interval (light-shaded areas) after influenza vaccination. \"Herpes zoster (B) \"represented the elderly who is diagnosed with herpes zoster during the control interval (dark-shaded areas). The study assessed the relative incidence of herpes zoster during the riskinterval as compared to that during the control interval.2o f6 WEI ET AL.[ICD-10-CM]: B02.*) and concurrent use of including confounding factors adjusted for in this study included sex, age, premium-based monthly salary, urbanization level, the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, 11comorbid autoimmune diseases, and cancer. CCI scores were calculated using the diagnosis of outpatient or inpatient admission during the preceding 12 months prior to the vaccination date. In addition, we used the registry for cat-astrophic illness in the NHIRD to define whether subjects had comor-bid autoimmune diseases or cancer. 2.5 |Statistical analysis We used the Poisson regression to compute the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident HZ during the risk interval compared to that in the control interval. The incidence of HZ per study subject during the observation period was accounted for inthe model. We evaluated the risks of incident HZ during days 1 -15, and 1 -30 after receiving influenza vaccine, respectively. To test the robustness of our findings, we conducted two sensitivity analyses thatlimited the control interval to the post-exposure observation time(i.e., 5 months after receiving influenza vaccine) and limited the pre- exposure observation time to 6 months before receiving influenza vaccine. We also performed a stratified analysis in subgroups definedaccording to age (<50, 50 -64, and 65 years), sex, CCI (score 0, 1, and2), autoimmune disease, and cancer (present or absent). Statisti- cal analysis was performed using the SASsoftware Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3|RESULTS Table 1provides the detailed characteristics of the study participants. In 2016, a total of 3,370,307 individuals in the NHIRD received the publicly funded influenza vaccine, of whom 1,294,590 (38.41) were older than 65 years, 1,080,886 (32.07%) were 50 -64 years old, and 29.52% were <50 years old. In total, 13,728 patients presented with incident HZ. The average age across all patients was 65.47/C613.43 years. The percentages of participants aged <50, 50 - 64, and 65 years old were 9.38, 33.83, and 56.80%, respectively. Most of the participants (56.37%) were females. In total, 49.2% of the participants had a CCI score 2. In addition, 12.19% of the patients had cancer, and 2.43% had a comorbid autoimmune disease. The incidence rates (IR) (per 1000 person-days) of HZ of risk periods for days 1 -15 and 1 -30 were 3.15 and 2.96. As compared to control periods, the IRs of HZ for post-exposure observation time andpre-exposure observation time were 2.88 and 2.81. The IRRs for HZ after influenza vaccination are shown in Table 2. When compared to the control interval, the IRR for days 1 -15 (risk interval) was signifi- cantly higher (IRR =1.11; 95% CI, 1 -30(IRR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.98 -1.10). The same results were observed in sensitivity analyses limiting the control interval to the post-exposureand pre-exposure observation times. The IRR for HZ after influenza vaccination was significantly higher for days 1 -15 compared to that with the control interval, but insignifi- cantly for days 1 -30; therefore, we only included days 1 -15 for strati- fied analyses. Figure 2showed the results of subgroup analyses for the risks of incident HZ during days 1 -15. The IRR for 50-64 years old participants was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02 -1.33) and for males was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01 -1.28). A CCI score of 0 (IRR =1.22; 95% CI, 1.05 -TABLE 1 Baseline characteristics of people receiving influenza vaccination and with incident herpes zoster during the observationperiod 4.55 842 dollar.WEI ET AL. 3o f61.14), as well as the absence of comorbid cancer (IRR =1.133; 95% CI, 1.04 -1.23), and autoimmune disease (IRR =1.11; 95% CI, 1.02 - 1.20) were associated with an increased risk of developing HZ afterreceiving the influenza vaccine. 4|DISCUSSION By using a nationwide database, the current study revealed a marginal increase in HZ incidence within 1 -15 days after receiving the influ- enza vaccine in the general population, particularly among individuals aged 50 -64 years, as well as in those with few comorbidities, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. This discrepancy in risk across dif-ferent age groups and health status is novel and might be due to an increased risk for HZ in older people, which renders the effect of vac- cination on HZ risk less apparent. In contrast, the incidence of HZ wassignificantly low in young people and those that were generallyhealthy. An increase in the number of HZ cases is therefore relatively easy to observe. Furthermore, although the IRR in patients with auto-immune diseases is not statistically significant, it might be due to the small number of cases contributing to its non-significance. Previous studies have identified various factors which can lead to VZV reactivation, including aging, physical or emotional stress, immu-nosuppression, and some medication, such as Janus kinase inhibi- tors. 9,10It is unlikely that the possible link between HZ and recent vaccination would cause physicians much concern, since HZ is com-mon in day-to-day patient care, and supposedly more prevalent in elderly people who should receive influenza vaccines. However, stud- ies using a large database should be able to reveal this unexpectedincrease in HZ with greater certainty. As an example, it is not surpris- ing that HZ had not been considered a monitoring target during the initial international clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine. 11-15The following massive vaccination supports that there is an increased riskof HZ following COVID-19 vaccination, which is unlikely to be coincident. It is unclear whether influenza vaccines directly or indirectly reac- tivate VZV from its latent state. Immunization may impose significant psychological and physical stresses. Stress alone, however, is unlikely to be the sole cause. As discussed in the literature regarding COVID-19 vaccines, there is speculation that dysregulation of T cells and cel- lular immunity, 16which are supposed to occur due to immune modu- lation caused by the target vectors16or adjuvant17of the vaccines, might be involved in reactivating the virus. It is also speculated that the reactivation of VZV is caused by the interaction of various factors with a summation effect. It is worthily noted that mRNA-based vac-cines are associated with HZ more frequently than other COVID-19vaccine types, suggesting that different types of vaccines are associ- ated with different risks. Further studies assessing the risk of HZ fol- lowing different types of influenza vaccinations may be needed. Zoster vaccines are effective in preventing HZ and is recom- mended for routine use in the elderly. Both conventional HZ vaccines (Zostavax \u00aeand Shingrix\u00ae) can be safely administered concomitantly with other vaccines, such as influenza18,19and pneumococcalTABLE 2 The incidence rate ratio of incident herpes zoster after influenza vaccination Events Observed person-days IRR (95% CI) P value Case Control Case Control Primary analysis Days 1 -15 649 12,884 205,920 4,530,240 0.202 Sensitivity analyses Control interval limited to post-exposure observation time Days 1 -15 649 5935 205,920 0.418 Control time -15 649 6952 205,920 interval; IRR, incidence rate ratio.

The only zoster vaccine available in Taiwan until December 2021 was Zostavax\u00ae(a live viral vaccine from Oka/Merck, MSD), launched in December 2013 and self-funded (without govern- ment subsidies). This vaccine is recommended for people over 50 years of age and costs about NT$ 5000 (equal to about 160 -170 US dollars). The relevant information about zoster vaccine recipients cannot be obtained from the NHIRD, since the vaccine is purchased privately. Although the exact coverage rate of zoster vaccination isunknown, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmedthat 27,695 HZ vaccines were imported during mid-2015 to mid- 2016 (assuming injection in 2016) according to the open data avail- able on the FDA website ( https://data.fda.gov.tw/frontsite/data/ DataAction.do?method =doDetail&infoId =102). Since zoster vaccines were administered in smaller numbers compared to those for influ- enza vaccines, the effect of zoster vaccine was less likely to be a con-founding factor. The clinical significance and efficacy of prior administration or simultaneous administration of influenza and HZ vaccines are worth to study in the future. This study has several limitations. First, we only examined those who were immunized with influenza vaccine in 2016 and not an extended period or different types of influenza vaccines. The brandand manufacturer for influenza vaccines can change every year, whichaffects the risk from year-to-year. The influenza vaccines used in Taiwan since 2001 were all denatured virus-based vaccines. There- fore, we did not extend our study period further. Second, it was diffi-cult to pinpoint the exact onset date of their HZ from insurance database information, and patients with HZ may not seek immediate medical attention when they develop clinical symptoms. However, weconfirmed the diagnosis using administration of antiviral drugs com- bined with the presence of diagnostic codes. According to the NHI, antiviral drugs are only reimbursed for patients who develop skin blis-ters within 72 h of administration. As a result, a delayed periodbetween diagnosis and the onset of symptoms of HZ should be less than 3 days according to information from NHIRD. Even though there may be a few days of error, the risk period in this study was 2 weeks;thus, differences would not significantly affect the results. As a final point, concomitant vaccination with influenza vaccines and other types of vaccines (such as the pneumococcal vaccine) has been thetrend in public health. Whether the combined use of vaccines affects the risk of zoster becomes an intriguing question. Since only a small number of subjects enrolled in our study (less than 1%) simultaneouslyreceived pneumococcal vaccine, the effect could not be assessed. In conclusion, patients receiving influenza vaccine, denatured virus-based, appear to have a greater marginal risk of developing HZin the immediate 1 -15 days after vaccination. We suggest that physi- cians should pay attention to the higher risk of developing HZ within first 2 weeks after receiving influenza vaccine.
