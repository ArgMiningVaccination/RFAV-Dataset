Cambridge is a research leduniversity and this magazineprovides a snapshot of just a small selection of the world-class research that is currentlybeing under taken across the University and its associated institutions. Cambridge hasbeen home to scientific andmedical breakthroughs for centuries, but as you will see, we are also home to ground-breaking research in the arts,humanities and the socialsciences. The University's Research Services Division supports thethousands of research programmes across Cambridge, and as part ofthat support, it promotes aseries of Horizon seminars,bringing the latest thinkingfrom academics and business people to a wider audience.This edition focuses oncurrent research in neur oscience, the subject of a Horizon seminar on 12October, and previews someof the latest scientificappr oaches to combating terrorism with security and threat detection. The latter forms the basis of the next Horizon seminar on 5 December . Whatever your interests, we hope that this magazinegives you an insight into howresearch at Cambridge ischanging the world.

Firstly , ther e is a new ability to manufacture at low temperatures, with big implications for the next generation ofelectronic devices such as mobile phones and computers. Previously, the production of nanotubes has involved growing themat 500\u00ba C, and production below this temperatur e was thought impossible. A group at the University of Cambridge have successfully grown them at 350\u00ba Cwhich means the nanotubes can now be directly integrated into new-generation electronics. Growing at higher temperatures would damage the inter-metal dielectrics (an electrical insulator) used to make electr onic devices. But at these new low temperatur es, the nanotubes could be used in niche applications and inminiaturised, mor e efficient versions of everyday electronics. The advantage of making materials from nano substr uctur es only one ten thousandth of a millimetr e across, is that the properties of a material change as its components get smaller; for example, isolated carbon nanotubes ar e stronger than any material known to man. The challenge is to assemble them into a fibre so as to exploit these properties. In the second br eakthr ough, Cambridge scientists have lear nt how to make the nanotubes and tur n them into a high performance fibre in one cost- effective operation. This time, using aparticularly high temperatur e, nanotubes form as a smoke which is elastic, a bit likecandy floss, so it can be grabbed and wound continuously to make the fibre. The strength and stiffness of these fibres combined with their low density means that they can be mixed with a polymer to for m composites, useful in cars and aeroplanes that require high strengthbut low weight to save fuel. Compositefibres made from nanotubes may replace graphite fibres in Formula One cars, but, because they are cheaper, eventually findtheir way into the family car too. The r esear ch was conducted at the Depar tment of Engineering, the Cambridge Hitachi Laboratory and theDepartment of Materials Science. www.msm.cam.ac.uk/polymer nanotubes@msm.cam.ac.uk Naontubes are made of a type of carbon known as Buckminster fullerene (or buckyballs) whichwas discovered in 1985. Fullereneis composed of football-shaped cages, which are formed into a hollow ball structure. Nanotubesare hollow tubes with a width of one millionth of a millimetre, andare up to one millimetere long. They contain carbon atomsarranged in sheets which are rolled together to form a cylindrical tube. They can besingle (one tube) or multi-walled.Nano breakthrough in next-generation manufacturing Carbon nanotubes are one of the basic building blocks of nanotechnology, but using nanotubes in manufacturing has challenged scientists across the globe. Nations in debt - weakness or strength? A common assumption today is that heavily indebted states,particularly in the developing world, are signing away a large partof their sovereignty. But the historical record suggests that indebtedness is often a means forstates to assert their sovereign power, either though their ability to sustain those debts or though their ability to renege on them. The Cambridge Sawyer Seminar is a year-long project funded by the Mellon Foundation, which will bring together historians, economists, lawyers and political theorists to explor e the relationship between public debt and political power. The question at the heart of this project is whether debt weakens or str engthens states. The project will examine what the history of state debt implies for the future prospects of the world' s most power ful and most heavily indebted states like the US, and what it tells usabout the plight of some of the weakest, in Africa and elsewher e. Standard responses to the issue of statedebt tend to take a moral stance or focus on highly technical analysis, buthistorical perspective is often missing. The seminar encompasses a series of historical workshops over the course of the academic year , and a conference in September 2007 that will identify any historical lessons which can infor m today's world picture. The workshops,which begin in November 2006, will look at subjects such as the r ole of debt in the power politics of the medieval Italian city-states, therelationship between debt and democracy in the founding of the Bank of England, the r ole of debt in the funding of empir e in the nineteenth century, and the relationship between debt and dictatorship in the first half of the twentieth centur y. The seminar pr ogram will also include a series of open lectur es during the academic year 2006-7 to highlightthemes of the pr oject: The first of these, on 12 October , will be given by James Macdonald, author of A Free Nation Deep in Debt: the FinancialRoots of Democracy . www .sps.cam.ac.uk/pol_sawyer .4| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006Research News Cambridge fir m wins UK BioEntrepreneur of the Year Award A University of Cambridge spin-out company hasbeen named as one of theUK's best new biotechinnovators at the BioEntrepreneur of the YearAwards hosted by UKTrade & Investment and London First. Cambridge company Domantis received the UK Innovation in Dr ug Discovery and Development A ward, in recognition of their contribution to the UK's dominant position in the development of new medicines. Domantis, which was formed as a spin-out from the University's Laborator y of Molecular Biology in 2000, is a dr ug discover y company developing the next generation of antibody molecules - Human Domain Antibodies. Domain Antibodies (dAbs)are therapeutic molecules that have benefits of both small molecules and conventional antibodies. Like small molecules, dAbs are highly stable, r esulting in a choice of therapeutic for mats, delivery formulations and manufacture options. And like human antibodies, dAbs can be designed to have specificity and high affinity with the biological target of interest. Domantis has more than a dozen proprietary Domain Antibody therapeutic pr ogrammes primarily in the fields of inflammation and oncologyand will start taking its own productsinto clinical development in 2007. www.domantis.comFirst time buyers in the spotlight In the mid 1980s, the median age of people expected to be able tobecome property owner-occupiers was 25. Short-term housing demand has driven this age well in to the early thirties and is also affecting the ability of key workers to find housing. Cambridge's Centre for Housing Planning Research is working with the Housing Corporation on a project looking at the demographic, economic and spatial impact of demand for affordable housing. The project is a longitudinal study that will assess how the life course of individuals affects their housing needs and will help inform the future housing strategies of government,regional development agencies, and local authorities The Centre for Housing Planning Research is a multi-disciplinary group including geographers, economists,architects and social scientists from across the University. Since it was formed in 1995, the Centre has attracted over \u00a310 million in exter nal research grants, carrying out over 100 research projects for a variety ofsponsors, ranging from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister , the Welsh Assembly, the Housing Corporation, theJoseph Rowntree Foundation, and awide range of other bodies includingRegional Assemblies, local authoritiesand housing associations. www.cchpr.landecon.cam.ac.uk/ Twinkle, twinkle - a step forward for radio astronomy Radio Astronomy observations are usually made interferometrically with paired antennas: interference between the signals allows astronomers to make detailed images of the sky. A big problem for radio astronomers is the difference in phase between signals received at each antenna. This can cause the radio equivalent of the 'twinkling' that can be seen in stars, particularly on a warm night, and is caused mainly by fluctuations in the water vapour content of the atmospher e. The Astr ophysics Gr oup at the Cavendish Laborator y have developed a unique technique to over come this problem by using a spectr oscopic characteristic of the water vapour itselfto correct the effects of the turbulentatmosphere. It works especially well inscenarios wher e the water vapour density is quite low , making it appr opriate for use at high-altitude sites where mostradio-telescopes are situated. The Group has received funding from European Southern Observatories (ESO) to support its development of a bespoke sensor system to test this technique and is currently putting it through its paces in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, where the system will sample hundreds of hours of atmospheric data and will be used to derive a better understanding of the effects of atmosphere on radio measurements. The system will eventually be used on the ALMA inter national radio astronomy facility situated at an altitude of 17,000 feet in the Atacama Deser t of northern Chile. The Astr ophysics Gr oup car ries out resear ch in several ar eas of radio astronomy , in par ticular the study of molecular gas clouds, galaxy evolutionand the cosmic microwave background radiation; in addition, it works on the development of optical inter ferometr y techniques. www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 5Research News A new home for Human Evolution Genetics, primate social evolution, determining how far thought processes are connected to language, how 'Out of Africa' migration patterns might look in ten years time, and putting flesh on the bones with computer-assisted technology. L-R: Mar ta Miraz\u00f3n-Lahr (Dir ector of the Duckwor th Laboratory), Alison Richard (Vice-Chancellor), Robert Foley (Head of Biological Anthropology), and Richard Leakey outside Evolutionary Studies' new building These wer e just some of the topics under discussion when leading evolutionary scholars fr om ar ound the world met in Cambridge earlier this year to celebrate the of ficial opening of the Lever hulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies. Chief among them was the r enowned anthropologist and conservationist Richard Leakey whose expeditions in Kenya's Turkana basin have yielded themost important fossil finds yet in thestruggle to understand the origins of the genus homo and early evolution. Part of the Department of Biological Anthropology, the Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies was established at Cambridge in 2000 to create aninternational centre of excellence inwhich boundaries between disciplinesdid not hinder attempts to solve scientific conundrums. Funding for their major collaborative pr oject on human evolution and development was provided by theLever hulme T rust, while the University , HEFCE and the Wellcome Trust financed the Centr e's new dedicated building in Fitzwilliam Street. In recognition of this, the Centre was renamed the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies(LCHES) in 2001 and its new home waschristened the Henry Wellcome Building. The building provides ample space for a seminar room, academic offices, PhDstudy areas, state-of-the-art laboratories, and secure storage space for the Centre's Duckworth Collection, one of the world'slargest reserves of human biologicalmaterials.The Cambridge University BotanicGarden The Cambridge University Botanic Garden holds the research and teachingcollection of living plants, which now number over 8,000 plant species, alongwith the Cory Library of 11,000 volumes, an invaluable botanicalreference source, and aHerbarium of plantsgrown in the Garden. Opened in 1846, the Garden boasts flamboyant glasshouses of tr opical plants, delicate alpines on the Rock Garden, the unique Systematic Beds,the best arboretum in the East of England and fabulous herbaceous plantings throughout. Seasonal highlights include the Dry Garden, theAutumn Garden and the exceptional Winter Garden. While the Botanic garden is first and foremost a research resource, the Garden, shop and caf\u00e9 are open to the public every day from 10am, admission is \u00a33. A programme of courses and events runs throughout the year. www.botanic.cam.ac.uk Missing genetic information key to severelearning disor ders Scientists have discover ed a genetic anomaly responsible for severe learning difficulties. Using a new technique for detailed examination of human chromosomes,researchers at the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute in Cambridge have identified amissing piece of genetic information whichthey believe may be a common cause oflearning difficulties. \"It seems that people with some forms of sever e lear ning dif ficulties have a small, but important section of chromosome 17 missing, which appears to have been deleted during meiosis, the process by which the egg and sper m are produced,\" explains Dr Charles Shaw-Smith, a Department of Medical Genetics researcherbased at the Institute. \"The deletion occurs in a region of the genome known for its complexity of organisation, and also for its associationwith neur odegenerative disor ders. However, this is the first time that theregion has been associated with learning difficulties in children.\" During meiosis, chromosomes are copied before lining up to exchange material. However , if the copying mechanism goes wrong, the chromosomes line up out of synch and the genetic material gets mis-paired. Dr Shaw-Smithlikens this to lining up the buttons and holes wr ongly on a shir t so that they don't pair up properly. It is during this process that genetic material can get deleted. www.cimr.cam.ac.uk/medgen/ 6| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006Neuroscience - breaking down the barrier s Through new collaborations, researchers are developing our understanding of the ner vous system in health and disease and identifying new treatments for neurological and psychologicaldisorders affecting people of all ages. Work at the School ofClinical Medicine and in the School of Biological Sciences fallsinto major neuroscience research themes covering basic and clinical science and their interactions. These have been extended by the creation of novel intellectual partnerships acr oss depar tments including mathematics, engineering, computer science and nanotechnology. Further expansion of the research community of neur oscientists in Cambridge will integrate understanding of neur ological disease. A major focus of Cambridge Neuroscience is the clinical application of basic r esearch to conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer'sdiseases, together with autism and Asperger's syndrome andother neurodevelopmental disorders in children. There is alsocross-disciplinary work on the molecular, neurochemical and neuropsychological effects ofdrug addiction, as well as inneuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophr enia and depr ession. There is a par ticular emphasis on cognitive enhancement thr ough a range of treatments: researchaddressing the repair mechanisms of the ner vous system following physical trauma, such as head injury or stroke, forms another major theme. The University lies at the hear t of a br oader r esear ch and industr y community with keenThe most challenging problems in clinical science and basic research will only be cracked by a concerted multidisciplinary attack. Neuroscience - the study of how the brain and nervous system functions in health and disease - is one of them. It is the target for a new collaborative initiative at the University of Cambridge called Cambridge Neuroscience.NEUROSCIENCE Neuroscience - breaking down the barriers NOBEL WINNERS AT CAMBRIDGE RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 7NEUROSCIENCE Cambridge has a strong tradition of world-leading achievements in neuroscience by scientists working across awide range of research interests, and recognised by the awardof several Nobel prizes for physiology or medicine. The 1920s saw the first analyses of neural signalling by Bryan Matthews and E D Adrian , the latter being awarded a Nobel prize in 1932. The determination of the laws that govern the movement of ions in a nerve cell during an action potential by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in the 1950s gave scientists a basic understanding of how nerve cells work and earned them the 1963 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine. Around the same time, Marthe Vogt identified noradrenaline as a transmitter in the communication between cells of the central nervous system and facilitated a revolution in the treatment of mental illness while in the 1960s David Marr and Horace Barlow made some of the early theoretical approaches to the function of neural circuitry. More recently, Sydney Brenner (working with John Sulston and H. Robert Horvitz) applied genetic analysis to cell division working in the nematode worm, C. elegans to solve the problems of nervous system development and function and was awarded the 2002 Nobel prize.interests in neuroscience, based in Cambridge and the surrounding areas. This includes the internationally recognised research centres at the Sanger Institute, the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit and the Babraham Institute as well as manybiotechnology, pharmaceutical and information technology companies.It is the formation of research links and collaborations between these centres that complements the other activities of Cambridge Neuroscience. Ther e is a clear developmental pipeline fr om basic science to applied clinical r esear ch that draws on these industry and research centre partnerships.Through this, Cambridge Neuroscience is cr eating new intellectual pr operty and products that lead to tangible deliverables ofbenefit to society . www .psychol.cam.ac.uk/pages/ research.htmlDr Andrea Brand NEUROSCIENCE Numerous disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, frontal dementia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's bycognitive impairments. Patients frequently str uggle with many everyday activities requiring concentration, memory, problem- solving and planning. The potential public health benefit of improving current treatments for cognitive disabilities in patients is undisputed. The disorder of schizophrenia provides a particularly good illustration of the potential benefitsto be had from exploring newoptions for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. It is estimated that 24 million people worldwide suffer fromschizophrenia, with the condition ranking third in terms of the global burden of neur opsychiatric conditions, following depr ession and alcohol dependence. The economic impact alone of the disor der is enor mous: in theUnited States the direct and indirect costs of schizophreniawere estimated to have been as much as $40 billion in the year 2000. In many patients withschizophrenia, cognitive difficultiesare the main factor limiting full rehabilitation - such as r eturning to work - and quality of life, particularly after the clinical symptoms have remitted. Indeed, it has been proposed that in certain patients withschizophrenia even smallimprovements in cognitivefunctions, such as enhancing the ability to adapt efficiently to new situations and to plan effectively,could help patients make thetransition to independent living outside a psychiatric institution. The relatively recent shift in clinical emphasis, away from a restrictedtargeting of the more overt psychotic symptoms of this disorder, serves to emphasize the debilitating long-ter m effects that cognitive impair ments can have, and the need to identify effectivetreatments. 8| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006Cognitive enhancement: on the frontline of neuropsychiatry Major psychiatric disorders are extremely common and their effects on behaviour, perception, emotion and cognition constitute an enormous contribution to worldwide disability .Research on cognitive enhancement at the Universityof Cambridge. A major problem in patients with schizophrenia, including thosewith first episode psychosis is thelack of cognitive flexibility in problem solving, which impacts on their ability to adapt effectively in daily life. Evidence suggests that impaired cognitive flexibility may be a marker of disease progressionsince it may deteriorate over timedespite antipsychotic medication, and relates to duration of untreated psychosis. Recentresearch shows that patients withschizophrenia given the cognitive enhancer modafinil significantly improve in terms of their cognitiveflexibility so that their performance is similar to that of healthy volunteers. In addition, it has been demonstrated that modafinil is able to improve impulsive behaviour in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and even impr oves aspects of memor y and executive functions such asplanning in healthy volunteers.Similar results have also been demonstrated in patients with ADHD and frontotemporaldementia and healthy volunteersusing methylphenidate. PET neuroimaging has shown that the improvement demonstrated with methylphenidate on executive tasks such as strategic working memory are associated withincreased efficiency in the frontal and parietal neural networkactivated during strategic working memory performance. Professor Barbara Sahakian's laboratory has had extensiveexperience with proof-of-conceptstudies in cognition enhancement. Indeed, her early r esearch demonstrated the feasibility of treating the problems in attention and concentration in patients withmild and moderate Alzheimer 's disease with cholinesterase inhibitors which have for med the basis for current treatments. More recently the laboratory has turned its focus on early detection of mildcognitive impairment (MCI) andAlzheimer's disease with a view toassessing novel cognitive enhancers and neuroprotective agents. This work will utilise clinical neuropsychology, cognitive psychopharmacology and neuroimaging to devise earlyoutcome measures to short-cut the drug development process for the pharmaceutical industry. Hopefully this will allow for noveleffective symptomatic treatments and neuroprotective agents to become available to patients much faster. Currently there are ongoing studies using modafinil to enhance cognition in neurosurgical patients, Huntington' s disease and depression. Studies about to begin include first episode psychosis, mild cognitive impairment andmild Alzheimer 's disease. A paper published recently in Science examines r esear ch to determine the effects on cognition of novel treatments for ADHD, such as Atomoxetine. This is currently an ongoing focus of PETneuroimaging studies at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Labalongside investigating non- pharmacological means ofenhancing cognition, such as neurocognitive activation. www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/ RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 9NEUROSCIENCE Professor Barbara Sahakian's laboratory has had extensive experience with proof-of- concept studies in cognition enhancement. Training tomor row's neur oscientists The Cambridge Neuroscience environment is ideally suited to these studies in the Medical Research Council (MRC) priority area of dementia and it provides an excellent training environment for young scientists and clinicians. The unique facilities available to these young scientists include the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, the Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute jointly funded by the MRC and Wellcome Trust and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit.A recent PhD student, Dr Danielle T urner, who completed her thesis, entitled'Psychopharmacology of cognitive enhancement', in 2005 was one of five young British Scientists to participate in the 'Celebrating British Science' event co-hosted by The Royal Society and the Department of Trade and Industry in March this year and was the winner of the 2005 Award from the British Psychological Society for outstanding doctoral research contributions to Psychology. Dr Turner held an MRC Research Studentship and the work was funded by the W ellcome T rust. 10| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006NEUROSCIENCE There are presently no reparative treatments for MS. One approach in the search for a treatment for MS is the use of stem cells to producehealthy new nerve cells and researchersat the Depar tment of Clinical Neurosciences are aiming to do just that. Their research involves both embr yonic and adult stem cells. Human embryonic stem cells are unique onaccount of their ability to generate all cell types of the body including nerve cells. Resear chers are also studying adult human stem cells (skin or bone marrow). One of the advantages ofadult stem cells is that they avoid therisk of rejection because they can be taken fr om the patient. Increasing evidence suggests that stem-cell-based therapies may behelpful for MS sufferers not onlybecause they may make new ner ve cells, but because stem cells can function as cellular r eservoirs of growth or nutrient factors and also modulate the body' s immune response. The latter is an important consideration for adisease such as MS that is caused to a large degree by an abnormal immune response. www.brc.cam.ac.uk/index.html Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological condition affecting young adults. Ar ound 85,000 people in the UK have MS. For some people, MS is characterised by periods of relapse and remission while for others it has a pr ogressive patter n. For everyone, it makes life unpredictable. In MS, myelin - a fatty protein that insulates axons, the long extensions of nerve cells - is damaged causing disruption to the messages to and fromthe brain. This results in a variety ofsymptoms. Repairing this damage andpreventing further permanent damage means that symptoms can be relieved and progression of disability can beprevented. Although other treatmentsexist to limit myelin damage, there are currently no therapies available to repair myelin in people with MS. Resear ch at Cambridge aims to change this. The research programme is divided into three phases: understand, test and trial. The Cambridge team feel thatphases one and two will be significantly advanced within five years and that within ten years they could be trialling a treatment. The work will be car ried out in collaboration with two other projects funded by the Multiple Sclerosis Society(www.mssociety.org.uk) at the Instituteof Neurology's magnetic resonance imaging scanner unit and the MS tissue bank at Imperial College, London. www.brc.cam.ac.uk/Ten year target for MS treatmentMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest cause of acquired neurological disability in young adults and is characterised by loss of both nerve fibres and their surrounding protective or insulating protein called myelin. Researchers at the Multiple Sclerosis Society's Cambridge Centre for Myelin Repair believe they could be trialling a treatment for multiple sclerosis within ten years.Stem cell solutions in MS research RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 11NEUROSCIENCE Modern medicine and the science of public health have improved the lot of the Common Man and his life expectancy is gradually increasing. While this is to becommended, it has several unfortunate consequences; ar guably easiest to solve is the pensions crisis, more difficult to combat is the threat of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's is the most common of these, causing up to half of all cases ofprogressive cognitive decline or dementia. Medical r esear ch in the 21st centur y seeks to understand disease at the molecular level; by identifying the molecules that cause disease, and by understanding their interactions, it is mostlikely that we will be able to design new therapeutic interventions. This discipline of molecular medicine has yielded up aspecific peptide (a small pr otein, called A ) that accumulates in patients with Alzheimer's disease. A highly or dered molecular process of A aggregation and deposition in the brain r esults in the death of neurones and the consequent loss of cognitive function. However the identification of A as a molecular culprit has not yet brought with it a raft of new drugs. Therapies aimed at preventing the production of the A peptide have been dogged with problematic side-effects and for this r eason the phar maceutical companies (we are collaborating withMerck & Co. Inc) need fresh drug targets.We are tackling this problem by making a model of Alzheimer's disease in the fr uit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) by givingthe fly the gene for the human A peptide. The flies produce the toxic peptide in their brains and sufferconsequences that resemble the human disease. As the A peptide accumulates in flies' brains we see behavioural deficits (the flies do not climb up their tubes normally) and their life span is foreshortened. We can even show thatthe flies have a poor memory - one of thecharacteristics of the human disease.Working with Drosophila allows us to perform powerful genetic experiments. In particular we have used a library of 3,000randomly-mutated fly lines to find outwhich genes when turned on, or off, can make the fly r esistant to the toxic ef fects of the A peptide. We have done this screening experiment and now have a list of 21 genes that, when turned on, protectthe fly fr om Alzheimer's disease. Some of the genes are well known and providereassurance that the fly is reflecting the known toxic processes that occur inAlzheimer's disease. Other genes are novel and it is these \"hits\" that providethe hope for new therapies. Although the fly has only 14,000 genes (as compared to the human's40,000) a survey of the literature showsthat about 75 per cent of disease-causing genes in humans have a direct insect equivalent. We are now taking ourresearch out of the fly and using cellcultur e to verify that the human equivalents of the fly genes are also effective at protecting human cells. It is our expectation that dr ugs mimicking the effects of these genes will pr ovide the next generation of therapies to halt therelentless progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Depar tment of Genetics/Cambridge Institute for 12| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006NEUROSCIENCE Movement is the only way we have of interacting with the world, whether foraging for food or attracting a waiter's attention. All communication, includingspeech, sign language, gesturesand writing, is mediated via the motor system. Taking this viewpoint, the purpose of the human brain is to use sensory signals to determine future actions. However, the effortless ease with which we move our arms, our eyes, even our lips when we speak, masks the tr ue complexity of the contr ol processes involved. This is evident when we tr y to build machines to per form human control tasks. While computers can now beat grandmasters at chess, no computer can yetcontr ol a robot to manipulate a chess piece with the dexterity of asix-year-old child. Therefore understanding brain processing could lead to dramatic improvements in technology. A major area of Wolpert's research programme is tounderstand how the brain deals with uncertainty inherent in the world and in our own sensory and motor systems. For example, our only access to knowledge about the world is through our senses which provide information that is usually corrupted by random fluctuations, termed noise, which lead to variability in our perception - tr y localising your hand when it is hidden under a table. In addition sensor y inputs may provide ambiguous information about the possible states of the envir onment - you can't tell if a teapot is full or empty just by looking at it. Professor Daniel Wolpert at Cambridge's Department of Engineering has been awarded a Wellcome Trust Programme Grant to study the computations the brain performs when contr olling our movements.A move towards understanding Professor Daniel Wolpert Moreover, when we act on the world through our motor system,the commands we send to our muscles are also corrupted by variability or noise that leads toinaccuracy in our movements. This combined sensor y and motor variability limits the precision with which we can perceive and act on the world. Society places a pr emium on those of us who can reduce theoverall variability of our sensory processing and motor outputs - financial rewards accrue to those who can r eliably hit a small white ball into a hole several hundredyards away using a long metalstick. Wolpert's group has shown that not only does society careabout reducing variability, butalso that the brain dedicates itsresources to reducing theuncertainty and variability in sensory and motor processing. To investigate how the brain reduces uncertainty the group hasdeveloped state-of-the-art roboticinterfaces and virtual realitysystems that allow r esear chers to control the environment as wellas the visual feedback that volunteers experience during skill learning tasks. Using this apparatus, the group has recentlyshown that when we learn a new task, although we are not aware of it, our brains combine our prior experience with our cur rent sensory input in an optimal fashion. The precise way in which these two sources of information are combined is given by aformula known as Bayes rule, named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th century English Presbyterianminister. The fundamental idea of Bayes rule is that probabilities canbe used to r epresent the degr ee of belief in different propositions about ourselves and the world -such as the probability that one islooking at an apple or tennis ball or that one's hand is at different possible locations when hidden under a table-top. Bayes rule specifies the optimal way that these probabilities should be updated as new information is received. Bayesian methods are currently a major component of statistics and W olpert's group is investigating to what extent they may provide a unifying mechanism by which the brain makes estimates about our own body and the world and choosesoptimal actions. http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/ wolpert/ RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 13NEUROSCIENCE Image: Nature magazine 14| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006NEUROSCIENCE Neurosurgeon Professor John Pickard is chairman and clinical director of the centre. \"Nobodyelse in the world has got the kindof facilities that we have,\" he says. \"These unique facilities have enabled a number of breakthroughs in research. We now have new insights into what happens in the brain as patients emerge from a coma, as well as which parts of the brain are affected by hydrocephalus ('water on the brain').\" Doctors are now able to predict the risk of a stroke and distinguish between different types of dementia. Researchers have also used the MRIequipment in new ways to detect how malignant brain tumours spread thr ough the brain and hence focus radiotherapy mor e appropriately. Other research breakthroughs include the identification of ar eas of the brain involved in appetite and recognition of facial emotion,leading to new concepts of how brain malfunction may lead to eating disorders and autism. Andknowledge gained at the WBIChas helped researchers designnew equipment such as thepatented scanner that combines PET with MRI, tackling the key problem of how to localise and resolve in fine detail the distribution of novel chemicals within the living brain. The Centre's mission is to advance the understanding and management of the most challenging and critically ill of patients with disorders of the brain, spinal cord and mind from initial illness throughrehabilitation to final outcome. In the last 20 years, death rates for people with acute brain injury have been almost halved because of good medical car e. And that does not mean simply keeping people alive - the proportion of sever ely disabled patients and those in a vegetativestate has fallen too. \"We are trying to improve the management of patients with acute brain injur y and to explore exciting new drugs,\" says Pickard. He believes strongly thatsociety still does not understand the need for ur gency in managing patients with all forms of 'brain attack' and the need for timely rehabilitation. For example, people should act far more quickly on signs of a minor stroke - like short periods when a person is unable to speak - because so much can be done to help. \"One of the problems we have to change is the perception of the general publicthat once you have had a stroke, there is nothing you can do about it. That is not tr ue. If you have a str oke and have treatment, you can avoid ending up in a nursing home for the next 10 or 20 years.\" he says. www .wbic.cam.ac.uk/ Professor John PickardThe Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre is a unique venture that brings together scientists and doctors from Cambridge University and Cambridge's Addenbr ookes Hospital to harness the power of state-of-the-art positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the development of new tr eatments for patients with br ain disor ders.Looking into the brain RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 15NEUROSCIENCE Anxiety disorders, such as phobias and PTSD, and also dr ug addiction ar e disor ders characterised by the persistent impact on behaviour of memories laid down earlier in the lives of affected individuals. In the case of dr ug addiction, addicts crave drugs and suffer relapse not justbecause of the alluring high of dr ugs, but also because they are compelled by the power ful, haunting memor y associations with the stimuli closely associated with their drug taking (e.g. the paraphernalia of syringes, aluminium foil, specific people)and, indeed, the environment in which theirdrug taking occurs. For many years it has been assumed that once memories are formed, they become fixed - 'consolidated' - for ever. However , recent r esear ch has shown that when memories are reactivated through recall, or simply being exposed to stimuli that elicitmemories, as in drug addicts, the memories become malleable and subject to disr uption by certain drugs. Everitt and Lee saw a long-lasting change in behaviour of rats that had had a specific gene in the amygdala - a par t of the brain where emotional memories are formed and stored - inactivated. Of course,selective inactivation of genes in the brain is not a viable tr eatment option and so cur rent research is aimed at identifying the neurochemical mechanisms in the brain that underlie memory reconsolidation and thereby drugs that can be taken systemically to inter fere with those mechanisms. The great advantage of this potential new treatment is that it could be given on very few, perhaps even one, occasion, therebyeliminating the need for chr onic dr ug therapy and all the problems that can bring. http://research.psychol.cam.ac.uk/~bcni/Imagine a one-off cure for dr ug addiction or post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) instead of today's life-long therapy regimes. Professor Barry Everitt and Dr Jonathan Lee of the MRC-W ellcome Behaviour and Clinical Neuroscience Institute have shown that they can selectively impair memories associated with drug addiction and PTSD by inactivating a specific gene in the brain.Addiction treatment - genes can playa part 16| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006NEUROSCIENCE The new research is based on a study that the Autism Resear ch Centr e lab has been engaged in for the last 10 years. That waswhen the lab star ted collecting the samples of amniotic fluid that are taken routinely in about sixper cent of pregnancies. Usuallythese samples are analysed for chromosomal abnor malities that might predict the unborn child to be at risk for conditions such as Down Syndrome. After thecytogenetics lab has tested for such chromosomal abnormalities,the fluid is stored for up to a year before being disposed of. Researchers have taken the novelstep of asking the biochemists atAddenbrooke's Hospital to testthese samples the amount ofthe 'male hormone', testosterone. Of course, testosterone is not just a male hormone, as bothsexes produce it. Male foetusesproduce twice as much as females, and it is of interest because animal research suggests it is foetal testosterone (FT) thathas an organising effect on brain development. It is well recognised that the average male brain differs fr om the average female brain, not just in overall size (males having the bigger brain)but in the size of specific structur es in the brain. In the average female brain, str uctur es like the corpus callosum (the connective tissue between the two hemispheres) is thicker, whilst in the average male brain,structures like the amgydala (thealmond-shaped brain region deep beneath the cor tex, sometimes thought of as the emotion centre) is bigger. Testosterone is produced in males by the testes, and in females by the adrenal glands,and then is taken up in the blood to the brain. It crosses the blood- brain barrier and binds toAndrogen Receptors. The regionsof the brain that differ betweenthe sexes also differ in thenumber of Androgen Receptors. The Androgen Receptors, bound with testosterone, affect neuralconnectivity in different ways. The significant issue is that even within one sex, there is substantial variation in how much FT is produced. Some girlsproduce as much as boys in the typical male range, and some boys pr oduce as little as girls in the typical female range. Thequestion the r esear ch has been testing is: does your FT levelAmniocentesis: a key to identify autism in the womb? Cambridge researchers are pioneering a new test for autism in the womb, by measuring the levels of testosterone produced by the foetus, which makes its way into the amniotic fluid. They hope to test if children who later develop autism have unusually high levels of testosterone between 12 and 20 weeks of pr egnancy . RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 17NEUROSCIENCE before you are born predict anything about your later psychological development? The answer is clear: yes it does. FT levels ar e negatively correlated with the amount of eye-contact the child makes at 12months, how fast the child isdeveloping language at 18 and 24 months, and social skills at 48 months of age. These results arefound not just when boys and girls are combined, but also whenjust boys ar e studied. FT levels ar e also positively correlated with 'narrow interests' at 48 months old. The research findings have recently been summarized in amonograph by the team ( Prenatal Testosterone in Mind , MIT Press, 2005). These studies have so far only followed children who are developing normally, but showthat individual differences insociability, language development, and narrow interests (even within the general population) are influenced to some extent byprenatal hormones. The lab isgoing on to test much largersamples (thousands, instead ofhundr eds) in or der to see if childr en with a for mal diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndromehad higher FT levels in the womb. Larger samples ar e needed because autism only occurs in about one per cent of childr en. The r elevance of this study of FT to autism is two-fold. First, it might reveal an important causeof autism, opening the door tofurther basic biomedical research investigating genetic factors influencing FT. Related to this, itmight help explain why autism is far more common among males.Second, a pr enatal test could enable intervention to begin at birth, rather than waiting for years by which time valuable opportunities for specialeducation or other kinds oflearning may have been missed. The researchers are clear that they are not undertaking this kind of research in order to lead to termination of the pregnancy,simply because autism exists on aspectrum of severity, and at the milder end of the spectrum the condition is often associated with unusual talents: for example, thenarrow interests might be channelled into fields such as mathematics or music, not just social or communication disability . www .autismr esear chcentr e. com/arc/default.asp Professor Simon Baron-Cohen 18| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006FEATURE Just as it is possible to predict Beethoven, Mozar t or Bach's appearance in a countdown of the 10 greatest composers, so the likes of Amsterdam'sConcer tgebouw , Boston' s Symphony Hall and Vienna's Musikverein are regular features of similar best-venue critical lists. But ar chitects and musicians alike are still perplexed as to what makes a great concert hall. In Venice, Deborah Howard, aProfessor of Architectural History at Cambridge, is leading research into the churches of 16th century Venice which could throw up some answers. Her focus is on how composers took account ofbuildings' acoustic properties, andhow architects of the time sought to meet contemporary musical needs. It is a project that has crossed the arts-science divide, bringing together about 40 architectural historians, musicologists and acousticians. By the time it is over,the choir of St John's College,Cambridge, and a substantial public audience will also havetaken part. Technology is being used to test the acoustic properties not just of buildingsthat ar e still standing, but remarkably, some that are not. The results will have exciting implications for how we understand the r elationship between musical performance and architectural space, not just in the buildings of Renaissance Venicebut those of other periods as well. By extension, they could come to influence how such venues are designed in the future. \"People are still trying to understand why the classic venuesfor music are so fantastic becauseacoustics is a very subjective thing,\" says Professor Howard. \"A lot of acoustics is to do with the way people feel about things. For example, a stage may be lined with wood because the public thinks that you get a better effect and the acoustics will therefore bebetter. One part of our researchwill be getting an audience to fill in questionnair es about what they think is going on. We have had an extraordinary range of responses to what people thought theacoustics wer e like in dif ferent places.\" In Renaissance Venice, music and architecture seem to have blossomed in har mony . The 16th century witnessed major advances in the sophistication, richness and religious expression of choralpolyphony, notably in the rise of coro spezzato (split choir) performances. At the same time, some of the most admired churches in the whole of the wester n canon were being erected, such as Palladio's two masterpieces, San Giorgio Maggiore and il Redentore. Architectural treatises suggest their designers boasted an advanced understanding of acoustics. But no systematic test of the buildings' acoustic properties has been carried out. The team has looked atAt risk of disappointing those aficionados who enjoy a good spat, society seems to be in general agreement about the best places to hear classical music.

In each case the building' s architectural history is investigated using archival documents, alongside musicological research into whatscores and r epertoires were available. Scientific measurements of the acoustics of each building are taken by creating and measuring noises at dif ferent frequencies. The tests should be complete in early 2007. Back in Cambridge, one of the project's most remarkable aspects has been developed using the anechoic (i.e. echo-less) chamber in the University's Faculty of Music, where the choir of St John's College has r ecorded sacred music from the period. This is now being fed into computer simulations of buildings which no longer exist or have been drastically altered sincethe Renaissance. For instance, thechurch of the Incurabili, renownedfor its excellent acoustics, wasdemolished in 1831, but audio its acoustic properties.Scientific measur ements of the acoustics of each building are taken by creating and measuring noises at different frequencies. The bilingual proceedings of the pr oject's first conference, held in September last year, have just been published as Architettura e Musica nella Venezia delRinascimento , edited by Deborah Howard and Laura Moretti. This September, the team met in Cambridge to plan more choral experiments for Easter 2007.These will form the climax of the project. From 8 to 15 April next year, St John's College Choir (pictured right), which specialises in coro spezzato performance, will carry out choral tests in the various churches, using a period repertoire. \"We want to try and see what works musically because we don't know where in the building the choirs were,\" Professor Howard explains. \"We are not trying to produce an authentic performance. We want to actually figure out what worked and what didn't. If you're doing very elaborate music in verycomplex harmonies and you haveCanaletto, View of the Grand Canal \u00a9The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge a very long reverberation time it's just a mush; you won' t hear anything.\" The singers and audiences will be invited to offer theirconclusions and any r eaders of this magazine who happen to be visiting Venice next Easter are welcome to take part. The views they put for ward may end up helping decide music's architectural future - and give those argumentative aficionadosone thing fewer to quarrel about.

And in r eal life, we may not be so far fromencountering the same kind of dilemma, as a Cambridge researcher is discovering. Social anthropologist Kathleen Richardson has carried out fieldwork in the r obotics labs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . She is inter ested in some of the same key questions that are raised in AI, such as the attachments possible between humans and machines, and what happens to human reactions to those machines when the technological object is given a child-like for m. Interestingly, at MIT, researchers have tried to giverobots specifically childish attributes and qualities. This is one approach to what is knownas \"sociable robotics\", where themachines are designed to look and behave in human-like ways. But the attempt to make themchildlike in this case is a peculiarity - and a reflection of an attempt to ensur e that the robots integrate into the \"real\"world.The term \"real\" here does not just mean the physical environment. It also r efers to the robot' s ability to interact with humans and for a human to likewise interact with it as they might another person. In otherwords, attempts are made to ensur e the robot also becomes a part of the emotionalenvironment Spielberg's filmexplored. At MIT , the r obots ar e designed with human-like faces, which mimic emotional cues andresponses. Often the relationshipbetween researcher and robotresembled that between adult and child. Indeed, the r esear chers talked about a particular robot as if it wasa child and surrounded the machines with childr en's toys and brightly colour ed objects to test their visual skills andmanipulation. By extension, thismeans that the outside viewer - the or dinar y person - was likewise being encouraged to accept the robots as somehowchildlike. What does this achieve? According to roboticists, givingthe robot this image challenges cultural preconceptions that they are somehow thr eatening creatures. If the robots look cute,the viewer relaxes his or herArtificial paradise? Our future with social robots In Steven Spielberg's 2001 box office hit, AI: Artificial Intelligence , a couple adopt a robot boy, David, as a substitute child while their own son is hospitalised with little hope of recovery. At first the mother, Monica, responds negatively to David's arrival.

RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 21FEATURE judgement of the machine. Adults also put in extra effort during interactions if they are thinking of the robot as a child and tr eating it accor dingly . In some ways this seems to challenge the conventions of current human-machine relations, in which the machine ef fectively pr ovides a service and little more. But perhaps it has less to do with what robots donow, and more with what roboticistsare building towar ds. MIT Media Lab r oboticist Cynthia Breazeal believes that robots shouldbe seen, and eventually will become,a \"companion species\", rather thanjust subjects of use. Gradually , the way in which these robots areprogrammed will be affected more and mor e by how we see one another and what we aspir e to in human relationship-building. Perhaps in that sense the themes of AI: Artificial Intelligence are not so far removed fr om the issues in robotics today. As Ray Kurzweil, computer futurologist writes: \"Beforethe next century is over, human beings will no longer be the most intelligent or capable type of entity on the planet... The primary political and philosophical issue of the next century will be the definition of who we ar e\".Does the r obot above look like a child?

Politicians and human rights activists in thesouther n African country of Malawi often talk about Malawians' 'har d-won' freedoms. Their reference is no longer to the liberation fr om the yoke of colonial rule but to the civil and politicalliberties achieved after the end ofDr Hastings Kamuzu Banda'sautocratic rule in the early 1990s. British citizens, concerned about the future of their own hard-wonfreedoms in the context of a waron terror, may wish to support Malawians' quest for freedom wholeheartedly. Yet unthinkingendorsements of 'freedom talk' can seriously curtail the scope of freedom itself. Freedom is by no means an invention of contemporary neo- liberalism, but the specific form the idea has taken in many parts of the world during the past decade is inseparable fr om neo-liberal reforms. The post-Cold War public policy envir onment has been overwhelmingly in favour of reforms that promote market economies and diminished involvement by the state in thelives of individuals. Malawi pr ovides clear evidence of how these reforms have beendriven less by national gover nments than by international financial institutions, foreign aid agencies and transnational non- governmental organisations. Onefallacy of fr eedom talk is, therefore, its failure to reflect on the cur rent situation, when for the first time in their history, Malawians hold r egular competitive multi-party electionswhile all major macro-economicdecisions affecting the country arestill made elsewhere. Further fallacies of freedom talk await those who deploy socialanthropological methods toexplore how the new situation is experienced by Malawian activists and impoverished citizens. Withoutsustained fieldwork based on competence in Malawian languages, the freedom talkspoken by eloquent human rightsactivists could become unduly persuasive. The Malawians certainly have impressive achievements to show to foreign obser vers and aid donors. Politicians' commitment to liberal democracy appear ed er ratic during the new president Bakili Muluzi's decade of r ule. Human rights organisations, often incollaboration with chur ches, halted politicians' retrogressive moves and supplied the independent media with critical voices. Yet theirFallacies of Freedom T alk in Africa Talk of \"hard-won freedom\" can be a threat to the very freedoms being celebrated. Harri Englund, a University Lecturer in the Department of Social Anthr opology , examines the experience of liberal democr acy in Mala wi over the pas t 15 years. RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 23FEATURE interest in civil and political liberties did little to focus public attention on the causes of impoverishment and exploitation among Malawi'smajority . Activists' narrow view of freedom was apparent in their translation of the concept of human rights. In Chichewa, the national language of Malawi, human rights came to bedefined as maufulu - freedoms - a concept that became the focus of non-governmental organisations' civic educationefforts among the rural andurban poor. The cry 'you can't eat freedoms!' was a common response to this civic education.It arose from chronic food shortages, an overburdened school system and salaries that were below even the pitifulminimum wage. Activists were selective in hearing what the targets of their civic education wished to express: popular claims to entitlements and obligations were precluded by activists' stubbor n insistence on human rights as individual freedoms.The material trappings of human rights activism wer e only one, albeit important, aspect of activists' reluctance to engage with the concerns ofthe poor . For example, the European Union spent millions of Eur os to support a civic education project whose district offices ran budgets that exceeded those of manygovernment departments.Decent salaries combined withinternational connections to make the non-governmental sector look particularlyattractive to young graduates.At the same time, the new talk about freedom became an aspect of the entrenchedelitism that formal, Western- style education had nourished in Malawi. Time and again,civic educators would attributepopular doubts about freedom to low-levels of education, if not outright ignorance, a condition that made civic education appear indispensable. The ability to talk about fr eedom was a mark of sophistication and cosmopolitanism, never mindits actual parochialism. While fr eedom talk imprisoned the minds of human rights activists, their personal lives could not escapethe popular concer ns their civic education usually ignored. As resourceful people, activists were firmly placed in the networks of familial obligations among the kinds of people they encountered during theircivic education. The salaries ofthe non-governmental sector supported business ventures among disadvantaged relatives,paid school fees andcontributed to wedding and funeral ceremonies in home villages. No-one talked aboutfreedom when these arrangements were negotiated, and yet it was only through such obligations that freedomcould have a meaning in the lives of the Malawian poor. Civic education defined freedom as a state of being that could be achieved once and for all. The everyday lives of activists and their r ural relations indicated that freedom could only be exer cised insituations; it came in moments. When obser ved as an aspect of Africans' everyday practices, freedom appears to have far brighter prospectsthan suggested by Afr o- pessimism, the crippling conviction that Africa' s ills are irredeemable. The challenge of identifying those pr ospects is as much intellectual as practical.The universalism of currentfreedom talk should notobscure the particular interests it serves. Nor should the general import of particularclaims, such as those made bythe Malawian poor, escape our attention. They compel a fresh recognition of obligations as asource of freedom, a recognition that may carry significance far beyond Africa.

His latest book Prisoners of Freedom: Human Rights and the African Poor has recently been published by the University of California Press.

The collection will be digitised and transcribed to improve access to the collection. Commonplace books are a cross between diaries andscrapbooks, either owned by individuals or contributed to by groups or households, providing a rich seam of personal historical information. An aspect of the challenge of digitising the collection is thatcommonplaces ar e very difficult to categorise. There is no \"typical\" example: one book may be a set ofhousehold accounts, another may contain recipes, proverbs and tables of weights and measur es; another still may be a \"poetic miscellany\", recording the favourite poems, proverbs and prayers of a group of friends. This intr oduces fur thercomplexity to the project, as commonplace books cancontain entries in variouslanguages and styles of writing so the Scriptorium will also feature an onlinepalaeography course, allowing users of the resource to acquire the skills and knowledge to understand the scripts. Voices from the past The Centr e for South Asian Studies is also engaged in an ambitious pr oject to digitise and publish access to its Oral History Archive. The value of the ar chive is without dispute. It takes the form of a collection of around 360 interviews, across 420 hours of playing time, plus transcription r unning to around 8,000 pages of text. All interviews offer first-handexperience, and because they record the views of individuals, contain little or no bias, with clear benefits to academics. The media on which the interviews ar e stor ed ar e mainly cassette and r eel-to-r eeltapes. This means that the archive in its current form isfragile - magnetic tape beingmore fragile with each use unlike printed paper - and interest in the collection isincreasing all the time. So there is a need to preserve the collection for future use, and at the same time broaden and enhance access. The challenges involved in digitizing the collection havebeen immense. Often one interviewee' s output is recorded acr oss multiple tapes, wher e blank space was available, which means that befor e output can even be transcribed, the or der of the interview must be established and transferred to digital storage. This is not even to mention the variable soundquality , and the inclusion of a number of previouslyunknown words and terms.

Genizah: embodying Jewish survival The Genizah On-Line Database (GOLD) pr oject is a major under taking for the Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit and the University Librar y. In 1898, 140,000 fragments of documents and texts recovered from the Cairo Genizah (the synagogue archive) wer e gifted to Cambridge by Dr Solomon Schechter. The items in the collection had taken less than 60 days to amass, but it has taken over a centur y topreserve, classify and house the greater part of them in away that makes them easilyavailable for study. Most of the fragments are in manuscript, and many are on vellum, which has contributed to the challenge. The collection features a wide range of content, from the sacred, to the heretical, to the mundane. It has yielded a vast array of detail, includingaccounts of social, economic and r eligious activity; the development of Jewish law; the knowledge of famousscholars, sometimes in their own hand; medieval pronunciations of Hebr ew; and rare examples of Jewish scientific, artistic and musical work mainly of the 11th and 12th centuries. The T aylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit wasestablished in 1974 amid growing inter est in the field of Jewish studies and the histor y of the medieval Meditteranean world. One of its key priorities has been to r estore the collection and to impr oveaccess to it. Since it was founded, the Unit has not only catalogued the majorityof the fragments, but also created a bibliography of scholarly works whichreference the collection. In many ways the latest phase of work is the most important, and lays the foundation for future possibilities in the field and research relating to thecollection.

The riseof broadband, still at an early stage in terms of its across-the-board availability , makes it ripe for examining the gr owth of virtual communities, in this case in China.

Toolssuch as the instant messenger , bulletin board, forum, blog or online game are becomingincreasingly impor tant to many people in this r espect. One manifestation of this is that while bulletin boards and online for ums in Eur ope or the United States ar e often small and specialised, the Chinese versions are often giant in scale, attracting millions of r egister ed par ticipants to varied topics covering all aspects of life. This, Xiaoxiao argues, suggests they provide users with a \"society of familiars\"and a ritualised r outine which helps for m a sense of belonging. A feeling of such belonging is important to Chinese people. It isalso less and less available in moder n-day China.

Meanwhile, theintroduction of a market economy since 1978 has put anend to the situation in whichstate-owned work units took charge of people' s private and public life, thereby creating a community around one centralpoint of reference and organisation. The one-child policy in China is also breaking down traditionally large families. In other words, China is changing from a society of familiars into a society of strangers . As this happens, the broadband internet is increasinglyproviding an alternative society offamiliars in a virtual setting.People feel almost compelled toreclaim a sense of belonging via alow-cost, knowledge-intensive,efficient appr oach, which the internet offers them. Xiaoxiao's film, The Story of SKS - on community constr uction, tr ust and entrepreneurship takes the argument a step further byfollowing a young couple, both active inter net users, as they build a second-hand laptop business.By developing trustedrelationships with their customers, they ar e able to fulfil an ambition of entrepreneurship - a dream shared by many young Chinese people today. British Telecom has been able to use this in particular as an insight into customer relationship- building in the Chinese service industry. From a businessperspective, the virtual society of familiars enables people to experience what makes people in China tick without actually beingin China. \"Understanding how to construct communities and build trust is key to any future servicewe might provide,\" Jeff Patmore,head of strategic university Research at BT, says. \"The unique insight this research providesallows us to make far better business decisions.\" Anthropologists have long been reflecting howanthropological knowledge and ethnographic data can be evaluated and become evidenceoutside the discipline, not least because often it takes the form of subjective experience rather than\"scientific\" fact.

BAA A viation Photo Librar y RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 29HORIZON Communications needs ar e becoming more complex, and not just because of theproliferation of fixed equipment such as wireless base stations, surveillance cameras, securitydetection equipment, display andterminal equipment. The airports of tomorrow will see more compact portableequipment, for example, locationand control equipment on a wide range of transpor tation equipment. Radio fr equency identification (RFID) tags supported by a wireless network can be used to sense, locate andtrack a wide array of objectsincluding luggage and commercial goods and can provide additional featur es such as boarding pass auto-tags, access contr ol tags and position information - so if you arebrowsing in duty fr ee when you should be boarding, the airline will know where to find you! Mobile biometric sensors will become a key part of the new airport environment providing advanced features such as iris scans, image capture andrecognition, finger printing andvideo analysis. This will improve positive identification of passengers but with lessintrusion. A range of fixed and mobile ter minals will pr ovide security measur es such as chemical detection and analysis,while other terminals will support passenger infor mation and enter tainment ser vices in transit. An intelligent, adaptive, self- organising combined wired and wireless communications system is essential in the airpor t environment, but the network envisaged will be huge and complex, supporting perhaps 10million infor mation sour ces, with an anticipated peak aggr egate data rate of the order 100 gigabits per second. This is beyond the capability of any current network and research is needed to understandthe principles upon which an effective system could be constructed. Perhaps moreimportantly, the level ofadaptation that will be required in accommodating the wired and wireless services within a singlesystem (rather than by usingmultiple separate systems as at present) will constitute a major advance in the development ofinformation systems for such complex environments. Cambridge scientists Pr ofessor Ian White and Professor Richard Penty fr om the Depar tment of Engineering and Professor JonCrowcr oft fr om the Computer Laboratory are part of a multidisciplinar y team who have been awarded \u00a3511,000 fromthe EPSRC organising, Wired/wireless Converged team also includes colleagues at UCL and Swansea University. This ambitious and multidisciplinary project is acollaborative programme and hasstrong industrial involvement and support from Laing O'Rourke who will provide the applicationcontext, shar e design experience, user r equir ements and architectural constraints, Red-M who will contribute pr opagation simulations and Ericsson who will contribute exper tise in complex communication system design.BAA and Boeing have agr eed to become involved in the project, providing exper tise fr om the user perspective. Equipment companies, including Motor ola, are involved to ensure that expert advice is received across all areaswithin the pr oject. For mor e infor mation contact Professor Richard Penty rvp11@cam.ac.ukThe intelligent airport: a new challenge inmanaging information Cambridge scientists are at the fore-front of developing a new vision for managing information incomplex environments, and air travellers of tomorrow will reap the rewards.Making sense of CCTV CCTV cameras monitor many public spaces throughout the world. However, these camerasare merely sensors, andinterpretation of theresulting video streams isnecessarily left to humanoperators, much like X-ray machines at airports. Unlike airports, the burden on CCTV operators is alr eady overwhelming. Hundreds of simultaneous videos stream mostly redundant data,making both active observation and after-the-fact data mining extremely tedious. The new challenge of localising and counting the individuals in crowd scenes is addressed by the Artificial Intelligence work of Dr Gabriel Brostow and ProfessorRoberto Cipolla of the Engineering Department's Machine IntelligenceLab. In contrast to previous methods,their appr oach handles dense crowds with just partially visible people, which in the past has lead tomissed detections or the inability to distinguish people fr om their neighbours. Instead of relying on the consistent appearance of a person' s face and limbs, the new approach looks for coherent motion.Distinctive image features, such as high-contrast pixels found on clothing or hairlines, are tracked throughout each sequence. The featur es that move coher ently in terms of velocity are automatically considered for clustering. Moving as part of a crowd, each person that passes through the camera's field of view follows their own trajectory. Those trajectories are often very similar to each other, but the new motion-driven algorithm detects subtle differences, revealing what features belong to which individuals. Through Cambridge Enterprise, this work is being prepared forlimited release as a licensableprototype that can be used with videos of crowds of people, as well as animals and insects.

As well as achieving fresh thinking in the area, the country now has a wider base of scientists investigating this crucial area of national security and the findings of the group will be discussed at theHorizon seminar in December (see page 28). The Royal Society Working Group on Detection and Decontamination ofChemical and Biological Weapons was chaired by Professor Herbert Huppert, and reported in 2004. The major r ecommendation was the need to establish a new centre to co- ordinate and direct the work ofimproving the UK's resistance to anycivilian chemical or biological incident. This has been taken up recently with the inauguration of a centr e at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire. Other recommendations included the importance of realistic exercises, the need to develop new and existing science, engineering and technology to develop robust, generic detectors of chemical and biological agents and the need to under take experimental work to deter mine how best to decontaminate people, buildings, vehicles and the wider environment. Since the r eport was published, the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) science and technology programme at the Home Office has continued the work. One of the impor tant aspects is that much of the developed knowledge could be r elevant not just to a terrorist attack but also to a major accident. The changes in Home Of fice procedur e due to the report are said to have made the response to 7/7 muchmore efficient. For fur ther infor mation contact Professor Herber t Huppert heh1@hermes.cam.ac.ukThe next generation of detection systems will be multi-modal - a variety of techniques will be used for both imaging and detection. For example a whitepowder is found on an individual, butidentifying it is another matter: it may be a nar cotic or remnants of explosive material, or it may simply be talcum powder or sugar . One of the ways to identify materials is by their absorption of electr o-magnetic energy. Different materials absorb different frequencies by molecules vibrating against each other: analysing which frequencies are absorbed enablesa range of materials, some currentlyimpossible to detect, to be identified. Cambridge's Department of Physics has been working with a University-backed company TeraView to develop semiconductors which ar e sensitive emitters and detectors of teraher tz (far infra-red) radiation. This is situated in theelectro-magnetic spectrum between infra-red (used in TV controllers) andmicrowave (used for mobile telephone communications). For example figure 1 illustrates the image of a shoe when the heel has been removed and then a razor blade, plastic explosive and ceramic blade are inserted.The teraher tz image taken when the heel is replaced clearly shows the hidden weapons, similarly figur e 2 clearly shows the presence of plastic explosive below several layers of clothing, each of which is visible. Identification at a distance is particularly important and here the absorption characteristics of a each material can be exploited to good effect. For example, the measured spectrum ofSemtex-H plastic explosive at a distanceof a metr e allows for rapid and reliable identification. Results such as this show that these sophisticated newtechnologies will make a real impact in threat identification. For further information contact Professor Sir Michael Pepper mp10000@cam.ac.ukTerahertz detection - fewer places to hide Security checks are now part of modern life, but traditional X-ray screening and metaldetectors have shortcomings - ceramic weapons and explosives are immune tometal detectors, for example. So how should government buildings, airports and transport links be protected in the future? RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 31RESEARCH SUPPORT Relationships between Cambridge and its researchcollaborators ar e being placed on a firmer footing with the launch of the Research Partner Programme (RPP). The aim of the RPP is to complement the existing links between academics and sponsors to make the r esearch life cycle as effective as possible. The structure at Cambridge can make it hard for external organisations to navigate, with the loss of potentially valuable links - the programme provides a simple frameworkfor improving information flow and enables par tners and the University to get the best from a relationship. We also hope to offer increased opportunities for interactions, funding leverage andengagement between partners to furtherthe success of r esearch projects. The programme will include free tickets to the Horizon seminar series (see below), a named contact proactively to assist interactions, tailored events for organisations, invitations to Partners events and innovation alerts. Contact Jo Ryan at Jo.Ryan@rsd.cam.ac.uk for more details.Partnerships make progress Scanning the Horizon A chance to hear about the latest research, its applications and its implications for society, Cambridge's Horizon seminar series is proving a popular way of gaining a real insight. Cambridge's Horizon seminars pr ovide participants with a first look at new developments in the most important and exciting areas of science and technology. The events bring together experts from academia and industry and provide an insight into the cutting edge of interdisciplinary research. Horizon seminars enable delegates to br oaden their knowledge by listening to the experiences of a varied group of inspiring speakers including key business leaders and prominent Cambridge academics. The speakers create a dynamic forum which provides opportunities for information exchange and meaningful networkingamong the delegates. Participating in Horizon seminars enables companies who understand the need to anticipate the latest tr ends and innovations in science and technology to sustain their business advantage and stay ahead of the competition. The next one-day seminar , Neuroscience and Society , will be held on Thursday , 12 October 2006. W orld leading academic and industr y scientists and opinion leaders will detail the latest areas of research and the future trends. In common with other confer ences in the Horizon series, the seminar will be followed by dinner in the elegant surroundings of New Hall. Much of the research outlined in thisedition of Research Horizons will be explored in greater depth at the seminar. Future seminars include Risk, Threat and Detection on Tuesday, 5 December, looking at security technology and security policy and pr oviding an insight into how a secur e futur e can be achieved for all. For more information including details of future events and how to book places online visit www.rsd.cam.ac.uk/events/horizon/fourthseries/ Guide to starting a technology company launched A comprehensive guide for anyone wanting to start a technology company has been launched by Cambridge Enterprise - and it' s proving popular outside the University too. Starting a Technology Company provides an introduction to key topics and valuable insights in starting a science- based business. The guide encompasses Cambridge Enterprise's collective skills of starting numerous businesses with University r esearchers and reflects the expertise of external contributors who have shared their business acumen and personal experience. Key points in the text ar e developed and highlighted by accompanying case studies and commentaries from experts. The guide is available for fr ee as a PDF on Cambridge Enterprise's website: www .enterprise.cam.ac.uk. New leadership at Cambridge Enterprise Teri F. Willey, an expert in commer cialising early stage technologies based on university resear ch, has joined the University as the new Dir ector of Cambridge Enterprise. W orking with University staff and students, CambridgeEnterprise licenses technology and incubates new technology-based companies. United States-born Ms Willey comes to Cambridge after spending five years as managing par tner of ARCH Development Par tners, Chicago, an early stage venture fund. Prior to this, she was VicePresident for ARCH Development Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Chicago which handles licensing and new company development. Cambridge Enterprise is one of the United Kingdom's leadingknowledge transfer offices, licensing patents and other intellectual property to existing companies, bothlarge and small as well as to spinouts for med to exploit University technology . In 2005, 40 licences and options were granted (with income from licensing exceeding \u00a32.7 million).Additionally , Cambridge Enterprise assessed 127 invention disclosur es and filed 41 new UK patent applications. Thr ee new spinouts have also been cr eated - Camfridge, Enecsys and Enval - with many mor e start-ups receiving advice andsupport. Demand for academics' technical advice added a fur ther \u00a31.5 million of consulting revenue. RESEARCH SUPPORT Research is one of the fundamental missions ofthe University, and at Cambridge there are many people who get involvedin making the process offinding and administeringresearch funding aseffective as possible. The University of Cambridge is the recipient of the largest amount of academic research income in the UK -some \u00a3270 million - and this is granted through both an annual amount flowing from the Government's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and from individual grants made to our academics.Research Services Division is the main administrative office in the University tasked with helping academics to find funds, submit bids, negotiate contracts and collect andaccount for research monies. But across the University , there are many more groups of academics and administrators who assist the pr ocess. Co-ordinating the RAE Co-ordinating the University's response to the Research Assessment Exercise is critical work, since funding based on the submission accounts for some \u00a3100million of Cambridge's income. The University's Academic Division is home to a team which pulls together theCambridge response to the RAE - thesubmission for the 2008 exer cise will be made on 31 October 2007, and theteam began work on pr ocesses for submission about a year ago. The team answer policy questions on the process, consult with the relevant people and co-ordinate the Universityresponse. The Research Policy Committee and the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research, Professor Ian Leslie, overseethe work which is then ratified by theGeneral Board (the University committee which advises on educational policy , contr ols resources and ensures high standar ds of teaching and r esear ch). Planning and Resour ce Allocation This team focus on the budgeting and financial sustainability of the University, enabling effective forward planning. Detailed 5 year budgets enable the University to take key decisions, for example, whether and when new buildings to house researchers can go ahead. The Scientific Research Infrastructure Fund (SRIF) is administered by this team, as is the fEC project (see below). Implementing Full Economic Costing (fEC) Full economic costing is a Government requir ement which aims to pr omote financial sustainability , particularly in respect ofresearch infrastructure, but also to distinguish between teaching, researchand other costs and public and non- public funding. Academic time, space costs, facilities costs and indirect costs all need to be captured much more accurately; in the past, Cambridge had used one overhead figure which was an approximation of the total costs. The introduction of fEC means that each project is costed more accurately and this represents a fundamental change in the funding methodology for research. The Full Economic Costing team, again part of the University's Academic Division implements the University's approach through robust costing andpricing methodologies applied toresearch projects across the University; the methods will also be developed further to cover other Universityactivities. Resear ch Policy Committee and the Pr o-Vice-Chancellor for Research The Research Policy Committee considers all key matters of researchpolicy and funding. Chair ed by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Resear ch, Professor Ian Leslie, the Committee considers agenda items ranging from the University IP policy to information about key sponsors. Individual Depar tments, Schools, and academics Beyond the central administration of the University, staff in every Department and School have key roles to play in the administration of research - some departments have an academic Head of Resear ch, others have senior depar tment administrators who play impor tant r oles in the process of bid submission and research funding accounting. Cambridge Enterprise Within Cambridge Enterprise, CUTS (Cambridge University TechnicalServices) Ltd exists to assist academics in their consulting activities by providing professional indemnity and liability cover . Publicising Research The Office of Communications has two Research Communication Officers -Genevieve Maul and T om Kirk - who help to publicise research undertaken at the University . World-class support for world-class research 32| RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 33RESEARCH SUPPORT Teri F. Willey Being new to the University and the country, I've been working part time in Cambridge since March to get acclimated to my new environment - and try and better understand what exactly I've gotten myself into. One of my first priorities has been to meet administrators, faculty, students, investors and companies in order to ask their advice, and so far I've only scratched thesurface. In the course of this, I've been asked a lot of questions. The most common ar e \"what\" and \"why\". What is Cambridge Enterprise? Cambridge Enterprise co- ordinates a group of on-going activities to commercialisetechnology at the University, now operating under one roof. There are three main services offered on behalf of the University that make up technology transfer at CambridgeEnterprise: 1. Consultancy - a service offered to faculty to assist with their consulting agreements with industry. 2. IPR and Licensing - a service offered to faculty, and where relevant, students, to manage intellectual property rights (IPR), find companies to commercialise IPR and conduct and manage licensing transactions to encouragecommercialisation and capture a fair return for theUniversity, departments and faculty. 3. New Ventures - a service offered to faculty and student ventures that provides advice, formation services,incubation services, seed funding and an introduction to resources within and outside the University. Why are these business ef forts at Cambridge Enterprise relevant to the University? A key part of our mission is to help University of Cambridge inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs make their ideas and concepts more commer cially successful for the benefit of society , the UK economy, the inventors and the University. This mission is further defined in other documents that call for Cambridge Enterprise to: i) aid the transfer of knowledge from the University via commercialisation; ii)aid staff and students in making their ideas more commer cially successful; and iii) produce a financial return for inventors, departments and the University . This often leads to the question that is the most dif ficult to answer and maybe the most important: what is the primary mission of Cambridge Enterprise (and how do we decide which cases and pr ojects r eceive r esour ces)? At Cambridge Enterprise, we ar e subject to a dilemma all university technology transfer programmes face. Though traditional management orthodoxy would suggest having asingle purpose, a central paradox of technology transfer is that it serves at least five purposes that ar e difficult if not impossible to unbundle: 1. Disseminating particular kinds of technology for public benefit by creating incentives to invest in the development of early stage discoveries 2. Catalysing economic development through attracting investment and creating jobs, resources and wealth 3. Provide incentives for faculty (and students) to be involved in the translational pr ocess as well as the r ecruiting and retention process 4. Creating close ties with industry to encourage its support for licensing, research funding and so forth 5.Generating income to distribute to inventors and the academy and to support further technology transfer. Ideally, the cases we manage at Cambridge Enterprise should meet all the above criteria, and there are many cases which may do so. Nevertheless, when there is mission conflict, which stakeholder wins? Which of the above criteria receives themost weight? We can strive to weight them equally and makedecisions supportive of as many of these five criteria as is reasonable. But when come down to it, we're here as a service to Cambridge academics. W ithout faculty and student innovations, we don' t have the raw materials to work with to address the other criteria. Cambridge Enterprise strives to be a trusted business resource for University faculty and students as it pertains to bringing IPR forward through commercial channels.

Or a sponsor wanting to work with the best academics in the world? RSD can help you identify sources of funding, fr om Research Councils to charities and industry. Boeing were interested in working with the University and the Partnership team in RSD helped key academics and the company find areas of long-termstrategic r esear ch for collaboration and funding. Academics in the areas ofinformation security and processing, intelligent systems and automated reasoning met with their Boeing counterpar ts to propose areas of work and three projects were initiated. Therelationship continues to develop and strengthen with other areas of work added to the benefit of both par ties. Are you ready to apply for funding to a research council or foundation? If you ar e new to drafting bids or would like some help on a complex project, RSD can help you. We will help you to draft your bid and to work through the analysis of the full economic costs of your project with you in a tailored one to one session. The Partnership Group helped academics at the Computer Lab and theDepartment of Engineering to draft andsubmit a bid to EPSRC for an integratedtransport monitoring project. This involvedfinding industrial partners who wouldsupport the bid and work as aconsortium. The bid was successful andthe project is now live.The applications team can book you a pFACTORY session, will check your application and submit it for you. They can also of fer assistance with determining staff costs and with FullEconomic Costing of r esear ch pr oposals, as well as specific advice for therequirements of your sponsor. Staff in the Department of Modern and Medieval Languages, who were new to pFACT, enjoyed a training session looking at the whole submission process.Following this, several staff have visitedRSD to go through a \"test\" application in more detail and are now ready to prepare actual proposals for theforthcoming funding round, with RSD'sassistance. Do you need help to negotiate or finalise a research contract? If you are working with a sponsor who has not agreed standard terms with theUniversity already, you'll need help negotiating a contract. RSD will negotiateand sign a contract for you on behalf of the University . The Contract Negotiation Group aim to achieve the best balance between protecting the rights of theacademic and those of the University and meeting the needs of each sponsor . The Centr e for Advanced Photonics and Electronics (CAPE) explores areas of conver gence in photonic and electr onic technologies, giving priority to pr ojects that can be exploited by collaboration with industry. The initial industry partnersare Alps Electric Company Limited, Marconi Communications Limited, Dow Corning Limited, and Advance Nanotech Inc. The Contract Negotiation Group negotiated the contracts for each project that the industr y partners fund. Have you reached the stage of having your funding awar ded? RSD will activate the grant in the University Finance System and administerit as required by the sponsor. SCOUT-03 is a major EU-funded project to provide best scientific knowledge for international assessmentson ozone depletion and climate changefor the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols. The Department of Chemistry, the Met Office, and other groups across the worldincluding Imperial College London, the University of California and the Max Planck Institute collaborate on this project.The Resear ch Finance Group has dedicated administrators for EU grantswho activate the grant in the Cambridge University Finance System and deal withany financial queries from the Cambridge collaborators or the EU sponsor . Is the r esear ch ready and able to be commercialised? Cambridge Enterprise can advise you about how to set up an enterprise and find commer cial funding. Once the grant has ended RSD will close the grant and direct you to the start of the r esear ch lifecycle if you seek continued or new funding.Conception RSD help facilitate interactions between academics and potential sponsors through events such as Horizons, Breakfast Briefings and Sponsor visits in order to help initiate research projects. Please contact us for any fur ther information: www.rsd.cam.ac.uk/ or contact Jo Ryan at Jo.Ryan@rsd.cam.ac.uk or by telephone on (+44 ) (0)1223 765404).Application Once the pr oject has been formulated we can help academics apply to appropriate research sponsors. Negotiation If the sponsor is a commercial organisation the Contract Negotiation Group within RSD then put in place a contract to govern issues such as intellectual property, publication, payment and liability. Activation Once the application has been successful and the award made or the contract finalised RSD activate the project on the University finance system.Financial Administration For the life time of the research project the RSD monitor expenditure, send invoices and reconcile the finances at the end of the project./barb5se /barb5down /barb5sw /barb5nw/barb5up/barb5ne Helping academics progress theirresearch Cambridge's Research Services Division aims to helpacademics and research sponsors work effectively together, at all stages of the research lifecycle. Whether you are an academic or apotential sponsor, do contactus - we'll do our best to helpwith any questions and toprogress your research project.Commercialisation If the project is successful and creates new intellectual pr operty Cambridge Enterprise can help academics commercialise the results. The results of the research project add to the br eadth of knowledge in the University which then encourages future investment in research. RESEARCH SUPPORT RESEARCH HORIZONS | October 2006 | 35Your way into Cambridge Research Services Division helps academics to identify, secure and manage research funding from external organizations. We identify funding opportunities through our relationships with regional, national and internationalsponsors and then support academics through every step of the awards process, from applying for a research grant and checking applications are correct, through negotiating contracts to protect the interests of academics and theUniversity , to supporting Departments in managing funding throughout the life of a research project. RSD also encourages collaboration between the University and industry, and fosters long-term research partnerships between sponsors and academics for mutual benefit.
