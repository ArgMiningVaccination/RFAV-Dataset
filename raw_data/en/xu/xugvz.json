Groundbreaking for the campus occurred two years later, and during the following year, Ogeechee Tech began offering its first credit program, Practi cal Nursing, with 25 students enrolled. Ogeechee Tech assumed the responsibi lity for offering Adult Literacy pr ograms and administering the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) examination in 1989. Faculty and staff moved into the new 75,000 square foot, $6 million state-of-the-art facility Fall of 1990, and additi onal program offerings began Spring Quarter 1991. Ogeechee Tech graduated its first class of nine Practi cal Nursing students in December of 1990. The opening of Ogeechee coincided with the expansive growth of Georgia Southern University and the Statesboro area. In addition, the establishment of the Georgia State Lottery funded Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) financial aid program in 1993 was a contributing factor in the unprecedented growth of Ogeechee Tech. Ogeechee Tech experienced a $5.5 million expansion by adding three buildings\u2014a Health Sciences Building, a Child Enrichment Center, and a Horticulture Bu ilding in 1999. During this time, Ogeec hee Tech also increased its services through the opening of the Screven Co unty Learning Center in Sylvania. Ogeechee Tech offered its first Associ ate of Applied Technology (AAT) degree program in Industrial Manufacturing Technology Winter Quarter 2000, with eight students en rolled, and in the following academic year offered AAT degrees in Accounting, Computer Information Systems, Early Childhood Care and Ed ucation, Funeral Services Education, Health Information Technology, Healthcare Management Technology, Marketing Management, Opticianry, and Secretarial Science. House Bill 1187, known as the A + Education Reform Act, en acted in 2000, changed the na mes of technical institutes in Georgia to technical colleges. On Ju ly 6th of that year, Ogeechee Technica l Institute officially became Ogeechee Technical College. Ogeechee Tech awarded its first AAT degree in December 2000 in Early Childhood Care and Education. During the summer of 2002, Ogeechee Tech opened the Evans County Learning Center. Student growth continued at Ogeechee Tech due largely to the addition of new programs, many of which are unique to DTAE, the state, and the region. These distinctive programs included certificate, diploma, and degrees in technical areas such as Funeral Service Education, Fo rensic Science Technology, and Opticianry. 8 With the opening of the Occupational Studies Building in Fall 2003, a wider variety of programs, such as Agribusiness, Wildlife and Plantation Management, Geog raphical Information Systems Technology, Veterinary Technology, Culinary Arts, and Hotel, Restaurant & Tourism Management, enabled the college to further expand its offerings. In 2004, Ogeechee Tech paid tribute to the late Senator Joseph E. Kennedy for his role in the establishment of Ogeechee Technical Institute by dedica ting the main building on campus as the Joseph F. Kennedy Building. Ogeechee Tech was established to develop the existing an d future workforce needs of the communities of Bulloch, Evans, Screven, and surrounding counties. As a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia, Ogeechee Tech continues to exist as a key player in the economic development of these communities.

Advanced Placement Admission of Transfer Students Applicants to Ogeechee Technical Coll ege (OTC) who have been previously en rolled at a postsecondary institution will be considered for admission under the following policies: Applicants who are in good standing at their previous institution may be accepted in good standing; and Applicants who are on academic probation at their previo us institution may be accept ed on academic probation. Applicants who wish to transfer to Ogeechee Tech must m eet the entrance requirements and follow the guidelines listed in the \"Program Requirements/Admission Procedures\" section of the OTC Catalog and Handbook. Applicants to Ogeechee Tech who have been previously enrolled at a postsecondary institution and desire entrance into one of the competitive medical education programs -Echocardiogra phy, Practical Nursing, Diag nostic Medical Sonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Radiologic Technology--mu st meet certain specific requirements listed in the Catalog. Students may be eligible for advanced placement throug h two methods: Transfer Credit and Exemption Credit. Transfer Credit Ogeechee Technical College recognizes previous postsecondary course work by accepting credits earned from other regionally or nationally accredited inst itutions that are applicable to the student's program of study. A student who presents credit for evaluation and transfer must be awar e that the awarding of credit does not guarantee that institutions subsequently attended by the student will accept those credits. Credit for courses at an institution accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and TCSG and whose entrance requ irements and curriculum are equivalent to or greater 20 than those of Ogeechee Tech will be considered for award of transfer credit. Credit may be granted for formal military schools, training, and corresp ondence courses in accordance with th e American Council on Education. Due to the rapid changes in technology and technical in formation, program-specific technical courses will be considered for transfer credit in a program only if the co ursework has been completed wi thin the past five years. Technical courses that were taken five years prior to ad mission to Ogeechee Tech will be evaluated for technical currency for course content by the program faculty. A stud ent desiring consideration of credit for technical courses or experiences that are more than five years old can request transfer by exemption testing. Transfer credit will be considered without restriction of co mpletion dates for those courses in academic disciplines. Examples of these courses include, but are not limited to , English, psychology, mathematics, physical sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. A student may receive credit for courses taken at another postsecondary institution if: The course taken is essentially the same equivalent course content as the cour se taken at Ogeechee Tech; The course taken has the same number of credit hours (or greater) as the course taken at Ogeechee Tech; An official transcript is on file in the student's admi ssion file from all postsecondary institutions attended; and A grade of \"C\" or higher has been earned for the course to be transferred. A grade of \"TR\" will be entered on the permanent record if credit is awarded. The hours will not be computed in the grade point average or appear on the quarterly grade repo rt. For competitive admissions programs, grades for credit earned as transfer credit will be evaluated for GPA and calculated into the GPA under consideration for program admission. A student who has attended a previous college and is eligible for transfer of credit for English and math is not required to take the COMPASS placemen t exam. However, if the student, fo r any reason, takes the COMPASS exam and scores a grade which places that student in a Learning Support class, the student forfeits evaluation of the transcript and the scores on the exam will determine plac ement, except in the case of a competitive admissions program. Transient Courses A transient student is a student who is currently enrolled at one technical college seeking to take classes at another technical college. At Ogeechee Tech, stud ents must obtain permission from th eir program advisor before applying as a transient student. To ensure course work and learning ou tcomes are at the collegiate level, Ogeechee Tech requires that associate degree level educational course work ta ken as a transient student be taken at a regionally accredited institution. However, if students cannot find the associate degree course offered at a regionally accredited college, they must request a \"Faculty Credentials Form\" be sent from the Regist rar's office at Ogeechee Tech to the Registrar of the host institution. Grading procedures for transien t students are the same as for traditional students. Therefore, the transient student's grade will be sent from the host school to Ogeechee Tech (home school) for recording of the grade upon completion of the course. The grade becomes a part of the student's permanent record. The hours will be computed in the grade point average and will appear on the student's transcript. Armed Services Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the American Council on Education (identified in th e Council's publication: Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services). Credit will be given on the basis of individual evaluation. Credible military experience must closely correspond to cour se(s) in the Ogeechee Tech curriculum in content and competencies. Foreign Earned Credit Credit may be awarded based upon an ev aluation performed by an independent evaluation service. Applications are available in the Admissions Office. The Registrar will make the final decision regarding the award of transfer credit. Grade points will not be assigned to transfer credit. 21 Residence Requirements for Degree/Diploma Ogeechee Technical College requires that a minimum of twen ty-five percent (25%) of the coursework of a particular program of study be completed at Ogeechee Tech to be granted an award. Secondary School Articulation Ogeechee Tech is required to establish articulation agreem ents with interested area high schools to ensure that students receive course credit when established competencies have been achieved. Formal Articulation Agreement - Ogeechee Tech requires formal written agreements with interested area high schools that give credit based on competencies achieved in selected courses. Validation of Credit - Ogeechee Tech will validate student competencies before awarding articulated credit for competencies learned in high school through one of the following processes: holding the credit in escrow until the student enrolls at Ogeechee Tech and completes one quarter of study successfully; holding the credit in escrow until the student enrolls at Ogeechee Tech and completes a desi gnated course successfully; or administering the final examination/exemption examination for the course to be articulated. Transferability of Credit - Ogeechee Tech honors local arti culation agreements statewide when students move from one area of the state to another. Local articulation agreements between Ogeechee Tech and secondary schools shall determine the length of time students have to use arti culated credit processes. 22 23 CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY Campus Securi ty .....................................................................................

Such disposition shall be final, and there shall be no subsequent proceedings. If the charges cannot be disposed of by mutual consent, th e Judicial Advisor may later serve in the same matter as the judicial body or a member thereof. At the accused student's discretion, a hearing shall be held before either the Judicial Advisor or the Judicial Bo dy (Technical College Student Discipline Committee). All charges shall be presented to the accused student in written form. A time shall be set for a hearing, not less than five nor more than fifteen (15) business days after the student has been notified. Maximum time limits for scheduling of hearings may be extend ed at the discretion of the Judicial Advisor. Hearings shall be conducted by the Judicial Advisor or Judicial Body according to the following guidelines: Hearings normally shall be conducted in private; Admission of any person to the he aring shall be at the discretion of the judicial body and/or its Judicial Advisor; In hearings involving more than one accused studen t, the Chair of the judicial body may permit the hearings concerning each student to be conducted separately; The complainant and the accused have the right to be assisted by any advisor they choose, at their own expense. The advisor may be an attorney. The complainant and/or the accused is responsible for presenting his/her own case and, therefore, advisors are not permitted to speak nor to participate directly in any he aring before a judicial body; The complainant, the accused and th e judicial body shall have the privilege of presenting witnesses, subject to the right of cross ex amination by the judicial body; Pertinent records, exhibits and wr itten statements may be accepted as evidence for consideration by a judicial body at the discretion of the Chair; All procedural questions are subject to the fina l decision of the Chair of the judicial body; After the hearing, the judicial body shall determine (b y majority vote if the judicial body consists of more than one person) whether the student has vi olated each section of the Student Code which the student is charged with violating; The judicial body's determination shall be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not that the accused student violated the Student Code except in those instances where the student faces suspension or expulsion, in which case the st andard of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence. There shall be a single verbatim record, such as a tape recording, of all hearings before a judicial body. The record shall be the property of the Technical College. Except in the case of a student charged with failing to obey the summons of a ju dicial body or Technical College official, no student may be found to have violated the Student Code solely because the student failed to appear before a judicial body. In all cases, the evidence in support of the charges shall be presented and considered. Sanctions The following sanctions may be imposed upon any st udent found to have violated the Student Code: Warning: A notice in writing to the student th at the student is violating or has violated institutional regulations.

Upon graduation, the student's confidential record ma y be expunged of disciplinary actions, Technical College suspension, or Technical College expulsio n, upon application to the Judicial Advisor. In addition to the penalties outlined abov e, groups or organizations may also face: Deactivation; Loss of all privileges, including Technical College recognition, for a specified period of time. In cases heard by the judicial body (Technical College Student Discipline Committee) where the student or organization is found to have violated the Stud ent Code, the judicial body may make recommendations to the Judicial Advisor but the Judi cial Advisor shall determine and im pose the sanctions. The Judicial Advisor is not bound by the sanctions recommended by members of the judicial body. The Judicial Advisor shall notify the student(s) in writing of his/ her final decision.

Such appeals shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Judicial Advisor or his or her designee. In cases where the Technical College is the complainant, the Technical College shall have no right of appeal. Except as required to explain the basis of new evidence, an appeal shall be limited to review of the verbatim record of the initial hearing and supporting documents for one or more of the following purposes: To determine whether the original hearing was conducted fairly in light of the charges and evidence presented, and in conformity with the pr escribed procedures giving the complaining party a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence that the Student Code was violated, and giving the accused student a reasonable opportunit y to prepare and to present a rebuttal of those allegations. To determine whether the decision reached regard ing the accused student was based on substantial evidence, that is, whether the facts in the case we re sufficient to establish that a violation of the Student Code occurred. 47 To determine whether the sanction(s) imposed were appropriate for the violation of the Student Code that the student was found to have committed. To consider new evidence, sufficien t to alter a decision or other re levant facts not brought out in the original hearing, because the person appealing did not know such evidence and/or facts at the time of the original hearing.

APPLICABILITY: All technical colleges associated with the Department of Tech nical and Adult Education. III. RELATED AUTHORITY: Procedure: Unlawful Harassment and Discrimination of Students IV. DEFINITIONS: Grievable issues: Issues arising from the application of a policy/procedure to the student's specific case is always grievable. Specifically grievable are issues re lated to student advisement, improper disclosure of grades, unfair testing procedures and poor treatment of students; this is a representative list and is not meant to be exhaustive.

Business days: Weekdays that the college administrative offices are open. Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA): The staff member in charge of the student affairs division at the college. Retaliation: Unfavorable action taken, condition created, or other action taken by a student/employee for the purpose of intimidation directed toward a student because the student initiated a grievance or participated in an investigation of a grievance.

A student has 10 business days from the date of th e incident being grieved to resolve their complaint informally by approaching their instructor, dean, or an y other staff or faculty member directly involved in the grieved incident. Where this process does not result in a resolution of the grievance, the student may proceed to the formal grievance procedure. Formal Complaint Procedure: where a student cannot resolve the complaint informally, the formal grievance procedure may be used. Within 15 business days of the incident being grieved, the student must file a form al grievance in the office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (VPSA) with the following information: Name, Date, Brief description of incident being grieved, Remedy requested 52 Signed, and Informal remedy attempted by student and outcome If the grievance is against the VPSA, the student shall file the grievance in the Office of the President.

Appeal of Staff Response: If a student is unsatisfie d with the response from the VPSA the student may appeal the decision to the President of the college. The college staff has no right to appeal. A student shall file a written appeal to the Presiden t within 5 business days of receiving the response referenced in VI.B.3. The appeal will be decided based en tirely on documents provided by the student and the administration; therefore, the student must ensure that he has pr ovided all relevant documents with his appeal. At the President of the College's sole discretion, grieva nce appeals at the institution may be held in one of the following two ways: The President may review the information provided by the student and administration and make the final decision; or The President may appoint a cross-functional committee comprised of 5 members, including one chair, to make the final decision. The decision of either the President or the cross-functional committee shall be made within 10 business days of receipt by the President of the appeal. Whichever process is chosen by the President, th e decision of the grievance appeal is final. Retaliation against a studen t for filing a grievance is strictly prohibited. VI.

Registration for currently enrolled students is done via Banner Web. A registration is not complete until tuition and fees are paid. Students who receive any type of financial aid must have that aid awarded before registration is confirmed. Students will be dropped from the courses for which they have attempted to register if tuition and fees are not paid before the stated course drop date for each quarter. Registration Errors It is the student's responsibility to complete the prop er forms and procedures for registration or changes to registration and to verify that his/her schedule of classes is correct. The Registrar's Office cannot be held responsible for errors resulting from the student's failure to execute th e proper procedure or verify his/her schedule at the time he/she registers. Course Load/Full-time Student Status A student's course load is the total number of credit hou rs for the courses taken during the term. A normal full-time load for a quarter is 12 to 18 hours. A student must be registered for a minimum of 12 quarter credit hours to be considered a full-time student. Approval from the Vice President for Academic Affairs is required for a course load of more than 22 hours. Dropping/Adding Courses A student may add or drop courses during the Registration and Schedule change period. Tuition and fees for courses dropped after the first three days of each quarter are no t refundable. To add or drop a course, a student must complete a Drop/Add Course(s) Form from the Registrar's Office. 57 Students who add courses may owe additional tuition and fees. (See Fees and Expenses section) Courses dropped during this period will not appear on the student's official academ ic record and will not be calculated in the course load for financial aid purposes . Students who drop a course may be due a refund. (See Tuition Refunds) Auditing Courses A student who wishes to audit a course and receive no credit may apply as a Special Student if not already enrolled as a Regular Student. Courses taken on an audit basis will not be used for certification for Financial Aid, Social Security, or Veterans Administration educational benefits. Auditors will receive a grade of \"AU\" in the course and will not have the grade computed in the quarterly or cumulative grade point average. A student registering as an auditor is Not allowed to receive credit for the course; however, a student will be permitted to re-register for the course for credit in a subsequent quarter. Required to complete a Request to Audi t form at the time of registration. Not permitted to change from audit to credit or from credit to audit after time of registration for the course. Must pay the regular fees for enrollment as listed in the Fees and Expenses section of the catalog. Are subject to the same instructional requir ements as other students in the class. Attendance Policy Attendance and punctuality are valued tr aits in any employee; therefore, students are expected to attend all classes and be on time for each class. The student is responsible for all material presented in class and for all announcements and assignments. For financial aid reasons, attendance of all students will be officially verified the first day of classes. Students who have not been attending class may not receive financial aid or may be dropped from the class roll. Classes will begin and end at their sc heduled time. Three tardies will be counted as one absence. A student may be dropped from the class roll when his/her absences exceed 10% of the total class hours for the course. Grading System Grades are issued at the end of each quarter using the following grading system(s): For Credit: Grades Explanation Grade Points A Excellent (90-100) 4 B Good (80-89) 3 C Satisfactory (70-79) 2 D Poor (60-69) 1 F Failing (0-59) 0 WF Withdrew Failing 0 W Withdrew Not Computed WP Withdrew Passing Not Computed I Incomplete Not Computed AU Audit/Warranty Not Computed EX Credit by Exam Not Computed TR Transfer Credit Not Computed (except for competitive admission placement) AC Articulated Credit Not Computed 58 Learning Support (Institutional Credit): A * Excellent (90-100) Not Computed B * Good (80-89) Not Computed C * Satisfactory (70-79) Not Computed D * Poor (60-69) Not Computed F * Failing (0-59) Not Computed \"WF\" Withdrew Failing - After mid-term, the student was failing up on withdrawing or be ing dropped from the course. \"W\" Withdrew - The student withdrew or was dropped from the course on or before mid-term. \"WP\" Withdrew Passing - After mid-term, the student was passing up on withdrawing or being dropped from the course. \"I\" Incomplete - The grade \"I\" may be given to any student who has not completed all required work by the end of the quarter. If the required make-up work is not completed by the last day of the following quarter, the instructor will submit the Completion Form for Incomplete Grades with a grade of \"F\" for the course. When a student receives a grade of \"I\" in a course which is a prerequisite to othe r courses, the student must complete the required make-up work to determine the final grade and eligibility to enroll in subsequent courses. \"AU\" Audit/Warranty - By registering as an auditor and paying fees and tuition, the student is permitted to audit a course, with the consent of the instructor, are subject to th e same instructional requirements as other students in the class and without receiving course credit . Exceptions to this policy include certain laboratory courses and supervised work experience. \"EX\" Exempted/Credit by Exam - The student received credit for a course by successfully completing a competency examination on the coursework. \"TR\" Transfer Credit - The student transferred coursework to the Co llege from another regionally or nationally accredited college. A student may transfer up to 75% of the total credits required for the program of study. The Registrar may confer with academic deans or program in structors when determining appropriateness of transfer request but is responsible for final transfer credit approval. \"AC\" Articulated Credit - The student earned credit for coursework completed at the secondary level. The competencies are validated by holding the credit in escrow until the student completes one quarter of study successfully. Learning Support - A grade with an asterisk following is a learni ng support grade and is not be computed in a student's GPA. Grade Point Average The quarterly grade point average (GPA) is the numerical average computed by dividing total quality points (for each course, hours attempted multiplied by grade value) by total hours attempted in a quarter (see below). A cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing total qual ity points by total hours attempted at the College. Class Code Course Title Hrs Attempted Grade Grade Value Quality Points MAT 103 Algebraic Concepts 5 A 4 20 ENG 101 General English 5 B 3 15 SCT 100 Intro. Microcomputers 3 F 0 0 EMP 100 Interpersonal Relations and Prof. Development 3 C 2 6 16 41 For example: 41 Total Quality Points divided by 16 Hours Attempted equals a GPA of 2.56. 59 Work Ethics At Ogeechee Technical College, we believe it is extremely important to encourage good work habits as an integral part of the instructional program. To achieve this, every credit course at Ogeechee Tech incorporates concepts of work ethics into the course curriculu m. Desirable work traits are emphasiz ed, including attendance, character, teamwork, appearance, attitude, produc tivity, organizational sk ills, communication, cooperation, and respect. As part of the evaluation process, the student receives a work ethics grade for each course. The work ethics grades are designed to evaluate and encourage good work habits. Performance factors and indicators include, but are not limited to, quality of work, ability to follow instructions, pr oductivity, dependability, honesty, reliability, attendance and punctuality, attitude, integrity, enthus iasm, interpersonal skills, and initiative. Students receive a work ethics grade (3, 2, 1 or 0) each qu arter for each course in which they enroll. The work ethics grade does not affect the academic grade point average (GPA) of a student; work ethics grades remain separate from academic grades. Work Ethics grades are posted quar terly to the student's tran script via Banner Web. Work Ethics Descriptions: Exceeds Expectations: 3 Meets Expectations: 2 Needs Improvement: 1 Unacceptable: 0 Grade Reports Final grades are recorded by instructors and submitted to th e Registrar's Office at the en d of each quarter. Official grades are posted to the student's transcript via Banner web. Academic Appeals Ogeechee Technical College Faculty an d Administrative Staff have the righ t and responsibility to exercise professional judgment in making decisions about student performance and progress. The College is accountable for setting and maintaining standards of academic performance and is committed to ensuring students are treated fairly in regard to all matters that relate to academic performa nce and progress. A student will be provided with a fair opportunity to have decisions that ar e believed by the student to negatively impact academic performance and progress reviewed in accordance with policies and procedures established by the College. Informal If a student believes that a basis exists for appealing an academic decision regarding a grade which prevents progression in a program of study, that student should first attempt to resolve th e matter informally through discussion with the instructor who made the decision. A student has five (5) working days to discuss the academic decision. If no resolution can be reached within these five (5) working days, then the student will have another five (5) working days to discuss the concern with the Dean for Instruction. The expectation is that the difference of opin ion is to be resolved as closely as possible to the level at which it originated, and as quickly as is possible with ca reful review. It is only when a disagreement cannot be resolved through this informal process that a formal appeal of the academic decision should be made. A student may seek advice from a counselor for support and direction. Formal Once a decision has been made that the informal process has not resulted in resolution, formal procedures will begin. Written notification to the Dean for In struction must be made regarding the decision under question. The Dean for Instruction, upon completion of his/her review (course outline, documentation relate d to the student's progress, transcript, summary of events, etc.) may uphold, modify, or reverse the academic decisi on. The Dean for Instruction will notify the student, the instructor, and the Registrar (if necessary) in writin g of his/her decision with a rationale for the decision. 60 If any party believes that the decision is not fair or reas onable, the decision may be appealed to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This gives the opportunity to ensure that all necessary and relevant information, documentation, opinion, and argument are fairly presented. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is final. Repeating Courses By registering for a course fo r which the student has already received credit , a student forfeits the previous credit in that course for graduation purposes. The student's official grade for graduation purposes in the course(s) will be the last one earned on repetition. Although all grades remain on the official academic record, only the final attempt will be calculated for the purpose of meeting graduation requirements. For graduation purposes, a student must have a grad uation GPA of a 2.0 and a cumulative GPA of 2.0. A student who fails or who does not earn a grade of \"C\" or higher as required for cou rses specified in the College Catalog within two attempts will not be allowed to repeat that course for one year and will be allowed to retake a third time on a space-available basis only. Before retaking a course the third time, th e student must complete an individualized remedial program assigned by the appropriate Dean for Instruction. Academic Probatio n and Suspension Students must maintain a minimum of a 2.0 cumulative grad e point average to be in satisfactory academic standing. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 2.0 will be placed on academic probation for the next academic quarter. A student is subject to suspension for on e quarter if the cumulative gr ade point average is less than a 2.0 during the quarter enrolled on ac ademic probation. Students will be advised and counseled as to academic deficiencies and given official notifi cation of academic probation/suspen sion status. Academic probation or suspension is indicated on the student's transcript vi a Banner Web and recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Academic Transcript Request Process Students can receive an unofficial tran script via Banner Web. The first offici al transcript for a student is provided free of charge. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for each addi tional official transcript, which must be paid before the transcript is released. Transcripts will not be released externally without the student's written co nsent unless as directed by law to comply. (Transcripts will be released in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. However, every reasonable attempt will be made to noti fy the student in advance of the compli ance.) An academic transcript will be issued within three (3) business days of receiving a written request. The Academic Transcript Request form may be obtained in the Registrar's Office or on the Ogeechee Tech website. If the student is unable to come to the Registrar's Office or download the form, Ogeechee Technical College will accept written consent in the form of a letter (either mailed or faxed) from the student. Exemption Credit Credit by Exemption Examination Eligibility Ogeechee Tech provides the student an opportunit y to receive credit for courses by successfully completing an exemption examination Ogeechee Tech may allow students to exempt courses by demonstrating thorough mastery of written and/or performance tests that have be en developed locally intended to adequately demonstrate achievement of the necessary competency level. A student attempting to earn credit by examination must be accepted and enrolled in a program of study at Ogeechee Te chnical College. 61 The course must be a course or elective in the student's program of study. The student cannot take an exemption examination if he/she is currently registered for the course. A student cannot withdraw from a course and regist er to take an exemption examination within the same quarter. The student cannot take an exemption examination for a failed course or for a course in which a grade of D was received. An exemption examination can only be taken twice. The second testing will occur no sooner than 90 days following the original test. See the appropriate Dean for Instruction for a listin g of courses eligible for exemption examinations. Procedure for applying and taking the Exemption Examination The student will contact his/her advisor concerni ng the exemption examination. Upon approval, the advisor will issue the student an Applic ation for Credit by Examination form. The student must take the application to the busi ness office in Building 700 and pay a $25 non- refundable fee for the examination. The student will take the form and the receipt of pa yment to the appropriate Dean for Instruction. The Dean will send to the administering instructor the exemption application. The administering instructor will contact the student to arrange a time for the exemption examination. The examination will generally be taken during the final week of a quarter unless otherwise approved on a case-by-case basis by th e appropriate Dean for Instruction. The student must score at least a 70% on the examination to receive credit. When the exam has been completed, the instruct or will grade the exam and forward the form to the Dean for Instruction's office. The Dean will forward the results to the Registrar. The examination results, includin g the actual test, will be filed in the office of the Dean for Instruction. Recording the grade A grade of \"EX\" will be entered on the permanent record if the exemption examination is successfully completed. The hours for the exempted courses will not be computed in the grade point average or appear on the quarterly grade report. Standardized Examination Credit: CLEP (College Level Examination Program) Credit may be awarded for successful completion of any appropriate CLEP subject area examinations. Credit will be awarded ba sed on score recommendations of the council on College Level Services. Ogeechee Technical College does not offer CLEP examinations at this time. PEP - Credit may be awarded for successful completion of appropriate examinations under PEP (Proficiency Examination Program). The Proficiency Examination Program is offered by the American College Testing Service. Advanced Placement Examinations may be awarded to st udent who have taken appropriate courses (determined equivalent to courses offered at Ogeechee Technical Coll ege) in high school and achieve a high score on the Advanced Placement Examination. The Advanced Placement Examinations ar e offered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Total amount of credit allowed: Credit by examination cannot exceed 25% of the total program credit hours. Military Credit Credit may be awarded for education/training experiences in the Armed Services. Such experiences must be certified by the Guide to the Evaluation of Education Experiences in the Armed Services, published by the American Council on Education. Credit is given when the training experience closely corresponds to courses offered at Ogeechee Technical College. The maximum credit for military training may not exceed 25% of the total program. For more information, contact the Office of the Registrar at 912.486.7865 or an academic advisor. 62 Enrollment Verification Students requiring verification for insurance, loan defe rments, military I.D., past and current enrollment, and degree(s) earned can now access this information through the Self-Service program with the National Student Clearinghouse. Ogeechee Technical College has authorized the national Student Clearinghouse to provide enrollment verification certifications for students throug h its Web-based Student Self-Ser vice program. Student Self- Service enables students to print official enrollment verifi cation certifications on demand through their Banner Web account at www.ogeecheetech.edu. Instructions are located in the Registrar's Office. Verification of enrollment status is based on the number of quarter hours for which student is or was enrolled. Full- time students carry 12 or more quarte r hours, three-quarter students carry ni ne to eleven quarter hours, half-time students carry six to eight hours, and less than half-time students carry one to five hours. Withdrawals Withdrawing from a Course Since choosing to drop a course is a serious academic decisi on that may affect a student's progress towards a degree or a student's financial aid status, a student should consult with the instructor of the course, the academic advisor, and a financial aid advisor before making this decision. Withdrawing From the College If a student is considering withdrawing from the College, the student is strongly encouraged to discuss this with an advisor or a counselor before formalizing the decision , to ensure that all alte rnatives are considered. In order to withdraw officially from the College, a studen t must complete an Official Withdrawal form available from the Career and Counseling Resource Center and/or the Registrar's Office. The effective date of withdrawal is the last date the student attended or logged into his/her class. The impact withdrawal has on the student's academic record is determined on a course-by-course basis. In certain cases, the Counselor or Registrar may act on beha lf of the student in completing the withdrawal process. Typically, this would occur in cases involving death, seri ous injury or illness, or formal requests to do so. Failure to attend classes does not consti tute an official withdrawal. Students who fail to continue attending class and who do not complete an Official Withdrawal form may be awarded a WF grade by the instructor. The instructor must still report the last date the student attended or lo gged into his/her cla ss to comply with the Federal Refund Policy. Graduation Requirements In order to be eligible for graduation, a degree, diploma, or certificate student must meet all of the following requirements: Have completed all course and credit hours requirem ents as prescribed in the state standard AND/OR outlined by each department, Have achieved regular admission status, Have a graduation GPA of a 2.0 for the program of study in which they are enrolled, Have a cumulative GPA of a 2.0, Have completed at least 25% of quarter cred it hours at Ogeechee Technical College, Have satisfied all financial obligations to the college, Have completed an Application for Program of Study Completion form by the mid-term of his/her final quarter. When all graduation requirements are complete, the student will receive his/her degree, diploma, or certificate through the mail.
