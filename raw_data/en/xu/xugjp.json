Crystal Therapy The Earth is more powerful than we can comprehend and its natural elements are conduits for that energy. By tapping into the energetic power of different crystals and harnessing the unique properties within the stones, we can promote healing throughout the body, which is a process called crystal therapy. Unlock the power within these natural elements to restore balance and enhance energy flow. Crystal healing is a holistic and natural therapy that utilizes the energy stored within crystals to heal the body and mind. Every crystal and mineral is unique, from its color and shape to its texture and makeup. When placed on and around the body in specific, deliberate locations, they allow positive crystal healing energy to flow into the body as negative, disease-causing energy flows out. The crystal therapy technique uses the natural, stored energy in the elements surrounding us and channels that energy to induce deep relaxation, release stress and pain, and promote balance within the physical and spiritual bodies.

What to expect during this session All people and things have energy frequencies. Crystal healing involves using the crystal's energy to recalibrate our energy to a more high-vibrational, positive state. After a short discussion with your crystal therapy practitioner, he/she will do one or two things: 1. Recommend crystals for you to have in your room, in your hands, in your pocket to carry around, and/or to meditate with for a deeper connection. 2. Send the crystal's energy to you using reiki or shamanic distance healing for you to feel the crystal healing in real-time. Your video may be on for all or part of this session.
