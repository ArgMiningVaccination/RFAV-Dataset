Now integrated with other traditional practices such as yoga, Ayurveda was documented in the sacred historical texts known as the Vedas.1 Here we explore what Ayurveda is, alongside the benefits and diet of Ayurveda as a lifestyle choice. Ayurveda, also known as ayurvedic medicine, is a whole body healing system, which is based on the belief that there is a delicate balance between the mind, body and spirit. And that our health and [wellness](/the-health-hub/conditions/mental-health/5-reasons-it-is-important-to-look-after-your-wellbeing/) is dependent on this being in balance.2 The word Ayurveda comes from comes from the Sanskrit words for life (ayur) and knowledge (veda).3 Ayurveda works on the basis that there are three principle energies (or doshas) with are present in everyone and everything. There are no single words in English that can easily convey, this so the Sanskrit words vata, pitta and kapha are used instead.4 Interestingly, each person has a unique mix of these three doshas and one is usually stronger than the other two. It is believed that these doshas should be kept in balance, in order to avoid illness. Believed to be the most powerful of the three doshas, vata controls basic body functions such as breathing, blood flow and heart function. This dosha can be disrupted by [eating too soon](/the-health-hub/food-drink/diets/what-is-mindful-eating/) after a meal, fear, grief and staying up too late.5 Characteristics of vata include creativity and energy. People where vata is dominant usually have a slim frame. And when this is out of balance, it is thought that they may experience digestive issues, fatigue and anxiety.6 Pitta is believed to regulate all of the metabolic processes in the body, as well as body temperature and hormonal balance. Large portions of food, extreme exercise and heat are considered to disrupt this dosha.7 People who have pitta as their dominant dosha are hard-working, intelligent and decisive, with a medium physical build and a short temper. When this is out of balance, the belief is that you may experience indigestion.8 Kapha is thought to control the growth of muscles, strength in the body, stability, weight and the immune system. Sleeping during the day, eating too many sweet foods and too much salt or water can disrupt it.9 Kaphas are calm, grounded and loyal with a sturdy frame. An imbalance can cause weight gain and depression.10 There are thought to be lots of benefits to consistent use of Ayurveda. These include: A healthy diet and eating habits through Ayurvedic treatment can help to lose weight and achieve a toned body.11 What your diet will look like will depend on your dominant dosha and we will explore this more below. [Mindfulness](/the-health-hub/conditions/mental-health/mind-and-body/what-is-mindfulness/) is an important part of Ayurveda and it is the practice of focussing on how you feel in the present.
