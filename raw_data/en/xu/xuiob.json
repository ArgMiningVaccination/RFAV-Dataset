On this page Vaccine uptake by demographic The number of eligible individuals with three vaccinations who continue to their fourth vaccination is higher in older age groups Proportions of eligible people aged 18 years and over who have received four vaccinations, by age range, England, 8 December 2020 to 2 March 2023 Source: Death registrations and Census 2021 from the Office for National Statistics, National Immunisation Management Service, Hospital Episode Statistics and General Practice Extraction Service data for Pandemic Planning and Research Download this chart The number of eligible individuals with three vaccinations who continue to their fourth vaccination is higher in older age groups [Image](/chartimage?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/8668e18e) [.csv](/generator?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/8668e18e&format=csv) [.xls](/generator?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/8668e18e&format=xls) Among people aged 18 years and over, 75.8% had received at least three COVID-19 vaccinations as of 2 March 2023. Of those who had received three doses and were eligible, 77.7% had continued to their fourth vaccination. The continuation from third to fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine was highest among individuals aged 80 years and over (94.0%) and those aged between 70 and 79 years (91.9%). Younger age groups had lower continuation, with less than half of eligible individuals aged 18 to 29 years (38.6%) and 30 to 39 years (44.1%) receiving their fourth dose. Vaccination data are produced using linked data from Deaths registrations and Census 2021, National Immunisation Management Service, Hospital Episode Statistics, and General Practise Extraction Service data for Pandemic Planning and Research. Data may differ from weekly administrative vaccination data published by NHS England.

People who have long-term health issues or a disability but are not reduced at all had the highest continuation for all age groups, from age 40 years and over. Among individuals aged under 60 years, continuation to the fourth dose was lowest for those with no self-reported long-term health conditions. People reporting fair health (77.8%) were the highest proportion of people continuing from a third to a fourth vaccination; individuals in very good health (71.8%) had the lowest continuation from third to fourth dose, followed by those in very bad health (73.1%).

However, there was an increased risk of cardiac death in young women after a first dose of non-mRNA vaccines, with the risk being 3.5 times higher in the 12 weeks following vaccination, compared with the longer-term risk. There was no increased risk for young men for either vaccine type. Those who received non-mRNA vaccines were more likely to be clinically vulnerable and may be at greater risk of adverse events following vaccination than the general population. While vaccination carries some risks, these need to be assessed in light of the benefits of vaccination. The risk of death is greatly increased following a positive test for COVID-19 even in young people, and many studies show that vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalisation or death following COVID-19 infection. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with increased cardiac and all-cause deaths; the risk was higher in those who were unvaccinated at time of testing than in those who were vaccinated. Last updated: 27 March 2023 Read more about this in our [Risk of death following COVID-19 vaccination or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in young people, England: 8 December 2020 to 25 May 2022 bulletin](https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/riskofdeathfollowingcovid19vaccinationorpositivesarscov2testinyoungpeopleengland8december2020to25may2022) COVID-19 mortality rates lowest for those with at least three vaccinations Risk of death involving COVID-19 in England has been consistently lower for people who had at least a third vaccine dose or booster 21 days or more ago, compared with unvaccinated people and those with only a first or second dose. Between March and December 2022, risk of death involving COVID-19 was similar for those who had received only a first or second dose and unvaccinated people, indicating possible waning in protection from vaccination over time. However, there is more uncertainty around these estimates because of smaller populations. Non-COVID-19 mortality rates for people who have had at least a third dose or booster at least 21 days ago have been similar to those for unvaccinated people in the latter half of 2022. While these rates are adjusted for age, they are not the same as vaccine effectiveness. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people likely differ in characteristics other than age, such as health. Some deaths are expected in vaccinated people as the number who are vaccinated is high and no vaccine is 100% effective.

Around 100 people received their autumn booster in the latest seven-day period (14 to 20 March 2023). This is a decrease from the previous seven-day period (around 200 autumn boosters, 7 to 13 March 2023). The autumn booster campaign ended on 12 February 2023. All adults aged between 50 and 64 years were offered the autumn booster from 14 October 2022. Before this, boosters were being offered to residents and staff of care homes for older people, frontline health and social care workers, all adults aged 65 years and over, those aged 5 years and over in a clinical risk group, those aged 5 years and over who live with an immunosuppressed individual, and those aged 16 years and over who are carers. More information can be found in the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccines-for-autumn-2022-jcvi-advice-15-august-2022/jcvi-statement-on-the-covid-19-booster-vaccination-programme-for-autumn-2022-update-15-august-2022). This chart uses the vaccination data from the [GOV.UK Coronavirus Dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations) which includes only those aged 50 years and over. This differs to the data from [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/) which includes those aged under 50 years, for example health care workers and immunosuppressed individuals.

More older people have received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the last three months than younger people. However, the proportions in the oldest age groups have started to decline, as an increasing number of older people received their autumn booster more than three months ago now. Around six months after the start of the autumn booster rollout, the majority of those aged 80 years and over (54.3%), 75 to 79 years (55.6%), 70 to 74 years (61.9%), 65 to 69 years (60.7%) and 60 to 64 years (57.9%) last received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine three to six months ago. Adults aged 55 to 59 years (1.9%) and 50 to 54 years (2.4%) had the highest proportions of people last vaccinated in the last three months. For adults aged under 50 years, the majority of people were last vaccinated for COVID-19 at least six months ago. In those aged 45 to 49 years, 68.4% were last vaccinated at least six months ago, compared with 39.7% of those aged 75 to 79 years and 41.1% of those aged 80 years and over. This reflects younger age groups not being eligible for the autumn booster in 2022. Children aged 5 to 11 years were most likely to be unvaccinated (89.4%) and adults aged 80 years and over (3.6%) were least likely to be unvaccinated. Vaccinations for those aged 5 to 11 years who are not in a clinical risk group are optional, whereas they were recommended for other groups. This chart uses data from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS), which shows the number of people vaccinated as a proportion of the living resident population of England.

The lowest proportions of unvaccinated adults were in the White British (8.8%) and Indian (9.7%) ethnic groups. This is also reflected in rates for people aged 18 years and over receiving two or three COVID-19 vaccinations, where the lowest proportions were for those identifying as Black Caribbean (57.5% have received two vaccinations and 39.2% have received three vaccinations). Those identifying as White British had the highest proportions receiving two vaccinations (89.4%) and three vaccinations (77.6%). The proportion of adults who were unvaccinated was also higher for those: living in more deprived areas, urban areas, or social rented housing who were not born in the UK or did not have English as a main language who have never worked or are long-term unemployed who are limited a lot by a disability who identify as Muslim or as having an \"Other Religion\" who are male Last updated: 9 December 2022 Find out more in our [Coronavirus and vaccination rates in people aged 18 years and over by socio-demographic characteristic and region, England dataset ](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthinequalities/datasets/coronavirusandvaccinationratesinpeopleaged18yearsandoverbysociodemographiccharacteristicandregionengland) Nearly 9 in 10 people aged 12 years and over in the UK have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine Proportion of those aged 12 years and over who have received one, two, or three or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, UK, 10 January 2021 to 31 August 2022 Source: GOV.uk Coronavirus Dashboard Download this chart Nearly 9 in 10 people aged 12 years and over in the UK have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine [Image](/chartimage?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/0489b81e) [.csv](/generator?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/0489b81e&format=csv) [.xls](/generator?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/vaccines/0489b81e&format=xls) In the UK by the end of August 2022, of those aged 12 years and over: 93.6% had received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine 88.2% had received a second dose 70.2% had received three or more doses This chart uses the vaccination uptake data from the [GOV.UK Dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations), which shows the number of vaccinations given to people of all ages as a proportion of the population aged 12 years and over. First and second dose rates overestimate uptake. They include vaccinations given to children aged between 5 and 11 years but are shown as a proportion of the population aged 12 years and over. Rates for three or more doses underestimate uptake. Not everyone aged 12 years and over is able to receive three or more doses. Only a small proportion of people aged under 16 years who are at a greater risk from COVID-19 can receive three or more doses. However, the figures provide a reasonable estimate of the proportion of those who can get a COVID-19 vaccine that have been vaccinated.

It is estimated by comparing the risk between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, taking into account differences in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was 52.2% for a first dose for COVID-19 (between 21 March 2021 to 20 March 2022). Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for COVID-19 was 55.7% for the second dose, and 77.6% for the third dose, respectively. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 mortality was 58.7% for a first dose, 88.6% for a second dose and 93.2% for a third dose. Protection increases with the increase of doses and is high for the third dose or booster, as has been shown in previous research. While these estimates take into account many sociodemographic and health-related differences between people, some differences may remain.
