Please discuss with medical professionals to decide if essential oils are right for you. What are essential oils? Essential oils are plant extracts obtained from different parts of the plant (leaves, bark, roots, resins, flowers, fruits and seeds) through steam distillation, cold pressing or solvent extraction. Essential oils have been used throughout many cultures for thousands of years, often for their therapeutic and medicinal benefits. Different essential oils have different claims\u2014for example, lemon oil has been known to keep bacterial infections at bay, frankincense oil has been know to promote feelings of relaxation and clary sage oil has been known to improve sleep. There have been certain [ studies ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10962794/)that suggest essential oils can help improve [memory, mood, immune system, and sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27527000/) as well as have therapeutic effects in alleviating the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. However, there's not enough evidence to prove their effectiveness. Essential oils affect people in different ways. What works for one person may not work for another! How to Use Essential Oils There are a variety of different ways to use essential oils for relaxation. In aromatherapy, essential oils are often inhaled to take advantage of their soothing scents. Some people add a few drops to bathwater, diffuse into the air or apply directly on your wrist. The most common way to make use of essential oils is to inhale them. As you breathe in, the scent molecules reach thousands of receptors in your nose and travel to the [limbic system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917081/)which is part of the brain involved in motivation, emotion, learning, and memory. Traditionally, oil burners have been used to diffuse oils, but in the last few years oil diffusers have become the go-to for most people. [Essential oils can also be used for massages](https://www.thehonestconsumer.com/blog/organic-massage-oil)- to relieve muscular pain, tightness, and tension- and to tackle skin issues such as skin texture, acne, and hair loss. It's worth noting that for [topical use](https://www.thehonestconsumer.com/blog/best-organic-beard-oil), [essential oils must be diluted](https://tisserandinstitute.org/new-survey-reveals-dangers-of-not-diluting-essential-oils/)with a carrier oils like coconut oil and argan oil to prevent irritation and burning to the skin. Essential oil based sprays are another way to get the benefits of aromatherapy while filling the room with a relaxing scent. By using body care products made with essential oils this can add some relaxing scents to your skin care routine. Some people even use [essential oils as dietary supplements](https://aromaticstudies.com/can-essential-oils-be-considered-as-dietary-supplements/). If this is the route you choose to take it's incredibly important to discuss with a medical professional to make sure you're taking the oil correctly and it is good quality. How to Start Using Essential Oils With any essential oil, consistency is key. Essential oils are very powerful and need to be diluted with a carrier oil before using topically or diffusing. If you're new to essential oils it's best to start by trying one or two at first to see how your body responds. This will also help limit the risks of allergies and sensitivities. How to Buy Essential Oils You may be surprised to learn that the quality of essential oils can vary widely and it can be difficult to assess the quality even for trained aroma therapists. Being that the industry is [not regulated](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/aromatherapy-pdq#link/_52) by the Food and Drug Administration, it's pretty much a free-or-all market for suppliers. Due to the lack of regulation, quality control in the industry is also lacking and not all essential oils are created with authenticity in mind. Some brands dilute or alter pure essential oils with synthetic fillers and fragrance chemicals which can cause [unwanted side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5093181/) such as allergic reactions, headaches, hives, asthma attacks, etc. In other cases, essential oils may have been grown with toxic chemicals that can slip into the oil during processing. That's why choosing certified organic oils is a great option. The reason why choosing certified organic oils is important is because many essential oils are distilled from flowers and herbs that absorb pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals in soil. If the oils aren't properly sourced, these chemicals may still be in the product you're using. To ensure your oil isn't diluted or blended with non-organic compounds check to see if the brand is independently certified by organizations like United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). How do organic essential oils differ from other oils? The main difference between organic and non-organic essential oils is that organic producers use a farming technique that avoids or reduces the use of pesticides and fertilizers , ensuring that only clean natural substances are used on the plant. Organic producers must be able to trace their ingredients back to the original source, which is why you should look for an organic essential oil that has the USDA's organic seal or one of its international equivalents (similar logos exist in Europe and Canada). How can you tell whether an essential oil is pure or fake? One of the easy ways to ensure you're getting pure essential oils is by looking for the USDA Organic certification. If an essential oil is labeled certified Organic, it means that the oil was grown without GMO seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides or other artificial additives and has been certified by the USDA. In contrast, products only labeled as \"pure\" \"all natural\" are not regulated by the FDA and may contain artificial substances. For quality assurance look for the USDA Organic certification symbol. This ensures you get some of the best quality oils. What Are Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oils? Many companies will do their best to convince you that they are selling the \"purest\" essential oils on the market - but what does this mean? What is the difference between organic, pure and therapeutic grade? And which one should you choose? Let's break it down: Pure- This term simply means that it does not contain any other oils besides the essential oil. It doesn't mean that it didn't come into contact with pesticides, fertilizers, etc., during production and processing. Therapeutic Grade- Again...this term means nothing. There is no governing body for this term so it can be used by anyone and applied to any essential oil. Even companies that advertise their oils as [therapeutic grade](https://artisanaromatics.com/therapeutic-grade-essential-oils/)aren't always telling the truth... but don't worry, we'll explore some of the best organic essential oils in a bit! Certified USDA Organic means this brand was actually regulated by a third party. What are the benefits of using organic essential oils over conventional? Organic essential oils aren't just good for the planet, they're also a better choice for your skin and body. Many people choose to purchase organic essential oils that have been tested by a third-party company to ensure they're free from pesticides and harmful chemicals . Most organic essential oil producers support and promote sustainable farming and often use recyclable materials in their essential oil packaging. Safety: A certified organic essential oil has been scrutinized by the USDA to ensure that it has been grown without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and GMOs. Meanwhile, conventional oils might be genetically engineered or sprayed with harmful pesticides - there's no way of knowing for sure. It's especially important to choose organic when avoiding skin irritation and when looking for high quality standards. Potential Health Benefits: Since organic essential oils are grown as naturally as possible, they maintain their purity and provide the maximum benefits. On the other hand, conventional oils might be contaminated with chemicals that could compromise your health. Environmental Benefits: Organic essential oils support small-scale farmers and promote sustainable agricultural practices that heighten biodiversity. On the flip side, oils that are cultivated through conventional farming methods may end up polluting our water, air, and soils.

How to Tell When an Essential Oil Is High Quality It doesn't take a chemist to spot fake essential oils. Once you know what to look for, it can be quite easy. When browsing the different brands at the store here are some things to look out for when buying essential oils: Pricing - Extracting oils is a labor intensive and expensive process, if the price of the essential oil is unusually low compared to the market price, you might be buying a diluted formula or from a brand that lacks good manufacturing practices. Sometimes competitive prices that are suspiciously low are usually due to something in the supply chain that does not add up. Product details - A trustworthy essential oil label will include the Latin name of the oil, the country where it comes from, shelf-life and batch number. Certification: It should have a seal from a reputable third party entity like the USDA. Packaging: Quality essentials oils are sold in dark amber, cobalt or green glass bottles to protect from UV rays and degradation. Tips for Using Essential Oils Essential oils can be a great addition to daily life and self care routine. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of your essential oil experience. Store essential oils away from heat and light as this may change the properties of the oil. Also, keep them in dark glass bottles since essential oils are light sensitive. Some essential oils are okay to have out on the counter or in a cupboard but I recommend keeping them away from children and pets just to be safe. Essential oil quality varies depending on where it is bought, who makes it and how old it is. It's best to buy your oils from a reputable company to ensure quality. If buying oil that isn't certified organic, it's important to find out where the plants used in the oil were grown along with other information about how they were made. When first introducing essential oils into your routine, try using small amounts since some people can be sensitive or allergic to the oils. Start with a few drops and work your way up as you see fit. Essential oils should never be taken internally without consulting a physician first. Hopefully this guide has helped you understand the importance of organic essential oils and provided guidance as to what to look for when shopping for oils.
