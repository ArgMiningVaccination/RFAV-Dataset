DOCUMENT BUSINESS LOSS - Document lost revenues and wages. - Document mandatory closures with date/ time stamped letters. - While it's still fresh, write a narrative/timeline of the events/timing specific to your business. - Take photos/have losses verified by a 3rd party insurance/ bank etc. on a loss report. - Have copies of your bills, document overhead expenses paid - These programs are developing without precedence. Keep details straight as things change. This type of funding requires strong evidence of loss in order to ensure federal dollars are not wasted, protect against fraud, and prevent duplicating benefits. For example, if you apply to multiple grants you must apply for separate losses such that your entire loss is covered but not duplicated. Duplication will lead to recapture. To avoid this, only accept funds from one source or be up front if you have applied for multiple sources.

Trips to the grocery store may be necessary, but try to limit them and go at times when they are less busy. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after your trip. And leave the medical masks and gloves for the medical professionals\u2014we need them to care for those who are sick. Maintain distance from others while shopping\u2014and remember that hoarding supplies negatively impacts others so buy what you need and leave some for everyone else. Take-out meals and food are riskier than making food at home given the links between the people who prepare food, transport the food, and you. It is hard to know how much that risk is, but it is certainly higher than making it at home. But you can and should continue to support your local small businesses (especially restaurants and other retailers) during this difficult time by buying gift certificates online that you can use later.
