We are located in the 2E Edmonton Oilers Ambulatory Clinic, located on the second floor on the north side of the Stollery Children's Hospital. From 112th street entrance, walk straight towards the North glass elevators and go to the second floor. Cross the pedway behind the elevators and enter the Edmonton Oiler blue and orange painted entrance. From the LRT station, take the stairs up to the pedway that crosses over 114th Street. You will turn left to walk North on the second floor of the hospital. You will walk past several banks of elevators. At the end of the hall you will cross the pedway behind the elevators and enter the Edmonton Oiler blue and orange painted entrance. Check in with the front desk once you enter and they will check you in and direct you to the waiting room or a clinic room. A Clinical Allergist or Immunologist will see you to take a full health history regarding your child. Typical appointments can last between one to two hours. Come prepared with toys, water, snacks or items of comfort for your child. Before the appointment your children will be taken to get their height, weight and vital signs taken. Following the appointment you may be required to take your child to get blood work done. Depending on what test is being performed, they may need to get blood work done immediately after the appointment, or within the next few days. If you are coming from a remote community you are likely to be required to do blood work before travelling home. Newborn infants being seen because of an abnormal newborn screen will be scheduled to arrange further investigations, and to provide families with more information regarding the result. The Stollery Children's Hospital is a teaching hospital. We often have learners in our clinic so you and your child may be seen by a medical resident or medical student as part of your child's care team. "}
