That is why my Administration has fought toensure that all of our residents -whether they have been here for five generations orfive minutes -have apathway to the middle class. That iswhy we areproud thatourunemployment rate has declined 1.1% in the past year, and even more so in Wards 7 and 8. Our economy is growing, small businesses are thriving, and new amenities and services are popping up in all 8 wards. Atthe same time, not all of our residents have shared inour prosperity -and economic opportunity has not reached every corner of our city. As Mayor, I am committed to investing in our city's most valuable resources: District residents and business owners. And, I am committed to having the strongest workforce system in the country that best serves those residents and businesses. The District's Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) State Plan is our roadmap to that future. With this plan, we will overhaul a system that for too long has failed to prepare our residents for good paying jobs. DC's workforce is the envy of the nation, with 49% of residents 25 years or older holding college degrees. Yet, approximately 60,000 adults in the District lack a high school diploma or its equivalent, and an even greater number lack basic literacy and numeracy skills. This plan will bridge that divide. We will create a workforce ecosystem that is coordinated, easily accessible, customer-focused and efficient. We will better leverage the District's significant investment in workforce training, so that our taxpayer dollars are put to good use strengthening our city and keeping us on our pathway to success. A strong, well educated workforce is the key to the District of Columbia's continued economic growth. And working together, we will put more District residents on the pathway to the middle class.

Federal reforms to WIOA foster better alignment of Federal investments in job training and adult education to integrate service delivery across workforce programs. States must have an approved WIOA plan in place to receive funding for core WIOA programs. The District of Columbia is using the WIOA planning process as an opportunity to realize our vision of a coordinated, accessible and effective workforce and education system. As such, the District's plan includes core workforce and education programs as defined under the law, workforce programs at the Department of Human Services (DHS), and emphasizes our partnership with the University of the District of Columbia Community College (UDC-CC). The District's WIOA state plan was developed by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity (DMGEO), the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Opportunity (DMPED), the Workforce Investment Council (WIC), Department of Employment Services (DOES), Department of Disability Services- Rehabilitation Services Agency (DDS/RSA), Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), Department of Human Services (DHS) and the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). The Office of the City Administrator's (OCA) Office of Performance Management has also provided additional capacity and support to this core team of agencies during plan development. The plan includes three major components: (1) the type of plan, (2) a strategic elements section that includes the vision, goals and strategies for the state and (3) an operational elements section that details the necessary infrastructure, policies and activities to meet our strategic goals and support ongoing program development and coordination. The following is a summary of each of these three major elements 1.Type of Plan: The District of Columbia will be submitting a Unified Plan that will include the following workforce programs: a. WIOA Adult Program (Title I, DOES) b. WIOA Dislocated Worker (Title I, DOES) c. WIOA Youth Program (Title, I, DOES) d. Wagner-Peyser Program (Title III, DOES) e. Adult Education and Family Literacy Program (Title II, OSSE) f. Vocational Rehabilitation Program (Title IV of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, DDS/RSA) DC is also incorporating both strategic and operational planning elements with various partners including local and federal workforce programs, the University of the District of Columbia- Community College, and programs under the Department of Human Services. The District will explore moving to a combined plan in the next two to four years.42.Strategic Elements WIOA requires that all states provide an analysis of the economic conditions, workforce characteristics, and workforce development and adult education activities of our city. After conducting these analyses, the District developed a vision, goals and strategies driven by the current and anticipated trends in our economy. A summary of our findings for each subsection of the strategic elements section of our WIOA plan can be found below: a.Economic and Workforce Analysis. The District of Columbia has a strong economy with significant population growth and large-scale development, but too many residents have yet to share in the prosperity and economic growth that has occurred in much of the city. While the District has a very skilled workforce, where 49 percent of people 25 years or older have bachelor's, master's, professional school or doctorate degrees (the highest percentage in the nation and significantly higher than the national average of 25 percent); there are approximately 60,000 adults in the District who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent - about 71 percent of which are African American. These residents face significant challenges in a labor market where by 2020, 76 percent of the jobs in the District will require some form of postsecondary education (the highest portion in the country) and currently more than 60 percent of job openings require a bachelor's degree or above. While there are some employment opportunities in the District for those without a four-year degree, including in high-demand sectors such as business administration and information technology, construction, healthcare, hospitality, and security and law; the availability of jobs for individuals with lower literacy levels, individuals who do not have a high school diploma or GED, and residents who only have a high school diploma or GED are far more limited. This is due to the fact that in many cases these residents need connections to adult basic education, adult secondary education and progressive levels of education, training, and other supports to start and advance along career pathways in these areas. To address these challenges, the Workforce Investment Council (WIC) and its partners have set the following vision, goals, and strategies: b.Vision. Every DC resident is ready ,able, and empowered to discover and attain their fullest potential through lifelong learning, sustained employment, and economic security. Businesses are connected to the skilled DC residents they need to compete globally , are full participants in the workforce system, and drive the District's economic growth . Residents and businesses in all eight wards are supported by a system that includes coordinated, cohesive, and integrated government agencies and partners working to help communities thrive.5c.Goals i.System Alignment Goal: District agencies form an integrated workforce and education system that delivers coordinated, accessible, and effective workforce and education services through clearly defined roles and transitional supports throughout the provision of a continuum of services. ii.Access to Workforce and Education Services Goal: All residents, including people with disabilities and those with multiple barriers to employment, regardless of education or skill level, can access the education, training, career, and supportive services necessary to move forward in their career pathway. iii.Sector Strategies /Alignment with Business Needs Goal: The District's business community gains access to a broader pool of District residents with the skills necessary to meet their needs and advance within their organizations; and informs workforce investments and incentives that effectively match jobseekers with their needs. iv.Performance and Accountability Goal: Workforce and education services are evidence-based, high quality, and flexible in meeting individuals' needs; and District agencies will evaluate outcomes through standardized methodologies that ensure accountability and transparency. v.Supporting Our Youth: Youth have access to a coordinated, accessible education and workforce system that provides the supports needed to prepare them for postsecondary success; including education, training, and competitive employment. 3.Operational Elements The Operational Elements section identifies the District's efforts to support our vision and goals. The District must ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure, policies and activities to meet our strategic goals, implement our strategies and support ongoing program development and coordination. District agencies and partners are working to implement strategies in order to achieve the outlined goals. Work is already underway on a number of these priorities and partners are increasing their efforts as a result of the WIOA planning process. Specifically, partner agencies are doing the following in fiscal year 2016: a. Build out the District's existing Data Vault to include all workforce system partners and additional functions which, at full capacity, will serve to: i. Create a unified intake, assessment and referral mechanism;6ii. Track customer participation, performance, progress, and outcomes which leads to better data; iii. Link customers to programs and services (i.e. adult literacy, occupational literacy, digital literacy, Career Essential Boot Camps, postsecondary education, and training) funded by the relevant partners. b. Integrate the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program within the American Job Centers (AJC) system. This partnership would provide comprehensive AJC services and include specialized services for TANF customers. c. Increase representation in the community through the Workforce on Wheels Mobile One-Stop and satellite AJC offices in Wards with high unemployment. These efforts will increase access to residents who may not visit one of the four AJCs. d. Require new Adult and Family Education providers to offer integrated education and training and workforce preparation services to District residents as well as transition services towards the next step in the educational continuum. i. Require different models and levels of funding per-student than were utilized in previous years as well as a continuation and expansion of professional development and technical assistance for all WIOA providers and partners. ii. Provide a key tool through the Data Vault in facilitating and tracking a customer's referral to and receipt of services from a particular agency, provider or partner. e. Strengthen partnerships with District agencies and community based organizations that can provide barrier remediation services for our residents, such as the Department of Behavioral Health and the Department of Human Services. f. Create more meaningful opportunities for youth to pursue education and career- related goals including: i. Increase work-based learning opportunities and ensure work experiences are available that directly relate to career goals; and ii. Enhance transition services for in-school youth, particularly those with disabilities through collaboration between DDS/RSA, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) and District Public Charter Schools. g. Develop a unified business services plan with employer engagement and job development staff. This plan will align outreach efforts and ensure businesses are not overly burdened by frequent communications from multiple agencies and partners. Information gathered from employers on their hiring needs will be shared with programs to ensure we are equipping residents with the training, education, and skills they need to be employable. h. Develop Vendor Score Cards to make performance data available, accessible and transparent to ensure District funding supports programs and services offered by the highest quality providers.7i. Leverage the work of the Career Pathways Task Force to help pilot efforts that build interconnected education and training pathways to help residents advance within high-demand sectors. Performance Measurement, Assessment and Accountability The District of Columbia will assess the overall effectiveness of its workforce system through the use of the Federal performance measures as well as additional local performance measures which align to our vision and goals. The District will use these assessment results and other feedback in a number of ways to ensure continuous improvements at the state and local program levels. These include: Implementation Progress Meetings . Convened by the WIC and DMGEO, leadership from DOES, DHS, OSSE, DDS/RSA, and UDC-CC will meet monthly to review the progress of WIOA implementation and address performance with a focus on the continuous improvement and system-wide problem solving. CapStat . CapStat is the District's performance accountability program that provides deep- dive, analytical reviews of services and programs, in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government. The OCA will conduct a CapStat on the WIOA plan annually to highlight what performance areas need to be improved as well as those areas that are working well; and will also conduct quarterly CapStat meetings covering State Plan goal progress in different areas. WIC Oversight. The WIC holds quarterly board meetings to discuss topical issues and make decisions on key workforce-related items. Additionally, the WIC's Executive Committee meets monthly and acts on behalf of the WIC on more detailed policy, performance management, fiscal and administrative issues related to the local workforce investment system. These meetings are a prime opportunity to present the board with assessment results to make policy-related changes. Customer Feedback. Customer feedback is extremely important to District agencies and provides an avenue for us to learn from our residents about what we are getting right and what we need to improve upon. To date, each agency has had its own mechanism for collecting customer feedback. Now, the District will move to sharing common methods of obtaining customer feedback to be able to assess the system as a whole and ensure that high quality programs and activities and customer-service are being delivered across all programs. This will include recurring meetings with advocates and stakeholders as well as periodic updates on the progress of implementation posted on the dcworks.dc.gov site.8The District's proposed WIOA plan will serve as the roadmap as we work to transform our workforce development and adult education system over the next four years. The vision, goals, strategies and plans for implementation outlined will move the District from a set of siloed workforce programs, across multiple agencies, to a coordinated, accessible and effective workforce system wherein residents can easily access an array of high-quality services offered through various departments through seamless service delivery.9COMMONLY USED ACRONYMS ABE Adult Basic Education AFE Adult and Family Education ASE Adult Secondary Education AJC American Job Center BLS Bureau of Labor Statistics BSG Business Services Group CAEL Council for Adult and Experiential Learning CASAS Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System CFMB Commission on Fathers, Men and Boys CFR Code of Federal Regulations CFSA Child and Family Services Agency CSBG Community Services Block Grant CSOSA Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency DBH Department of Behavioral Health DCPS District of Columbia Public Schools DDS Department on Disability Services DHS Department of Human Services DME Deputy Mayor for Education DMGEO Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity DMPED Deputy Major for Planning and Economic Development DOES Department of Employment Services DSLBD Department of Small and Local Business Development DYRS Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services DV Data Vault DVOP Disabled Veteran's Outreach Program EFL Educational Functioning Level EL/Civics English Literacy/Civics Education ESL English as a Second Language EMT Emergency Medical Technician (Training) ETA Employment and Training Administration EOM Executive Office of the Mayor FS First Source FSET Food Stamp Employment and Training GED General Educational Development GLE Grade Level Equivalency GRP Gross Regional Product IEP Individual Education Plan ITA Individual Training Account JVSG Jobs for Veterans Services Grant LACES Literacy Adult Community Education System LEP Limited English Proficient LMI Labor Market Information LVER Local Veteran's Employment Representative MOA Memorandum of Agreement10MOU Memorandum of Understanding MSA Metropolitan Statistical Area NEDP National External Diploma Program NRS National Reporting System OAA Older Americans Act OAAA Office of African American Affairs OCTAE Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education OAIT Office of Apprenticeship Information and Training OCA Office of the City Administrator ODR Office of Disability Rights ORCA Office on Returning Citizens Affairs OYP Office of Youth Programs (DOES) OSSE Office of the State Superintendent of Education PCSB Public Charter School Board RFA Request for Application RR Rapid Response RRC Rapid Response Center RSA Rehabilitation Services Administration SCSEP Senior Community Service Employment Program SNAP Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math SOP Standard Operating Procedures SWOT Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats SYEP Mayor Marion S.

WIOA STATE PLAN TYPE The District is submitting a Unified State Plan. We are incorporating both strategic and operational planning elements with various partners including local and federal workforce programs, the University of the District of Columbia-Community College, and programs under the Department of Human Services. We are taking steps to build a truly integrated system and will explore moving to a Combined State Plan in the next two to four years. II. STRATEGIC PLANNING ELEMENTS (a) ECONOMIC, WORKFORCE, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ANALYSIS (1) ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE ANALYSIS (A) Economic Analysis. The Unified or Combined State Plan must include an analysis of the economic conditions and trends in the State, including sub-state regions and any specific economic areas identified by the State. This includes: On January 2, 2015, Muriel Bowser was sworn in as Mayor of the District of Columbia and promised to deliver a \" Fresh Start \" for residents. As a candidate and as Mayor, she has focused on expanding economic opportunity to residents across the District of Columbia so that more residents are able to access a pathway to the middle class. Reforming the District's workforce system is a top priority for the Bowser Administration, and the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act State Plan is the roadmap we will use to guide our reform efforts. These reforms come at a critical time in the city's history because economic growth has happened unevenly over the course of decades, leaving some residents ill equipped for the jobs available today and leaving historically overlooked communities hungry for opportunity. The District of Columbia is in the midst of significant change. Beginning in the 1950s, the District experienced a sharp, significant decrease in population that lasted into the 1990s, and witnessed an economy on the verge of collapse. In subsequent decades, both population numbers and the city's economy have climbed such that today, Washington, D.C. is the anchor of a strong and highly competitive regional economy. The city's skyline is dotted with cranes demonstrating large- scale construction projects in every Ward, including areas that had not seen significant development in decades. While the economy is thriving; thousands of District residents have not yet seen or felt the prosperity or economic growth in their families and their communities. Washington, D.C. is divided into eight Wards that have each experienced the city's economic resurgence differently. While some communities have had a front seat to job growth, economic development, and prosperity for decades, some areas have only recently seen growth, and other communities - particularly within Wards 7 and 8 located east of the river, which serves as a critical dividing line, have seen limited change. A majority of all jobs in the District are located in the downtown core, primarily in Ward 2 and immediately surrounding areas.12The District has seen significant changes to its population in the past decades. In 1998, the city's population dropped to 565,230, the lowest since before the Second World War. Today, the District of Columbia's population is steadily climbing, adding more than 1,000 residents each month. 0 F1The District's 2015 population estimate is now at 672,228, a 1.9 percent increase over the revised 2014 population of 659,836 1F2. According to the US Census Bureau, the main driver of the increase was domestic and international migration - people moving to the District from other parts of the United States, and from abroad. However, an ongoing \"baby boom\" also contributed to the increase with more than 9,400 babies born to District residents in each of the past three years 2 F3. The District's economic and population growth comes at a time when the entire nation is still reeling from the recent economic recession. The recession was felt throughout every industry and community across the U.S., but for some professions and for some areas of the country, the effects were greater. Collectively, the District of Columbia weathered the economic recession relatively well compared to similar cities across the U.S. Overall growth slowed but did not stop, and job loss was focused on a limited number of industries, such as construction, real estate, legal services, and scientific research and development. Job losses were highest in early-mid 2009, and except for a short period in 2010 when job gains were barely measurable, jobs have been increasing steadily ever since. The District of Columbia added 7,300 jobs over the one-year period from November 2013 to December 2014, with private sector employment increasing by 10,400 jobs, but public sector employment decreasing by 3,100 jobs 3F4. Since January 2015, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that the District of Columbia has added 23,500 jobs 4 F5. However, unlike the overall jobs trajectory, wages have not seen a steady climb. Average wages in the region grew steadily between 1990 and 2010, according to the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, but then fell by 3% between 2010 and 2012, and regained only half that value by the end of 2014 5 F6. Wages fell for many groups of DC residents during the recessions, and have grown unevenly since the start of the recovery 6 F7. While the highest-earning DC residents have fully recovered and now earn more than before the recession started, low-wage workers, 1US Census Bureau.

For African-American residents, wages grew just 2 percent between 2008 and 2012, a difference of just $0.38 an hour; and wages for Hispanic residents barely grew at all. Yet the typical wage for white workers rose about 9 percent. Residents without college degrees saw their wages fall in the wake of the recession. The typical wage for a resident with a high school diploma fell from about $15 per hour in 2008 to about $12 per hour in 2012. Even those with some college, but without a bachelor's degree saw wages decline from about $17 to $16 an hour. Meanwhile, wages for those with college degrees grew from $30 to $31 an hour 7 F8. Average expenses for the typical household are higher in DC than in any other metropolitan area in the country though, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 8F9. Based on an estimate from MIT, a family of four in DC would need to have two earners working full time and making an average of $20.27 an hour to meet all basic living expenses 9 F10. Below that level\u2014even for people above the federal poverty line\u2014having enough money for food and housing is often very difficult. Economic Development Strategies Due to these pervasive disparities that exist in the District of Columbia, Mayor Bowser opened the first ever Mayor's Office east of the Anacostia River and created the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity (DMGEO). DMGEO, working in close partnership with other government agencies and community stakeholders, is responsible for facilitating job creation, small business growth, and investment in the District's historically overlooked communities. This has created a culture change within District government wherein a Deputy Mayor is focused on building a skilled workforce, working with employers, and ensuring residents are better prepared for the jobs available today, as well as those on the horizon. With a strong and growing economy, the District is employing a number of targeted strategies to promote continued growth and greater economic opportunity for all residents. Several key entities drive these efforts, including the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED), the Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP), and the Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD). DMPED is charged with executing the Mayor's economic development strategy, which includes a number of priority strategies that will help build the Pathways to the Middle Class: 1. Supporting Job Creation for Residents 2. Directing Investment to Overlooked and Underserved Communities 8U.S. Census Bureau of Labor Statistics (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages), and GMU Center for Regional Analysis 9Ilana Boivie, Latest DC Minimum Wage Increase Helping Improve Families' Security, DC Fiscal Policy Institute, http://www.dcfpi.org/latest-dc-minimum-wage-increase-helping-improve-families-security (July 7 , 2015). 10Ibid.143. Producing, Preserving and Protecting Affordable Housing (HPTF, Preservation Strike Force) 4. Fostering Innovation & Entrepreneurship DMPED recognizes that resident job creation is critical for growing and diversifying the District's economy and increasing economic opportunities. Toward this end, its Business Development team helps businesses identify space, connect with financial resources, attract and retain key employees, and identify strategic alliance partners. In 2015, the team helped retain The Advisory Board Companies and Blackboard, two of DC's largest tech employers. The Advisory Board alone will produce 1,000 new jobs for District residents over the next 15 years. The Business Development team also runs the Great Streets grants program, which assists small businesses with capital improvements, so that they can thrive and expand, while also helping to revitalize commercial corridors in the District. The team also has focused on international investment, leading a trade mission to China as well as upcoming trips with regional partners to Cuba and Canada. Given the District's thriving technology sector, one of DMPED's priority areas is technology, entrepreneurship, and inclusion. DMPED has led the District's delegation to South by Southwest to highlight its strengths for startups and funders and has run a month of innovation programming in May called InnoMAYtion. Looking forward, DMPED will seek to capitalize on the District's diverse and publicly-minded workforce to drive efforts at making the District the capital of inclusive innovation. Already DMPED has led a partnership with Howard University to create the first ever inclusive tech hub. It has also commissioned a report to better understand opportunities in the space. DMPED's Real Estate Development team helps create vibrant and stable neighborhoods, rebuild retail corridors and ensure that every District investment yields real benefits for residents and local businesses. The team manages a portfolio of projects worth more than $13 billion across all eight wards ranging from small-scale neighborhood retail to the $10 billion initiative to reclaim the long- neglected Anacostia Waterfront. Under Mayor Bowser, it has been charged with helping to direct investment to underserved communities and to help produce more affordable housing. Already, DMPED has gained significant traction at its Saint Elizabeth's East Campus in the Congress Heights neighborhood of Ward 8. It has partnered with Monumental Sports and Events DC to create a 5,000 seat Sports and Entertainment Arena and with a developer to create housing, retail and commercial space. In both cases, the District is working with neighborhood residents to ensure they can take advantage of job and housing opportunities. The Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP) is a non-profit, public-private organization created by the District Government whose core purpose is to actively position, promote, and support economic development and business opportunities in Washington, DC. They work closely with public and private organizations that contribute to the District's economic ecosystem to help support business retention and attraction. WDCEP provides an array of programs and services in support of these objectives, including corporate recruitment programs, providing market intelligence to investors, educating businesses on resources and real estate opportunities, and convening public officials and private industry leaders to move deals forward.15The Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD) supports the development, economic growth, and retention of District-based businesses, and promotes economic development throughout the District's commercial districts. They provide a range of services to meet the needs of District based small businesses that are available to both start-up and existing businesses. DSLBD's services include one-on-one counseling, workshops and seminars for both entrepreneurs and small business owners, as well as microlending opportunities and financial resources for small business owners seeking free or low-cost capitol to improve enhance, or expand their businesses. The agency also manages the District's Certified Business Enterprise program, which provides procurement preferences for District-based businesses and helps facilitate their inclusion in economic development projects. (i) Existing Demand Industry Sectors and Occupations. Provide an analysis of the industries and occupations for which there is existing demand. Government continues to be the District's largest industry, accounting for about 237,000 jobs and 41 percent of the gross regional product (GRP). Nonprofit organizations, while not officially classified as an industry and instead spread across a range of sectors, accounted for over 125,000 jobs or 26 percent of total employment in 2012. Professional and Business Services is the second largest local industry with about 165,000 jobs, and Education and Health Services is the only other industry that employs over 100,000 people. The Leisure and Hospitality and Other Services (Except Public Administration) each account for over 70,000 jobs. Chart 1: Employment by Industry Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics. 16(ii) Emerging Demand Industry Sectors and Occupations. Provide an analysis of the industries and occupations for which demand is emerging. While Government employs a plurality of District-based workers, hiring demand in this sector has been limited due to sequestration and other budget factors at the federal level. Since 2010, private sector growth has been relatively steady, while public sector employment has decreased or remained flat (see chart below). Chart 2: Public vs. Private Sector Employment in DC Among private sector industries, broken down into more targeted industry sectors, Professional, Scientific and Technical Services is projected to be the fastest growing industry, with 22,258 new employees over the next ten years; and Healthcare and Social Assistance, Educational Services, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services, Other Services (Except Public Administration), and Accommodation and Food Service all projecting significant growth (see chart Growing Sectors: 2015-25 Change in Jobs (2015-2025)Chart 3: DC Top 10 Fastest Growing Sectors: 2015-2025 Source: DC Department of Employment Services An analysis of job postings in the District during 2015 confirms that most of the positions employers are hiring for fall into the sectors identified above. Additionally, 14 of the 20 most listed occupations from January - October 2015 required a bachelor's degree or above to qualify for the position (see table below). While the District boasts a rate of educational attainment higher than the national average, the majority of unemployed District residents (69%) do not have a bachelor's degree (more analyses on this issue included in workforce analysis below). Additionally, many positions that do not typically require a bachelor's degree are filled by individuals that do have that credential in the District. For example, major occupations in the District such as Registered Nurses, Paralegals and Legal Assistants, and Web Developers that do not typically require a bachelor's degree nationally typically do require a bachelor's degree in DC 10F11. 11BW Research Partnership (2014).

The previous list only accounted for specific occupations, rather than groups of occupations within sectors that may be linked through Career Pathways, and did not take into account different skill level and experience requirements between occupations. To produce its updated High-Demand Sectors and Occupations List, WIC staff worked with DOES's Office of Labor Market Research and Information (OLMRI) to develop a data set that 12District of Columbia Workforce Investment Council, District of Columbia High-Demand Sectors and Occupations List, September 2015 (Washington, DC).19captured projected job openings for each occupation over the next ten years in the District, weighted it to account for openings at or above the District's Living Wage (currently $13.85 per hour), and sorted occupations into both sectors and skill levels (denoted by groupings of the US Department of Labor's Job Zone categories, which account for relevant education, training, and experience needed to gain entry to an occupation). WIC staff analyzed this data set to identify key sectors 12F13and occupations for jobs generally requiring an Associates' degree or less, which are most likely to have entry points and advancement opportunities for adult learners and better match the characteristics of the District's unemployed residents and those not currently participating in the workforce (see workforce analyses that follow). Analyses were shared broadly with a number of government stakeholders and other workforce experts to produce a final list of high-demand sectors and occupations within those sectors. The WIC's High-Demand Sectors and Occupations List identifies five key high-demand sectors 1. Business Administration and Information Technology, 2. Construction, 3. Healthcare, 4. Hospitality, and 5. Security and Law. Of the more than 12,000 average annual job openings in the District that do not typically require a bachelor's degree and/or other advanced education and training, about 76 percent of all entry- intermediate skills openings and 87 percent of middle skills openings fall within the five high- demand sectors after weighing for Living Wage criteria as follows: Table 2: Job Openings by High Demand Sector Sector Percent of All Entry- Intermediate Skill Openings (Living Wage Weighted)Percent of All Middle Skill Openings (Living Wage Weighted)Total Average Annual Job Openings (excluding High Skill) Business and Information Technology27% 49% 13Sectors were established using the U.S. Department of Education's Career Clusters, rather than North American Industry Classification codes as used for industry information above. This criteria was used to help group relevant career pathways within each defined sector to better inform education and training activities. 14Note that the District's First Source Law and robust apprenticeship system and requirements in this sector create additional demand and opportunities for District residents that is not captured in labor market data for this sector.20Source: DC Department of Employment Services, Office of Labor Market Research and Information, with supplemental analyses by DC Workforce Investment Council staff. See full District of Columbia High-Demand Sectors and Occupations List document for complete methodological details and criteria. The WIC has designated these five sectors as high-demand in the District, indicating that federal workforce funding from the US Department of Labor should be aligned with these areas, as well as most other workforce programming focused on individuals at the middle skills level or below - including job training and apprenticeship, and education up to the associate degree level. Within these five sectors, 86 occupations have been designated as high-demand in the District, which account for the majority of all average annual openings in each area (see Appendix 2 for full list). (iii) Employers' Employment Needs. With regard to the industry sectors and occupations identified in (A)(i) and (ii), provide an assessment of the employment needs of employers, including a description of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required, including credentials and licenses. The District's business and industry employment needs were assessed through the Workforce Investment Council, the Career Pathways Task Force, and with additional research. The Career Pathways Task Force, a locally mandated task force convened by the WIC, worked within the WIC's high-demand sector and occupation framework to assess relevant career pathways opportunities and formulate recommendations on next steps. To help inform the Task Force's work, the WIC, with assistance from the DC Chamber of Commerce and Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL), convened focus groups of business stakeholders in each of these sectors and administered a follow-up survey to capture key information and facilitate the development of specific pathways that may be implemented in the District. Additional research by CAEL and WIC staff was incorporated with this feedback and data to produce career pathway profiles that reflect findings from these efforts. The table below is a career pathway profile for hospital occupations in the Healthcare sector that was produced by CAEL. All of the career profiles by high-demand sector and job in the family can be found in Appendix 3.21Table 3: Healthcare Career Profiles 22Ongoing business engagement efforts will inform investments and coordination efforts that meet business needs in these areas and connect jobseekers to opportunities. The District is also considering additional labor market intelligence efforts to help identify the best opportunities for investments and employer outreach. (B) Workforce Analysis: Must include analysis of current workforce including individuals with barriers to employment, as defined in section 3 of WIOA (individuals with disabilities among other groups) (i) Employment and Unemployment Data and (ii) Labor Market Trends More than 773,000 people worked in the District as of October 2015, with 583,300 employed in the private sector and 234,700 employed in government 14F15. The unemployment rate for the D.C. Metropolitan is 4.2 percent (November 2015) and the District of Columbia's citywide unemployment rate is 6.6 percent (November 2015). This snapshot of the District of Columbia's employment and unemployment data only begins to tell the story of a rather unique jurisdiction when it comes to employment and workforce. The District's workforce is made up of commuters from outside D.C., highly educated individuals, a surplus of skilled job opportunities, and relatively few jobs with low- barriers to entry. The District of Columbia is also located within a highly competitive regional economy. A few things are notable about the District of Columbia's workforce. For one, a majority of people who work in the District do not live in the District. Of the 773,000 people working in the District as of October 2015, about 72 percent of all of these workers live outside of the District - primarily in Maryland and Virginia 15F16. District residents compete with residents from Maryland and Virginia, as well as candidates from across the country interested in working in the Nation's capital, for available job opportunities. Of those District residents in the labor force, a majority (66 percent) stay within the city limits for their job and most other employed residents work in the jurisdictions immediately bordering the District. The Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Division unemployment rate was 4.2 percent as of November 2015 16F17, which is lower than the national average. However, the District of Columbia's seasonally- adjusted 17 F18unemployment rate is above the national average, at 6.6 percent District-wide, though it 15D.C.

The table below illustrates this positive trend during 2015, including significant increases in total DC resident employment and reductions in total unemployment. Chart 4: DC Employment and Unemployment Numbers Source: Department of Employment Services, Office of Labor Market Research and Information However, the average unemployment rate masks significant variation by age, race and ward. Rates range from a low of 4.3% in Ward 3 to a high of 14.7% in Ward 8 18F19, with African Americans as a group having a higher unemployment rate of up to 17% 19 F20. Youth aged 16-24 had an average unemployment rate of 23% in 2014, which is far above the overall average 2 0F21. Behind these unemployment numbers is another important fact: an average of almost 47% of unemployed D.C. residents were unemployed for 6 months or more during 2012 and 2013, placing them in the category of \"long-term unemployed.\" And 83% of these long-term unemployed were African American, though they represented only 40% of the overall labor force. The difference in the regional, local, and Ward-specific unemployment rates demonstrates that many within the District of Columbia are not benefitting from the region's economic prosperity. WIOA defines a number of categories of barriers to employment, with individuals falling under these categories typically facing 19Department Of Employment Services Office of Labor Market Research and Information 20American Community Survey (2014 one-year estimate). 21Ibid.24greater challenges in attaining positive labor market outcomes. This Plan serves as an opportunity to identify these challenges and work to enhance the level of support provided to individuals listed in the sections below. Workforce Profiles by Target Populations This plan is designed to create a system that serves every DC resident, but in particular those who have faced significant barriers to employment. The following profiles look at target populations including: 1. Youth 2. Youth in Foster Care 3. Long-term unemployed residents and displaced homemakers 4. Low income individuals, including TANF and SNAP Participants 5. Individuals with disabilities 6. Older individuals 7. Returning citizens 8. Individuals who are English language learners or facing substantial cultural barriers 9. People experiencing or with recent histories of homelessness 10.Individuals who have low levels of literacy Youth Young people in the District face difficulties in their transition into adulthood due to their level of education and the availability of employment options. During the period December 2014 November 2015, the District's overall unemployment rate was 7. 1%, while the unemployment rate for individuals aged 16-19 was 26.7%, and 12.7% among 20-24 year olds. 21 F22 In addition to the unemployed, there is an estimated 5,500 youth (6.8% of the total youth aged 16- 24) that want to work but have not looked for work recently due to issues such as transportation and child care. 22F23A 2013 analysis revealed that there were approximately 8,300 disconnected youth defined as out of school, out of work, and living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level in Washington, D.C., making up 9 percent of the total population of 16 to 24-year-olds. Of these 8,300 young people: 22 percent were aged 16-19; 78 percent were aged 20-24; 54 percent were male; 46 percent were female; The vast majority (more than 90 percent) were African-American; and 22Current Population Survey (CPS), December2014 - November 2015, 12 month moving average, U.S. Census Bureau & U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 23Ibid.2525 percent had less than a high school education, 59 percent had a high school diploma or its equivalent, and 16 percent have attended some college. 23 F24 In addition to the need to build workforce experience among the District's youth, such as with the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) and on-the-job training opportunities, there is a continued need to focus as well on basic skill remediation, high school equivalency attainment, and the attainment of postsecondary credentials, certifications, and/or degrees that are connected to regional demand and recognized by industry. To this end, the District is taking action to ensure youth have access to the workforce, education, and barrier remediation services they need to enter and move forward in a career pathway. The SYEP, expanded to include youth ages 22-24 in 2015 and 2016, is an extremely popular program with more than 12,000 participants each summer. Starting this year, the District is creating new efforts to leverage the interest in this program to engage and enroll youth in the more comprehensive WIOA-funded year round programs and the locally funded Career Connections program. Youth in Foster Care In FY15, 226 18 to 21-year-old youth were in the District's foster care system, operated by the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA). Of that population 55 were employed in full time positions and 55 in part-time positions, for an overall employment rate of 48.6%. 24F25 In the first quarter of FY16, 211 18 to 21 year olds were in the foster care system. Thirty-nine of these youth were employed in full time positions and 50 in part-time positions, for an overall employment rate of 42%. For the 122 not employed, plus an additional 31 youth who recently aged out of the foster care system, 105 participated in some type of educational programming, including high school, GED preparation, college, special education, or vocational programming. An additional 16 youth are enrolled CFSA's Career Pathways programs which assist them in pursuing substantive vocational training leading to employment, and six others are enrolled in DOES's Career Connections program. Long-term unemployed individuals/Displaced homemakers The number of residents who can and should be working may well be higher than the unemployment figures indicate. Unemployment only counts those who are \"in the labor force.\" An average of 34,000 D.C. residents were not considered to be in the labor force during 2012 and 2013, and are not counted as \"unemployed\" because they are discouraged from or marginally attached to the labor force. An additional average of 12,500 workers were working part time during 2012 and 2013, but wanted to work full-time. They were prevented from working full-time by economic factors, including unfavorable business conditions, inability to find full-time work, and seasonal declines in demand. Additionally, almost 47% of unemployed D.C. residents were unemployed for 6 months or more during 2012 and 2013, placing them in the category of \"long- 24American Community Survey micro data, 2013 1-year estimates 25Child and Family Services Agency26term unemployed.\" And 83% of these long-term unemployed were African American, though they represented only 40% of the overall labor force. Low income individuals, including TANF and SNAP Participants According to a recent analysis by the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, there were 18,000 more residents living in poverty in DC in 2014 than in 2007, before the recession. 25F26About 110,000 residents were living in poverty in 2014, 18 percent of all residents, while the poverty rate for African Americans was 26 percent. An estimated 57,000 residents lived in deep poverty \u2014 with less than $12,000 a year in annual income for a family of four, almost unchanged from 2007 to 2014. Of those experiencing deep poverty, 14,000 are children. Poverty is also largely concentrated in several areas of the District, with about 33 percent of residents in Wards 7 and 8 living in poverty, while no other Ward's poverty rate was more than 15 percent and Ward 3 registered a low of 8 percent 26 F27. While the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program has a sixty (60) month limit for most recipients to receive benefits, the District had not adopted this policy, maintaining families' TANF benefits using local funds. After redesigning the TANF program five years ago, the District also adopted a time limit. With benefits gradually stepped down over the last four years for families who had received benefits in excess of 60 months, effective October 1, 2016, families who have received benefits for greater than 60 months will, absent an extension or exemption, no longer be eligible for TANF benefits. The Mayor has proposed extending this benefit to October 1, 2017 as part of the FY 2017 proposed budget which is currently under review by the DC Council.28The proposed extension to October 1, 2017 would provide additional time for the District to legislate and implement the most effective and supportive programmatic changes. The current policy could result in upwards of 6,000 families transitioning off TANF, and needing to secure employment and workforce development supports from other avenues. As of September 2015, 7,492 individuals receiving TANF had been receiving benefits for more than 48 months, meaning they have 1 year or less of assistance remaining before reaching the 60-month time limit. Of those 7,492 individuals, only 536 (7%) of them are currently employed, and less than half, only 252 of these employed participants, are earning a living wage (above the DC living wage requirement of $13.85 per hour for 2016). Additionally, of those currently employed, only 184 have total monthly earnings of over $600. In order to gain family sustaining income, TANF participants often need additional education or certifications to leverage higher wages. Based on data taken at the time of assessment, only 22% of all TANF participants had reported completing post-high school education29. These figures highlight the District's unique challenge in helping TANF 26Wes Rivers and Claire Zippel, While DC Continues to Recover from Recession, Communities of Color Continue to Face Challenges, DC Fiscal Policy Institute, http://www.dcfpi.org/while-dc-continues-to-recover-from-recession- communities-of-color-continue-to-face-challenges (September 18, 2015). 27Ibid. 28The DC Council will vote on the proposed budget in May and June 2016 29TANF Comprehensive Assessment (TCA) Data, self-reported assessment administered by the Department of Human Services as part of the eligibility process to receive TANF. FSET participants are now also assessed using the same TCA tool.27participants connect to workforce opportunities; and are a key driver in the District's efforts to better coordinate services for these individuals. An estimated 39,000 low-income District households received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) assistance in 2014, and these individuals also face unique workforce challenges. Though a majority of these households had at least one working family member, 31.4% of these households had no family member that had been employed in the past 12 months\u2014compared to 9.2% among the households not receiving food stamp assistance. 28 F30DHS also administers SNAP, and inter-agency coordination efforts will also help us better serve this population. Individuals with disabilities, including youth who are individuals with disabilities According to data provided by the Department on Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA), 37,300 District residents between the ages of 21-64 (roughly 8.8 percent) are estimated to have a disability. Of those individuals, it is estimated that 32.8 percent are employed, compared with 76.9 percent of people without disabilities. However, only 16.1 percent of people with disabilities are employed on a full-time/full year basis, compared with 61.1 percent of people without disabilities. The poverty rate for working age people with disabilities is 38.5 percent, compared with a poverty rate of 14.7 percent for people without disabilities, both of which are the second highest rates in the nation. 29F31 The prevalence of youth ages 16-20 with disabilities is 8.3 percent, or approximately 3,600 individuals. The District does not track employment rates for youth with disabilities, specifically. However, DDS/RSA works closely with the Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE) to coordinate transition services for students with disabilities. One of the factors OSSE tracks is post-school outcomes for students with disabilities. This tracks the percentage of youth who have exited school, who had individualized education plans while in school, and the activities these youth are engaged in one year after exit from school. Based on the information provided for the largest education agency in the District, which includes DCPS and dependent public charter schools, only approximately 30 percent of students with disabilities are engaged in post-secondary education, training or employment one year after exiting from high school in the District 30F32. Older individuals The unemployment rate among workers 55-64 also outpaces the District's overall rate, with 8.3% unemployment between December 2014 and November 2015 among 55-64 year olds compared with 7.1% overall. Among those 65 and older the unemployment rate falls to 4.7%, though this rate does not reflect the many workers that have given up searching for new work in a job market\u2014and job search landscape\u2014that has changed dramatically over the last two decades. Between December 2014 and November 2016, there was an estimated 3,600 workers monthly 55 years and 30U.S. Census Bureau, 2014 American Community Survey, 1-Year estimate. 31U.S. Census Bureau, 2013 American Community Survey 32 http://osse.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/FFY%202013%20APR%20Public%20Reporting .pdf28older that want a job, but have not searched for work recently. 31F33Employment for older individuals has increased significantly over the last few years after decreases during the recession (see chart below). Chart 5: DC Average New Hires Source: US Census Bureau, Quarterly Workforce Indicators As of last quarter of 2014, approximately 71 percent of all employees age 55 or older who were in the District workforce were employed in one of five economic sectors: Professional and Business services, Educational and Health Services, Public Administration (including both Federal and State Government), Leisure and Hospitality, and Other Services (excluding Public Administration) 32 F34. Job growth is also concentrated in these sectors, and many of the positions in these areas require a bachelor's degree or above. This suggests that higher-skilled older workers will continue to have access to employment opportunities in these sectors. However, many older individuals in the District have lower levels of education attainment, particularly those served through the District's Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), in which approximately 29 percent of participants in PY 2011 had less than a high school diploma or equivalent, and an additional 40 percent had only a high school diploma or equivalent 33 F35. 33Current Population Survey (CPS), December 2014 - November 2015, 12-month moving average, U.S. Census Bureau & U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 34U.S. Census Bureau, Local Economic Household Dynamics (LEDH), 2010 35Department Of Employment Services, Office of Labor Market Research and Information5,1944,888 4,3824,7504,9315,1335,4885,733 1,812 1,7501,5291,750 1,8282,0792,3532,605 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000 2012 2013 20140000 55-64 65+29Returning Citizens (Preferred District term for Ex-Offenders referenced in law) Returning citizens face unique challenges in the District's labor market, and their numbers, while declining, are significant. Over the last several years, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency's (CSOSA) (the federal agency providing supervision of adults on probation, parole, and supervised release in the District) supervision of returning citizens in the District of Columbia has been decreasing. On average, CSOSA supervised approximately 12,000 returning citizens each day in FY 2015, and a total of 18,427 unique offenders over the course of the fiscal year. In FY 2015, a total of 6,461 returning citizens entered CSOSA supervision; 4,869 men and women sentenced to probation by the Superior Court for the District of Columbia and 1,592 individuals released from incarceration in a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility on parole or supervised release. Of the supervised population on September 30, 2015, 62 percent were employable and, of those, 49 percent were employed 3 4F36. In FY 2015, the percentage of CSOSA's total supervised population revoked to incarceration decreased to 8.1 percent; inclusive of continuing annual reductions experienced since FY 2006. The reduction of recidivism is a significant public safety accomplishment. A key challenge faced by returning citizens is their below average levels of educational attainment, as evidenced by the self-reported data below: Table 4: Self-Declared Education Levels of Returning Citizens Self-Declared Education Levels Not Declared College GED High School None Other Male Inmates 5.5% Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency The need for education, training and employment services is prevalent for returning citizens. The Mayor's Office on Returning Citizens (ORCA) provided re-entrant services to more than 5,100 ex- offenders in 2014. A large proportion of these clients require adult basic education, computer literacy, job readiness, training, employment and other social services to help facilitate their transition back into their communities. This transition is exacerbated by the fact that many positions have limited or no access for individuals with certain types of criminal convictions. The District's recent \"ban the box\" initiative has helped ensure individuals can advance in hiring processes for which they are qualified for without sharing their criminal records until later phases of the hiring process, which may improve returning citizen outcomes over time. 36Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, Office of Legislative, Intergovernmental, and Public Affairs, Fact Sheet: Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency ,http://www.csosa.gov/newsmedia/factsheets/csosa-overview- v2016.pdf (2016). Returning citizens are classified as \"employable\" if they are not retired, disabled, suffering from a debilitating medical condition, receiving SSI, participating in a residential treatment program, participating in a residential sanctions program (i.e., incarcerated), or participating in a school or training program.30Individuals who are English language learners, individuals who have low levels of literacy, and individuals facing substantial cultural barriers The District is also home to a growing number of immigrants who are English language learners.. The number of individuals with Limited English Proficiency is 33,200 in the District of Columbia, including approximately 4,000 that are native-born. 3 5F37About 14 percent of the District's population, or about 93,000 individuals, is foreign-born and that number has increased steadily since 1980. 36F38 Since 2010 alone, the District has seen a 13 percent increase in the share of immigrants in the population, the fourth highest increase in the nation. In 2013, immigrants constituted about 17 percent of the civilian labor force. This proportion dropped from 18 percent in 2010, despite the increase in the overall immigrant population in the District. 37F39This suggests that finding employment has become more challenging for immigrants since the recession. This data also suggests that it is necessary to consider how to increase job opportunities for those with limited English proficiency as well as those with a high school diploma or less. At the same time, we must develop strategies to ensure that the jobs they enter are part of a career path that will lead to both increased education and skill attainment, and higher wages. The system must also address the fact that race has a disparate impact on employment for those English language learners who are people of color, especially for those without a college degree. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2009-2013 American Community Survey, an estimated 11.7 percent (9,801 total) of 18-24 year old DC residents lack a high school diploma or its equivalent; and a similar 11.6 percent (49,916 total) of individuals age 25 and over also lack this credential - many of which are likely to have low levels of literacy. Additional data on the education and skill levels of DC residents can be found in Section II (a)(1)(B)(iii) below. Further review of the ACS data from this time period shows that one's educational attainment has a direct impact on one's earning potential, resulting in the following disparities: 36.8% of families headed by someone with less than a high school diploma or equivalent live below the poverty level; 26.4% of families headed by someone with a high school diploma or equivalent live below the poverty level; 18.3% of families headed by someone with some college/associates degree live below the poverty level; and 2.4% of families headed by someone with a bachelor's degree or higher live below the poverty level. 37Migration Policy Institute, based on data from the 2013 American Community Survey, US Census Bureau 38Ibid. 39Ibid.31People experiencing or with recent histories of homelessness Homelessness is a major issue in the District, with 7,298 persons counted as experiencing homelessness according to the District of Columbia's annual point in time (PIT) count conducted on January 28, 2015, including: 544 persons who were unsheltered, i.e. living on the street or places not meant for habitation (all persons were unaccompanied, no persons in families were found to be unsheltered at PIT); and 5,085 persons in Emergency Shelters (2,612 individuals and 2,473 people in 768 families); and 1,669 persons in Transitional Housing (665 unaccompanied individuals and 1,004 people in 363 families). The number of persons experiencing homelessness at PIT decreased by 5.8 percent from 2014. The number of unaccompanied homeless individuals counted decreased by 3.3 percent from last year, and the number of families also decreased by 8.1 percent. Assisting homeless residents is a key priority for the District, and they face numerous challenges that can often keep them disengaged from the workforce, and those that are engaged in the workforce have much higher unemployment rates than District averages. Key demographic and employment data on homeless individuals is as follows: Median age of unaccompanied homeless persons was 50 years while median age among adults in homeless families was 25. 10 percent of homeless adults surveyed reported having served in the United States Armed Forces. 63 percent of unaccompanied homeless adults and 14 percent of adults in families reported that they have no income. Eight percent of adult homeless persons reported a chronic health problem, and 13 percent reported a physical disability. (iii) Education and Skill Levels of the Workforce The District has a distinctively high proportion of residents with college degrees, with the percentage of adults over 25 with a bachelor's degree or higher nearly double the national average 38F40. The number of District residents who have at least some college background has risen dramatically over the past decade - from just over 250,000 to nearly 330,000 39 F41. The District also has a substantial job market that demands and supports these degree-holders. Sixty percent of the job postings between January and October 2015 required a bachelor's degree or above 40 F42. A recent analysis of the top \"high demand, high wage\" occupations indicates that nearly two-thirds 40American Community Survey (2009-2013) 41Economic Modeling Specialists Inc. (EMSI) Q2 2015 Data Set, Education Level 2006-2015. 42D.C. Department of Employment Services, DC Networks Data Analysis.32(61%) of the Top 31 high demand, high wage occupations in the District require a bachelor's degree. An additional 29% of high demand, high wage occupations require a graduate degree (Doctoral or Professional and/or Master's) 41F43. High annual salaries in this analysis range from a low median of $72,800 for a public relations specialist to a high median of $187,200 for a surgeon. The number of District adults with a high school diploma or less has barely moved since 2006, hovering around 135,000. And these individuals are not nearly as well served by the District's economy. This discrepancy can be seen in the difference in unemployment and labor force participation rates by education level in the District. For residents with a bachelor's Degree or above the unemployment rate was 2.8 percent and labor force participation was 84.3 percent, while for those with less than a high school diploma the unemployment rate was 12.7 percent and the labor force participation rate was only 45.4 percent (see table below for additional details).

Describe apparent skills gaps. Economists project that in just four years, 76% of all jobs in D.C. will require some postsecondary education, whether academic or technical, the highest rate in the country 4 2F44. Many current job- seekers will not be prepared, given that approximately 60,000 District residents lack a high school credential 43F45, and many more lack basic reading, writing, math, English language, problem solving, and critical thinking skills needed to succeed in training, postsecondary education, and the workplace 4 4F46. According to data collected from 1,377 employers in D.C., the most difficult occupations reported to fill are computer programmers, software developers for applications and systems software, civil engineers, and registered nurses. 45 F47For these occupations, more than 80% of employers require a minimum of a bachelor's degree. In a different survey of 250 employers, greatest deficiencies of the talent pool in the District were reported to be for written communication, the ability to use math, analytical ability, and problem solving. 46F48 The WIC and DOES have facilitated a number of feedback sessions with employers over the last few years, and challenges related to \"soft skills\" such as professional communication and timeliness are often cited. Many employers have indicated that they are willing to hire District residents with minimal levels of technical skills or relevant experience for entry-level positions if 44Georgetown University, Center on Education and Workforce.

Some employers in the hospitality and construction sectors have also noted that they do not typically have trouble identifying qualified candidates for job openings, but instead have trouble identifying enough qualified District residents. Retention of individuals that lack adequate transportation, childcare services, and case management services have also been cited as challenging by business stakeholders. To be competitive and attractive to businesses, our workforce system needs to ensure District residents hone the soft skills that employers require, as well as have the supports in place to be successful in all aspects of their lives. (2) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES ANALYSIS The Unified or Combined State Plan must include an analysis of the workforce development activities, including education and training in the State, to address the education and skill needs of the workforce, as identified in (a)(1)(B)(iii) above, and the employment needs of employers, as identified in (a)(1)(A)(iii) above. This must include an analysis of - (A) The State's Workforce Development Activities. Provide an analysis of the State's workforce development activities, including education and training activities of the core programs, Combined State Plan partner programs included in this plan, and mandatory and optional one-stop delivery system partners. Core WIOA programming is administered by three District agencies - the Department of Employment Services (DOES, Titles I and III), Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Adult and Family Education Department (OSSE AFE, Title II), and Department on Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA, Title IV). Each of these entities is represented at DC American Job Centers (AJC), and the District is expanding existing service links and coordination efforts among these partners through additional interagency agreements, increased co-location, and staff training. AJC's are certified by the Workforce Investment Council (WIC), which also helps facilitate coordination efforts across agency partners. Working groups convened by the WIC that include each of these partner agencies, as well as agencies with oversight for partner programs and the University of the District of Columbia - Community College, have made significant joint contributions to this plan and will continue to work on implementation steps moving forward. Title I - Adult, Dislocated Worker and Youth Programs - Administered by DOES Adult The District's WIOA Adult Program provides quality employment and training services to help eligible customers find sustainable employment and achieve self-sufficiency. The District's Adult Program serves the broadest range of individuals, including: unemployment insurance claimants; individuals with disabilities; public assistance recipients; veterans; and individuals with no work history. The program is also designed to help employer-customers meet their needs for skilled workers to compete in the District's dynamic economy. In program year 2014, the District's WIOA35Adult allocation of $2.0 million served 1,048 enrolled individuals, including 187 participants utilizing individual training accounts (ITA). The District was allotted $2.1 million for program year 2015; and in the first half of this year, 458 individuals were enrolled, including 103 utilizing ITAs. For program year 2016, DOES plans to increase WIOA Adult enrollment to at least 1,350. Dislocated worker The District's WIOA Dislocated Worker (DW) Program is designed to help laid-off workers reconnect with the labor force as quickly as possible in sustainable employment. The program aims to increase the retention and earnings of dislocated workers by increasing their work readiness, educational attainment, and occupational skills and by connecting them to careers in high-demand occupations. In program year 2014, the District's WIOA DW allocation of $3.0 million served 271 enrolled individuals, including 26 participants utilizing individual training accounts (ITA). The District was allotted $3.4 million from USDOL to fund the WIOA Dislocated Worker Program in program year 2015. In the first half of program year 2015, 169 individuals were enrolled in WIOA DW, including 24 utilizing ITAs. For program year 2015, DOES' goal is to increase WIOA DW enrollment to 400, with plans to increase enrollment to at least 650 in program year 2016. The District's American Job Center (AJC) system delivers core, intensive, and training services Adult and DW customers at the District's AJC locations, while many more benefit from self-service offerings available online via the DC Networks system. Based on new flexibility in funding provided under WIOA, the District may choose to shift funds from the Dislocated Worker program to the Adult program, or vice versa, as needed to best serve participants. As necessary, participants in both the Adult and Dislocated worker programs are assessed to determine their educational needs by OSSE providers who work on-site at the American Job Centers. The main assessment tool is the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS). Participants who require and/or choose adult educational services are able to receive literacy and remediation services onsite at the AJC or are referred to another OSSE provider that specializes in meeting their specific learning needs. Youth The District's WIOA Youth Program consists of a comprehensive set of programs and services designed to support in-school youth ages 14-21 and out-of-school youth ages 16-24. Leveraging both federal and local youth funds, the District offers eligible youth access to all fourteen required WIOA program elements, including meaningful work experience during the summer and throughout the calendar year, occupational skills training, work readiness training, educational training and tutoring, leadership development, mentoring, and supportive services. The program is supported by federal and local funding, including about $2.3 million allotted in program year 2015 from USDOL and $21 million annually in local funds. Youth are eligible to receive services both in school or out- of-school, with an emphasis on work-based learning. In program year 2014, the District's WIOA Youth program only served 56 individuals; and has only enrolled 83 individuals in the first half of program year 2015. This reflects ongoing performance and program design challenges that led the WIC, as part of their youth grant oversight responsibilities, to end the in-school and out-of-school grants during program year 2014 and not authorize enrollment of new youth until an updated youth36service delivery plan was in place and approved, which necessitated new procurements and further delayed enrollment. An approved plan and revised WIC and DOES oversight processes have resulted in a new procurement process and revitalized program model, and the District anticipates significant enrollment increases in the coming months. For more information on program requirements and specific activities provided under Title I Youth programs, see sections VI(c) and VI(d)(3). Title II -Adult and Family Education Program - Administered By OSSE/AFE The District's adult and family education programming is supported by a combination of federal and local funding (about $1.2 million of Title II funding annually and $3.8 million in local funds), and currently funds 23 organizations to offer Adult Basic Education (ABE), Adult Secondary Education (ASE) inclusive of the General Educational Development Program (GED) and National External Diploma Program (NEDP), English as a Second Language (ESL), English Literacy/Civics Education (EL Civics), Family Literacy, Occupational Literacy, Digital Literacy, Career Essential Boot-Camp and Postsecondary Education and Workforce Transition and Ancillary Services to District residents. Nearly 4,000 District residents are served by OSSE AFE providers annually. OSSE AFE sub-grantees include community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and select DCPS and DC Public Charter Schools that specialize in serving a diverse population of District residents (e.g. individuals with low income who are educationally disadvantaged, single parents, displaced homemakers, families, individuals with limited English proficiency, adults with learning disabilities, older youth, individuals who are homeless and returning citizens). Prior to WIOA, beginning in 2008, the OSSE AFE began working with its WIA partners including DOES, the DHS, DDS/RSA, and other organizations to better coordinate intake, assessment, and referral practices among DC agencies in an effort to streamline and coordinate the provision of education, training and other related services to District residents. These efforts include the ongoing implementation of the DC Data Vault (DV), a transactional data system that facilitates the referral of District residents to and from OSSE AFE and DOES, including plans to add DHS, DDS/RSA, UDC-CC and other partner agencies. The DV links customers to programs and services (i.e. adult literacy, occupational literacy, digital literacy, Career Essential Boot-Camp, postsecondary education and training), tracks customer participation, performance, progress and outcomes, and facilitates cross agency communication and case management of services for DC residents. OSSE and DOES also partner to offer integrated occupational literacy (training and education regarding a specific sector) with adult basic education, adult secondary education, GED instruction, and/or English language instruction to create contextualized educational opportunities for learners so that they can develop essential employment skills needed for the successful entry into a given field, while also improving basic reading, writing, math, and/or English skills. To allow the sharing of the client data and to ensure the DV meets FERPA and HIPPA requirements, all residents who will be served through the DV sign a Release of Information form so that agencies can best share only the necessary data to make appropriate referrals and meet the customer's needs. Furthermore, WIOA core partners enter into Data Sharing Agreements to meet the needs of District residents and to help facilitate the sharing and reporting of outcome data. Social security numbers, if available, are collected during the intake process and are required for employment data37matching purposes. Follow-up activities on student attainment of core goals will include data matching, where possible, and the continuation of surveying. Title III - Wagner-Peyser - Administered by DOES Wagner-Peyser Act employment services are offered in each of the District's AJC locations. Wagner-Peyser activities include (but are not limited to) initial assessment, provision of labor market and job opening information, and assistance registering in DC Networks, as well as referrals to WIOA, adult education and literacy, senior community service employment activities, postsecondary vocational education, Trade Adjustment Assistance activities, veteran services, state unemployment compensation services, as well as employment and training activities carried out under the Community Services Block Grant and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In program year 2014, 43,395 individuals were enrolled in Wagner-Peyser employment Services, with a budget allocation of $2.1 million. The District was also allotted $2.1 million from USDOL to fund the program in program year 2015. In the first half of PY2015, 20,924 individuals were enrolled in Wagner-Peyser. Title IV - Vocational Rehabilitation - Administered by DDS/RSA The District's vocational rehabilitation (VR) services are eligibility based, and are provided to people who have a disability, which presents a substantial impediment to employment, and who would benefit from services to achieve an employment outcome. In addition, pre-employment transition services (PETS) are available for all students with disabilities, including those who are eligible or potentially eligible for VR services; i.e., students receiving special education services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or who are eligible for services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. VR services are individualized, based on the strengths, needs, abilities, interests, capabilities, and informed choice of the person. DDS/RSA currently serves about 4,600 people across the full range of services, which include evaluation, counseling and guidance, physical and mental restoration services, transition between advancement opportunities and related services, job exploration and readiness training, vocational training, support services and monetary supports, and placement services, supported employment services, job coaching, among others. The District receives $14 million in federal VR funds per year, in addition to about $6.5 million in local funding. RSA also administers a supported employment grant of $300,000, 50 percent of which must be used to provide services to youth; and an independent living grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services of about $300,000. Over the past three years the agency has made substantial efforts to engage in partnerships with other government agencies, community based agencies and schools, in order to provide services in the community. Currently, DDS/RSA is providing services at thirty locations around the city. In most instances this is through agreements with agencies that allow DDS/RSA to provide services at their agency weekly. The agency also currently provides services at two of the four American Job Centers five days per week, and two sites one day per week, with plans for expansion of co- location to all sites moving forward. DDS/RSA also provides services at all DC Public Schools, Public Charter Schools and non-public placements within the DC-Baltimore Metropolitan area where DC students attend.38The Strengths and Weaknesses of Workforce Development Activities: Provide an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of activities from above. Through an analysis of its core programs in the District's workforce system, the following strengths and weaknesses have been identified. Note that a number of the weaknesses identified are derived from analyses by external stakeholders, and are cited accordingly below. Strengths Workforce System Performance Improvements - Measures taken by DOES to strengthen the Adult, Dislocated Worker and Wagner-Peyser programs have been successful, as evidenced by meeting or exceeding all program year 2014 Federal Common Measure goals. DDS/RSA also improved their closure rates and wages in fiscal year 2015; and OSSE AFE has been successful in improving enrollments and maximizing service provision to adult learners. Coordination of Jobseeker Services - AJCs and partner agencies already serve as a referral source to a variety of community or interagency social service partners and employers. Agency partners have utilized an extensive intake assessment, screening, and referral process to help inform services needed; and are already working to integrate these processes. Technology - District agencies administering WIOA programs have comprehensive data and case management systems in place, and have been taking steps to begin integrating these systems through the Data Vault initiative. Currently, DOES and OSSE are already able to access each other's data to assist with improved intake and performance tracking through the Data Vault. Access - The District's AJC system ensures equitable access to services through multiple sites that are strategically located throughout DC and mobile one stop services that reach additional areas of the city. Facilities also meet ADA compliance standards. Additionally, DDS has expanded their outreach and presence in the community, particularly in focusing on locations and groups that were identified as unserved or underserved. Training Focused on Hiring Needs - Numerous occupational training offerings supported by both federal and local funding are already targeted at high-demand sectors and occupations; and some customized training and pre-apprenticeships that are directly aligned with business hiring are already in place. Broad Adult Education Offerings - OSSE AFE sub-grantees include providers and support services geared towards adult learners across the educational spectrum. Inter-Agency Coordination - Agencies administering WIOA programming have already cultivated partnerships to support cross-agency collaborations to serve District Residents, including through co-location, blended funding, collaborative provision of services, and data system integration. Strong External Partnerships - The District has a wealth of community workforce, adult education, and disability advocates that are active collaborators with all workforce system partner agencies, and government stakeholders participate in multiple externally-led communities of practice. Additionally, the WIC Board has an active business membership and our workforce system has partnerships with a number of other private sector organizations.39Business Services are Robust - DOES's provides a number of valuable services to businesses, including hiring events and pre-screening, assistance in accessing trained jobseekers, apprenticeship, and wage subsidies for some jobseekers. DDS and DHS also provide job development services and are working more closely with DOES to align services. Youth Programs Communication - Youth are knowledgeable about program offerings and stay connected via mobile phones, emails, and social media. Weaknesses High Risk Status with USDOL - DOL identified numerous deficiencies with the District's use of federal funds under WIA related to performance, fiscal controls, governance, and operating procedures in 2012. These issues resulted in the District receiving a High Risk designation from DOL and a corrective action plan (CAP) was put in place to address those items. The District successfully remediated some of the items in this CAP over the last few years. However, the WIA Youth program (now WIOA Youth program) has failed to meet multiple performance goals and underspent funding in program years, 2013, 2014, and 2015 resulting in a new CAP process and a continuing High Risk designation with DOL. This weakness is a key focus at the highest levels of District government, and significant efforts to address them are underway, including a new procurement process and service model, a dedicated compliance team to ensure that all items are addressed as quickly as possible, and a stronger WIC to provide oversight and monitoring. Youth Program and Performance Tracking Deficits - An independent report from 2014 on the challenges of District youth in the labor market identified several issues with workforce system services 47 F49. These included programs and activities not being linked to youth outcomes or being aligned with career pathways, performance and progress measures being undefined and/or inconsistent across programs, and lack of information management and/or staff capacity to document and track outcomes. Customer Service Challenges for Jobseekers and Businesses - Customers have reported receiving services of varying quality from both workforce system agencies and providers. Both jobseekers and businesses have identified issues in accessing services that meet their needs. Fragmented Workforce System - A recent policy brief from key workforce system advocates noted that the District's workforce development system is fragmented, creating opportunities for individuals to fall out of the process before receiving the services they need 48 F50. Agencies responsible for administering workforce system programming also cited a lack of integration between partners and services, which can result in costly and inefficient processes, and making it difficult for users to find utility in the system. DOES Operational and Staff Challenges - Challenges in DOES's operational structure over decades led to issues with frontline staff performance. Additional training and support for staff is needed to ensure successful program implementation, including implementation of a comprehensive change management strategy focused on maximizing staff talent, capacity 49Ross, Martha, Improving Youth Programs and Outcomes in Washington, D.C. , 2014 . 50Berman et al, Charting the Course: An Opportunity to Improve Workforce Development in DC , February 2015.40building through cross training and credentialing. DOES has begun addressing these challenges in the last year, but this work is ongoing. Adult Education and Vocational Rehabilitation Capacity Fails to Meet Demand - A recent policy brief noted that DC's investments in adult education and career pathways skill building are insufficient to meet the demand for these services, as evidenced by waiting lists for many programs and the significant need for these services (see workforce analyses above) 4 9F51. OSSE AFE also cited capacity as a challenge, despite increased enrollment and provider offerings in recent years. DDS/RSA has also noted increased demand for their services that has resulted in requests for additional funding and the possible need for more priority of service considerations. Support Service Gaps - Many adult learners need additional support services, such as transportation, housing, childcare, counseling, coaching, and income supports to fully access and complete education and training opportunities; but access to these services varies by programs and providers and gaps exist. Provider Capacity and Access Challenges - The amount of high quality providers of occupational training and adult education services is limited, and additional capacity building is needed to help providers improve offerings and scale successful programming. Capacity related to workforce system efforts to integrate education and industry skills training has been cited as a specific area where capacity building is needed. Additionally, several agencies have reported challenges identifying and establishing agreements or contracts with key providers. Challenges have also been cited in linking workforce system participants to appropriate training and education offerings provided through UDC-CC - a priority partner for the system that also receives significant District funding. District Procurement and Contract Management Challenges - Sub-grantees have reported challenges in navigating the District's procurement and grantmaking processes, and lack of coordination across agencies and programs have contributed to delays in administrative barriers in sub-grantee operations. Changes in Vocational Rehabilitation Requirements - WIOA requirements that adjust DDS/RSA's Vocational Rehabilitation requirements related to performance tracking and funding requirements for in-school-youth services necessitate significant changes in operations. The District has made a number of changes to ensure requirements are met and enhanced partnerships with other programming, but implementation burdens are significant. Business Focus Lacking - Business partners have frequently cited issues with training offerings that fail to meet their needs and are not informed by them. They have also identified issues with working with government, including too many points of contact and a lack of clarity on services available and how to access them. 51DeRenzis, Brooke, From Basic Skills to Good Jobs: A Strategy for Connecting D.C.'s Adult Learners to Career Pathways , April 2014.41(B) State Workforce Development Capacity: Provide an analysis of the capacity of the State entities to provide the activities above The District's capacity to provide workforce development activities is strong with the multitude of local and federal programs funded throughout the city. The District's workforce development appropriations are currently spread among at least 12 different District agencies, and over $120 million is budgeted annually for programs that have at least some workforce development components. 50 F52Over $40 million of these funds are provided from the federal government each year towards programs that include workforce components at each of these agencies. While these resources provide a significant array of services to help District residents and businesses, divergent funding streams, lack of oversight infrastructure, and varying performance reporting requirements contribute to the decentralized nature of the District's workforce system. A 2011 GAO report noted that 9 federal agencies administer 47 federal programs related to employment and training, contributing to overlap and possible inefficiencies and coordination challenges at the local level. 51F53Workforce services are not just limited to occupational training and adult education, but may also include work readiness, job placement and on-the-job training, and services to businesses as well as human, social, mental health, disability and other supportive services. Key agencies making significant investments include: Department of Employment Services University of the District of Columbia- Community College (UDC-CC) Department of Human Services Department on Disability Services Department of Behavioral Health Office of the State Superintendent of Education Workforce Investment Council In addition to direct service provision through District agencies, a significant portion of workforce funding is distributed to more than 100 external service providers. This diversity in service providers allows the District to procure a number of services not provided within government, and also facilitate community-based services, but has the disadvantage of being both difficult to navigate for residents, and difficult to evaluate for policy makers. The various grants and other procurements that fund these providers often have different performance measures and expectations, making it difficult to compare services across programs and agencies. 522015 WIC staff analyses of data from multiple sources, including the District of Columbia Office of the City Administrator, Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Support Act of 2015, and other secondary sources. Exact figures are unavailable due to program complexity and varying definitions of workforce services. 53GAO, Multiple Employment and Training Programs: Providing Information on Co-locating Services and Consolidating Administrative Structures Could Promote Efficiencies, GAO-11-92 (Washington, DC: January 13, 2011).42The main access point to WIOA core programs is through the District's American Job Center (AJC) system which includes four centers as well as through our Virtual One Stop (VOS), DC Networks. The AJC system has increased its links to required and non-required programs in recent years, but additional coordination efforts will be needed to help ensure that all jobseekers and businesses can access the full range of resources available through these centers. This includes ongoing integration efforts between DOES and other agencies, as well as in departments within DOES. DOES has not typically experienced capacity challenges in core programs, but has instead had challenges in enrolling sufficient numbers of participants and expending all available resources. This is not due to lack of need for these services in the District, but rather a combination of restrictive enrollment policies and lack of sufficient coordination to ensure interested jobseekers were identified and received prompt services. DOES has continued to address these challenges in recent years, and overall enrollment and expenditures are increasing in both core and other workforce programming administered by the agency. DDS/RSA has required re-allotment funds in FY 2014 and 2015 in order to be able to serve all eligible individuals. Particularly with the requirement to dedicate 15% of the Title IV grant funds to the provision of pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities, and with the increase in the number of people for whom the agency provides supported employment services, the agency is facing the possible need to institute a waiting list for services. It is essential that a number of measures be implemented in order to prevent imposition of a waiting list, including better coordination regarding provision of training services, including those provided by UDC-CC, to ensure that VR dollars are only used for training in circumstances in which a program is not available at no cost to the person at UDC-CC or the person is not eligible for training through DOES or one of the District's adult education providers (including adult serving community based organizations, DC Public Schools, or DC Public Charter Schools); and ensure that all agencies are aware of all training and apprenticeship opportunities; improved coordination of business outreach to more efficiently engage businesses and identify employment opportunities for District residents. OSSE AFE's providers were funded to serve 2,076 residents while their actual enrollment was 2,914 in PY 2015 (July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015). Furthermore, in FY15 the District's adult- serving DCPS and DC Public Charter schools were funded to serve 6,045 educational slots. Most of these educational institutions are at, or above funded capacity and many of them have long waiting lists. When the number of funded slots are compared to the approximately 60,000 adult residents in the District who don't have a high school diploma or its equivalent, and the unknown number (likely tens of thousands) of residents who have a secondary credential but don't have the requisite skills to successfully compete in the labor market, it is clear that the existing capacity is insufficient to meet the District's needs. More planning on how to increase capacity for adult education providers is needed and indeed some has started through the work of the OSSE AFE, in collaboration with DOES, the University of the District of Columbia and the Graduate School USA over the past three years as well as the District's Career Pathways Task Force. Overall, it is essential that we work as full partners in a workforce development system that efficiently and effectively allocates resources to assist all people to enter the workforce, especially43those with significant barriers, including people with disabilities. In order to make best use of resources and ensure we are able to serve District residents to capacity, we must continue to truly integrate services and adopt career pathways with linkages between partners and programs. Through these efforts, we will be able to increase our capacity to better serve District residents, reduce duplication of services and streamline funding through shared contracts and blending and braiding of funding. The District will continue to strategize how to leverage funding across all of the WIOA Titles to meet as much of the Workforce Development and adult education needs of District residents as possible. Additionally, the District will continue to engage providers, partners, businesses and other key stakeholders in conversations about its efforts to increase the capacity of its providers throughout the implementation of the WIOA State Plan over the next four years. (b)State Strategic Vision and Goals: The Unified or Combined State Plan must include the State's strategic vision and goals for developing its workforce and meeting employer needs in order to support economic growth and economic self-sufficiency. This must include\u2014 (1) Vision. Describe the State's strategic vision for its workforce development system. Every Washington, DC resident is ready, able, and empowered to discover and attain their fullest potential through lifelong learning, sustained employment, and economic security. Businesses are connected to the skilled District residents they need to compete globally, are full participants in the workforce system, and drive the District's economic growth. Residents and businesses in all wards are supported by coordinated, cohesive, and integrated government agencies and partners working to help communities thrive. (2) Goals. Describe the goals for achieving this vision based on the analysis in (a) above of the State's economic conditions, workforce, and workforce development activities. This should\u2014 (A) Include goals for preparing an educated and skilled workforce, including preparing youth and individuals with barriers to employment and other populations. (B) Include goals for meeting the skilled workforce needs of employers. GOAL #1- System Alignment: District agencies form an integrated workforce system that delivers coordinated, accessible, and effective workforce services through clearly defined roles and transitional supports throughout the provision of a continuum of services. In order for our workforce system to progress and continue to serve all District residents, all partner agencies need to be aligned in their procedural and operational functions. While delineating clear roles and responsibilities, this will provide the opportunity to eliminate inefficient processes and improve customer service to both jobseekers and businesses. In recent focus groups and interviews with area employers and system users, several points were raised on how the current overlap among services and programming offerings complicates the utilization of the system. Increased integration with clearly defined roles and transitional supports will provide a more44seamless delivery structure for system users and help allocate resources more efficiently to increase overall offerings. GOAL #2- Access to Workforce and Education Services: All residents, including people with disabilities and those with multiple barriers to employment, regardless of education or skill level, can access the education, training, career, and supportive services necessary to move forward in their career pathway. While a large segment of the District's population possesses bachelors and advanced degrees, we also have a large population without a high school diploma or its equivalent and significant numbers of individuals with one or more barriers to employment. Challenges in accessing and moving between the numerous services needed for some individuals to advance towards self- sufficiency have frequently been cited, and an effective system must be flexible in addressing varying needs. Increasing access to the full range of services and supports, as well as connections and handoff processes between services, will ensure that there are career pathways and options for individuals regardless of their educational attainment and skill levels. GOAL #3- Sector Strategies/Alignment with Business Needs: The District's business community gains access to a broader pool of District talent with the skills necessary to meet their needs and advance within their organizations; and informs workforce investments and incentives that effectively match jobseekers with their needs. Businesses have frequently cited challenges in identifying enough District residents to meet both their skill set requirements and job readiness criteria, which can lead to both reduced business competitiveness and challenges for residents in competing with talent from neighboring jurisdictions. These stakeholders have cited the need to increase their role in informing and delivering training and other services, as well as aligning services targeted within high-demand sectors with significant hiring needs. Increasing the role of business leaders in the workforce system and creating true sector strategies that align with career pathways in high-demand sectors can help ensure that the District's workforce system adds value for employers. GOAL #4- Performance and Accountability: Funded workforce services are evidence-based, high quality, and flexible in meeting individuals' needs; and District agencies evaluate outcomes through standardized methodologies that ensures accountability and transparency. Evidence based services with high-level accountability and transparency are key to a sustainable and demand-driven workforce system. Accurate and timely assessment of programs has been lacking in many areas, and differences in reporting requirements and structures have increased these challenges. Through Mayor Bowser's CapStat initiative, the District will assess its workforce system more thoroughly to help increase high-quality program offerings and move away from less effective services and providers. Greater standardization in defining and tracking outcomes will help the District better serve our jobseekers and business stakeholders. The process for determining the additional outcomes that will be tracked across providers will be informed by an engagement process with stakeholders and subject matter experts.45GOAL #5- Youth: Youth have access to a coordinated, accessible, education and workforce system that provides the supports needed to prepare them for postsecondary success; including education, training, and competitive employment. A critical component of improving of the District's larger workforce development strategy includes the reshaping and integration of youth workforce development. Youth suffer from higher rates of unemployment and disconnection from the workforce than other age groups, and also have unique developmental needs, which necessitate targeted services that both supplement and complement other workforce offerings. In order to create a more coordinated system of services and ensure that the District's youth employment programs address previous compliance challenges, coordinated and accessible services must be provided across workforce system partners. (3) Performance Goals: Performance Goals. Using the table provided in Appendix 1, include the State's expected levels of performance relating to the performance accountability measures based on primary indicators of performance described in section 116(b)(2)(A) of WIOA. (This Strategic Planning element only applies to core programs.) Performance Goals included in Appendix 1. (4) Assessment. Describe how the State will assess the overall effectiveness of the workforce investment system in the State in relation to the strategic vision and goals stated above in sections (b)(1), (2), and (3) and how it will use the results of this assessment and other feedback to make continuous or quality improvements. The District will assess overall effectiveness both through the use of the Federal performance measures as well as additional local performance measures which align to our unique goals. The District will use assessment results and other feedback in a number of ways to ensure continuous improvements. As we work towards our goal of eliminating silos and creating one integrated workforce development system, ongoing planning meetings between agency leadership will be a priority. Convened by DMGEO and the WIC, leadership from DOES, DHS, OSSE, DDS/RSA and UDC-CC will meet monthly to review the progress of WIOA implementation and address performance with a focus on the continuous improvement of the programs and processes we have developed and system-wide problem solving. The Office of the City Administrator uses CapStat to perform a deep-dive, analytical review of services and challenges, in order to identify solutions. The OCA will do a CapStat on the WIOA plan annually to highlight what performance areas need to be improved as well as those areas that are working well. The WIC holds quarterly board meetings to discuss topical issues and make decisions on key workforce-related items. It is also a prime opportunity to present the board with assessment results46and make policy-related changes as a result of them. The quarterly board meetings also provide an opportunity for the public to weigh in on continuous improvement efforts. Customer feedback is extremely important to the District agencies and provides an avenue for us to learn from our residents what we are getting right, and what we need to improve. To date each agency has had its own mechanism for collecting customer feedback. We will now move to sharing common methods of obtaining customer feedback to be able to assess the system as a whole and ensure that high quality programs and activities and customer-service are being delivered across the District. Mayor Bowser has made workforce development a priority. She is particularly focused on improving and integrating the current system to ensure all residents have access to pathways to the middle class. A major innovation of the Bowser administration was the creation of the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity (DMGEO) located at the newly established Mayor's Office which is east of the Anacostia River, on the city's Southeast side. The DMGEO cluster is made up of the Department of Employment Services (DOES), the Workforce Investment Council (WIC), the Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD), the Office of African American Affairs (OAAA), and the Commission on Fathers, Men, and Boys (CFMB). This cluster was created to facilitate investment and job creation in DC's underserved communities. The Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity's work is devoted to expanding prosperity through workforce development, job growth, and entrepreneurship city-wide. The creation of this new office, and its placement within one of DC's most underserved communities, demonstrates the commitment the Bowser Administration has made to improving the lives of every resident, regardless of zip code. (c) State Strategy: The Unified or Combined State Plan must include the State's strategies to achieve its strategic vision and goals. These strategies must take into account the State's economic, workforce, and workforce development, education and training activities and analysis provided in Section (a) above.

OPERATIONAL PLANNING ELEMENTS (a) STATE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION (a) State Strategy Implementation. The Unified or Combined State Plan must include- (1) State Board Functions. Describe how the State board will implement its functions under section 101(d) of WIOA (i.e.. provide a description of Board operational structures and decision making processes to ensure such functions are carried out). The DC Workforce Investment Council (WIC) serves as the District's State and Local Workforce Development Board empowered to advise the Mayor, the Council and the District government on the development, implementation, and continued improvement of an integrated and effective workforce investment system. The WIC works in conjunction with the Mayor, DMGEO, the Department of Employment Services, and partner agencies in order to set policy direction, performance goals, and oversight to the DC workforce development system. The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity provides management oversight of the WIC and the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development provides administrative and technical support to the WIC. The WIC has an Executive Director and other staff in place to carry out day to day operations and facilitate Board activities. The WIC's mission statement, as determined by its members, is as follows: The District of Columbia Workforce Investment Council will lead with a sense of urgency to help create a fully integrated, comprehensive workforce development system that effectively meets jobseeker and business needs; while ensuring accountability, high performance, coordination, transparency, and effective leadership at all levels. The Mayor appoints the members of the Workforce Investment Council (WIC), with the exception of two DC Council members appointed by the DC Council Chairperson, and designates a business community representative as WIC Chairperson. The Chairperson, together with the Executive Committee, may establish subcommittees and task forces as deemed necessary. Currently, the WIC has an Executive Committee and is working to establish additional subcommittees to help execute its role. The Executive Committee acts on behalf of the WIC on all policy, performance management, fiscal and administrative issue related to the local workforce investment system. The WIC also convenes the Career Pathways Task Force, a locally mandated body consisting of District Government and community workforce and education organizations charged with ensuring that all adult learners have access to career pathways. WIC meetings occur on the second Tuesday of every third month and are open to the public, while committee and taskforce meetings occur on an ad-hoc basis to enable decision-making when needed. Meeting agendas are set through the Executive Committee with the assistance of WIC staff, and WIC Board decisions on workforce system policies and other considerations are determined through votes approved by the majority of members present during times that a quorum of the Board is in session.50The following are the functions of the WIC as a State and Local Board per WIOA (with specific references to the law cited) and local workforce implementation legislation; carried out through the processes described above. Some of these functions are carried out through coordination with The Department of Employment Services, the WIOA administrative agency and fiscal agent as designated through local law and policies. 1.The development, implementation, and modification of the State plan; 2.The review of statewide policies, of statewide programs, and of recommendations on actions that should be taken by the State to align workforce development programs in the State in a manner that supports a comprehensive and streamlined workforce development system in the State, including the review and provision of comments on the State plans, if any, for programs and activities of one-stop partners that are not core programs; 3.The development and continuous improvement of the workforce development system in the State, including: a.The identification of barriers and means for removing barriers to better coordinate, align, and avoid duplication among the programs and activities carried out through the system; b.The development of strategies to support the use of career pathways for the purpose of providing individuals, including low-skilled adults, youth, and individuals with barriers to employment (including individuals with disabilities), with workforce investment activities, education, and supportive services to enter or retain employment; c.The development of strategies for providing effective outreach to and improved access for individuals and employers who could benefit from services provided through the workforce development system; d.The development and expansion of strategies for meeting the needs of employers, workers, and jobseekers, particularly through industry or sector partnerships related to in- demand industry sectors and occupations; e.The development and continuous improvement of the one-stop delivery system, including providing assistance to one-stop operators, one-stop partners, and providers with planning and delivering services, including training services and supportive services, to support effective delivery of services to workers, jobseekers, and employers; and f.The development of strategies to support staff training and awareness across programs supported under the workforce development system; 4.The development and updating of comprehensive State performance accountability measures, including State adjusted levels of performance, to assess the effectiveness of the core programs in the State as required under section 116(b); 5.The identification and dissemination of information on best practices, including best practices for: a.The effective operation of one-stop centers, relating to the use of business outreach, partnerships, and service delivery strategies, including strategies for serving individuals with barriers to employment; and b. Effective training programs that respond to real-time labor market analysis, that effectively use direct assessment and prior learning assessment to measure an individual's prior knowledge, skills, competencies, and experiences, and that evaluate such skills, and51competencies for adaptability, to support efficient placement into employment or career pathways; 6.The development and review of statewide policies affecting the coordinated provision of services through the State's one-stop delivery system described in section 121(e), including the development of: a.Objective criteria and procedures in assessing the effectiveness and continuous improvement of one-stop centers described in such section; b.Guidance for the allocation of one-stop center infrastructure funds under section 121(h); and c.Policies relating to the appropriate roles and contributions of entities carrying out one- stop partner programs within the one-stop delivery system, including approaches to facilitating equitable and efficient cost allocation in such system; 7.The development of strategies for technological improvements to facilitate access to, and improve the quality of, services and activities provided through the one-stop delivery system, including such improvements to: a.Enhance digital literacy skills (as defined in section 202 of the Museum and Library Services Act (20 U.S.C. 9101); referred to in this Act as ''digital literacy skills''); b.Accelerate the acquisition of skills and recognized postsecondary credentials by participants; c.Strengthen the professional development of providers and workforce professionals; and d.Ensure such technology is accessible to individuals with disabilities and individuals residing in remote areas; 8.The development of strategies for aligning technology and data systems across one-stop partner programs to enhance service delivery and improve efficiencies in reporting on performance accountability measures, including the design and implementation of common intake, data collection, case management information, and performance accountability measurement and reporting processes,, to improve coordination of services across one-stop partner programs; 9.The preparation of the annual reports described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 116(d); 10.The development of the statewide workforce and labor market information system described in section 15(e) of the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49l-2(e)); and 11.The development of such other policies as may promote statewide objectives for, and enhance the performance of, the workforce development system in the State. Per requirements under WIOA, the WIC will develop a plan to administer a competitive solicitation process for the procurement of one-stop operator(s). An initial strategy will be developed by July 2016, with a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to be administered during the following program year and one or more providers in place by July 2017. The WIC will work with stakeholders to ensure that this process is well designed to facilitate the selection of the highest quality one-stop operator(s); and also ensure that the process is compliant with both WIOA and federal and local law related to procurement.52(2) Implementation of State Strategy. Describe how the lead State agency with responsibility for the administration of each core program or a Combined State Plan partner program included in this plan will implement the State's Strategies identified in II(c) above. This must include a description of\u2014 (A) Core Program Activities to Implement the State's Strategy. Describe the activities the entities carrying out the respective core programs will fund to implement the State's strategies. Also describe how such activities will be aligned across the core programs and Combined State Plan partner programs included in this plan and among the entities administering the programs, including using co-enrollment and other strategies. In order to ensure the strategies laid out in the WIOA State Plan are implemented in a timely and transparent manner, the WIC will convene a WIOA Implementation Work Group to track and oversee activities and system changes with its first meeting slated for April 2016. This work group will be made up of District agency leadership, employers, and members of the public. Progress of the WIOA Implementation work group will be made available to the public through meeting minutes posted on dcworks.dc.gov. The District is taking a phased approach to WIOA implementation. The phases below describe our high-level priority areas that the WIOA Implementation Work Group will address. Further details on these activities are outlined in the following sections.53Table 7: WIOA Implementation Phases by Goal Area WIOA Implementation by Phases PHASE 1 PHASE 2 PHASE 3 SYSTEM ALIGNMENT A Community of Practice for adult education, training, and other related providers is established through the Innovation Fund, based on a Career Pathways/WIOA framework, in alignment with current professional development offerings in the city.

Ensure the availability of pre-employment transition services for all students with disabilities in DCPS, DC Public Charter and non- public placements. These include, career counseling, counseling on post- secondary options, work readiness training, work based learning experiences and peer mentoring. Coordination between RSA, DOES, DCPS and all DC Public Charter and non- public schools to ensure that all youth with disabilities have opportunities for paid work experience prior to graduation Coordination between DOES, OSSE, DCPS and relevant DC Public Charter schools to ensure work experiences are aligned, where appropriate, with a student's CTE program of study.Youth one-stop established and serving youth.57The District agencies responsible for carrying out core programs, the Department of Employment Services (DOES), the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), and the Department of Disability Services- Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA), are committed to working together, integrating services, and aligning programs to form a cohesive workforce development system as outlined in the State goals and strategies. 1.System Alignment Goal: District agencies form an integrated workforce system that delivers coordinated, accessible, and effective workforce services through clearly defined roles and transitional supports throughout the provision of a continuum of services. Strategies: 1.1 - Create a uniform intake, assessment, and referral system. 1.2 - Fully integrate all American Job Center partners to allow for cohesive delivery of services. 1.3 - Align policies, procedures, and performance measures and share data across programs to eliminate barriers to integration. 1.4 - Blend funding and utilize shared contracts to avoid duplication of resources. 1.5 - Foster environment of collaboration through cross-training staff and shared case management. District agencies made a concerted effort towards system alignment even prior to the passage of WIOA. While these partnerships tended to be between individual agencies, rather than an overall agreement among all one-stop partners, there are existing relationships among staff at each of the agencies. DOES and DDS/RSA have an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), a draft of which has been updated to reflect changes required under WIOA. DOES and OSSE also have a current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) covering educational services to DOES customers. DDS/RSA has worked very closely with OSSE, in terms of services to students with disabilities, and has been working this year to establish an MOA with OSSE, regarding sharing resources for Adult and Family Education (AFE), including ensuring that people served by DDS/RSA have access to adult education and literacy providers. Through regular meetings and communication, the agencies have all recognized that the people we serve face common barriers to employment, and we have begun sharing information regarding addressing these barriers. Most importantly, all of these agencies participated in the development of the Career Pathways Strategic Plan which lays out the framework for an aligned system. Moving forward, the agencies will establish one umbrella MOA for AJC partners. As noted previously, only about $40 million of the over $120 million that is budgeted annually for District programs that have at least some workforce development components comes from the federal government 5 2F54. Accordingly, agencies will engage in planning regarding blended funding, 542015 WIC staff analyses of data from multiple sources, including the District of Columbia Office of the City Administrator, Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Support Act of 2015, and other secondary sources. Exact figures are unavailable due to program complexity and varying definitions of workforce services.58shared contracts, and resource contributions to ensure they are maximizing resources. The District is already beginning to improve coordination between federally and locally funded resources, including through alignment of year-round youth services programming and connections to the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP); referrals of WIOA participants to locally funded training options, including UDC-CC course offerings; and alignment of adult education offerings funded through various sources. Agencies are working to further integrate services including through the development of a common intake, assessment, screening, and referral process. Currently, DOES and OSSE have a common initial intake through the Data Vault (DV). The DV was initially designed based on a single, multi- agency (OSSE AFE and DOES) customer intake and referral process. The DV is currently being implemented at each of the District's American Job Centers and by OSSE AFE program providers. Expansion plans over the next two years include incorporating other workforce system partners including DOES/WIC training providers, DDS/RSA, DHS, UDC-CC, adult-serving DCPS and DC Public Charter schools (on a voluntary basis), and other partner agencies. Additionally, the Districts' efforts over the next two three years will focus on system alignment and data sharing through interfaces between the DV and LACES, SLED, DOES's VOS and other data systems. As these additional partners are connected to the Data Vault the system and details associated with the uniform intake, assessment, and referral processes will be updated to ensure they reflect the needs of all partners. Moving forward, the Data Vault will be an essential tool to the integration of data systems and service delivery across agencies and partners. Its build out and implementation will serve as a vehicle for sharing key data on District residents which will streamline enrollment and service provision as well as facilitate a warm hand-off and referral to other agencies with a built in mechanism to track the enrollment, participation, progress, and outcomes associated with these referrals. The Data Vault will include performance data once the interfaces are developed between the DV and other DC government agencies' data systems. Follow-up of customers' attainment of core outcomes are the responsibility of the grantee/contractor, in collaboration with the state agencies via data matching and surveying. As aforementioned, the DV is currently being implemented by staff in the DOES American Job Centers and OSSE AFE providers. Check-in meetings about DV implementation have provided DOES and OSSE AFE state and local program staff with opportunities to provide feedback, suggestions and recommendations on the DV's usage and design to ensure there is a built-in feedback loop regarding strengths and weaknesses. Already there have been several modifications and additions to the Data Vault identified based on this feedback from users and we intend to continue to solicit feedback from all current and future users and partners to ensure the Data Vault is effectively supporting the District's system alignment goals. In an effort to further integrate services, the District's AJC system is pursuing the development of a co-located partnership with the Department of Human Services' TANF program. This partnership would provide comprehensive AJC services and include specialized services for TANF customers. TANF customers would be able to receive their TANF program assessments and be assigned a TANF vocational development specialist and vendor, while also receiving AJC services. TANF customers would have direct access to the breadth of services offered by one-stop partners,59including DOES' occupational skills training programs, to include Individual Training Accounts (ITAs), pre-apprenticeship, registered apprenticeship and On-the-Job Training, RSA services for individuals with disabilities, and adult education services through the use of the Data Vault from OSSE's AFE providers. District agencies recognize the need for shared case management as the most optimal method of service delivery for our residents. While some residents are enrolled in a number of District programs, it is not always possible for case managers to work in tandem. In a shared model, case managers and other staff working with individuals will ensure wrap around services are there to support individuals while reducing duplication of resources. Shared case management will be beneficial in aligning efforts to support individuals in reaching their goals. Further planning on shared case management including a study of best practices needs to take place before moving towards implementation. As part of the District's efforts towards system alignment, DOES introduced the agile theory of Strategic Doing to its workforce and partner agencies. The Strategic Doing discipline is designed and developed by Dr. Ed Morrison and the research team at the Purdue Center for Regional Development (PCRD) on the Campus of Purdue University, West Lafayette. Strategic Doing is a process that enables civic leaders to form collaborations quickly, guide them toward measurable outcomes, and make adjustments along the way. The agency (DOES) has created an inter-agency network of connected partners to improve the statewide workforce development system. This network is primarily focused on streamlining workforce services and creating centralized access points for District of Columbia residents. The process quickly forms new collaborations among workshop participants and moves them into learning by doing. As these collaborations form and participants learn from each other, Strategic Doingadvances quickly. Short, focused strategy reviews take place regularly, usually every 30 days. With Strategic Doing , strategy becomes more like software development. New versions of the strategy appear frequently as participants learn what actually works. Recently, DOES engaged several external partners, including Department of Human Services (DHS); Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA); University of the District of Columbia- Community College (UDC-CC); Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE); Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA); District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS); Department on Disability Services (DDS); Department of Youth Rehabilitative Services (DYRS); DC Housing Authority; Executive Office of the Mayor (EOM); Office on Returning Citizens Affairs (ORCA); and the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), to form a Strategic Doing workgroup. Representatives from these agencies are a part of core teams, which were asked to specifically focus on the process of: \"developing integrated workforce strategies to assist with the implementation of statewide WIOA service delivery.\" DOES held a two-day work session to introduce and reinforce the principles of the Strategic Doingmodel while also setting specific goals and priorities for the WIOA-related work teams.60Participants were grouped into work teams tasked with creating action plans for specific functional work streams. The teams have continued to work together as we move forward with the implementation of WIOA goals and objectives. The self-directed work teams have various identifiable tasks to be completed on a continuous 30-day cycle. Some of the goals achieved during the last session include the following: Stand-up core WIOA-related workgroups of the new state-wide WIOA requirements. Development of identifiable state-wide assets and recommendations on how to best leverage those resources. Identification and implementation of quick wins that can be implemented in the short term and that have a meaningful impact on the residents participating in workforce development services right now. Development of a transformation plan that informs the WIOA state plan developed in coordination with the WIC and Career Pathways Task Force that integrates best practices that exemplify a national model of an integrated workforce system. The workgroups focused on six initiatives which embody the goals and vision of WIOA. These efforts are focused on: aligning policy and protocols across partner agencies, improving business processes through inter-agency cross training for partner agencies, increasing awareness for customers surrounding in-demand jobs, streamlining processes for all state-wide agencies with employer engagement responsibilities, coordinating efforts around data sharing across agencies, and improving customer service in the American Job Centers. Moving forward, Strategic Doing will also be utilized to assist partner agencies with staying on target and task with required elements of the District's state plan. Through the ongoing efforts of strategic alignment and integrating the Memoranda of Understanding and the implementation support of Strategic Doing , the District will more effectively align WIOA and District priorities to more effectively serve both job seekers and businesses. 2. Access to Workforce and Education Services Goal: All residents, including people with disabilities and those with multiple barriers to employment, regardless of education or skill level, can access the education, training, career, and supportive services necessary to move forward in their career pathway. Strategies: 2.1- Expand earn and learn opportunities to allow residents to increase education and skills levels while helping support themselves and their families. 2.2- Ensure each sector pathway is developed with business input and includes well-connected and transparent education, training, credential offerings that are delivered through multiple linked and aligned programs.612.3- Ensure residents receive appropriate case management, career navigation, and support services to remediate barriers and ensure their movement along the pathway. 2.4- Education and training programs on the sector career pathway will incorporate, as appropriate, contextualized curriculum appropriate to the educational functioning level of the participant and to the sector/occupation of study. 2.5- Residents are able to access programs and services through multiple and convenient means including at the American Job Centers, virtual platforms, and in their own communities through Workforce on Wheels and the Mobile One-Stop, and other community outreach efforts in all eight Wards. Ensuring access to quality workforce development programs and services is a priority for the WIC and District agencies. As a result of the Career Pathways Strategic Plan, agency partners are examining how their programs and services fit into the career pathways approach and are making adjustments to ensure residents successful movement to and through a career pathway. In alignment with WIOA, the District's Unified State Plan, and the Career Pathways Task Force recommendations, future OSSE AFE-funded providers will be required to offer integrated education and training services that align with the vision and goals of District's workforce development system. In preparation for this requirement, OSSE AFE has provided substantial technical assistance, professional development, and support to its current providers regarding this model of instruction. Eligible providers serving adult learners at the Beginning Adult Basic Education/English as a Second Language literacy levels will be required to imbed career awareness in one or more of the WIC approved career sectors into their instruction. This model could include the provision of contextualized learning opportunities appropriate to their skill level that introduce lower-level learners to WIC approved industries and occupations, industry specific terms, occupation specific equipment, and provide opportunities to participate in site visits or field trips, and talk to/interact with employers and other individuals currently working in those respective fields, etc. These activities would occur through contextualized instruction focused on improving their basic literacy and numeracy skills, preparing for their transition to Intermediate level programming. Eligible providers serving adult learners at the Adult Basic Education/English as a Second Language Intermediate literacy levels or at the Adult Secondary Education levels will be required to offer integrated education and training towards an industry recognized certification in one or more of the WIC approved career sectors and/or workforce preparation activities. These models could include funding for single organizations that have the capacity and expertise to offer both the academic education and industry training towards an industry recognized certification in one of the WIC approved career sectors or for a set of partner organizations that could include an adult education provider, an industry-specific job training provider, an institution of postsecondary education, and/or an employer. Similar to the current funding approach, OSSE AFE will apportion future funding opportunities in a manner that ensures adult learners across the educational continuum would have access to appropriate educational opportunities. This apportionment will be informed by a review of the current educational functioning levels of the District's adult learners and62will help to reduce perverse incentives to serve only those residents who are already functioning at the highest levels. Additionally, all future OSSE AFE providers will be required to provide transition services towards the next step in the educational continuum. This would include transition services from ABE to ASE or from the GED/NEDP to postsecondary education (including certification programs or 2 and 4 year degree programs through the development of dual enrollment and articulation agreements). This would also include connections to employment and/or apprenticeship opportunities. District residents often face one or more barriers which prevent them from accessing education and training programs and from ultimately being successful in the workforce. Consequently, the District's workforce system must take meaningful steps to help remediate these barriers to ensure residents are able to overcome obstacles and attain their goals. A common barrier is economically- related as residents need to work to support themselves and their families. Due to this, agencies are working to increase access to earn and learn opportunities through partnerships and innovative methods including expanding apprenticeship and on-the-job (OJT) training opportunities. Other common barriers include health issues (both physical and behavioral), transportation costs, housing, income supports, and child care. Consequently, workforce system partners are strengthening partnerships among one another as well as with other District agencies that can provide barrier remediation services for our residents, such as the Department of Behavioral Health, the Department of Human Services, and OSSE's Division of Early Learning. District agencies and partners have multiple efforts to increase access to workforce services through community outreach. DOES's Workforce on Wheels is a mobile team of workforce development specialists who provide AJC services in non-traditional environments to reach those demographics who may not visit one of the AJCs. The Mobile One-Stop is a tool of the Workforce on Wheels staff to bring AJC resources to the community. It is used at community events and can be requested by the public. Additionally, DOES is establishing satellite AJC offices in Wards with high unemployment. As the core and partner programs move forward with WIOA implementation, further opportunities to increase residents' access to services and remove barriers will be identified, evaluated, and implemented. 3.Sector Strategies /Alignment with Business Needs Goal: The District's business community gains access to a broader pool of District residents with the skills necessary to meet their needs and advance within their organizations and informs workforce investments and incentives that effectively match jobseekers with their needs. Strategies: 3.1 - Coordinate and expand business advisory committees under the WIC in each high-demand sector; and leverage their expertise to inform workforce system activities and career pathways development - including through feedback to external education and training providers. 3.2 - Expand business-driven training options, including apprenticeship, on-the-job training, customized training for businesses with significant hiring needs that responds quickly to demand.633.3 - Create a unified business services strategy to better align outreach efforts to employers and offer more comprehensive services to meet their needs. 3.4 - Utilize labor market intelligence to identify key businesses for outreach and occupations with emerging demand, and ensure training resources are aligned accordingly. 3.5 - Leverage the WIC's Workforce Intermediary program funding to support new sector strategy activities and supplement existing efforts. 3.6 - Expand and re-evaluate available incentives for businesses to hire District residents. With a revitalized board, a new Chairperson, and a new Executive Director, the WIC is making renewed efforts to strengthen sector partnerships and align workforce services with the needs of businesses. The WIC has established business advisory committees in the construction and hospitality sectors in partnership with DOES and UDC-CC that provide input and expertise for the Workforce Intermediary Program and broader system efforts in those sectors. The WIC will convene additional committees for healthcare, security and law, and business administration and information technology; and also leverage the efforts of the Career Pathways Task Force to inform workforce investments. Workforce system partners will be included in these engagement efforts to ensure that information gathered helps inform their programming, and will also be disseminated more broadly. The WIC has funding available through its Workforce Intermediary program to support new and innovative sector strategy activities. With several new board members from high-demand industries, the WIC will begin planning for additional service offerings with the input of key business stakeholders in these sectors. In feedback collected from employers, they reported several challenges in accessing effective business services, including lack of coordination among and within government agencies, too often hearing from multiple providers and agencies that are looking to place their participants without coordinating efforts, and difficulty in understanding and navigating programs and incentives that exist that may meet their needs. Consequently, the WIC and DOES have been working in conjunction with agency business engagement and job development staff to develop a unified business services plan. This plan would streamline both outreach and services to area businesses in order to better meet their needs and provide more comprehensive services. DOES's Employer Services team already provides significant services to business partners, including competency- based assessment pre-screenings, targeted hiring events, technical support, access to workforce system clients with documented skill sets, compliance assistance, and apprenticeship registration. Job development services are also provided through other agencies, including DDS/RSA and DHS. Moving forward, the District will look to build on these offerings and implement a unified business services plan that better coordinates efforts and continues to improve quality. The WIC and DOES will use labor market intelligence to identify those businesses and occupations with emerging demand so we can respond quickly and align training programs. Some of these efforts are already underway through ongoing analyses, but additional work with real time labor market data and economic intelligence data can help us be more proactive in identifying trends and meeting business needs. The WIC has updated its Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) policies to be more responsive to emerging demand in areas not previously identified, and allow for funds to be used more flexibly in aligning with these needs. Business advisory committees and other64engagement efforts, noted above, can also be helpful in confirming labor market trends and identifying opportunities for customized training, on-the-job training, or additional apprenticeship offerings. The WIC will also assess its policies to ensure that WIOA funds can be effectively utilized to respond to identified needs, and provide technical assistance to agency and provider partners in effectively responding to these needs. The District will look to expand and re-evaluate incentives for businesses for hiring District residents. As noted in other sections of this document, DOES and other AJC partners utilize On-the- Job Training as an incentive for hiring District residents, as well as wage subsidies through Project Empowerment and LEAP. The District is also re-evaluating federal and local tax credits available to businesses that hire DC residents to determine if changes and/or increased awareness may produce better results. The District's First Source law requires District resident hiring on many publicly funded projects, which is sometimes viewed as a burden by the business community, but efforts to assist businesses in meeting goals and to promote effective partners can also be helpful in incentivizing outcomes that help both jobseekers and employers. The District also possesses robust apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship program offerings to address the long-term skill needs of DC businesses in the construction sector, with plans for expansion into other industries and government agency partners. See Section III(a)(2)(D) - Coordination, Alignment, and Provision of Services to Employers for additional details on Sector Strategies /Alignment with Business Needs. 4.Performance and Accountability Goal: Workforce Services funded are evidence-based, high quality, and flexible in meeting individuals' needs; and District agencies will evaluate outcomes through standardized methodologies that ensure accountability and transparency. Strategies: 4.1 - Use performance data to drive decision making on workforce investments. 4.2 - Develop a customer feedback process for both job seekers and businesses that interact with the workforce system. 4.3 - Continue to move forward with data systems integration across agencies and funding streams, including the expansion of the Data Vault partnership and inter-agency data sharing agreements. 4.4 - Conduct comprehensive workforce system and provider evaluations using standardized and accurate data and consistent processes. 4.5 - Expand the use of performance based contracting and grant making, and make processes more consistent across agencies and programs. 4.6 - Create standardized report cards on service providers across the workforce system to facilitate informed customer choices. The District is committed to developing a robust performance management infrastructure that will allow us to closely examine our workforce and education investments and use the data and analysis65to make continuous improvements. To accomplish this, the District will develop an additional set of accountability mechanisms that are aimed at assessing the overall effectiveness of the District's workforce system. These include: Adult Education and Workforce System Performance Dashboard: The dashboard will outline key goals for the workforce system with specific measures and targets to gauge performance. This dashboard will be available to the public to ensure transparency and accountability. Scorecard for Training Providers, Service Providers and Employers: To better provide District residents with the best decision-making tools possible, DC will develop an instrument to evaluate the quality of the service providers currently in the workforce system, including adult education providers funded by OSSE AFE. This online tool that would allow residents to search service providers and make informed decisions about which providers meet their needs. CapStat . The Office of the City Administrator (OCA) uses CapStat to perform a deep-dive, analytical review of services and challenges in order to identify solutions. The OCA will do a CapStat on the WIOA plan annually to highlight what performance areas need to be improved as well as those areas that are working well. Common Data Dictionary and Methods for Measurement: To move the District's workforce system toward being more data-driven, it will develop a common data dictionary for workforce definitions, data locations and methods for measurement. DC will build off the work already being done on the Data Vault, a partnership between DOES and OSSE to share information about participants in the workforce and education programs. The development (and use) of a consistent set of data elements and formats for documenting content and structures help to make information systems more accessible - for example: table structures, collection protocols, data elements, and data element terms and definitions. Workforce System Evaluation: The District is committed to continuous improvement of its workforce system. To this end, the DC will work with an outside entity to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the workforce system during Year 2 of the WIOA strategic plan implementation. The outcomes will inform what progress has been made to date and where DC needs to focus in the second half of the strategic plan period to make continued progress toward meetings its goals. 5. Supporting Our Youth: Youth have access to a coordinated, accessible education and workforce system that provides the supports needed to prepare them for postsecondary success; including education, training, and competitive employment. Strategies: 5.1 - Ensure developmentally appropriate access and services for youth to DC's one stop system.665.2 - Provide youth access to supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, behavioral health services, and income supports so they can take full advantage of education and training programs. 5.3 - Leverage technology to engage youth and youth-serving partners to provide information and access to education, training, credentialing, and employment opportunities. 5.4 - Increase opportunities for work-based learning and career exploration, including through the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) and leveraging it as an entry point for year-round services and supports. 5.5 - Focus on facilitating seamless transitions between secondary and postsecondary education, training and employment. 5.6 - Maintain the focused attention and resources on engaging disconnected youth (youth 16 to 24 who are neither in-school nor employed). While the goals and strategies outlined above will have an impact on the youth population of the District, they are a special population that the Bowser Administration and the WIC seeks to focus on through specific and necessary strategies and activities. In line with WIOA's new requirement to focus Title I Youth funding on out-of-school youth, core partners have established a number of initiatives and partnerships to provide high quality and meaningful services to disconnected youth (youth ages 16 to 24 who are neither in-school nor employed). A number of these partnerships are outlined in the following section, although the District recognizes that many additional agencies and community-based organizations serve this population and will seek to expand current partnerships. While WIOA's Youth funding requirements are increased for the out-of-school population, the District is not losing focus of the in-school youth who are in need of support to graduate as well as transition to education, training, and employment after graduation. DOES is reserving funding to continue to support programs to in-school youth and RSA is enhancing collaboration with DCPS and the public charter schools to ensure youth with disabilities have the necessary transition and support services they need. The WIC and agency partners recognize that changes to the one-stop system are necessary to ensure youth are able to receive developmentally appropriate services. Several options are being explored on how to best do this with existing funding and infrastructure. This effort will be coordinated with, and capitalize on the lessons learned by, OSSE's Reengagement Center (REC), which acts as an education-focused one-stop for youth, ages 16 to 24, who dropped out of high school. DOES and OSSE are currently obtaining input from community partners and youth themselves, as well as conducting research on national best practices to help inform next steps. The approach to a youth appropriate one-stop will include a universal intake and referral process that would be supported by robust cross-agency training and program partnerships including an onsite presence from DDS/RSA to support youth with disabilities. To ensure youth have access to the supportive services they need, core partners and OSSE's REC will conduct a universally shared comprehensive assessment at intake in order to identify barriers to youth successfully engaging and completing education, training, and employment. The core partner programs will utilize WIOA funds to mitigate barriers during participation in WIOA-funded education67and training by providing the allowable supportive services. Locally funded supports will be used to augment and/or elongate these services to ensure long-term success beyond WIOA program participation. For instance, the District's Kids Ride Free program allows youth, between the ages of 5 through 21, who live in the District and attend a DC Public School (DCPS) or Public Charter School (PCS) to ride the rail and bus system for free when attending school or school-related activities. This program allows core partners to leverage this free transportation when enrolled youth attend school-related activities. As a whole the youth population increasingly uses and relies on mobile technology to communicate and access information. Consequently, the District's goal to leverage technology to engage youth and youth serving partners is fitting. DOES is working to modify its existing Virtual One-Stop (VOS), which provides access to employment opportunities, online training modules, available job training programs, and labor market information, to be more youth friendly. The core partners will also register youth in VOS through their universally shared intake system (as appropriate). DOES's Office of Youth Programs is piloting a badging program with next year's Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) participants and some community-based organizations, with potential expansion to WIOA core programs based on pilot results. The badging program is a virtual way to engage young people in online learning where they earn a virtual badge for their knowledge and skills in topical areas. In order to increase opportunities for work-based learning and career exploration for youth, agencies will ensure all youth in WIOA core programs have access to work based experiences which include year-round and/or summer paid and unpaid work placements/internships, on-the-job training opportunities, job shadowing, earn-and-learn opportunities, pre-apprenticeship programs, or apprenticeship programs. This effort will prioritize targeted groups including youth with disabilities, English language learners, youth re-engaging in education, homeless youth, and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth. These groups face the highest barriers in and outside of school; and, as such, work-based learning opportunities are even more important to help connect youth to a career pathway. The District wants to ensure that youth work experiences are as meaningful as possible and relate to their long-term goals. DOES and OSSE will align work experiences, both year-round and summer, to industries related to specific Career and Technical Education (CTE) Programs of Study for CTE concentrators, completers, or students who have declared a CTE focus. Additionally, DOES, OSSE, and RSA will collaborate to ensure youth with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), participate in year-round and summer work experiences that align with the transition goals in their IEP. Furthermore, DOES will ensure RSA representatives are integrated into the SYEP orientations for youth, their families, and employers, and work to identify youth with disabilities early enough to make appropriate job placements and work with employers on providing appropriate accommodations. Additionally, they will provide information about vocational rehabilitative services to youth (and their parents) who are participating in the program and ensure that youth with disabilities receive necessary support to be successful in any Summer Youth Employment Placement. Similarly, DOES will work with the REC to identify out-of-school youth who don't have a68high school diploma that are participating in both the SYEP and year-round youth employment programs for participation in REC services. OSSE will ensure that future Adult and Family Education (AFE) providers (who educate hundreds of older youth between the ages of 18 and 24) are required to offer an integrated education and training model as explained in the section above. Moreover, OSSE will also ensure that future OSSE AFE providers are required to offer transition services to postsecondary education, training, apprenticeships, and employment for all students at the adult secondary education levels. Similarly, all WIOA core partners will require that all participants in in-school WIOA funded programs and all REC clients nearing completion of their secondary education, have established a transition plan that includes specific and appropriate postsecondary goals. Students with an Individual Graduation Plan and/or an IEP with an appropriate secondary transition plan by the age of 14, as required by local statute, can be waived of this requirement. (B) Alignment with Activities outside the Plan. Describe how the activities identified in (A) will be aligned with programs and activities provided by mandatory one-stop partners and other optional one-stop partners and activities provided under employment, training (including Registered Apprenticeships), education (including career and technical education), human services and other programs not covered by the plan, as appropriate, assuring coordination of, and avoiding duplication among these activities. The agencies which operate the core programs rely on many other programs and partners to enhance their work and deliver the broad scope of services our residents require. Funded through both federal and local dollars, these partners support residents along their career pathways by providing supportive services to individuals and families, education and training, work experiences, and workforce activities. Although not exhaustive, an existing alignment of partnerships are outlined below. Operated by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education: Re-Engagement Center (REC): Similar to an educationally-focused youth one-stop, the REC works to engage educationally- disengaged District youth, ages 16-24, to enroll them in educational programming and mitigate barriers to their success. OSSE will work with DOES to establish an ongoing opportunity to refer REC clients in need of employment (approximately 35% of all REC clients) with subsidized employment opportunities that could be coordinated and contingent on their enrollment, continued participation, and progress in an education program. In addition to the technology initiatives of the core programs, OSSE's REC is developing a public facing website that will present information on all education options for older youth and adults. Once it is developed, it will eventually include information for occupational training programs (industry certification programs) specifically targeted for older youth and adults through collaboration with DOES.69Career and Technical Education (CTE): OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education (PCE) funds (through both federal Perkins and local dollars) multiple LEAs and individual schools to develop and offer CTE programs of study in high wage and high demand career sectors. PCE has also funded the development of ten initial Career Academies and is currently funding the planning year for an additional four Career Academies. These academies are supported by core industry advisory boards made up of local businesses from the relevant industry. The funding also supports several initiatives of UDC- Community College's including a portion of the student support teams, the dual-enrollment program, and the co-requisite remediation initiative. Furthermore, these funds support an educational vendor that provides supplemental CTE instruction for incarcerated youth in the DC Jail and the District's Microsoft IT Academy initiative, which provides digital literacy instructional support and resources at 20 DCPS or DC Public Charter schools. Office of Postsecondary Education: OSSE's Office of Postsecondary Education supports programs that improve the overall postsecondary enrollment and graduation rates for youth and adults in the District of Columbia. Through financial support from the DC TAG program and the DC Mayor's Scholars Undergraduate Program, and college and career readiness programmatic support, the Office of Postsecondary Education creates opportunities for District youth and adults to enroll in and complete their postsecondary education. To increase awareness of these resources and to coordinate efforts, information on Postsecondary Education resources will be integrated into DOES's SYEP orientation and DOES will identify out-of-school youth who have a high school diploma but have not entered postsecondary education to connect them to staff from the Office of Postsecondary Education for follow up postsecondary counseling. Similarly, information about resources available to provide District residents access to postsecondary education and training, (including information about UDC CC WDLL opportunities, DOES funded job training programs, DC TAG funding, DC Mayor's Scholars funding, and Dual Enrollment opportunities) will be made available to all youth participating in WIOA funded programs and recent GED recipients, diploma recipients that were part of the National External Diploma program, and REC clients who have recently graduated or are nearing graduation. Operated by the Department of Employment Services: Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP): SYEP is a locally funded initiative sponsored by (DOES) that provides District youth ages 14 to 21 with enriching and constructive summer work experiences through subsidized placements in the private and government sectors. Mayor Bowser expanded the 2015 SYEP to include youth ages 22- 24 years old to provide them with meaningful work experience and individualized support that will help them identify a career pathway. Though SYEP is a short-term employment and training program, the goal is to introduce youth to employers who will positively impact their futures. Collaboration between DDS/RSA, OSSE, and DOES ensures those youth who are individuals with70disabilities are identified early on and have the appropriate supports in place to be successful in their work experiences. Career Connections: Career Connections serves disconnected and justice-involved youth ages 20-24 in the areas of the city hardest hit by poverty and the recent spike in violence. Local funding provides these young adults with meaningful, paid work experiences for 9 months as well as no cost training through UDC-CC. Participants also receive supportive services to eliminate barriers to employment. DOES will prioritize Food Stamp eligible participants who do not currently receive TANF benefits for enrollment in Career Connections. The streamlined application process will make it easier for food stamp customers to connect to the program. In addition, DOES intends to host application/intake sessions at facilities recommended by DHS and will provide direct support onsite at DHS's Adams Place location. LEAP Academy: LEAP (\"Learn, Earn, Advance, Prosper\"), operated by DOES, is a network of interconnected partners utilizing the \"earn-and-learn\" approach that will link the city's unemployed residents with employment, education and training opportunities. The earn-and-learn approach applies the apprenticeship model to skill development, allowing individuals to earn a wage while participating in an on-the-job training experience and concurrently participating in related technical instruction. This framework allows individuals to earn wages and accumulate work experience thus bolstering their ability to advance along a career pathway and into the middle class. One of the eligibility requirements for LEAP is participants must first be enrolled in a District agency workforce program to utilize a co-enrollment approach. LEAP currently focuses on training residents for District government jobs but is planning to expand to private sector employers in the near future. Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) Program: DOLETA implemented the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment Program (RESEA) initiative in FY 2005 to help address two (2) of ETA's highest priorities: 1) to help unemployment insurance claimants become reemployed as quickly as possible and 2) to reduce erroneous payments. In PY 2014, DOES made significant upgrades to the RESEA technology systems. The upgrades allowed the agency to fulfill administrative and programmatic activities in accordance with federal guidelines and enhance alignment between programs. Reemployment program attendance reports were shared with the Unemployment Insurance (UI) staff on a weekly basis. Non-compliant RESEA customers became subject to interruption of benefits. Information about REA customers who returned to work full- time was entered in the database in a timely manner. Staff performed wage bumps and made follow-up telephone calls to ascertain the employment status of participants. During RESEA sessions, customers receive an orientation of the center services, UI disqualifications, resume review, work search review, LMI review and one on one job counseling. RESEA sessions are held every Monday at the AJC Northeast.71Office of Apprenticeship, Information and Training (OAIT): OAIT is responsible for administering the District's Apprenticeship program and the enforcement of DC Law 2-156 and the federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) on District-funded projects. These services include recruiting and enrolling apprentices; registering employers as apprenticeship sponsors; and providing oversight, technical assistance, and monitoring to ensure compliance with federal and state laws. This program is a comprehensive training that combines on-the-job learning experiences with supplemental job-related classroom instruction. In PY 2014, the DC Apprenticeship Council approved 23 new apprenticeship programs and 1,293 new apprentices were registered. In addition, six (6) company sponsors were conducting pre- apprenticeship initiatives for electricians, ironworkers, plumbers, ironworkers, and sheet metal and concrete form builders. Pre-Apprenticeships: The District is one of the few jurisdictions that directly funds pre-apprenticeship programs. DOES's Office of Apprenticeship, Information and Training (\"D.C. Office of Apprenticeship\") funds several pre-apprenticeship training programs for District residents. One particular hybrid model gives District residents the advantage of earning wages during their initial training period. This pre- apprenticeship training is a preparatory training initiative that prepares District residents to qualify for established registered apprenticeship programs. These programs are targeted to serve hard to employ residents, particularly those residents with certain deficiencies in math, aptitude testing and job readiness. Pre-apprenticeship training initiatives have been an effective tool to increase the number of District residents in existing apprenticeship opportunities. These programs are approved, overseen and funded by the District and run by labor union entities and companies with existing approved apprenticeship programs, recognized by the District of Columbia. In order for these entities to participate they must commit to increasing the number of District residents apprentices in their apprenticeship program by accepting all successful completers of the pre-apprenticeship program as apprentices. During the pre-apprenticeship training program period, all pre-apprentices will receive on-the-job work experience at job sites located in the District and the metropolitan area. The on-the-job training will be conducted under the supervision of skilled workers in the trade/job designation. Prior to participants being assigned to specific job sites, participants will be provided with preparatory field training that will include safety and OSHA 10 instruction where appropriate and other job readiness training. Pre-apprentices will also receive preparatory classroom related instruction that will include technical, theoretical and educational subjects related to the trade/job designation. This pre- apprenticeship will simulate a regular apprenticeship program; however, at a more elementary level. For several years the D.C. Office of Apprenticeship has funded annually, as many as six (6) pre- apprenticeship initiatives with existing union sponsors and, for the first time more recently, a non- union sponsor, which included Miller & Long, DC and the Electrical, Steamfitter, Plumbing,72Ironworkers, and Sheet Metal unions. Moving forward the District plans to fund existing programs and to expand pre-apprenticeship initiatives to include more non-union sponsors. Being one (1) of three (3) jurisdictions in the country that has a mandatory apprenticeship registration requirement, the District established the \"Step-up Apprentice\" classification, which gives District residents another avenue to qualify for union apprenticeship programs. Step-up Apprentices are indentured in the same as regular apprentices; however, this classification gives District residents, who may have slight deficiencies, a year-period to meet full apprenticeship eligibility requirements while gaining credit towards their program. First Source Employment Program: The First Source Employment Program has been an important part of the District's strategy to reduce unemployment in the city since 1984. The program is designed to ensure that District residents are given priority for new jobs created by municipal financing and development programs. Under this law, employers must ensure that 51 percent of all new hires on any government-assisted project or contract valued at $300,000 or more are District residents. Additionally, government- assisted construction projects receiving government assistance totaling $5 million or more must meet hours worked requirements for identified trades on the project as follows: Journey Worker - at least 20% of hours shall be performed by District residents; Apprentice - at least 60% of hours shall be performed by District residents; Skilled Laborer - at least 51% of hours shall be performed by District residents; and Common Laborer - at least 70% of hours shall be performed by District residents. The Semiannual First Source Report for the period of January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 reflects a 40.5 percent hiring rate on projects subject to First Source Employment Agreements. The submission of the Semiannual First Source Report period of January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015 realized a 47 percent hiring percentage. A total of 1390 District residents were newly hired during PY 2014. Project Empowerment (PE): The Project Empowerment (PE) Transitional Employment Program continues to be one of the District's most invaluable resources for persons with multiple barriers to employment. PE is a locally-funded transitional employment program that provides training and subsidized employment to District residents facing multiple barriers to employment, serving over five hundred participants each year, over 90% of whom have criminal records. PE participants are often the hardest to serve due to histories of homelessness, substance abuse, previous incarceration, or a number of other mitigating factors that make the attainment of permanent employment challenging. The PE program produces positive results year-after-year for participants and remains in constant pursuit of effective ways to serve District residents. In PY 2014, six hundred and twenty-four (624) residents graduated from PE's intensive, three-week Job Readiness Training (JRT). During that time period, three hundred73and sixty-nine (369) training graduates obtained permanent, unsubsidized employment earning an average wage of $12.47 per hour - approximately $2.00 higher than the District' current minimum wage. Retention rates among PE graduates far surpassed the national average of 50 percent at both the six-month and one-year benchmarks. Approximately 70 percent of graduates retained employment for six months, while 66 percent remained employed after one year. In realizing the importance of tracking retention data among its graduates, PE employed continuous contact methodologies which are supported by the implementation of a monetary incentive for graduates who retain employment. DOES, in partnership with experienced training providers and area employers, expanded the Project Empowerment program to include an intensive IT training track. While Project Empowerment boasts a sterling record, historically, it has primarily connected participants to lower skilled jobs in the retail, service, and labor industries. The addition of the TechHire track provides PE participants a pathway to mid-and high-skill occupations in the IT sector, thereby, enhancing the quality of training provided and the caliber of employment obtained. Beginning September 2015, Project Empowerment increased its efforts to reach the District's homeless population through weekly information sessions at Adams Place, a day center in Northeast DC that is frequented by homeless residents. This initiative seeks to bridge the employment gap faced by homeless residents by providing the job training and work experience that employers seek. Residents who express interest in program enrollment are given placement priority and invited to attend the very next Project Empowerment orientation where they are scheduled for an intake interview. DC Jail Work Reentry Program: The District wants to ensure all residents who seek employment services - including those who have recently been incarcerated have access to comprehensive support to enter the workforce. District residents pending release from incarceration face a unique set of challenges when seeking to obtain employment. Limited employment history, inadequate educational credentials, substance abuse and mental health challenges are but a few of the obstacles faced by the clients this partnership serves. Through the development of life skills, job training, and basic computer training participants are better prepared for the employment challenges they will face upon release. To that end, the DC Jail Work Reentry Program was established in July 2015 in partnership with the Department of Corrections (DOC), to provide intensive 6-week job training for incarcerated persons with an impending release date. This program enhances the availability of employment options for returning citizens by beginning the process of reintegration prior to release. Inmates face a thorough screening and assessment to determine eligibility and suitability for the program. Those who are selected are transferred to an exclusive housing unit that is designated solely for the DJ Jail Work Reentry Program. A new cohort of no more than 20 participants begins approximately every six weeks. Job Readiness Class is held Monday through Friday from 9am to 4pm.The program offers a multitude of services including: job readiness workshops and classes, which closely parallel the Project Empowerment program, hands-on computer training through a74contracted computer instructor; case management for wrap-around services; and post-release services. Perhaps, the most exciting thing about this program is that those participants who take advantage of Project Empowerment referrals are able to start earning a wage almost immediately after being released. For these participants, the transition is significantly easier. The remaining graduates have an open invitation to join Project Empowerment and receive weekly follow-up from an American Job Center case manager. Partnership with the DC Department of Health: DOES partnered with the DC Department of Health (DOH) to establish a working relationship to enhance outcomes for District residents. DOH facilitates weekly workshops for both the Project Empowerment and the DC Jail Work Readiness Programs, using curricula designed to promote physical and mental wellness and healthy relationships, including parenting. The workshops provide an opportunity for participant skill development, education and resource sharing. DOH's support has enabled the provision of comprehensive job training that meaningfully addresses the multitude of factors (i.e. social determinants of health) to promote employment, long-term self- sufficiency and global well-being. Most recently, the agency has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the District Department of Health's Community Health Administration. This MOU provides DOES up to $250,000 for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2016 to allow Project Empowerment to conduct home visits with at-risk participants recently released from incarceration, collaborate with DOH on the development of participant risk assessment and retention tracking tools, and provide DOH with comprehensive outcome data on a quarterly basis. DOES will work with DOH to renew that MOU in 2017 and beyond to continue the distribution of those health services to this critical population. Veterans' Services Program: The Department of Employment Services has an unwavering commitment to support veterans seeking employment. Leading this work is the Veterans' Services Program, which ensures all Honorably Discharged Veterans receive priority in a multitude of services, including career assessments, job counseling, job referrals and targeted hiring events and are educated on the preferences made available to veterans seeking employment in the private, District Government, and Federal Government employment sectors. Through the Veterans' Services Program, a range of federally funded services known as the Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) and the Local Veteran's Employment Representative (LVER) provide resources and expertise to assist and prepare our clients to maximize their employment opportunities and protect their employment rights. We recognize that through their service, veterans gain valuable knowledge, strengthened characters, and transferable skills, but that translating and marketing those skills to the civilian labor market can sometimes be a challenge. That is why we make an effort to have veterans serving veterans , so that shared experiences and a mutual understanding of skills can enhance the quality of services provided to this special population. More details on services to veterans is found in section III(b)(7).75Partnerships with the Department on Disability Services: Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) and Developmental Disabilities Administration: DDS/RSA has agreements in place with the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) and the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) Agency. Consistent with these agreements, DDS/RSA has a vocational rehabilitation (VR) specialist assigned to work in each of these offices to work with youth in foster care and youth in the District's juvenile justice system. The VR specialist conducts intakes and provides rehabilitation services to assist these youth to obtain necessary services to prepare for and obtain employment. In an effort to increase barrier remediation, DDS/RSA has also strengthened its relationship with the DDA and with the DBH, in order to improve coordination in the provision of supported employment services for people with Serious Mental Illness (SMI), Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED), and Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD). The agency updated its policies regarding provision of supported employment services in order to ensure that there was a smooth transition from supported employment services with DDS/RSA to extended supported employment services with DDS/DDA or DBH. DDS/RSA is also finalizing an MOA with DBH, clarifying referral, service provision and cross training issues; and meets regularly with DBH supported employment staff and meets jointly with DBH and all supported employment providers. In FY 2015, a significant increase is expected in the number of people with SMI, SED and IDD who are served by DDS/RSA and who have successful employment outcomes. Operated by Department of Human Services: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and TANF Employment Programs (TEP): Operated by DHS's Economic Security Administration (ESA) the TANF program provides temporary income support assistance for low-income families while helping family-members improve their long-term employability with the ultimate goal of ending dependence on public assistance by helping people prepare for, secure, and retain jobs providing family-sustaining income. Towards the goal of improving long-term employability, the TANF Employment Program (TEP) uses a universal service delivery model and comprehensive assessment to provide a tailored complement of services for each TANF customer to meet their current level of skill and need. Through this universal service delivery model, TEP provides: Job Placement for customers with low personal and health barriers to employment and moderate to high levels of education and skills. Job placement services include: job preparation, job search assistance, actual job placement, and job retention assistance; Work Readiness for customers with low personal and health barriers to employment and low levels of education and skills. Work readiness services include: education, vocational training, work experience, and community service; Barrier removal and work support for customers with moderate to high personal and health barriers and moderate to high levels of education and skills. Barrier removal and work support services include: subsidized work, supported work, case coordination and76connection to intensive social services in the District (e.g. health, behavioral health, rehabilitation); and, Barrier removal and financial support for customers with moderate to high personal and health barriers due to temporary or permanent disability and low levels of education and skills. Community Services Block Grant (CSBG): CSBG, through its designated Community Action Agency, United Planning Organization (UPO), has developed Building Careers Academy in a 10,000 sq. ft. training facility that trains participants in the area of Building Careers/ Green Technology, with the purpose of preparing individuals for occupations that meet the needs of employers in today's labor market. In doing so, UPO now provides training that encompasses Professional Building Maintenance, Broadband and Telecommunications, and Plumbing and Weatherization. The course period has been expanded to 16-weeks for a full array of training that provides for more in-depth education into the subject matter. The goal of the program is to provide training in construction trades that builds twenty-first century skills and work experience of students/trainees to enable them to obtain higher wages, sustainable employment, and enhanced skills for higher degrees of self-sufficiency and independence. Students now learn, in addition to trade skills, effective jobsite communication, problem solving, professional behavior, and organizational skills necessary for successful careers. Building Careers Academy program participants enroll in the DCNetworks at the American Job Center with the support of a Job Readiness Coach. As the participants acquire new skills during the training, the Job Readiness Coach will assist them with updating their profile thus increasing their employability. The Coach will also assist with connection First Source Employment Agreement employers to the Academy graduates to meet their hiring needs. Through CSBG, UPO also provided Culinary Arts Training (ServSafe Certifications), Commercial Driver's License (CDL), training and IT Training (CompTIA Certification) to low-income residents of the District of Columbia. UPO will utilize their partnership and collaboration with the AJCs to continue activities such as job search and placement assistance, career counseling, job recruitment, providing job vacancy listings, providing information regarding filing of claims for unemployment compensation, assistance in establishing eligibility for programs providing financial aid for training and education programs. Food Stamp Employment & Training Program (FSET): FSET provides employment and training opportunities to SNAP recipients that do not receive TANF benefits. The purpose of the FSET program and its components is to assist SNAP participants in gaining skills, training, work or experience that will increase their ability to obtain regular77employment. 53F55To achieve these ends, FSET Program conducts an in-depth assessment of every customer to identify various barriers to education/training and employment in order to provide customers with the best possible services and resources to help them move promptly into employment and training. FSET services include: Transportation subsidies Childcare cost assistance Educational services On-the-job training Job placement and retention services One-on-one customized and personalized case management Use of a fully equipped computer lab Resume development Interviewing techniques Other employment & training related support services Customers are referred to appropriate supportive/wrap-around services with sister agencies or community partners as necessary to address barriers. Operated by Workforce Investment Council: In addition to its federally mandated role in WIOA core programs and overall workforce system coordination efforts, the Workforce Investment Council (WIC) also administers two locally funded workforce programs related to sector strategies and career pathways programming. Both leverage the expertise of WIC Board members and business and workforce stakeholders to help supplement other workforce system initiatives. These programs consist of: Career Pathways Task Force and Innovation Fund: In 2014, the DC Council required the Mayor to establish a multi-stakeholder Career Pathways Task Force that was responsible for developing a city-wide strategy for the development and implementation of career pathways programs for adult learners; and continuing to meet to help implement the strategy. The Task Force, which consists of both WIC Board members and other stakeholders, including agency leads for core WIOA programs, produced a plan that was released in early 2016 that has also helped inform WIOA planning. Based on the Task Force's efforts and findings, the DC Council passed legislation establishing a Career Pathways Innovation Fund to provide grants to design, pilot, and scale best practices in the implementation of adult career pathways and improve District performance on WIOA-mandated outcomes. The District appropriated $500,000 this year for technical assistance to help prepare for the issuance of these grants and plans to appropriate $1.5 million annually starting in fiscal year 2017 to implement this programming. The WIC used a portion of the FY16 funding on technical assistance for the 55USDA, SNAP Employment and Training Toolkit, 2013, Section 2: Essentials of an E&T Program78implementation of WIOA and the remainder will be used to develop a community of practice for adult basic education providers in the District. This community of practice will provide training and professional development to ensure providers have the resources and ability to incorporate national best practices for adult learners to successfully enter career pathways. The FY17 funds will support career pathways partnerships in high-demand sectors with special attention to helping residents with low levels of literacy and barriers to employment. The grants made through these funds help address workforce system strategies related to system alignment, sector strategies, access to career pathways, and will be coordinated by design with programming at other agencies and input from employers and stakeholders. Specific on the Innovation Fund will be further developed and shared at the Career Pathways Task Force meetings which are open to the public, its schedule can be found at dcworks.dc.gov. Workforce Intermediary Program: The Workforce Intermediary Program is a sector-based workforce development initiative that brings together multiple stakeholders in key industries with significant employment growth and importance to the local economy. The program promotes a shared understanding of industries' workforce needs, advances training that meets those needs, coordinates services for job seekers, and helps employers find qualified job candidates. The Workforce Intermediary is currently active in the hospitality and construction sectors, and may expand into additional high-growth sectors based on additional research and the work of the Career Pathways Task Force. The program convenes employer advisory groups in each sector to inform program efforts and provide feedback on broader workforce system considerations. Partner agencies and organizations with existing workforce and education programs in each sector participate in these advisory groups, and the program helps connect them to additional resources and employment opportunities. The Workforce Intermediary has received $1.6 million in local funds annually since its inception in 2013, and funding primarily supports performance-based grants to competitively-selected organizations that help fill gaps identified through employer and stakeholder feedback. Cross-Agency Initiatives: Homeward DC: Homeward DC is a five year strategic plan (2015-2020) to end homelessness in the District. DHS partners with agencies across District Government to implement this plan. The District has higher rates of chronic homelessness than other similarly sized cities in America, and family homelessness has increased a staggering 50% over the past five years. The City spends millions of dollars every year to simply manage homelessness, while the root causes remain. Homeward DC will do better than this and create pathways to the middle class. Employment is a cornerstone to addressing homelessness. As part of Homeward DC, DHS and several other partners have been working to implement strategies for (1) providing targeted job training and placement assistance for individuals and families in the shelter system, with a particular focus on households assessed for Rapid Re-Housing assistance, and (2) to coordinate with the District Government during the planning phase of large projects to ensure the District can provide a pipeline of trained/work-ready applicants (who are participants in homeless programs).79Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH) Focus Group: Connecting adults experiencing homelessness with critical employment supports is key to reducing barriers to housing and making that experience rare, brief and non-recurring. The Department of Human Services, along with their TANF and homeless services partners, provide critical case management and work readiness support, including resume preparation, interviewing skills, and job readiness workshops. However, many residents lack the education and training foundation needed to compete in the District's regional economy. These barriers affect various populations experiencing homelessness differently, (i.e. returning citizens are not eligible for many housing subsidies, parents must find housing suitable for children, and young adults exiting the foster care system are new to navigating the housing system). DOES has formed a focus group, comprised of homeless and formerly homeless residents, homeless services providers, the DC Department of Human Services, and other DC agency partners and experts, which will meet to develop official recommendations to ensure the workforce system rapidly assists residents experiencing homelessness with their immediate need for employment, while moving them along a career pathway. (C)Coordination, Alignment and Provision of Services to Individuals. Describe how the entities carrying out the respective core programs, Combined State Plan partner programs included in this plan, and mandatory and optional one-stop partner programs will coordinate activities and resources to provide comprehensive, high-quality, customer- centered services, including supportive services to individuals including those populations identified in section II(a)(1)(B). The activities described shall conform to the statutory requirements of each program. The District is working to make its American Job Center (AJC) system the cornerstone of the workforce system and ensure that individuals receive coordinated and high-quality services from all one-stop partners. The agencies that comprise the one-stop partner programs have been meeting on a continual basis to examine the current model and identify where further integration needs to happen to solidify the District's vision for its one-stop system. This vision includes: Customers experience no wrong door. Regardless of customers' needs, they will receive the appropriate services or referrals to address barriers and assist them in meeting their goals. Excellent customer-service is provided to all customers. Staff are trained to provide high- quality and consistent services to both job-seekers and businesses in a welcoming and engaging environment. Service delivery is customer-centered. Partners integrate services to ensure customers experience seamless delivery of services and warm handoffs when necessary. The American Job Center partner agencies and programs include:80Department of Employment Services (DOES) WIOA Adults WIOA Dislocated Workers WIOA Youth Wagner-Peyser Act Programs and Activities Unemployment Insurance Programs authorized under District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Law Veterans' Workforce Programs Trade Adjustment Assistance Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), as authorized under Title V of the Older American Act of 1965 (42 USC 3056) District of Columbia Department on Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA) Vocational Rehabilitation Programs, as authorized under Parts A and B of the Title I of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 720) District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Any postsecondary career and technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (20 USC 2301) Adult Education and Family Literacy activities authorized under Title II of the Workforce Investment Act Department of Human Services (DHS) Employment and training activities carried out under the Community Services Block Grant Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) District of Columbia Housing Authority Employment and training activities carried out by the Department of Housing and Urban Development Job Corps Washington, DC Outreach and Admissions Job Corps outreach activities Department Of Employment Services operates four AJCs throughout the District and mandates that the centers be certified as either a comprehensive center or an affiliate center in accordance to the81WIC Policy No. 2013.003. A comprehensive AJC as well as affiliates sites must provide career, employment, and training services specified in Section 134 of the WIOA, and provide job seeker and employer access to AJC partner services listed in Section 121(b). Each AJC in the District is equipped to provide all District residents with all DOES programs; however, a comprehensive center provides customers with access to all of the AJC partner programs through either on-site services or referrals. The roles of the co-located one-stop partners are clearly defined in existing MOAs and MOUs between DOES, OSSE, and DDS/RSA. Resource contributions of the one-stop partners are currently being examined and this topic requires further planning. Through the District's AJCs, customers receive direct access to DOES staff and partners in support of their job search efforts. Services delivered through the AJCs are completely based on customer choice, allowing each customer to determine which services they would like to pursue. AJC staff is provided with tools and resources to make recommendations and work with customers to determine their individual plans based on an initial assessment. All customers are provided with assistance in the completion of their DC Networks registration, job search assistance, job readiness workshops, and labor market information. Those who are assessed as needing more intensive services and meet eligibility requirements for WIOA are enrolled and matched with a Workforce Development Specialist. WIOA's provision for career services provide comprehensive assessments, development of individual employment plans, group/individual guidance and counseling, career planning, prevocational services, and a variety of specialized services and workshops tailored to the customers' needs. Customers are provided with an Individual Employment Plan that identifies the customer's goals, appropriate educational and employment objectives, and the most effective methods for securing employment. Customers focus on securing employment, obtaining training that will lead to employment, or both depending on their needs. They will work with their assigned Workforce Development Specialists to explore career/training options and related needs, attend career development workshops, enroll in an educational component, address any barriers to employment, and identify and resolve any deficiencies. Additionally, Workforce Development Specialists make referrals to one-stop partners based on each individual's needs. The specialists coordinate with partner service providers on customers' Individual Employment Plans and ensure the service strategies in place are coordinated and comprehensive. Occupational Skills Training is also available to employed and unemployed adults and dislocated workers who have met the eligibility requirements; are in need of training services and have the skills and qualifications to successfully complete the selected training program. The selected training programs are directly linked to the demand occupations in either the local area in which they reside or in areas where they are willing to commute for employment. Occupational Skills Training programs funded through individual training accounts (ITAs) must be accessible through the AJC. Other training services may include:82On-the-Job training; Programs that combine workplace training with related instruction, which can include cooperative education programs and registered apprenticeship programs; Skills upgrading and retraining; Job readiness training (this should not be mistaken as short-term prevocational training, which is an intensive service, this training service is occupation-specific); Adult education and literacy activities when provided in combination with any of the previously listed training services; Customized training; and, Registered Apprenticeship. Supportive services, allowed under WIOA 134 (d)(2), are provided to eligible adults and dislocated workers when they are determined necessary for the customer to participate in employment and training activities. Supportive services must be based on an objective assessment that is described and justified in the participant's Individual Employment Plan and documented in case notes. They are provided only when the customer is unable to obtain such services through other programs. The WIC will work with the AJC and agency partners to ensure that supportive services are coordinated through the District's AJC Memorandum of Agreement. Supportive services are extremely important to our residents in order to remove barriers to their success and enable successful completion of training and other activities authorized under WIOA Title I. These services include: Transportation assistance Childcare assistance Training and work-related clothing, including uniforms and tools Housing assistance Employment-related medical testing and background checks In addition, WIOA participants that are enrolled in a training program may also be eligible to receive needs-related payments to improve their chances of successfully completing the training. Participants receiving needs-related payments must be enrolled in a WIOA-funded training program, unemployed, and not qualified (or no longer qualified) to receive Unemployment Compensation. The District is considering including legal aid supportive services that may be necessary to secure employment, a consideration recommended in WIOA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). Those would include: criminal record expungement, resolving credit and debit issues, and support in reinstating or receiving their driver's license. In addition to the career, training, education, and support services, there is also an Employment Opportunity functional team. This functional team works to find placements for customers determined to be job ready, and build relationships with the business community. The team is83comprised of members from the Business Services Group (BSG) as well as AJC Workforce Development Specialists. The duties and services provided by this team includes: Research and maintain labor market statistics and trends amongst current AJC customers in DCNetworks / VOS and in the Washington DC area; Build relationships with employers, including sector partnerships and business alliances; Conduct business outreach; Communicate placement opportunities with Center Manager; Review job candidate qualification; Confirm placements and hiring with recruiters and BSG; Secure placements for customers who have successfully completed training programs; Maintain an active employer contact base via the BSG and employer stakeholder relationships; Maintain contact with employers during customers' placement period and report outcomes in DCNetworks / VOS; Perform job coaching, as needed, with placed customers to ensure that they maintain employment and handle any difficulties (within reason) that arise in a timely manner and with communication to all stakeholders; Develop communications with job bank representatives to ensure opportunity activities are related to open and current positions; and, Host business forums, networking events, and outplacement. Customers eligible or in need of education and training services are referred to co-located OSSE providers for services including assessment of literacy and numeracy skills through the CASAS (Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System), learning disability screenings, and referrals to appropriate providers based in individual needs (ESL, literacy, etc.). Staff also track and monitor educational attainment of individuals, and provide technical assistance to DOES staff related to CASAS implementation. RSA plays an integral role in the delivery of services to individuals in the AJCs. Services provided by RSA staff to eligible individuals with disabilities include: conducting comprehensive and specialized assessments, creating Individualized Plans for Employment (IPE), providing counseling and guidance, career planning including career exploration, training or postsecondary education, job search and placement assistance, and supported employment services and referrals to other agencies as appropriate. Additionally, RSA provides technical assistance to the one-stop system on assistive technology and accessibility of each of the AJCs. For more on the roles of one-stop partners, refer to current Memorandums of Agreement and Understanding in Appendix 4. As previously mentioned, the District's AJC system is pursuing the development of a partnership with Department of Human Services' Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. By integrating TANF programming into its delivery of services, the District can ensure that services are coordinated and not duplicated for those residents who may otherwise access TANF services at84a DHS location as well as other workforce services at an AJC. The identification of supportive services will also be enhanced in this co-located model. Additional methods of coordination of services to individuals are outlined above in Section (A). (D)Coordination, Alignment and Provision of Services to Employers. Describe how the entities carrying out the respective core programs, any Combined State Plan partner program included in this plan, mandatory and optional one-stop partner programs will coordinate activities and resources to provide comprehensive, high-quality services to employers to meet their current and projected workforce needs. The activities described shall conform to the statutory requirements of each program. The District engages and serves employers in its workforce system through a number of channels, including the following: WIC Board business representatives help ensure workforce system policies facilitate high- quality services to employers, including through informing training investments and management of Workforce Intermediary program (locally-funded sector workforce initiative). DOES's Business Services Group (BSG) serves as a primary direct business services provider across most core and combined programs, with WIOA participants referred to screening and placement services, apprenticeship opportunities, and other services designed to address business needs. This group also helps employers that have District resident hiring requirements through the First Source program identify qualified candidates to meet their needs. In addition to BSG, job developers operate within a number of other District agencies, including at DDS and DHS, to assist employers in identifying qualified jobseekers that have received services through their respective programs. Key business service types that the workforce system can provide include pre-screening or facilitated human resource functions, post-placement retention support, subsidized wages, tax credits, subsidized employer-specific training (e.g. customized training, on-the-job training, pre- apprenticeship, or apprenticeship), and positive publicity for key business partners. These services are currently offered to varying degrees through existing programs, but the District is working towards a more coordinate approach that better serves business needs. The WIC and DOES have been working to engage businesses and other employers over the last year to gather information on how to best meet their needs and identify challenges they have in partnering with our workforce system. These efforts included a recent forum and series of one-on- one calls in preparation for this plan. Through these conversations, employers cited several key challenges, including Lack of coordination of services to businesses and difficulty in obtaining information on the programs that best meet their needs.85Multiple providers and agencies that are looking to place their participants contact them regularly without coordinating efforts, which is cumbersome. Hiring incentives that exist are difficult to access and manage administratively, and additional targeted incentives could be helpful in encouraging business collaboration. More positive recognition for businesses that are effective partners with the workforce system and that successfully meet First Source targets would be helpful in enhancing partnership efforts. Jobseekers referred for openings do not always meet business needs, though some employers noted improvement in this area in recent years. In response to these identified needs and challenges, the WIC and DOES have been working in conjunction with agency business engagement and job development staff to develop a unified business services plan. Led by the WIC, this plan would help streamline both outreach and services to area businesses in order to better meet their needs and provide comprehensive services. Information gathered from employers on their hiring needs will be shared to ensure we are equipping residents with the training, education, and skills they need to be employable. As part of these efforts, job developers from across District agencies have been meeting to share information and increase collaboration on processes such as hiring events, and additional cross- training is planned. Additionally, one of the Strategic Doing groups mentioned above focuses on streamlining business services and is working to create a collaborative space to share contact information for all District-wide employer account reps, job developers and success coaches. While the District is moving forward with efforts to better coordinate and enhance the quality of services to employers, significant capacity exists through current programming, including the following services administered through DDS/RSA, DHS, and DOES. DDS/RSA's Business Relations Unit (BRU) was established to develop relationships with businesses throughout the Washington DC Metropolitan Area. The BRU collaborates with businesses to educate them about RSA services and to identify their staffing needs for the purpose of gaining exposure and identifying employment opportunities for qualified RSA job seekers.86BRU services to businesses include: Conducting disability awareness education training Creating opportunities for businesses to market themselves to people with disabilities through Industry Spotlights, where job seekers learn about various businesses and the expectations for successful applicants and employees Creating opportunities for businesses to participate in mock interviews with job seekers and provide feedback Sharing employment announcements with job seekers Employers are invited to career day events which are industry specific to meet job seekers and share information to assist job seekers with identifying or solidifying their employment goal. Screening and identifying qualified employment candidates Educating business about tax incentives Sharing resources to assist businesses with retaining existing employees and sharing sources for reasonable accommodations Brain storming potential opportunities to increase the pipeline of qualified talent to businesses Identify candidates for internship/volunteer opportunities Since the passage of WIOA, RSA has identified one dedicated employment specialist to provide services to support the transition units. These services include supports to employers, job seekers, and students with disabilities. The employment specialist assigned to the transition units identifies businesses willing to provide paid part-time work experiences for students, as well as identifying permanent employment options for youth who have completed their education or training. This employment specialist also works in the DC Public Charter Schools to provide work readiness training for students with disabilities. In addition, he provides the same technical assistance to employers identified above, as the employment specialists in the General VR units provide. DHS's TANF Employment Program also provides job placement services to businesses through their contracted work readiness and job-placement service providers. Clients receive a number of services related to barrier removal, work readiness (education and skill-building activities, work experience), and occupational training before moving forward to employers, and the program also offers job retention assistance and incentives in coordination with DHS. Employer Services is an umbrella unit within DOES that is comprised of several employer- interfacing programs that include a Business Services Group (BSG), a First Source (FS) unit and the Office of Apprenticeship Information and Training (OAIT). These units provide employers with services such as, pre-screenings, hiring events, technical support, and job-matching to ensure District residents and regional employers have greater access to successfully navigate the District workforce system. Employer Services activities are focused on serving individuals enrolled in WIOA services, served through DC American Job Centers, and/or the DC Networks labor exchange database; and also support jobseekers engaged in other workforce system programming.87Business Services Group (BSG), the federally funded component of the Employer Services program, provides local businesses with essential services to support their workforce needs, as well as a variety of related resources, at no cost. Business owners, human resource professionals, recruiters, and government hiring managers can call on BSG team members to provide efficient and personalized attention to their workforce development needs. The BSG works with employers to co- host competency-based assessment pre-screenings and facilitate on-site application lab sessions, ensuring that job seekers possess the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to support employer investments in human capital. In PY 14, BSG created and/or extended a host of employer partnerships representing the following industries: Construction, Transportation, Non-profits, Retail, Hospitality and Leisure, Healthcare and Information Technology. BSG has provided mass recruitments for firms, such as, Lowe's Home Improvement, Clark Construction, M.C. Dean, GEICO, Greyhound, Enterprise Rental, American University, Chipotle, Busboys and Poets, Allied Barton, Marriott Marquis, Comcast, Department of Corrections, Baker DC, Universal Healthcare Management, Safeway, the Department of Human Services, DC United, Giant Foods, First Transit - Metro Access, WMATA and many others. BSG collaborated with the Mayor's Office of Community Relations to host several Ward focused events in the District. These targeted events were held in Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8 and have assisted local employers with recruiting for over 500 immediate openings from entry to senior level positions. BSG also facilitated training workshops for local non-profits and local agencies in the following categories: DCNetworks, resume development, and best practices for interviewing. These workshops were instrumental in providing more targeted recruitments, utilizing volunteers from outside entities to assist with the vetting process for local employers. BSG and First Source collaborated to increase the number of hires for District funded projects for both construction and non-construction opportunities. BSG has placed a heavy premium on organizations with emerging needs to hire and retain District residents. BSG's employer driven model has improved employer retention rates and has created more job opportunities for job ready candidates throughout the District. District efforts to provide effective services to businesses have improved significantly over the last year, with many of the activities described above representing significant departures from past practices that focused on larger hiring events and a less customized approach to meeting business needs. Feedback obtained from several business partners in the development of this plan confirmed that they view these changes positively. Moving forward, the District will look to build on recent successes and implement a unified business services plan that better coordinates efforts and continues to improve quality.88(E) Partner Engagement with Educational Institutions. Describe how the State's Strategies will engage the State's education and training providers, including community colleges and area career and technical education schools, as partners in the workforce development system to create a job-driven education and training system. The District and surrounding areas have a wealth of educational institutions, both secondary and post-secondary, that will be of great assistance in expanding the workforce development and higher education opportunities for District residents. Currently, efforts are underway to strengthen the connection between DOES and University of the District of Columbia-Community College (UDC-CC). There are currently standing meetings between executive leadership to engage in further conversation about how best to ensure a coordinated approach towards workforce development and access to higher education. The WIC has also been engaged in conversations in order to solidify the addition of UDC-CC classes and programs to the District's Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL). In the meantime, the UDC-CC's Division of Workforce Development and Lifelong Learning (WDLL) is currently serving as the primary training partner for the DC Career Connections Program, which will provide education, training, workforce development and work experience for approximately 400 District youth between the ages of 20-24 who reside in some of the areas of the city hardest hit by poverty and violence. The regional area of the District, Northern Virginia, and Maryland is home to a host of high quality four year universities, none of which are currently on the WIC's ETPL. Over the next year, the WIC will be making a concerted effort to engage colleges and universities whose offerings align with the in-demand sectors and occupations data. The WIC recognizes universities are an important component to career pathways to provide the four year and advanced degrees that many businesses seek in a competitive economy such as the District's. In addition to working with DOES in identifying the correct mix of program offerings, UDC-CC's Workforce Development and Lifelong Learning (WDLL) works closely with DOES' Business Services Group (BSG) to connect trained District residents to jobs. District residents receive training and career counseling from WDLL and are encouraged to create and maintain a profile in the DOES DC Networks system. The BSG then works with completers and employers to place District residents. We are initiating work with the Department of Human Services to serve TANF recipients and automate the attendance verification process. Within a unified, comprehensive workforce system, UDC will serve as an intake hub for District residents who want to advance their careers. The range of offerings at UDC - from workforce to graduate programs\u2014presents an opportunity to steer District residents into educational opportunities that will ultimately result in employment and career advancement. As additional residents are served, current programs will need to be scaled up and expanded to meet these needs. The approach outlined here can only be supported with appropriate funding for serving as the Education & Training hub (personnel, information system development) and serving additional students (training costs and facilities). At the same time, those seeking training will be supported by services from various DC agencies.89(F) Partner Engagement with Other Educational and Training Providers. Describe how the State's Strategies will engage the State's other education and training providers, including providers on the state's eligible training provider list, as partners in the workforce development system to create a job-driven education and training system. In addition to efforts to expand partnerships with UDC-CC and other higher education institutions noted above, including inclusion of more of these providers on the WIC's ETPL, the District will also look to expand access to other high-quality training provided outside of higher education institutions. The WIC's ETPL includes a number of CBO and for-profit training providers; and employers, local CBOs, organized labor, and for-profit providers, including apprenticeship instruction providers, also provide a number of non-federally funded training options outside of the ETPL that are accessible through AJCs and other agency programming. The District plans to better coordinate these training resources and ensure that jobseekers have access high-quality providers with clear links to employer needs by improving provider evaluation processes and expanding available options through the ETPL and AJCs. We will help facilitate customized training options that are directly linked to employer needs and/or provided by employers and organized labor; help facilitate partnerships between employers and training providers; and utilize advisory committees to ensure that training providers are linked to business feedback. (G)Leveraging Resources to Increase Educational Access. Describe how the State's strategies will enable the State to leverage other Federal, State, and local investments that have enhanced access to workforce development programs at the above institutions, described in section (E). Efficiently leveraging resources across the District will help to address the barriers residents face in accessing education and allow them to enter and complete education and training programs leading to employment. These range from payment for tests and credentials, addressing supportive services needs and efficiently providing child care and transportation assistance. As mentioned, provision of training for residents is readily available through the UDC-CC's Division of Workforce Development and Lifelong Learning, further collaboration between District agencies and UDC's WDLL will increase educational access for residents. While programs at the UDC-CC's WDLL are provided at no cost to residents, funded through local federal, and private dollars, the certification exams that follow the courses must be paid for by the student which can present a barrier for students. However, if enrolled in WIOA, federal funding could pay for the exams and remove this barrier. Supportive services, such as transportation assistance, can also be leveraged for residents enrolled in WIOA and attending either UDC-CC or an OSSE AFE provider. One of the most persistent barriers for District residents in DC's adult education and/or workforce development systems is the lack of child care. Looking at data from the District's recently launched Re-Engagement Center's (REC) first year of operations, 64, or 20 percent, of the 318 youth served by the REC last year identified the lack of child care as a key barrier to their successful enrollment and completion of high school or an alternative secondary education program. Furthermore, the costs of child care in the District only exacerbate this issue. However, while the District leads the90nation in costs, it also leads the nation when it comes to providing public pre-school options for all three and four year olds in the District. According to OSSE's \"The State of Pre-K in the District of Columbia: 2014 Pre-K Report\" the District serves over 80% of all District three and four year olds, as compared to the next highest state which only serves a total of 46% of their three and four year olds. Additionally, the District has invested substantial local and federal funding in early child care subsidies to help mitigate the need for child care for infants and toddlers for low and moderate income residents. This provision of child care vouchers is a critical resource for District residents and, through additional collaboration, can be better utilized to support residents in DC's adult education and/or workforce development systems. Leveraging this resource and borrowing from a successful partnership between the REC and OSSE's Division of Early Learning, in 2016 staff from all four of DC's American Jobs Centers will be trained on the child care voucher program eligibility requirements and will be empowered to determine eligibility and provide vouchers directly to District residents in need of this resource. Through thoughtful leveraging of resources with particular attention to the coordination of support services access to education and training programs will be expanded. These efforts detailed here will be used as a template to expand other comparable and similar opportunities as they develop. (H)Improving Access to Postsecondary Credentials. Describe how the State's strategies will improve access to activities leading to recognized postsecondary credentials, including Registered Apprenticeship certificates. This includes credentials that are industry- recognized certificates, licenses or certifications, and that are portable and stackable. As noted in WIOA, access to the right credentials is critical to successful employment opportunities for the District residents. Several partners currently utilize attainment of credentials as critical to their success. These efforts illustrated below will be expanded and enhanced to better serve District residents. The Office of Apprenticeship has taken steps to expand apprenticeship opportunities for DC residents, particularly disadvantaged and hard-to-employ residents through pre-apprenticeship initiatives. These pre-apprenticeship initiatives are coordinated in partnership with registered apprenticeship sponsors, who agree to provide preparatory training that is designed to assist residents in meeting eligibility requirements of the sponsors' formal apprenticeship programs. The participating apprenticeship sponsors also agree to accept all successful completers as registered apprentices. The pre-apprenticeship initiatives have continually contributed to the increased number of DC residents as new apprentices annually and is the most effective training model used in the country for assisting and preparing disadvantaged residents, women, minorities and returning citizens for available apprenticeship opportunities. With the launch of the UDC-Community College in 2009, the Division of Workforce Development and Lifelong Learning (WDLL) was formed from existing workforce offerings. Since that time, WDLL has grown to serve nearly 3,500 District residents annually. As part of this growth, WDLL has evolved to focus on two things - career pathways and student success. WDLL aligns course offerings with high-demand, high-growth occupations as determined by research by DOES and employer demand. The majority of classes lead to third-party industry certifications. WDLL's data-91informed approach has led to a focus on building stackable certificates in five career pathways: IT and Office Administration; Hospitality and Tourism; Construction and Property Management; Healthcare Administration and Clinical Care; and Transportation. As a division within the Community College at UDC, students have a unique opportunity to obtain career training while being college students with student IDs, UDC email accounts, and full access to University resources. Nearly 300 students have transitioned to for-credit programs. This is part of the focus on student success and a recognition of the advantages a degree confers on a District resident. In addition to highlighting their role as students, WDLL provides student support services and student advancement focused on the unique needs of workforce students. WDLL reports data on a semester and annual basis. The District is also expanding its youth programs to ensure that youth have access to programs leading to industry-recognized certification in a diverse range of in-demand occupations. Beginning in PY15, the District will expand the number of slots available to out-of-school youth in its YouthTech program, which is a component of the Pathways for Young Adults Program that provides youth with hands-on training and certification as IT Helpdesk professionals. Likewise, the District's expanded Youth Earn and Learn Program will include certification in Information Technology, Hospitality and Customer Service, and Flooring Installation. Additionally, as aforementioned, future OSSE AFE providers will be required to offer integrated education and training services which is a best-practice model of instruction that research shows leads to better outcomes, including the completion of more industry-recognized credentials. Also as stated earlier, all future OSSE AFE providers will be required to provide transition services to District residents, which will include the establishment and/or expansion of articulation agreements and/or dual enrollment agreements between CBOs/adult-serving schools providing secondary instruction with postsecondary education and training programs including apprenticeship programs. Similarly, OSSE will continue to work with secondary schools and postsecondary education institutions and training programs to provide dual-enrollment and articulation opportunities for the District's secondary students. This will include the establishment of direct connections between CTE programs and registered apprenticeship programs. Furthermore, OSSE has focused both its local and federal funding for CTE on programs of study that culminate in industry-recognized credentials and/or dual-enrollment or articulation into postsecondary education and is improving its capacity to track certification attainment data. OSSE has also funded UDC CC to expand its' co-requisite remediation strategy which has been proven to increase completion rates for students that require remedial classes at the postsecondary level. Lastly, OSSE will work with WIOA Core partners, UDC CC, and individual schools and community based organizations to publicize available resources that support District residents' access to postsecondary education and training. This will include presenting on and disseminating information about UDC CC WDLL opportunities, DOES funded job training programs, and federal and local funding for postsecondary education (DC TAG and DC Mayor's Scholars Undergraduate Program).92As can be gleaned from these four current examples, there are significant opportunities to improve access to post-secondary credentials that will only expand over the course of WIOA implementation from these partners as well as additional partners as they are identified. (I) Coordinating with Economic Development Strategies. Describe how the activities identified in (A) will be coordinated with economic development entities, strategies, and activities in the State. The District's economic development and workforce development efforts are aligned in multiple ways, as increasing jobs and decreasing unemployment are key economic development goals. Additional efforts are underway to ensure better coordination moving forward. Current efforts that link economic development strategies to the workforce system include: In addition to the WIC's 23 private-sector members, the body also includes the District agency leads for economic development initiatives - the Deputy Mayors for Economic Development and Planning (DMPED) and Greater Economic Opportunity (DMGEO), and the Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD). This active private sector and economic development presence on the Board helps ensure that workforce policy is well aligned with the District's economic development strategies and activities. Mayor Bowser created DMGEO shortly after taking office in 2015, and tasked this office with facilitating investment and job creation in underserved District communities in order to improve economic opportunities for residents in those communities. DMGEO has oversight over DOES, the WIC, and DSLBD, allowing for a more targeted focus on linking economic development and small business growth with workforce programming. DMGEO's dual role in economic and workforce development helps ensure that a high-level focus is placed on District efforts in these areas, and agencies in this cluster meet frequently to help the office further its mission through coordinated efforts. DMPED's economic development work touches both real estate development as well as business attraction and retention. In all of its work, DMPED seeks to ensure that residents benefit through improved job opportunities and training. Significant examples include the transformative Wharf project along the Southwest Waterfront, which is providing funding for job training in addition to the requisite First Source compliance. On the business development side, the Advisory Board retention agreement, not only ensures 1,000 additional jobs for District residents, but also training and internship opportunities. In each case, DMPED worked with DOES and/or WIC to coordinate the community benefits with the larger workforce and labor strategies. The District's First Source program helps ensure that development efforts in DC are well connected to the workforce system by requiring that District residents are given priority for new jobs created by municipal financing and development programs. Under this law, employers must ensure that 51% of all new hires on any government-assisted project or contract valued at $300,000 or more are District residents. Additionally, government- assisted construction projects receiving government assistance totaling $5 million or more must meet hours worked requirements for identified trades on the project as follows:93Journey Worker - at least 20% of hours shall be performed by District residents; Apprentice - at least 60% of hours shall be performed by District residents; Skilled Laborer - at least 51% of hours shall be performed by District residents; and Common Laborer - at least 70% of hours shall be performed by District residents. In addition to First Source, numerous publicly and privately financed development projects include community benefits agreements, many of which specify workforce development efforts that may include funding for project-related job training. DOES provides targeted services to help ensure businesses are able to identify qualified District residents that meet their needs, in order to ensure the highest levels of economic and workforce development integration. The District has also initiated additional efforts to ensure improved coordination with economic development strategies moving forward. The program staff from DMPED, DOES, and the WIC meet regularly to ensure awareness of complementary programs and establish direct links between workforce programs and businesses that are expanding in the District. In addition to programmatic coordination, the District realizes that open and shared data are critical to making informed and impactful decisions around workforce development. DOES has an Office of Labor Market Research and Information that provides data and analysis to all stakeholders. Additionally, DMPED's Economic Intelligence Dashboard (http://dmped.dc.gov/dashboard) is a new public-facing effort to provide key economic data to government and external stakeholders. It includes a section on employment and workforce that is constantly growing with additional data. Finally, DC Networks and the Washington DC Economic Partnership have significant data related to the labor market that are valuable for business partners looking to expand in the District. (b) STATE OPERATING SYSTEMS AND POLICIES (b) State Operating Systems and Policies The Unified or Combined State Plan must include a description of the State operating systems and policies that will support the implementation of the State strategy described in section II Strategic Elements. (1) The State operating systems that will support the implementation of the State's strategies. This must include a description of- (A) State operating systems that support coordinated implementation of State strategies (e.g., labor market information systems, data systems, communication systems, case-management systems, job banks, etc.). (B) Data-collection and reporting processes used for all programs and activities, including those present in one-stop centers.94Agencies and partners use a variety of operating systems to support and document workforce development activities, gather data, and produce reports. Agencies make updates to the systems when necessary and provide professional development to staff to ensure data integrity and accountably. The systems and their functions are outlined below. As the District moves toward greater integration it's intended that agencies will eventually be able to utilize common systems. Department of Employment Services (DOES) DCNetworks DCNetworks, known internally as the Virtual One Stop (VOS), connects agencies, programs, and services electronically to assist and connect employers and jobseekers. The system provides integrated services via the internet for individuals, employers, training providers, workforce staff, and AJC partners, as well as, dramatically improves customer satisfaction, staff efficiency, and overall program performance. DCNetworks also provides easy access to real-time labor market information, allowing customers to compare information, such as, wage rates, the total number of jobs available, and the competitive landscape for jobs of interest. DCNetworks provides employers with great solutions for online recruiting through the use of advanced candidate search options, automated correspondence, and applicant tracking. The system also offers easy access to key reporting features to provide management with valuable information for improved service delivery and enhanced performance. Utilizing DCNetworks significantly increases the quantity and quality of the available talent pool, as well as, access to employment opportunities. Additionally, DCNetworks is utilized by DOES as it workforce development management information system to document and meet the accountability and reporting requirements of the Department of Labor under WIOA. This system will also aide the District in accomplishing its goal of overall data system alignment. Wage Record Interchange System (WRIS) The Department of Employment Services (DOES) utilizes the Wage Record Interchange System (WRIS) to facilitate the exchange of wage data among participating states for the purpose of assessing and reporting on the District's employment and training program performance, evaluating training provider performance, and for other related purposes. The exchange permits DOES to secure wage data of individuals who have participated in workforce investment programs in one state, then subsequently secured employment in another. By participating in WRIS, DOES has a more robust picture of the effectiveness of the District's workforce investment programs, and DOES is able to report more comprehensive outcomes against its performance measures. Unemployment Insurance (UI) The Department of Employment Services' Online Unemployment Compensation Program affords District residents an opportunity to file for unemployment compensation via the Internet, in addition to the telephone. District residents seeking unemployment benefits are strongly encouraged to do so online for quicker service. The Office of Unemployment Compensation (OUC), also referred to95as Unemployment Insurance (UI) Office, serves claimants and employers of more than 30,000 businesses in and around the District of Columbia. Department of Human Services (DHS) Automated Client Eligibility Determination System (ACEDS) The Department of Human Services (DHS) determines eligibility for major public benefit programs, including Food Stamps (SNAP), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and Medical Assistance. DHS currently uses the Automated Client Eligibility Determination System (ACEDS) as its information system to make eligibility determinations and provide assistance to District residents. The application, enrollment, and recertification processes are completed using ACEDS. The process for determining eligibility includes meeting with ESA Social Service Representatives (SSRs), who request and collect proof of eligibility criteria and enter supported data into ACEDS. SSRs also create client case files of supporting documentation and authorize eligibility. DHS is currently working with partner agencies to develop the DC Access System (DCAS), which will replace ACEDS as both an eligibility determination engine as well as the system of records for public benefit cases. Built to support the mandates of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), DCAS is being developed in a series of three releases. Release 1, already released, supported health expansion provided for under the ACA. Release 2, scheduled for the summer of 2016, will include the TANF and Food Stamp Programs. Release 3 will include non-magi Medicaid, as well as other benefit programs and case management functionality. Customer Assessment Tracking and Case History (CATCH) The TANF Employment Program utilizes the Customer Assessment Tracking and Case History tools CATCH1 and CATCH 2, a custom web-based case management system, collectively referred to as \"CATCH\". CATCH tracks the comprehensive TANF assessments completed by the customer; enables DHS to summarize the outcomes of the assessments; and refers customers to TEP service providers. CATCH also allows TEP service providers, sister agency providers (Department of Behavioral Heath, Child and Family Services Administration), housing providers, and the University of the District of Columbia to track and record customers' participation in work activities and generates monthly invoices based on that participation. The CATCH system utilizes data obtained from ACEDS. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) FAMCare The Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) utilizes a case management system called FAMCare. This application is a secure vendor hosted, cloud based application that's a96Juvenile Justice centric case management system. The web based application provides the ability to enter case notes, demographics data, treatment plans, education, intake, out processing and case histories of all youth under DYRS care. Additionally, it provides a mechanism to generate status reports, trending data, schedules, alerts and dashboards for case workers. Department on Disability Services/Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA) Vocational Rehabilitation Management (VR) The Department on Disability Services/Rehabilitation Services Administration's (DDS/RSA) electronic case management system is provided by an outside vendor, Libera. This company provides a Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) software package to the District, and 16 other VR agencies in the country. This is a specialized system that provides case management support and management information, to allow the agency to prepare all required federal reports related to its vocational rehabilitation and supported employment grants from the US Department of Education. Libera is in the process of making a number of changes to its system to ensure that the agency is able to track and report on all performance measures now required under WIOA, except those measures that require the agency to track post-closure data on participants. RSA will need to establish agreements with OSSE and DOES in order to collect and report on post-closure employment and education performance indicators. Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) Statewide Longitudinal Education Data System (SLED) The Office of the State Superintendent of Education's (OSSE) Statewide Longitudinal Education Data System (SLED) is a repository of student and education related data. SLED provides extensive PreK-3 to Postsecondary and Workforce educational data to schools and the District which enable better planning, trend analysis, performance projections, program evaluation, and stakeholder empowerment and in turn, improve educational outcomes of D.C. students. OSSE will be working to conduct data matching activities with GED Testing Services, Jacob France and the National Student Clearinghouse on student attainment of core indicators of performance. OSSE will also be data matching with DOES per a Data Sharing MOA between both agencies and exploring the feasibility of data matching with other DC government agencies (DHS, DDS/RSA, UDC-CC) on student attainment of core indicators of performance under WIOA. Literacy Adult Community Education System (LACES) OSSE AFE adheres to U.S. Department of Education, National Reporting System (NRS) guidelines and uses LACES (Literacy Adult Community Education System) to meet the accountability and reporting requirements of the Sections 212(c), 231(e)(2) and 212(a) of the Adult and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014,OSSE AFE mandates that local program providers collect and report student and local program performance, progress and outcome data to the state using LACES including:97Core Outcome Measures: Educational gains Entered employment Retained or improved employment Receipt of secondary school diploma or GED and placement in postsecondary education or training Secondary Outcome Measures: Reduction in receipt of public assistance Voting behavior Achieved citizenship skills Involvement in children's education Involvement in children's literacy-related activities Involvement in community activities Descriptive measures: Student demographics Reasons for attending Student enrollment status Participation measures: Contact hours earned and enrollment in instructional programs for special populations or topics (such as family literacy or workplace literacy). Data Vault The Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Adult and Family Education (OSSE AFE), in collaboration with Department of Employment Services, worked with Literacy Pro Systems, Inc., the developer of the OSSE AFE's management information system - LACES, to develop a conceptual framework and work flows for the data vault. The data vault was designed based on a single, multi-agency (OSSE AFE, DOES, and DHS) customer intake and referral process. The DC Data Vault 1) Facilitates the referral of customers to and from OSSE AFE and DOES for services (expansion plans include DHS and DDS/RSA); 2) Allows DOES staff to register customers for assessment services on a specific date/time at each American Job Center (AJC) and refer customers to the OSSE AFE onsite provider partner or another offsite adult literacy provider for educational services; 3) Provides access to information and notifications to key staff at each agency about customers (i.e. registering for assessments, being referred to a specific provider for services, status/updates on customers); 4) Links customers to programs and services (i.e. adult98literacy, occupational literacy, digital literacy, Career Essential Boot Camps, postsecondary education, and training) funded by the initiative; 5) Allows adult literacy provider staff and DC government agency staff to upload and maintain customer eligibility documents so that they can be accessed by each agency and eliminate the need for District residents to provide the same documentation to multiple agencies; 6) Links District residents to DC Networks to register in the Virtual One Stop system; 7) Tracks customer participation, performance, progress and outcomes; and 8) Facilitates cross agency communication, case management and collaboration of services for DC residents. University of the District of Columbia, Community College (UDC-CC) Banner The University of the District of Columbia, (UDC) uses Banner as the student information system for credit programs. Among other things, Banner is used to create ad hoc retention and graduation reports, track enrollment, class completion, financial aid eligibility, and human resources. In addition, Workforce Development and Lifelong Learning (WDLL) students are in Banner so they can receive UDC IDs and email addresses. AspirePath The University of the District of Columbia, Community College's (UDC-CC) Division of WDLL uses AspirePath as its student information system to meet the accountability and reporting requirements for grants (public and private). WDLL collects and reports student enrollment, progress, completion, and certification information using AspirePath. It is also used for student demographics, career pathway information, attendance, and contact hours. AspirePath can be integrated with external systems. XenDirect The University of the District of Columbia, Community College's (UDC-CC) Division of WDLL uses this information system to collect and report student demographics, course completion, certification, and attendance. (2) The State policies that will support the implementation of the State's strategies (e.g., co- enrollment policies and universal intake processes). In addition, describe the State's process for developing guidelines for State-administered one-stop partner programs' contributions to a one- stop delivery system, including benchmarks, and its guidance to assist local boards, chief elected officials, and local one-stop partners in determining equitable and stable methods of funding infrastructure in accordance with sec. 121(h)(1)(B). Beginning with the state plan modification in 2018 and for subsequent state plans and state plan modifications, the State must also include such guidelines.99The WIC has developed policies to enable collaboration among workforce partners, high quality workforce services, and ensure legislative, regulatory, and quality requirements are met for the workforce system. These policies are in regards to: Workforce system roles and responsibilities One-stop delivery system One-stop certification process Adult and Dislocated Worker Services and Eligibility Adult and Veterans Priority of Services Co-Enrollment Supportive Services Individual Training Accounts Eligible Training Providers Demand Occupation List Youth Eligibility, Program Design, and Selection of Service Providers The WIC's policy manual, which updates and replaces past policies established under WIA, was approved at the July 20, 2016 WIC Executive Committee meeting. WIC staff are currently working on updates to the manual based on WIOA regulations and DC WIOA working group discussions as needed. This updated policy manual will be shared with the WIC Executive Committee for their approval at their next meeting on September 15, 2016 and will subsequently be publically posted to the WIC website at dcworks.dc.gov and disseminated to workforce development system stakeholders. The WIC is currently working with District agencies with responsibilities for Core WIOA programs (DOES, OSSE, and RSA), as well as required partners to establish inter-agency agreements on one-stop partner programs' contributions to a one-stop delivery system. Currently the District's AJC system is funded exclusively through DOES, but with plans for increased co-location of services and new coordination requirements under WIOA, other agencies will begin making contributions to AJC operations after budget and co-location plans are finalized. The District plans to finalize a resource sharing framework by July 2016, consistent with the timeline for the development for a procurement process for one-stop operator(s), as referenced in Section III(a)(1) above. In the event that inter-agency negotiations are unable to yield agreements, the Mayor will be engaged to help finalize resource allocation decisions, as all relevant agencies report directly to the Mayor. As a single state-local area, the District does not need to address separate local resource-sharing agreement considerations.100(3) State Program and State Board Overview. (A) State Agency Organization. Describe the organization and delivery systems at the State and local levels for the programs covered in the plan, including the organizational structure. Include an organizational chart. The District is designated as a single-state area by the Department of Labor. As the chief elected official, Mayor Muriel Bowser acts in the role of the governor where federal guidelines require gubernatorial action. The Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) and the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity (DMGEO) provide oversight and leadership on the District's economic growth and workforce initiatives. They also manage agencies and commissions in line with each office's mission which forms their cluster. The WIC, under the management oversight of DMGEO and with DMPED administrative and technical support, provides oversight of the American Job Center delivery system and federally-supported workforce programs, while also ensuring that such programs and investments are more closely aligned with the city's economic development initiatives. DOES is under the DMGEO cluster and serves as the WIOA fiscal agent and local administrative entity. OSSE falls under the Deputy Mayor for Education. The Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services oversees both RSA/DDS and DHS. The Directors of District agencies are Mayoral appointees, confirmed by the District's City Council. Each agency is the focus of one or more DC Council committees that also provide oversight of agency budgets and performance. The District's organizational chart, demonstrating these reporting relationships, follows.101 102(B) State Board. Provide a description of the State Board, including--- (i) Membership Roster. Provide a membership roster for the State Board, including members' organizational affiliations. The Workforce Investment Council (WIC), serves as the District's State and Local Workforce Development Board (see Section III (a)(1) of this plan for a more complete description of the Board and its functions). The WIC Board has a total of 34 seats, with the following representation: 1. The Mayor, or his or her designee; 2. One (1) member of the Council of the District of Columbia (\"Council\") appointed by the Chairman of the Council; 3. The Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, or his or her designee; 4.

The WIC Chairperson, who shall serve as the chair of the Executive Committee; 2. Four (4) members of the WIC representing businesses in the District 3. A member of the WIC representing labor organizations 4. A member of the WIC representing a youth-focused organization Full Board Roster Can Be Found In Appendix 5. (ii)Board Activities. Provide a description of the activities that will assist State Board members and staff in carrying out State Board functions effectively. All newly appointed members are given an orientation that includes the responsibilities of being a board member, an overview of all board functions, an explanation of WIOA, and the strategies that the state is currently implementing to achieve determined workforce goals. Additionally, all Board members have access to the WIC website which includes policy, strategy documents, and other information. The WIC also has an Executive Director and staff in place with workforce development expertise to assist them in executing their Board responsibilities. The WIC also utilizes committees, subcommittees, and task forces to help focus member efforts and enables board members to achieve objectives within specific timeframes (see Section III(a)(1) of this plan for a more complete description of WIC). The composition of the Board is designed to enable input from industry, government, and nonprofit leaders to effectively determine the best policies to effectively implement WIOA in the District. (4) Assessment of Programs and One-Stop Program Partners. (A) Assessment of Core Programs. Describe how the core programs will be assessed each year based on State performance accountability measures described in section 116(b) of WIOA. This State assessment must include the quality, effectiveness, and improvement of programs broken down by local area or provider. Such state assessments should take into account local and regional planning goals. (B) Assessment of One-Stop Program Partner Programs. Describe how other one-stop delivery system partner program services and Combined State Plan partner program included in the plan will be assessed each year. Such state assessments should take into account local and regional planning goals. With detailed guidance pending from one or more federal partners regarding data definitions, sources, validation and submission requirements, the agencies operating the core programs will work together to adopt joint performance reporting requirements as outlined by the WIOA. Joint performance measures for WIOA will consist of six customer outcomes specific to core indicators of105performance and employer (customer) satisfaction by program. The District's negotiated performance measures for PY 2015 for Titles I and III will remain the same as in PY 2014. The District will work to meet or exceed to these benchmarks and will collect and asses the necessary data to determine performance levels under new WIOA standards for PY 2016. The District reports all performance measures quarterly. These reports allow the District and other areas to monitor performance outcomes in order to establish trends and identify measures requiring correction action. Baseline performance data will be collected in the first two years as pertinent for negotiating levels of performance. As outlined in our Data and Performance Strategy above, the District is starting several new initiatives to assess the effectiveness of partners as well as the workforce development system as a whole. The Workforce System Performance Dashboard will outline our workforce system goals along with performance measures for each. The specific measures and targets will be developed and made available to the public prior to the July 1, 2016 implementation of the District's Unified State Plan. The District's new evaluation initiatives are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the workforce system operations and high-demand occupation projections for the District and its surrounding area.

Beginning with the state plan modification in 2018 and for subsequent state plans and state plan modifications, provide the results of an assessment of the effectiveness of the core programs and other one-stop partner programs and Combined State Plan partner program included in the plan during the preceding 2-year period. Describe how the State is adapting its strategies based on these assessments. The District's previous assessment results from core programs and TANF are outlined below. These previous assessment results have helped guide the strategies developed to enhance outcomes and create better opportunities for District residents to be successful. While the District is not required to provide this information for WIOA programs until the state plan modification in 2018 and for subsequent plans and modifications, we have elected to include this information to provide context from WIA. TITLE I\u2014Workforce Investment Act The District's performance goals for PY 2014 were established in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA). This report covers performance and activities for Adults, Dislocated Workers, and Youth receiving WIA-funded services in the District. The statewide WIA Annual Report ETA Form 9091 tables are included as an attachment following the narrative report. Cumulatively, this information provides a look at the employment experiences of program participants who exited programs into an economy that was somewhat volatile. The measures examine job placement during the first quarter after exit, employment retention during the second and third quarters after exit, and six-month earnings during the second and third quarters after exit. Adult Table 9a: WIA Adult Program Performance - PY 2014 Table 9a provides performance results for the WIA Adult Program in PY 2014. In PY 2014, a total of 1,048 Adult participants were served by DOES. Further, a total of 468 Adult participants were exited within the April 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015 reporting period. The entered employment and retention rates achieved during PY2014 showed an increase from program year 2013 ( Table 9bbelow)\u2014entered employment and retention were up 3.57 and 7.07 percentage points respectively. It is also worth noting that employment and retention performance for WIA Adults that received training services was also higher than last program year- entered employment and retention were up 5.76 and 9 percentage points respectively.WIA Adult Program Performance - PY 2014 Common Measure Negotiated Actual Performance Entered Employment Rate 61.6% 60.5% Met Employment Retention Rate $13,175 Table 10a: WIA Dislocated Worker Program Performance - PY 2014 WIA Dislocated Worker Program Performance - PY 2014 Common Measure Negotiated Actual Performance Entered Employment Rate 63.0% 60.0% Met Employment Retention Rate 84.0% 83.9% Met Six-Months Average Earnings$17,750 $18,865 Exceeds Table 10a provides performance results for the WIA Dislocated Worker Program in PY 2014.

This program offers services to young people under two divisions - the In-School Youth (ISY) Program and the Out-of-School Youth (OSY) Program. In PY 2014, District's Office of Youth Programs (OYP) exercised new option years thereby extending existing ISY Program grants to four (4) providers (Urban Alliance, Sasha Bruce Youthwork, Opportunities Industrialization Center, and Latin American Youth Center). The ISY Program provides academic enrichment, work readiness, career exploration, and life skills for District youth enrolled in high school and officially classified as juniors or seniors. The program is designed to help youth participants successfully complete high school and make a successful transition to postsecondary education, employment, or advanced training. Due to performance concerns, in October 2014, the WIC decided to discontinue funding the ISY program grants and not permit enrollment of new youth into these programs until an updated youth service delivery plan111was in place and approved. Youth that were already enrolled were permitted to remain in the programs through the end of the grant period while OYP developed a new plan for these youth. In August 2015, based upon the request of DOES, the WIC Executive Committee approved extensions of these ISY grants through the next fiscal year to allow more time for DOES to transition current grantees to the new contracts. This course of action allowed for continuity of services while finalizing the WIOA youth plan, as well as finalizing the RFQ and the cost model for performance- based Human Care Agreements with OCP. DOES established the following conditions for the grant extensions: Providers shall submit a revised service plan that meets the new fiscal and programmatic requirements. They shall articulate how remedial services and the fourteen required elements under WIOA will be offered; Providers are authorized to recruit in-school participants from more than one school to meet enrollment caps; base payments will be reduced if provider is not enrolling and serving youth; Grants are modified to lift restrictive enrollment requirements, such as high literacy and numeracy levels, to give more flexibility to providers to work with motivated youth; and Providers must compete for an award under the new contract model if they wish to pursue funds beyond the end of the option period. The District's OSY Program providers, Covenant House, Latin American Youth Center, and YWCA, delivered tailored services to provide youth not enrolled in school with opportunities to obtain certification in Occupational Skills Training. Participants prepared for and received certifications in Customer Service or IC3 Computer Training. Program participants also gained skills necessary to transition into full-time employment. A second OSY Program model utilized is GED to College. Youth enrolled in this program model prepared and tested for the official GED exam then transition into postsecondary education or advanced training. Due to performance concerns, in October 2014, the WIC decided to discontinue funding the OSY program grants and not permit enrollment of new youth into these programs until an updated youth service delivery plan was in place and approved. Youth were permitted to remain in the programs through the end of the grant period while OYP developed a new plan for WIC review and approval. The OSY Program concluded at the end of June 2015.

OYP developed a robust transformation plan that will support the program during the transition to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. These changes include increasing staff assigned to the year round youth programs; expanding the capacity and diversity of youth program services using a new performance based program model; modifying systems to enable contractors to input and upload data to support performance objectives; developing and implementing comprehensive staff and provider training; and modifying policies that impose barriers to access. In addition, during PY2014, DOES developed a standardized process for collecting participant documentation in accordance with governing mandates and DOES operations. This process is now used across all programs, including the American Job Center staff supporting the District's Virtual One-Stop System. TITLE III - Wagner-Peyser Program Performance Table 13a: Wagner-Peyser Program Performance - PY 2014 Table 13a provides performance results for the Wagner-Peyser Program in PY 2014. Performance on all measures met the negotiated standard set for PY2014. The entered employment and retention rates achieved during PY2014 were slightly less than those achieved in PY2013 ( Table 13b below), with the entered employment and retention rates both decreasing less than 1 percentage point. Table 13b: Wagner-Peyser Program Performance - PY 2013 Title II -Adult and Family Education OSSE AFE currently funds 23 organizations to offer Adult Basic Education (ABE), Adult Secondary Education (ASE) inclusive of the General Educational Development Program (GED) and National External Diploma Program (NEDP), English as a Second Language (ESL), English Literacy/Civics Education (EL Civics), Family Literacy, Occupational Literacy, Digital Literacy, Career Essential Boot-Camp and Postsecondary Education and Workforce Transition and Ancillary Services to District residents.Wagner-Peyser Program Performance - PY 2014 Common Measure Negotiated Actual Performance Entered Employment Rate 56% 46.0% Met Employment Retention Rate79% 78.1% Met Average Earnings $18,000 $15,417 Met Wagner-Peyser Program Performance - PY 2013 Common Measure Negotiated Actual Performance Entered Employment Rate 56% 46.9% Met Employment Retention Rate79% 79% Exceeds Average Earnings $18,000 $16,450 Met113Of the students served in OSSE AFE programs, 95%, inclusive of 48% (ABE) and 47% (ESL), enter at the Adult Basic Education Level (Grade Level Equivalency 1-8), while five percent (5%) enter at the Adult Secondary Level (Grade Level Equivalency 9-12). . A total of 4,177 adult learners received services in OSSE AFE funded programs in FY 2015. Of this number, 2,914 represents the total number of learners who met the National Reporting System (NRS) guidelines of having a valid assessment and twelve (12) or more instructional hours in the program year to be reportable to the U.S. Department of Education. The remaining 1,263 adult learners engaged in one to eleven instructional hours. The total number of learners served in FY 2015 (n = 2,914) that met the NRS requirements decreased by nine percent (9%) in comparison with the number of learners served in FY 2014 (n = 3,286) that met the NRS requirements. Of the 2,914 adult learners served in FY 2015, thirty-five percent (35%/n = 1,019) completed an educational functioning level. This reflects a three-percent (3%) increase in the percentage of adult learners that completed a level in FY 2015 in comparison to thirty-two percent (32%/n= 1,062) in FY 2014. FY14 Participants by Program Type In FY 2014, of the total number of learners (n = 3,286) that met the NRS guidelines, students in English as a Second Language (ESL) programs comprised the single largest group by program type with fifty-one percent (51%n = 1,682). The number of ESL learners were closely followed by the second largest group by program type with forty-four percent (44%/n = 1,441) of the learners receiving Adult Basic Education (ABE) services. The smallest group of learners served by program type was the Adult Secondary Education (ASE) group at five percent (5%/n=163) which has been consistent for many years. FY15 Participants by Program Type In FY 2015, of the total number of learners (n=2,914) that met the NRS guidelines, students in Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs comprised the single largest group by program type with forty- eight percent (48%/n=1,388). The number of ABE learners were closely followed by the second largest group by program type with forty-five percent (45%/n=1,325) of the learners receiving English as a Second Language (ESL) services. This is the first time in recent years that ABE students outnumber ESL students. The smallest group of learners served by pro00gram type was the Adult Secondary Education (ASE) group at seven percent (7%/n=201), which has been consistent for many years. FY 2014 ABE/ASE Participants by Educational Functional Level (NRS Table 14) Of the total number of ABE and ASE participants (n = 1,604), the largest number of students entered at the ABE Intermediate High level (n=637) followed by the ABE Intermediate Low (n = 409) level. The smallest number of participants entered at the ASE High level (n = 27). This breakdown is consistent with the breakdown of the DC FY 2013 ABE/ASE Participants by Educational Functioning Level.114Of the total number of ESL participants (n = 1,682), the largest number of participants entered in ESL Intermediate Low (n = 513) followed by the second largest number of participants who entered in ESL Beginning High (n = 390).

The agency is required to conduct a comprehensive assessment every three years describing the rehabilitation needs of individuals with disabilities residing in the District, particularly the needs of people with most significant disabilities, people who are minorities or have been unserved or underserved by the vocational rehabilitation program and people with disabilities served by other components of the workforceNRS Measure (NRS Table 15b)2014-2015 Approved Targets2014-2015 Actual Performance2014-2015 Survey 48% 62% Retained Employment 98% 95% 61% Secondary School Diploma 59% 59% Entered Postsecondary Education or Training 61% 31%53% Education or Training - Prior Program YearN/A 37% 72%117development system. The assessment was initiated in May, 2014, with a final report issued in December 2014 (available on-line ). The CSNA was conducted by the Interwork Institute at San Diego State University (SDSU). SDSU had completed the agency's prior CSNA in 2013. This 2013 CSNA was supposed to be completed in 2011. However, there had been delays in conducting this assessment and therefore, the 2011 CSNA was not completed until May, 2013. SDSU conducted both the 2013 and 2014 CSNAs. In both instances, this organization was selected through a competitive process. The 2014 assessment was able to build on the findings of the previous assessment. The focus of the 2014 assessment was expanded to thoroughly evaluate independent living services in the District, as well. There were increased efforts in the 2014 assessment to ensure that focus groups included people with disabilities who have not been served by the agency, as well as groups that include populations identified in the previous assessment as unserved or underserved. Lastly, SDSU worked with DCRSA's Business Relations Unit to obtain more input from employers. The themes that emerged from the plan and the recommendations included there have been very helpful in informing the 2015 State Plan for Vocational Rehabilitation and Supported Employment Services, and has informed the planning in the development of the Unified State Plan currently under development. Some specific strategies are spelled out in more detail in other sections of this Unified Plan, including in the Strategic and Operational Sections, as well as the Vocational Rehabilitation Program Specific portion. Some changes that had been underway as part of the 2015 VR State Plan included implementation of additional staff training, including supervisory training, expanding the presence of DDS/RSA at the American Job Centers from one day per week to five days per week, expanding outreach to specific population identified in the 2013 CSNA as unserved or underserved, development of agreement with the Development Disability Administration to improve coordination of services for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, expanding the coordination of services to transition youth through increased cooperation with the DC Public Schools, as well as all DC Public Charter Schools, coordinate with schools to begin referral for VR services earlier to ensure that DDS/RSA is available to work with students for at least the final two years of high school, and establish performance based contracts for Job Development and Supported Employment providers. The work with the agency partners in developing the Unified State Plan has allowed us to continue in the development of strategies to address the issues identified in the CSNA. These continued efforts include developing a Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Behavioral Health to clarify the coordination of supported employment services for people with mental health impairments, establishing a specialized VR unit that provides supported employment services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and serious mental illness or serious emotional disturbance, continuing to work with the Workforce Investment Council American Job Center Sub-Committee to improve coordination of services at the AJC, improved outreach to community based organizations that work with people with disabilities who have immigrated from Latin America and Ethiopia, expanding outreach in wards 7 and 8, working with the Office of the State Superintendent of Education and the Department of Employment Services to establish data sharing agreements to address the coordination of services, and tracking of outcomes, ensuring118that all services are accessible to people with disabilities, including people who are blind or visually impaired, improved coordination with DC Public Schools and the DC Public Charter Schools and the Department of Employment Services in provision of transition services for students with disabilities, including pre-employment transition services and increased opportunities for work experiences for youth with disabilities, better coordination among workforce partners in conducting outreach to businesses and provision of services to businesses. DDS/RSA has been working closely with the Unified Workforce Development System partners to create a system in the District that more effectively and efficiently meets the needs of job seekers in the District, particularly those with disabilities. The AJC sub-committee, as well as other WIC sub- committees, including one regarding services for people with disabilities and one regarding services for youth, should assist in providing ongoing guidance as we attempt to implement recommended changes from the CSNA. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families The TANF program is designed around a continuous improvement model, and grounded in data based-decisions. Core to the TANF program, are the TANF vendors - those entities which provide the job placement and job readiness services to TANF customers. Each of the providers functions under a hybrid performance-based contract model. Through use of a performance based contracting model, the program is able to maximize outcome and also resource allocation. If the providers do not arrive at the desired outcomes, they do not get paid. The program has five key metrics, which measure the overall effectiveness of the program (below). Analysis of these metrics helps inform contract payment point modifications. Furthermore, we also use these metrics and other data elements that measure the behaviors and outcomes of our TANF customers to help shape policy changes and incentivize stability and employment. According to the October 30, 2015, DHS TANF Employment Program Quarterly Report 54 F56, between Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 and FY 2015, the program has improved. Data from several key areas shows: The number of customers newly assigned to a provider increased from 9,483 in FY 13 to 12,433 in FY 15. The number of customers served by TANF providers increased from 8,473 in FY 13 to 10,592 in FY 15. The number of TANF customers whose cases closed and exited TANF because of earnings increased from 1,636 in FY 13 to 2,357 in FY 15. The number of TANF customers who obtained new employment during the fiscal year dipped slightly from 2,347 in FY 13 to 2256 in FY 15 5 5F57. The number of TANF customers retaining employment for 6 months or more increased from 1,252 in FY 13 to 2,772 in Q3 FY 15. 56http://dcdhs.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dhs/page_content/attachments/TANF_QuarterlyReport_30Oct-V9.pdf 57FY 15 total of first second and third quarters of the FY.119(D) Describe how the state will conduct evaluations and research projects on activities under WIOA core programs; how such projects will be coordinated with, and designed in conjunction with, State and local boards and with State agencies responsible for the administration of all respective core programs; and, further, how the projects will be coordinated with the evaluations provided for by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education under WIOA. As specified in Section II(c) above, a key goal for the District's workforce system is that workforce services funded are evidence-based, high quality, and flexible in meeting individuals' needs; and District agencies will evaluate outcomes through standardized methodologies that ensure accountability and transparency (Goal 4). A key strategy proposed to meet this goal is to conduct comprehensive workforce system and provider evaluations using standardized and accurate data and consistent processes. This will include: Common Data Dictionary and Methods for Measurement: To move the District's workforce system toward being more data-driven, we would move to developing a common data dictionary for workforce definitions, data locations and methods for measurement. DC will build off the work already being done on the Data Vault, a partnership between DOES and OSSE to share information about participants in the workforce and education programs. The development (and use) of a consistent set of data elements and formats for documenting content and structures would help to make information systems more accessible - for example: table structures, collection protocols, Workforce System Evaluation: The District is committed to continuous improvement of its workforce system. To this end, the DC will work with an outside entity to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the workforce system during Year 2 of the WIOA strategic plan implementation. The outcomes will inform what progress has been made to date and where DC needs to focus in the second half of the strategic plan period to make continued progress toward meetings its goals. Additional content on planned District evaluations is also included in sections III(b)(4)(A-B). Evaluations will be conducted and/or commissioned by several entities, including the Office of the City Administrator, the WIC, and relevant District agencies. Evaluation plans will be shared through the WIC and Office of the City Administrator to ensure coordination at the District level and with evaluations provided for by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education under WIOA. Third party evaluators will be used when relevant and contracted through both federal and local funding sources contingent upon availability of funds.120(5) Distribution of Funds for Core Programs. Describe the methods and factors the State will use in distributing funds under the core programs in accordance with the provisions authorizing such distributions. (A) For Title I programs, provide a description of the written policies that establish the State's methods and factors used to distribute funds to local areas for\u2014 (i) Youth activities in accordance with WIOA section 128(b)(2) or (b)(3), (ii) Adult and training activities in accordance with WIOA section 133(b)(2) or (b)(3), (iii) Dislocated worker employment and training activities in accordance with WIOA section 133(b)(2) and based on data and weights assigned. The District is a single state-local area, and accordingly does not distribute funds to local areas. DOES serves as the District's fiscal agent, which distributes funds based on relevant policies set by the WIC to ensure compliance with federal law and alignment with business needs. All policies governing the workforce system can be found online at: http://dmped.dc.gov/node/637022 (B) For Title II: (i) Describe how the eligible agency will award multi-year grants or contracts on a competitive basis to eligible providers in the State, including how eligible agencies will establish that eligible providers are organizations of demonstrated effectiveness. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) is the state's eligible agency for adult education and literacy programs. As such, OSSE is responsible for administering Title II, Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) funds and providing program and performance oversight to grantees. Adult education and literacy eligible providers approved under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) requirements will receive continuation funding for grant year 2016-2017 through June 30, 2017, as long as they adhere to state and federal grant requirements. During grant year 2016-2017, OSSE will conduct a grant competition for AEFLA funding that will determine the eligible providers for grant year 2017-2018 who will be awarded funds starting July 1, 2017 under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requirements. The grant competition will be held in response to shifts in funding priorities as a result of the WIOA and to explore new and innovative models for integrated service delivery. AEFLA funding will be used to provide services to District residents who have the greatest literacy needs. This includes individuals with low level literacy skills, adults who do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, English language learners, adults with learning and other disabilities, incarcerated individuals, returning citizens, families living at or below the poverty level, and unemployed and under-employed individuals residing primarily in Wards 8, 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1 in the District of Columbia. Through the competitive grant process, OSSE will award multi-year grants (minimum of three years) to eligible providers for the purpose of developing, implementing and improving adult121education within the District of Columbia. An eligible provider is an organization that has demonstrated effectiveness in providing adult education activities to eligible individuals and may include: (1) a local education agency; (2) a community-based or faith-based organization; (3) a volunteer literacy organization; (4) an institution of higher education; (5) a public or private non- profit agency; (6) a library; (7) a public housing authority; (8) a non-profit institution with the ability to provide adult education and literacy services; (9) a consortium or coalition of agencies organizations, institutions, libraries or authorities described above; (10) and a partnership between an employer and an entity described above. To determine if an applicant is an organization of demonstrated effectiveness, all applicants will be required to provide evidence of their ability to improve the skills of adults with low level literacy skills and/or English language learners in the applicable academic areas related to the RFA. Prior AEFLA grant recipients will be required to provide data from OSSE's management information system - LACES (Literacy Adult Community Education System). Additionally, local program monitoring data could be provided as evidence as to how the organization has met the state's negotiated performance measures for students at all levels, including adults with low-level literacy skills and English language learners. New applicants will be required to describe and provide evidence of student achievement of core outcomes for adults with low-level literacy skills and English language learners, including student learning gains, acquisition of high school diploma or GED, and entrance into postsecondary education, training and/or employment in the RFA. Each application will be reviewed to determine whether it meets the standard of demonstrated effectiveness. Applications that do not include sufficient evidence of demonstrated effectiveness will be eliminated from the grant competition. All applications will be reviewed and evaluated in the same manner. OSSE will award funding directly to the selected eligible providers. Throughout each year of the multi-year grant cycle (minimum three years), OSSE will monitor the eligible provider's performance via desk reviews, monthly reporting, local program self-assessments and onsite monitoring visits. Based on OSSE's findings, eligible providers that meet federal, state and local accountability and reporting requirements will be invited to apply for continuation funding for the subsequent grant year. Timeline: The following steps will be taken to facilitate the AEFLA grant competition for sections 231, 225, and 243 funding: September 2016: OSSE AFE will finalize the draft multi-year (minimum of three-years) Request for Application (RFA). The RFA will be submitted to the District's Workforce Investment Council (WIC) for review to ensure alignment with local workforce plans. October 2016: OSSE will publish a Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) on the DC Office of Partnerships and Grant Services (OPGS) website and in the OPGS electronic bulletin \"The Funding Alert.\" The NOFA will also be published on OSSE's website at www.osse.dc.gov . October - November 2016: OSSE will recruit independent external subject matter experts to serve on a panel to review and score the AEFLA applications.122November 2016: OSSE will publish the finalized Request for Applications (RFA) that aligns with the District's funding priorities and approved Unified State Plan. A notice about the release of the RFA will be published on the DC Office of Partnerships and Grant Services (OPGS) website and in the Funding Alert. The RFA will be published on OSSE's website at www.osse.dc.gov. November 2016: OSSE will hold a pre-application conference to provide prospective applicants with an opportunity to ask questions relative to the application. The responses to all questions will be posted on OSSE's website at www.osse.dc.gov. January 15, 2017: Due date for AEFLA grant applications. January to March 2017: The panel of reviewers will review and score the AEFLA applications based on the 13 considerations under Title II of WIOA which include: (1) The degree to which the eligible provider would be responsive to (A) regional needs as identified in the local plan under section 108; and (B) serving individuals in the community who were identified in such plan as most in need of adult education and literacy activities, including individuals - (i) who have low levels of literacy skills; or (ii) who are English language learners; (2) The ability of the eligible provider to serve eligible individuals with disabilities, including eligible individuals with learning disabilities; (3) The past effectiveness of an eligible provider in improving the literacy of eligible individuals, to meet State-adjusted levels of performance for the primary indicators of performance described in section 116, especially with respect to eligible individuals who have low levels of literacy; (4) The extent to which the eligible provider demonstrates alignment between proposed activities and services and the strategy and goals of the local plan under section 108, as well as the activities and services of the one-stop partners; (5) Whether the eligible provider's program -(A) is of sufficient intensity and quality, and based on the most rigorous research available so that participants achieve substantial learning gains; and (B) uses instructional practices that include the essential components of reading instruction; (6) Whether the eligible provider's activities, including whether reading, writing, speaking, mathematics, and English language acquisition instruction delivered by the eligible provider, are based on best practices derived from the most rigorous research available and appropriate, including scientifically valid research and effective educational practice; (7) Whether the eligible provider's activities effectively use technology, services, and delivery systems, including distance education in a manner sufficient to increase the amount and quality of learning and how such technology, services and systems lead to improved performance;123(8) Whether the eligible provider's activities provide learning in context, including through integrated education and training, so that an individual acquires the skills needed to transition to and complete postsecondary education and training programs, obtain and advance in employment leading to self-sufficiency, and to exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; (9) Whether the eligible provider's activities are delivered by well-trained instructors, counselors, and administrators who meet any minimum qualifications established by the State, where applicable, and who have access to high quality professional development, including through electronic means. (10)Whether the eligible provider's activities coordinate with other available education, training, and social service resources in the community, such as by establishing strong links with elementary schools and secondary schools postsecondary educational institutions, institutions of higher education, local workforce investment boards, one-stop centers, job training programs, and social service agencies, business, industry, labor organizations, community-based organizations, non-profit organizations, and intermediaries, for the development of career pathways. (11)Whether the eligible provider's activities offer flexible schedules and coordination with Federal, state, and local support services (such as child care, transportation, mental health services, and career planning) that are necessary to enable individuals, including individuals with disabilities or other special needs, to attend and complete programs. (12)Whether the eligible provider maintains a high-quality information management system that has the capacity to report measurable participant outcomes (consistent with section 116). (13)Whether the local areas in which the eligible provider is located have a demonstrated need for additional English language acquisition programs and civics education programs. March 2017: OSSE will conduct a review of the selected applicant's applications, budgets and the grant requirements and develop a rank-order slate of eligible providers based on the applicants' scores. April 2017: OSSE will announce the AEFLA grant applicants that will receive funding. July 1, 2017: AEFLA grant providers will begin local program implementation under WIOA. (ii) Describe how the eligible agency will ensure direct and equitable access to all eligible providers to apply and compete for funds and how the eligible agency will ensure that it is using the same grant or contract announcement and application procedure for all eligible providers.124OSSE AFE ensures direct and equitable access for all eligible providers to apply for AEFLA grant funds in the District of Columbia. OSSE will publish a Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) on the DC Office of Partnerships and Grant Services (OPGS) website and in the OPGS electronic bulletin \"The Funding Alert.\" The NOFA will also be published on OSSE's website at www.osse.dc.gov . OSSE will then publish the multi-year (minimum three-years) AEFLA Request for Applications (RFA). A notice about the release of the RFA will be published on the DC OPGS website and in the Funding Alert. The RFA will also be published on OSSE's website at www.osse.dc.gov. All eligible applicants will submit applications using OSSE's web-based Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS), including certifications and assurances. Other information in the application will include a description of how funds awarded under the AEFLA will be spent and a description of any cooperative agreements the eligible provider has with other agencies, institutions or organizations for the delivery of adult education and family literacy activities. A panel of independent reviewers, external to OSSE, will review and score the applications based on the 13 considerations in section 231(e) of WIOA. Eligible applicants will not be required to apply for an AEFLA grant through another agency as OSSE will award the funding directly to the selected eligible providers. The application process has been designed so that it is clearly evident that the direct submission of an application to OSSE via EGMS is the only acceptable and non-negotiable method of applying for grant funds. OSSE will require all eligible providers for sections 231, 225, and 243 to use the same application process via EGMS to ensure that all applications are evaluated using the same rubric and scoring criteria. OSSE further ensures that all eligible providers will have direct and equitable access to apply for AEFLA grant funds via the same grant announcement and application process. During the initial period of the grant submission process, any eligible agency that contacts OSSE with an interest in participating in the competition will be provided the information needed. OSSE believes that these approaches meet the requirements specified in AEFLA and satisfy the requirement that every effort be made to ensure direct and equitable access to eligible providers. (C)Title IV Vocational Rehabilitation In the case of a State that, under section 101(a)(2)(A)(i)of the Rehabilitation Act designates a State agency to administer the part of the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services portion of the Unified or Combined State Plan under which VR services are provided for individuals who are blind, describe the process and the factors used by the State to determine the distribution of funds among the two VR agencies in the State.125This does not apply to the District as it has a combined State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency that provides services to all people with disabilities, including people who are blind or visually impaired. (6) Program Data (A) Data Alignment and Integration. Describe the plans of the lead State agencies with responsibility for the administration of the core programs, along with the State Board, to align and integrate available workforce and education data systems for the core programs, unemployment insurance programs, and education through postsecondary education, and to the extent possible, the Combined State Plan partner programs included in this plan. The description of the State's plan for integrating data systems should include the State's goals for achieving integration and any progress to date. (i) Describe the State's plans to make the management information systems for the core programs interoperable to maximize the efficient exchange of common data elements to support assessment and evaluation. (ii) Describe the State's plans to integrate data systems to facilitate streamlined intake and service delivery to track participation across all programs included in this plan. As stated earlier, Office of State Superintendent for Education Adult and Family Education (OSSE AFE) has led the District in developing the DC Data Vault which was initially designed based on a single, multi-agency (DC OSSE AFE and DOES) customer intake and referral process. The Data Vault is being implemented at the DOES American Job Centers and in OSSE AFE programs. Expansion plans include building into the referral list DOES/WIC training providers, UDC-CC, and adult-serving DCPS and DC Public Charter schools. Additionally, within the next year it is expected that DDS/RSA and DHS will begin using the Data Vault as part of the universally shared intake system. The Data Vault: Facilitates the referral of customers to and from DC OSSE AFE and DOES for services (initial expansion plans include DC DHS and DDS/RSA); Allows DC DOES staff to register customers for assessment services on a specific date/time at each AJC and refer customers to the DC OSSE AFE onsite provider partner or another offsite adult literacy provider for services; Provides access to information and notifications to key staff at each agency about customers (i.e. registering for assessments, being referred to a specific provider for services, status/updates on customers); Links customers to programs and services (i.e. adult literacy, occupational literacy, digital literacy, Career Essential Boot Camps, postsecondary education, and training) funded by the OSSE AFE and DOES partnership;126Allows adult literacy provider staff and DC government agency staff to upload and maintain customer eligibility documents so that they can be accessed by each agency and eliminate the need for District residents to provide the same documentation to multiple agencies; Links District residents to DC Networks to register in the Virtual One Stop system; Tracks customer participation, performance, progress and core outcomes; and Facilitates cross agency data sharing, communication, case management and collaboration of services for participating DC residents. OSSE also maintains the Statewide Longitudinal Education Data System (SLED) which is a single, repository of student and education-related data needed to improve education planning, management, reporting, instruction and evaluation. This system includes data from multiple other agencies and partners and can be accessed for specific purposes based on data sharing agreements with OSSE to ensure compliance with all local and federal privacy laws. There are plans to connect the Data Vault to SLED and DOES's VOS by the end of FY16 to improve data access and accuracy. Where possible, OSSE will be working to conduct data matching activities with GED data, Jacob France Institute wage data and the National Student Clearinghouse data on student attainment of core indicators of performance. In collaboration with OSSE's division of Data, Accountability, and Research, OSSE AFE will be data matching with DOES per a Data Sharing MOA between both agencies and will explore the feasibility of data matching with other DC government agencies (DHS, DDS/RSA, UDC-CC) on student attainment of core indicators of performance under WIOA. Regarding employment data, data sharing agreements will be formalized between core programs to ensure agencies have the ability to access employment and wage data which is required for WIOA performance measures. At present time, only DOES has access to WRIS and UI data. Lastly, DC will develop a common data dictionary and methods for measurement. To move the District's workforce system toward being more data-driven, we would move to developing a common data dictionary for workforce definitions, data locations and methods for measurement. DC will build off the work already being done on the Data Vault, a partnership between DOES and OSSE to share information about participants in the workforce and education programs. The development (and use) of a consistent set of data elements and formats for documenting content and structures would help to make information systems more accessible - for example: table structures, collection protocols, data elements, and data element terms and definitions.127(iii) Explain how the State board will assist the governor in aligning technology and data systems across mandatory one-stop partner programs (including design and implementation of common intake, data collection, etc.) and how such alignment will improve service delivery to individuals, including unemployed individuals. The WIC advises the Mayor, Council, and the District government on the development, implementation, and continuous improvement of an integrated and effective workforce investment system; including on the alignment of technology and data systems. The WIC serves this role in part as a convener of workforce system stakeholders, and has helped facilitate continued Data Vault expansion through discussions and work groups involved in producing this State Plan and the Career Pathways Task Force. The WIC also provides assistance with the negotiation of inter- agency agreements, and will continue to facilitate all of these efforts through work groups convened to implement this State Plan. Further, the WIC convenes business stakeholders through numerous formats to obtain feedback on workforce system efforts, and helps share this input in District planning efforts related to technology and data systems alignment. (iv)Describe the State's plans to develop and produce the reports required under section 116, performance accountability system. (WIOA section116(d)(2)). Each of the District agencies responsible for administering core programs has data systems in place that are able to track outcomes related to required WIOA performance metrics and store relevant information on case management and other activities as required for monitoring. Agencies will leverage DOES's access to the Wage Record Interchange System (WRIS) and will explore the use of the Jacob France Institute's wage data to report on the District's employment and training program performance, evaluating training provider performance, and for other related purposes for federal programs as permitted. As mentioned, data sharing agreements will be formalized to ensure employment data is accessible to agencies administering core programs. (B) Assessment of Participants' Post-Program Success. Describe how lead State agencies will use the workforce development system to assess the progress of participants who are exiting from core programs in entering, persisting in, and completing postsecondary education, or entering or remaining in employment. States may choose to set additional indicators of performance. District residents' success as a result of workforce programming is the largest indicator of the effectiveness of our system. Consequently, being able to accurately assess this success is of particular importance. As previously stated, DOES utilizes DCNetworks for both case management and performance tracking of program participants. DCNetworks tracks, predicts, and reports the core indicators of performance, including job placement rates, earnings, employment retention,128skills gains, and credentials earned to ensure that federal performance standards are achieved for WIOA Title I and Title III Programs. Through this, the DOES will continue to carefully monitor state performance measures under WIOA. In addition to quarterly reports distributed to the Site Supervisors and Program Managers, the performance team works with AJC Managers and staff throughout the year to ensure success, identifying and addressing any areas where performance is not meeting expectations. While DOES has not established any state-specific performance measures to date, data on performance is shared constantly with management and the WIC and any recommendations on performance measures identified through these venues will be taken into account. OSSE will continue to look at high school equivalency completion, postsecondary enrollment and employment data to the extent available through existing partnerships with the Jacob France Institute and the National Student Clearinghouse to determine student attainment of core indicators of performance. OSSE is already working with DOES per a Data Sharing MOA between both agencies and exploring the feasibility of additional potential connections with other DC government agencies (DHS, DDS/RSA, UDC-CC) on student attainment of core indicators of performance under WIOA. With the introduction of WIOA, the performance measures for the vocational rehabilitation program have changed. RSA will use these performance measures to assess success per federal requirements. However, the administration has also taken steps to improve performance on the standards that existed prior to the passage of WIOA which are important methods to assess participant's success. They include: Indicator 1.1 Annual Change in Employment Outcomes: the difference in the number of individuals exiting the VR program who achieved an employment outcome during the current performance period as compared to the previous performance period. Indicator 1.2 Percent of Employment Outcomes: the percentage of individuals exiting the program who have achieved an employment outcome after receiving services. Indicator 1.3 Competitive Employment Outcomes: the percentage of individuals who exit the VR program in employment in integrated settings with hourly rate of earnings equivalent to at least the federal or state minimum wage rate, whichever is higher. Indicator 1.4 Significance of Disability: reflects the significance of disability served by the VR agency and is the percentage of those identified in Indicator 1.3 who have significant disabilities. Indicator 1.5 Earnings Ratio: indicates that VR consumers who achieved competitive outcomes are earning, on the average, at least 52 cents for every dollar earned hourly by all employed individuals in the state. Indicator 1.6 Self-Support: For those identified in Indicator 1.3, the difference in the percentage of individuals who at program entry reported their income as the largest single129source of support, and the percentage that reported their personal income as the largest single source of support at program exit. More detailed information on these indicators can be found in the Vocational Rehabilitation section of the plan section of the plan. The administration continues to track these measures and currently uses many of these measures in its performance measures for its City Plan, which includes the following key performance indicators: Number of people placed by RSA that remained employer for 90 calendar days or more Percent of people with an individualized plan for employment developed within 90 calendar days of eligibility determination Percent of people for whom eligibility is determined within 60 calendar days Average entry level wages for people whose cases are closed successfully Percentage of eligible transition youth for whom an IPE is developed (A) Use of Unemployment Insurance (UI) Wage Record Data. Explain how the State will meet the requirements to utilize quarterly UI wage records for performance accountability, evaluations, and as a source for workforce and labor market information, consistent with Federal and State law. (This Operational Planning element applies to core programs.) The District currently utilizes the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Wage Record Database to validate information collected about WIOA program participants with respect to their placement in employment, average earnings, and retention in employment as required by law. In addition to using UI wage data for performance monitoring and validation, DOES utilizes this data to support program evaluations. DOES is currently working with the District of Columbia Council and the Office of the Auditor to complete an evaluation of its services to youth ages 22-24. The use of UI data has proven to be an invaluable resource for determining how and when young people are connecting to employment after involvement in the program. Additionally, the Office of Labor Market Information (LMI), reviews UI wage records each quarter to inform their research and findings related to high- demand occupations and industries. (B) Privacy Safeguards. Describe the privacy safeguards incorporated in the State's workforce development system, including safeguards required by section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g) and other applicable Federal laws. District agencies are strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information and the security of our computer systems. With respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, the District makes every effort to ensure compliance with applicable Federal law, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). We are aware that130a key element of success to utilizing data across agencies for either improved customer service or improved measurement and tracking of outcomes is ensuring the integrity of all data and ensuring confidential data is treated as such. This is accomplished with various safeguards and ensuring personnel handling this data are properly trained in all relevant regulations and the fundamentals of handling personal and confidential data. As a general rule, DCNetworks does not collect personally identifying information about customers when they visit our site, unless they choose to provide such information to us. The information we receive depends upon what a customer provides in web forms filled out when visiting our site. The information is kept on file in a secure database and is only used by staff members to determine eligibility for federal assistance in obtaining employment and/or training for employment. (7) Priority of Service for Veterans. Describe how the State will implement and monitor the priority of service provisions for veterans in accordance with the requirements of the Jobs for Veterans Act, codified at section 4215 of 38 U.S.C., which applies to all employment and training programs funded in whole or in part by the Department of Labor. States should also describe the referral process for veterans determined to have a significant barrier to employment to receive services from the Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program's Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) specialist. The District places great importance on effectively serving veterans in alignment with the Veterans Priority of Service guidance. The District operates several programs that prioritize high quality service to veterans. Implementation and Monitoring of Veterans' Priority of Service The District fully adheres to the Veterans Priority of Service guidance as prescribed by the JVSG and WIOA. Pursuant to the requirements of section 4215 of title 38, United States Code and the WIC Policy No. 2013.005, the \"priority of service\" mandate with respect to any qualified USDOL employment and job training programs means that veterans and eligible spouses shall be given priority over non-covered persons for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services, notwithstanding any other provision of the law. If services or resources are limited, the veteran or eligible spouse receives access instead of or before the non-covered person. The District is following priority of service guidance provided under DOL Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) 3-15; and the WIC is re-evaluating its current policy to ensure compliance with this guidance. Gold Card Initiative Per the DOL directive, all unemployed veterans who served in any branch of the armed services during or following the 9/11 era are entitled to intensive employment services for up to 6-months. Services DOES provides to unemployed veterans through its AJCs include case management, skills assessments, interest surveys, career guidance, and job search assistance. Targeted veteran populations include disabled veterans, post 9/11 veterans (Gold Card), homeless veterans, VR&E participants, special disabled veterans, transitioning service members, service- connected veterans, and other eligible persons (including eligible spouses). Providing appropriate131services for veterans often requires diagnostic testing and in-depth evaluation to identify employment barriers and appropriate employment goals. Once the staff makes the determination that intensive services are needed, the veterans/other eligible persons will be referred to the AJC workforce development specialists, which includes Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) Specialists and Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVERs) and non-veteran staff or other partners, as necessary. The District workforce system strictly follows the Veterans Priority of Service guidance as prescribed by the Jobs for Veterans Act. The Act assures that the District's veterans and eligible spouses are given priority to receive workforce services. This means, with respect to any qualified Department of Labor employment and job training programs, that Veterans and Eligible Spouses shall be given priority over non-covered persons for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services, notwithstanding any other provision of the law. It is the responsibility of the District workforce system to serve our military veterans with a high-level of prioritized service. Veterans possess highly desirable skills sets when they transition out of active duty. Challenges may exist to translate prior learning, work, and training experience into civilian terms. As a result, too many veterans remain unemployed. 1/10/2014 AJC-SE Certification Business Plan Page 29 Veterans and eligible spouses take precedence over non-covered persons in obtaining services and shall receive access to services and resources before and/or earlier in time than a non-covered person. If services or resources are limited, the veteran or eligible spouse receives access instead of or before the non-covered person. Staff members providing intensive services will help veteran job seekers develop Individual Employment Plans to identify employment goals, objectives, and the services needed for the veteran to achieve those goals. The staff will also work with participants, one-on-one, to provide individual counseling and career planning. Many customers will require short-term prevocational services, including communication skills, interviewing skills, punctuality, and professional conduct. As required by law, veterans receive priority of service through the AJC system for the following programs: WIOA Adult WIOA Dislocated Worker National Emergency Grants Wagner-Peyser State Grants Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) DVOPs and LVERs target services to disabled veterans, economically or educationally disadvantaged veterans, and veterans with other barriers to employment. DOES is able to provide this priority service from the point of entry. At entry, veterans and eligible spouses are made aware of (1) their entitlement to priority of service, (2) the full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service, and (3) any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services. In addition to the priority of service provisions covering services at all AJCs, the District also operates a veterans-only AJC.132The District's VOS system also allows registered veteran job seekers the opportunity to have priority of job postings before they are made available to the public. The District will pay GI Bill benefits to veterans aged 35 to 60 who are unemployed. The monthly payment will be approximately $1,500 but will not include tuition or book stipends. In this unique partnership, program participants are referred to DOES by USDOL, and veterans will be allowed to enter a program leading to a certificate or degree within one year. Applications will be submitted through USDOL and benefits paid by the Veterans Administration (VA). Participants must be enrolled in a VA-approved program of education offered by a community college or technical school. The program must lead to an associate degree, non-college degree, or a certification, and train the veteran for a high demand occupation. To qualify, a veteran must: Be at least 35 but no more than 60 years old Be unemployed (as determined by USDOL) Have an other than dishonorable discharge Not be eligible for any other VA education benefit program (e.g., the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Montgomery GI Bill, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Assistance) Not be in receipt of VA compensation due to un-employability Not be enrolled in a federal or state job training program (8) Addressing the Accessibility of the One-Stop Delivery System. Describe how the one-stop delivery system (including one-stop center operators and the one-stop delivery system partners), will comply with section 188 of WIOA (if applicable) and applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) with regard to the physical and programmatic accessibility of facilities, programs, services, technology, and materials for individuals with disabilities. This also must include a description of compliance through providing staff training and support for addressing the needs of individuals with disabilities. Describe the State's one-stop center certification policy, particularly the accessibility criteria. (This Operational Planning element applies to core programs.) The District is committed to serving individuals with disabilities effectively and ensuring that they have access to all offices and agencies, commencing with all the American Job Centers and continuing to all partner agencies, providers, educational institutions, and organizations impacted by this plan and utilizing funds associated with the related activities. According to data provided by the DC Department of Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA), 37,300 District residents between the ages of 21-64 (roughly 8.8 percent) are estimated to have a disability. Of those individuals, it is estimated that 32.8 percent are employed on a full-time or part-time basis. DOES currently enjoys strong partnerships with the DC Office of Disability Rights (ODR) and DDS. In the future, DOES will expand these partnerships into collaborative programming and coordination with employer partners who are interested in hiring District residents with disabilities. Through the collaboration DOES will work with DDS to exchange customer data and ensure comprehensive services are accessible through dual onsite access for DOES and DDS staff.133DOES works with the DDS/RSA to tap into their experience assisting persons with disabilities to find employment and also leverages resources. For example, DDS/RSA may have the employer relationship, and DOES may cover the costs of occupational skills training. The District is committed to equal opportunity employment. All decisions made regarding recruitment, hiring, training, and other terms and conditions of program operations will be made without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, political affiliation, or belief. The AJCs will comply with WIA Section 188, Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and current District of Columbia method of administration. This assurance will be incorporated into all grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or other arrangements whereby WIA funds are made available. Pursuant to DOES Policy 300.20-4, AJC Reasonable Accommodation Policy, qualified individuals with disabilities will be given a meaningful opportunity to participate in and benefit from aid, benefits, services, or training, including core, intensive, training, and supportive services. This includes the adoption of effective communication strategies for applicants, participants, and the general public with a wide range of physical, perceptual, communication, and cognitive abilities. This policy aims to ensure that universal access is a reality for all persons interested in participating in programs, projects, and activities contracted through the AJCs, including persons with disabilities. The Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) offices have served this special population with distinction and will continue to do so. They have indicated interest in continuing to partner with the AJCs to provide services, and they are welcomed as valuable partners. Vocational rehabilitation already enjoys a close relationship with Goodwill Industries because of their shared interest in serving individuals with special needs. AJCs and VR will share adaptive equipment and services already in place to assist those who need special assistance. Furthermore the District will ensure all AJCs are in compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and will continue to work towards ensuring employment-related services are being provided to citizens with special needs at AJCs, as opposed to relying heavily on referrals. The Assistive Technology (AT) Center and the AT Specialist with RSA have provided technical assistance to the one stop in order to identify necessary equipment to ensure accessibility of services to people with disabilities, including people who are blind or visually impaired, which includes special screens, keyboards, and adjustable workstations for use by customers who are blind or visually impaired,, in wheelchairs, or with other disabilities. Department of Employment Services Accessibility Plan and Section 508 Compliance Initiative WIOA requires universal access to the services of the AJCs. While AJC staff are not rehabilitation counselors or disabilities specialists, with a combination of basic customer service practices, core knowledge of disability issues, and information on where staff and customers can find additional assistance, the AJC can play a significant role in helping many people with disabilities meet their employment and career advancement goals.134In partnership with OSSE AFE, DOES AJC customers are screened for learning disabilities by the onsite OSSE AFE provider partner using a Learning Needs Screening Tool imbedded in the Data Vault. Individuals that score 12 or higher on the screening may be referred for further assessment. OSSE AFE, in collaboration with Literacy Pro systems, digitized the Learning Needs Screening, the Student Questionnaire for English Language Learners and the more intensive \"Payne Learning Needs Inventory\" into the Data Vault for use by DC government and partner agencies. The Data Vault will include future functionality so that recommendations for accommodations in instruction and testing auto-populate based on the Payne Learning Needs Inventory results. The Data Vault will also include functionality for OSSE AFE to receive requests for authorizations for customers to be referred to a licensed psychologist/clinician for psychological evaluations, psycho-educational assessments, speech, hearing, and vision screenings. If approved, this will result in a referral to vendors/providers for whom OSSE has contracted with in coordination with DDS/RSA. DDS/RSA will also be partnering with OSSE to provide additional and/or other supportive services to adult learners who have been found to have special needs. DOES is currently developing a formal plan that will establish the procedures to be implemented to ensure that AJCs are in compliance with Section 508. The term disability is extremely broad. While some individuals can be identified due to mobility issues or sensory deficits (such as people who are blind, visually impaired, or deaf), there are other individuals who are covered under one of the provisions of the law for whom physical access is not an issue, such as those with learning disabilities, mental health issues, head injuries, and many other conditions. DOES is committed to providing services that: Strive to anticipate the needs of people with disabilities in the physical design of the center, as well as the design of services that provide opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in an effective and meaningful way in an integrated setting; and, Avoid unnecessary requirements that tend to screen out individuals with disabilities, such as requiring a driver's license as the only acceptable form of identification, or requirements mandating that individuals must complete intake forms without assistance Permit special benefits beyond those required by regulation, such as additional one-on-one assistance or extra time beyond typical time limits Provide reasonable accommodations to customers with disabilities, unless providing those accommodations would cause undue hardship (e.g., modified computer keyboards, sign-language interpreters, intensive staff assistance, modified computer screens) Ensure communications with customers and members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others (i.e., providing auxiliary aids such as qualified interpreters, assistive listening headsets, closed and open captioning on videos, and telecommunication devices [TDD and TTY]) Comply with WIOA nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions. (9) Addressing the Accessibility of the One-Stop Delivery System for Individuals with Limited English Proficiency. Describe how the one-stop delivery system (including one-stop center operators and the one-stop delivery system partners) will ensure that each one- stop center is able to meet the needs of limited English proficient individuals, such as through established procedures, staff training, resources, and other materials.135DOES has bilingual workforce development specialists who are able to serve customers in all of the AJCs, including the SE center. The agency also has access to the District's Language Access Program, which provides interpretation services to allow workforce development specialists to communicate with all District residents. DOES has a designated liaison to the DC Office of Human Rights participating in the Language Access Program for the District. The DOES Language Access Coordinator ensures that staff are trained to identify those in need of additional language resources to understand all relevant information in their job search activities across all DOES programs . Training is especially geared to those staff members that are customer-facing in the service delivery system such as the AJC centers. Outreach and customer tracking is documented in a quarterly report that is submitted to the Office of Human Rights. DOES staff are required to: Document the language requested by phone or at sign-in for services at an American Job Center Access the language helpline for translation services Provide translation of vital documents in the top six languages identified for this demographic area Attend training sessions to review the language access outreach process for major District agencies Complete service reports and submit to the DC Office of Human Rights each quarter Participate in outreach activities at community centers and special programs for specific language demographics The DOES Office of Public Affairs and the DOES Office of Equal Employment Opportunity are collaborating to ensure vital documents are translated into identified languages across all affected programs, including the Office of Unemployment Compensation and American Job Centers. Additionally, outreach tools from the DC Office of Human Rights are provided for posting in the American Job Centers to promote interactive communication between front line staff and walk-in customers requiring service.136IV. COORDINATION WITH STATE PLAN PROGRAMS. Describe the methods used for joint planning coordination among the core programs, and with the required one-stop partner programs and other programs and activities included in the Unified or Combined State Plan The agencies operating the core programs and the required partner programs made strides over the past year to improve coordination of services and jointly plan for the changes called for under WIOA. Members of the District's Adult Career Pathways Task Force, first convened in December 2014, include leadership from the WIC, DOES, DDS/RSA, DHS, OSSE, DME, DMGEO, DCPS, the DC Council, the Public Charter School Board, the DC Public Library system, and three community- based organizations. Through the work of the Task Force's Strategic Plan to build a career pathways system in the District, these agencies laid the ground work for how services and programs can better be integrated in order to improve delivery of services for our residents. Much of the content in this WIOA State Plan builds on the work of the Task Force, which will continue to meet quarterly to oversee implementation of the career pathways strategies. After the completion of the Career Pathways Strategic Plan, the Deputy Mayor for Greater Economic Opportunity, the Office of the City Administrator, and the WIC convened agencies for the development of the District's WIOA State Plan. Working groups were established under the WIC, comprised of partner agencies, to look at youth services, system alignment, performance and accountability, and sector strategies more in-depth. In a series of meetings including agency leadership and subject matter experts, goals, strategies, and priorities were laid out and operationalized to address the formation of a cohesive workforce system under WIOA that will meet the needs of District residents and businesses. Moving forward, all partner agencies, along with representatives from District businesses and members of the public, will participate in the WIOA Implementation Work Group to oversee the implementation of the strategies laid out in this plan. During the public comment period, the WIC facilitated robust engagement with the public and various stakeholders to obtain their input on the plan. Moving forward, we will continue to solicit feedback and be available to address questions and concerns through the DMGEO's advocacy roundtable meetings, DOES's stakeholder meetings, WIC Board meetings, and Career Pathways Task Force meetings. We encourage the public to email the WIC at wic.dmped@dc.gov with comments or concerns regarding the workforce system. Additional information on coordination with state plan programs can be found in Section III (A) - State Strategy Implementation.137V. COMMON ASSURANCES 1.

(D) Provide the appeals process referred to in section 121(h)(2)(E) of WIOA relating to determinations for infrastructure funding. The District is a single workforce area and therefore does not designate regions or local workforce development areas. (2) Statewide Activities. (A) Provide State policies or guidance for the statewide workforce development system and for use of State funds for workforce investment activities. The WIC's policy manual, which updates and replaces past policies established under WIA, was approved at the July 20, 2016 WIC Executive Committee meeting. This manual includes policies governing the statewide workforce development system and for the use of State funds for workforce investment activities. WIC staff are currently working on updates to the manual based on WIOA regulations and DC WIOA working group discussions as needed. This updated policy manual will be shared with the WIC Executive Committee for their approval at their next meeting on September 15, 2016 and will subsequently be publically posted to the WIC website at dcworks.dc.gov and disseminated to workforce development system stakeholders.141(B) Describe how the State intends to use Governor's set aside funding. Describe how the State will utilize Rapid Response funds to respond to layoffs and plant closings and coordinate services to quickly aid companies and their affected workers. States also should describe any layoff aversion strategies they have implemented to address at risk companies and workers. (C)In addition, describe the State policies and procedures to provide Rapid Responses in cases of natural disasters including coordination with FEMA and other entities. (D)Describe how the State provides early intervention (e.g., Rapid Response) to worker groups on whose behalf a Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition has been filed. (Section 134(a)(2)(A)This description must include how the State disseminates benefit information to provide trade-affected workers in the groups identified in the TAA petitions with an accurate understanding of the provision of TAA benefits and services in such a way that they are transparent to the trade-affected dislocated worker applying for them (Trade Act Sec. 221(a)(2)(A) and Sec. 225; Governor-Secretary Agreement). Describe how the State will use funds that have been reserved for Rapid Response to provide services for every worker group that files a TAA petition. The District will use its Governor's set aside funding to support WIC staff and operations, some DOES staff with responsibility for WIOA-related program administration, and to supplement other workforce development activities. The District will utilize Rapid Response funds and implement layoff aversion strategies as described below, including program procedures and descriptions: Rapid Response (RR) : Rapid Response is a proactive, employee-focused program designed to assist Dislocated Workers in transitioning into new employment opportunities. The goal of the RR program is two-fold: 1) provide resources to companies in both private and government sectors; and 2) respond to layoffs and closings by coordinating services and providing immediate aid to companies and their affected workers. In this regard, the program is beneficial to employees experiencing downsizing but is also geared to growing companies who need a pool of skilled workers who are readily available. Ultimately, RR services are designed to minimize the disruptions of companies and to maximize public and private resources for affected workers and communities associated with job loss. The team responds within 48 hours of receiving notice of layoffs or closings and works to quickly coordinate services with the employer. The District follows federal guidelines under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act to trigger delivery of services. Rapid Response delivers customized services on site at the affected company to accommodate work schedules, and assists companies and affected workers through transitions. The District of Columbia is uniquely fortunate in its geographic positioning as the Piedmont region does not often face the threat of many natural disasters. For entire regions of the country ravaged by hurricanes or communities devastated by tornado, fires or floods, however, WIA and now WIOA have allowed states and Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) to play a significant role in recovery.142Although the District has not experienced major natural disasters, advanced planning is a crucial step to ensuring the appropriate local entities are prepared to respond. Some of the Advanced Planning areas the District considers are the following: Connecting with FEMA. Planning for continued DC Government operation in the midst of the natural disaster. Generating a plan for UI registration after the disaster. Establishing communication hubs in the midst of potential phone outage and down phone lines. Generating a plan to support public service employment. Establishing human resources functionality in the midst of diminished capacity and ensuring that our HR system is flexible enough to allow staff to get the job done. Developing an emergency plan is the first step in disaster preparedness. Rapid Response funds are flexible and permit the use of funds to support disaster planning, including, but not limited to the following activities: Devising prospective strategies to provide assistance to local areas experiencing disasters Identifying strategies for aversion of layoffs Developing mechanisms for regular exchange of information relating to potential dislocations Collect and analyze data and information for a number of purposes The District of Columbia Rapid Response Team partners with disaster response entities to ensure it fulfills its obligation to deliver services and transition workers to new employment as quickly as possible. Some of the external agencies and government organizations Rapid Response will maintain effective partnerships with include: Emergency management organizations (i.e., state emergency management agencies and FEMA) Chief Elected Officials (CEO) (the Mayor, City Administrator's Office) DC Chamber of Commerce & the WIC Economic development organizations Labor and industry organizations USDOL143Some of the internal agencies Rapid Response will coordinate with for its disaster planning and delivery of services include: Unemployment Insurance (UI) Workforce Development/National Emergency Grant contact Workforce Investment Council American Job Centers (AJC) Business Services The DC Rapid Response team are already in place to provide transition services to the unemployed as a result of employer layoffs, which most often occur last minute, allowing for little planning. Although there is not a great deal of guidance related to disaster response, there are some great examples from other states and jurisdictions from which the District's Rapid Response team has gleaned invaluable information from, including: Purchase and deployment of mobile units for service delivery in disaster areas Support for organizing physical locations for disaster relief centers Support to individuals with applying for unemployment insurance (and Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) Support sharing information on services available, including temporary jobs through National Emergency Grants (NEG) Hiring staff to support range of needs of impacted individuals, including counselors Job search assistance (i.e., evacuees from Hurricane Katrina, Baton Rouge floods) The disaster dictates the response and the DC Rapid Response team seeks to position itself to be connected and embedded in the District's response to disaster recovery in order to provide much- needed employment and training services. Lay off Aversion Strategies The Rapid Response team is an integral partner with the District's Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) and the Department of Human Resources. These partnerships allow DOES to have an early warning of possible layoffs. Ninety percent of dislocations occur within the District and federal governments, therefore it is imperative the layoff aversion strategies are in line with District and federal personnel policies and are controlled by the human resource directorates of those entities. Layoff ave rsion strategies include the following: Prior to separation notices being issued, vacant positions are identified and employees are reassigned to the positions determined as essential to the operation of the agency Positions are filled with temporary employees to perform essential work Positions are frozen when reduction in funds are anticipated A budget deficit triggers the use of furloughs to reduce budget gaps and avoid employee separation, and Job sharing allows two employees to perform the work of one full-time employee.144Recommended layoff aversion strategies are to be discussed during the initial meeting with the employer. Typically, the employers will consider or have considered these options when the decision to have a reduction in force was made. Lay off aversion strategies are used more often in states that have production industries. Establish linkages between firms that are reducing their workforce and firms expanding their workforce. In the case of a natural disaster, the District's procedures to provide RR services include coordination with FEMA and other entities in alignment with the federal regulations. When the District is notified that FEMA has declared the District \"a disaster area eligible for public assistance,\" the District can apply for the appropriate federal resources. The National Emergency Grant (NEG) purpose is to create temporary employment to assist with disaster clean-up activities. Per the federal mandate, the primary award will limit the clean-up period to six months from the date of grant award, until there is a subsequent information justifying a longer clean-up period. The District will include in its fully documented plan, or modification request, a segment for employment-related services. This component will be targeted for workers involved in the clean-up work and who are not returning to their prior employment. The District will demonstrate the participant's need for employment-related assistance to return to the workforce and that non-NEG resources are not accessible to provide the requested services. The employment-related component will provide information on the number of participants requiring assistance, the type of assistance and the duration and planned performance goals. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) : Authorized by the TAA Act of 1974, TAA is a federal program providing reemployment services and benefits to workers who have lost their jobs or suffered a reduction of hours and wages as a result of increased imports or shifts in production outside of the United States. Workers may be eligible for training, travel allowance, subsistence allowance, job search assistance, relocation allowance, reemployment trade adjustment assistance, or trade readjustment assistance. Certified individuals may be eligible to receive one or more program benefits and services depending on what level of assistance is needed to return them to suitable, sustainable employment. Reemployment benefits include 80 percent of paid average weekly wage at the time of layoff. For workers who experience lose jobs due to foreign trade or shifts in production, the Rapid Response team provides information on Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), initiates trade petitions and informs employees of the benefits and services available if the company is certified as trade affected. Although the services are available, the District rarely receives TAA requests. However, the District is poised to serve affected workers from other State Workforce Agencies and mandated to serve them per the federal mandate. The District provides the following benefits to affected workers:145Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) and Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) - a wage subsidy for up to two years that is available to reemployed older works and covers a portion of the difference between a worker's new wage and his/her old wage (up to a specified maximum amount). Training - classroom training, on-the-job training, and customized training designed to meet the needs of a specific employer or group of employers, apprenticeship programs, and more. Relocation Allowances - provide reimbursement for approved expenses if you are successful in obtaining employment outside your normal commuting area for you to relocate to your new area of employment. Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA) - income support available in the form of weekly cash payments to workers who are enrolled in a full-time training course and have exhausted their unemployment insurance. Job Search Allowances - may be payable to cover expenses incurred in seeking employment outside your normal commuting area. The District will use funds that have been reserved for Rapid Response to provide services for every worker group that files a TAA petition. The District's funding structure for RR and TAA are comprised of two separate funding streams. The RR funding is dedicated to program operations which services TAA participants and agency personnel who work with dislocated workers. The TAA reserved funds are utilized for personnel and approved workers to utilize for training, TRA, job search and relocation allowances, ATAA and RTAA benefits. When the Office of Special Programs (OSP) receives a TAA petition, it usually originates from another state that has been impacted and affected by trade. The Rapid Response Team also performs TAA services and actively works with the state agency from which the petition originates to ensure the timely transfer of all necessary documentation and involves necessary internal agency partners in the process. These partners include the UI department, Finance, and the American Jobs Center. OSP also works with the Office of Policy, Performance and Monitoring to ensure they are on track to provide the necessary services within the time allotted per the requirements of federal law. The TAA program has and will continue to help workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade to quickly rejoin the workforce by providing them with the means to attain competitive and marketable skills for today's increasingly competitive work environment. The TAA process typically unfolds in this manner: Company files a petition DOL investigates the petition. If approved, DOL issues a certification; a five-digit number is assigned to the certification Workers are notified about the Trade certification by DOES and Office of Special Programs (OSP)146Workers visit the American Jobs Centers (AJC) for services and case management Benefits are executed by OSP and administered through the AJC and Unemployment Insurance The TAA program assists workers who have lost their jobs as a result of foreign trade. The program offers a variety of benefits and services to eligible workers, including: Job training Income support (TRA) Job search and relocation allowances Tax credit to help pay the costs of health insurance (HCTC) Wage supplement to certain reemployed trade-affected workers 50 years of age and older (RTAA) Under the new TAA rules, petitions that number 70,000 or higher, participants must be enrolled in training within the following timeline: 26 weeks from the date of petition certification OR 26 weeks from the worker's most recent total separation from the certified company 45 days \"extenuating circumstances\" extension is possible Once a petition is approved, affected workers have 26 weeks from the date of petition certification to enroll in a TAA-approved training program. Because Washington DC is the recipient of transferred petitions, we request no less than 60 day notice prior to the expiration of the open petition period. This timeframe is paramount to ensure that appropriate arrangements may be made regarding DC networks enrollment and TAA training program-related expenses including (but not limited to) tuition and fees related to applications, registration, certification, examinations, etc. Upon completion of the handoff from the originating state, the Rapid Response/TAA team maintains weekly contact with the affected worker and connects with appropriate officials at the training program to ensure timely exchange of required documentation within the approved time frame. By utilizing our in-house resources, we collaborate with existing Rapid Response offices like UI, Business Services, and the American Jobs Centers while also keeping lines of communication open with the state from which the petition originated to ensure information is shared while maintaining a web of accountability towards ensuring the participants do not miss the deadline for eligibility.147(b) Adult and Dislocated Worker Program Requirements (1) Work-Based Training Models If the State is utilizing work-based training models (e.g. on-the- job training, incumbent worker training, transitional jobs, and customized training) as part of its training strategy and these strategies are not already discussed in other sections of the plan, describe the State's strategies for how these models ensure high quality training for both the participant and the employer. The District plans to expand investments in alternative training over the next five years, with a particular focus on on-the-job and incumbent worker training, led by the Business Services Group (BSG) of DOES. With On-the-Job (OJT) training, eligible employers have an opportunity to train, mentor and potentially hire candidates who are not fully proficient in a particular skillset or job function. Through the OJT model candidates receive the hand-on training necessary to increase their skills, knowledge and capacity to perform the designated job function. The OJT strategy ensures unemployed and underemployed jobseekers have a chance to enter/ reenter the workforce through an Earn while you Learn model. This streamlined approach developed between select employers and the Department of Employment Services (DOES) allows employers to be reimbursed at an established wage rate in exchange for the training provided to participating OJT candidates. OJTs are designed to lead to long-term employment assuming workers meet the employer's workforce skills needs, and are not meant to serve as a disincentive for local employers to take on full-time, unsubsidized employees, and DOES policies and process reflect this. The rate of reimbursement for employers participating in the OJT strategy will be based on the designated category of the selected OJT candidate. The reimbursement rates are under review and through business engagement will be tested and revised as needed to ensure they are adequate to incentivize employers. The current categories and reimbursement rates are listed below: Reimbursement Guidance 1 - Employer oCategory 1 - 50% Reimbursement Larger Companies (Number of Employees: 100 or more) oCategory 2 - 75% Reimbursement Small to Mid-size companies (Number of Employees: 99 or less) Note: The employer will receive the higher percentage amount from Guidance 1 and 2, even if the candidate falls into a lower percentage rate. Reimbursement Guidance 2 - Participant oCategory 1 - 50% Reimbursement Participant is job ready with significant work experience or skillsets and/or some post-secondary education. oCategory 2 - 75% Reimbursement148Participant is job ready with limited work experience or skillsets, possesses a high school diploma or GED. Other qualifiers include one of the following: Youth ages 18 - 24 Seniors 55 years or older Returning citizens Individuals with disabilities Chronically unemployed Homeless veterans Does not possess a high school diploma or GED Or is not job ready, but possesses the desire to work. OJT Candidates will be assessed to determine their capacity to fulfill the requirement of the job they are interested in pursuing. The results of the assessment will be used to place the candidate within one of the three identified categories. The training instruction and the length of OJT will be determined by the employer or identified industry standards for the particular job function. The agency will use a nationally recognized assessment tool such as Prove-It or Career Ready 101, to gauge the candidates' level of proficiency. Utilizing these tools will aid the case manager, candidate and employer in creating an individualized OJT plan that increases the jobseekers' proficiency level. OJT positions must be full-time, and must provide an hourly wage that meets the District of Columbia's living wage of $13.85 and does not exceed the District's average wage of $23.95 for the participant, with evidence that the participant is on a career pathway towards a higher paying job. However, waivers are allowable for individuals with disabilities and older workers (55 years and older). Exceptions include a job opportunity that is appropriate to the customer's needs, and skill acquisition meets the occupational qualifications, but the starting wage does not meet the $14.00 per hour wage, then an OJT contract can be written for a lower hourly rate in consideration of the participant's extraordinary limitations and/or barriers. The District also realizes that incumbent worker training has the potential to be of immense value to employers, jobseekers, and the public workforce system. Employers are able to offset part of their training costs for their best District-resident employees; incumbent workers gain new skills, advance their careers, and realize increased wages; work-ready District jobseekers seeking entry- level positions will have new openings to apply for; and the public workforce system strengthens its relationship with local employers, better understands the types of skills that are required for success in high-demand occupations and sectors, and the certifications, credentials, and training providers that employers value to make hiring decisions. The District also plans to continue the growth of two transitional jobs strategies: Project Empowerment and LEAP. Both strategies have proven to provide high quality training and149comprehensive employment and supportive services for residents, while positively impacting employer recruitment and retention efforts. Project Empowerment and LEAP are both locally-funded strategies with eligibility criteria that define the programs as serving residents with multiple barriers to employment. Project Empowerment serves a target population with barriers such as basic skills deficiency, lack of a secondary education credential, a documented history of substance abuse, homelessness, a history of job cycling, and a conviction of a felony or previous incarceration. Similarly, LEAP specifically focuses on the provision of transitional employment opportunities for the District's TANF recipients, especially those about to reach their cap on benefits. Through both programs, government, public and private employers are provided 100% wage subsidies in positions that do not displace current employees but are meant to establish work history and whenever possible become permanent jobs upon the subsidy's end. (2) Registered Apprenticeship. Describe how the State will incorporate Registered Apprenticeship into its strategy and services. The District of Columbia is currently recognized by the US Department of Labor to operate as a State Apprenticeship Agency pursuant to Title 29 CFR, part 29.13, and has been since 1946. In 1978, the District of Columbia established a local mandatory apprenticeship law (DC Law 2-156) that requires contractors, who are awarded contracts to perform work on District government assisted construction projects, to register apprenticeship programs with the District of Columbia. The law was amended in 2004 under Bill 15-295 to require a minimum of 35% apprenticeship hours on all government assisted projects to be performed by DC residents. Any contractor who fails to comply with the amended apprenticeship law is subject to a fine of 5% of direct and indirect labor cost of their contract amount. Since the amended law took effect in 2005, there was an immediate impact on the percentages of DC residents employed on District government assisted projects. The results of the amended apprenticeship law are evident on many major city projects: New Ball Park Stadium -157 apprentices, DC resident apprentices 123 or 78% City Market at O Street, NW - 321 apprentices, DC residents 199 or 62% Marriott Marquis Hotel - 313,334.88 apprenticeship hours worked, 197,039.7 or 63% apprenticeship hours were performed by DC residents. The amended mandatory apprenticeship law also impacted the overall employment of DC residents in other work classifications such as, journey-workers, skilled laborers and common laborer on government funded projects. The Marquis Marriott Hotel construction project for example, had the highest overall percentages of DC residents employed on any publically funded construction project in the history of the city. The results are as follows:150Table 16: DC Residents Hired by Marriott Hotel for City Projects Total hours worked DC residents Percentages 704,656.4 30% Total workforce To complement its long history of apprenticeship programs in the construction industry, the District of Columbia is in the midst of an expansion effort to add more non-traditional sectors as career options. This effort looks to increase apprenticeship opportunities to new and emerging industries (related to utilizing apprenticeship models) such as information technology, healthcare and energy. The District Columbia will use local resources coupled with apprenticeship sponsor ETPL eligibility to create an attractive option for non-traditional sector employers to enter the system. Apprenticeship is not limited to the private sector, state and federal government agencies have established registered apprenticeship programs, in which state and federal workers are employed in various apprentice-able occupation areas. In the District, the Department of Public Workers (DPW) is the only agency that currently has a registered apprenticeship program, which had been recognized in the occupation of automotive technician specialist since around 2007. DPW plans to expand apprenticeship training in the occupation of fuel handler and in its maintenance area. There are other District government agencies, in which apprenticeship can be implemented. Expanding the apprenticeship system to include more programs in District government agencies will increase and retain more DC residents in its workforce and reduce the need to seek skilled workers from outside of the city when existing seasoned workers retire. Examples of other DC agencies, in which apprenticeship can be implemented in occupations certified by the Department of Labor: District of Columbia Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) - building inspector DC Water - water treatment operator, instrumentation technician Department of Transportation - equipment operator DC Public School - teacher aide; this is an area, in which a high school graduate can enter as an apprentice, while taking college courses at UDC towards eventually earning a degree in education. This could also assist residents on TANIF participants. Other apprentice-able occupations in the health-care field can be applied to the city's hospital such as, medical assistant, medical laboratory technician, medial coder, and nurse assistant. Apprenticeship can also be implemented for DC Fire Department in the area of Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). The related instruction for the occupation can be held at UDC. To support the ongoing growth and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship opportunities, the District's Department of Employment Services has focused on strategies related to the alignment of151partner systems, the leveraging of federal, state and private resources and the inclusion of underrepresented groups. Through the Career Pathways Task Force and other partner-led initiatives, DOES has convened with education, workforce and economic development partners such as businesses and industry intermediaries. The partnerships and planning sessions have been purposed to better align systems and increase resident accessibility to pathways and earn-as-you-learn opportunities, including apprenticeship, in both traditional and non-tradition industry sectors. DOES currently leverages federal, state and private resources to develop registered apprenticeship programs, provide general tuition assistance and to support enrolled registered apprentices with supportive services. DOES encourages the enrollment of registered apprentices in WIOA and ensures registered apprentices consistently have the opportunity to enroll throughout their participation. Strategies to supported registered apprentices through OJT and ITAs have also been developed. Private resources have been and will continue to be used in the development of employer-based apprenticeship programs. The DOES Business Services Group, in conjunction with the DOES Office of Apprenticeship, Information and Technology, continues to serve as the primary connection to assist residents in entering Registered Apprenticeship programs and positions. To ensure the inclusion of underrepresented groups in these efforts, DOES currently has referral partnerships with community based organizations, DC Public Schools, the American Job Centers, the TANF and FSET programs and various workforce programs throughout the District. To further increase inclusion, DOES has actively identified and met with agencies and organizations committed to serving women, veterans, individuals with disabilities, communities of color and economically disadvantaged groups. (3) Training Provider Eligibility Procedure. Provide the procedure, eligibility criteria and information requirements for determining training provider initial and continued eligibility, including Registered Apprenticeship programs (WIOA Section 122). The WIC sets policies related to eligible training providers (ETP) and the use of federal funds for training under WIOA, including through individual training accounts (ITA). While the WIC is currently finalizing a policy manual update that will be shared with the WIC Executive Committee for their approval at their next meeting on September 15, 2016 and will subsequently be publically posted to the WIC website at dcworks.dc.gov and disseminated to workforce development system stakeholders, the WIC Board previously passed WIOA-specific policies related to both ETPs and ITAs that can be found at http://dmped.dc.gov/node/637022. These updates will be incorporated into the Policy manual.152Key elements of the District's WIOA Eligible Training Providers policy (2013-009, Change 1) include the following: requirements for the types of ETPs and relevant licensures needed for eligibility; requirements for the types of training allowed, with a focus on programming offering industry-recognized credentials or degrees and directly related to employer needs in high demand sectors and occupations as defined by the WIC; criteria to establish both initial and continued eligibility, including the submission of performance data for all program participants (not just those funded through WIOA); exceptions to the full process, including for apprenticeship programs - which are automatically eligible for inclusion; and approval and removal processes, including the process for denying eligibility based on performance and appeals to the process. Key elements of the District's WIOA Individual Training Accounts policy (2013-008, change 2) include the following: ITA amounts allowed for ETPs based on a market rate determination relevant timeframes; allowable services for ITA payments, including occupational training, related expenses, and career or support services; requirements that other federal and state funds available to support training program participation, such as Pell grants, are utilized prior to ITA consideration; and customer choice requirements. (4) Describe how the State will implement and monitor the priority for public assistance recipients, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient in accordance with the requirements of WIOA sec. 134(c)(3)(E), which applies to individualized career services and training services funded by the Adult Formula program. Pursuant to Sec 134(c)(3)(E) of WIOA, DOES has developed a policy and procedures to ensure priority of Adult and Dislocated Worker training and employment services for those jobseekers that are veterans, receiving public assistance, low-income, or are determined to be basic skills deficient. As outlined in TEGL 3-15, the priority of service for WIOA Adult and Dislocated Workers in the District is as follows: 1.1st Priority - Covered persons (veterans and eligible spouses) who are: o Low income [as defined by WIOA Sec. 3(36)], or o Recipients of public assistance, or o Who are basic skills deficient. 2.2nd Priority - Individuals (non-covered persons) who are: o Low income [as defined by WIOA Sec. 3(36)], or o Recipients of public assistance, or o Who are basic skills deficient.1533.3rd Priority - Veterans and eligible spouses who are: o Not low income, and o Not recipients of public assistance, and o Not basic skills deficient. 4.4th Priority - Individuals (non-covered persons) who do not meet the above priorities may be enrolled. These individuals are: oNot veterans or eligible spouses, and oNot low income, and oNot recipients of public assistance, and oNot basic skills deficient. During enrollment into WIOA, Workforce Development Specialists (WDS) are required to determine each customer's Priority of Service level, and mark the priority level on the Priority of Service Determination form that must be signed by the WDS. The backside of this determination form also provides details on how low-income status should be determined under WIOA. This low-income definition includes: the various forms of public assistance receipt; the current Federal Poverty Line (based on guidelines released by the Department of Health and Human Services) and 70% of Lower Living Standard Income Levels (LLSIL, released by DOLETA) based on different family/household sizes; homeless individuals; foster children; and all low-income individuals with disabilities regardless of their family/household income. In the District, basic skills deficiency is determined by using the eCASAS test, and defined as having reading and/or math scores at or below the 8th grade level. Customers receiving public assistance are asked to provide documentation, which is included in the customer's folder. The Priority of Service Determination form is stored in the customer's file, and if applying to enroll in training services, the customer's training folder as well. WDSs are required to identify the participant's Priority of Service level on the customer folder tab\u2014as P1, P2, P3, or P4\u2014along with last name, first name, and last four of their SSN. This labeling mechanism is to ensure that when customer files are in the process of review and approval for services (such as training), that the Priority of Service is always followed. Priority of Service is covered in the training for new Workforce Development Specialists and other AJC staff, and will continue to be emphasized and communicated in upcoming and ongoing professional development and WIOA training sessions at all AJCs. (5) Describe the State's criteria regarding local area transfer of funds between the adult and dislocated worker programs. In accordance with WIOA Section 133(b)(4), the Department of Employment Services has been given the authority to approve transfer requests on behalf of the Mayor.154Each program year the Department of Labor (DOL) provides funds to the state in two separate allotments. The first allotment begins July 1 and the second allotment begins October 1. Transfer requests can be submitted anytime during the two-year life of the funds. Funds transferred must stay within the original year of allocation. They must also stay within their respective allocation time period (i.e., July 1, first allocation funds, or October 1, second allocation funds). Accordingly, funds cannot be transfer between program years or between first and second allocations. In addition, DOES will ensure that its funds are not overdrawn during the time a transfer takes place. If this condition occurs, the transfer will not be approved. In order to accommodate DOL reporting requirements, formula funds may not be transferred directly from the dislocated worker grant codes to the adult grant codes (501 to 201 and 502 to 202) or vice versa (201 to 501 and 202 to 502). Instead, the funds are transferred to distinct grant codes that remain attached to their original funding stream. AJC Operations must submit transfer requests in writing to the OCFO and all requests must contain the reason(s)/rationale for the transfer. The OCFO will consider the following factors in its review of transfer requests: Changes in planned services to eligible participants Unexpected layoffs requiring additional funds Changes in the goals for serving eligible participants Changes in labor market conditions Effect of transfer on jointly funded employment and training programs in American Job Centers Effect on existing agreements for the delivery and/or coordination of employment and training services Effect on current workforce system employment and training systems Effect on the employment and training needs of eligible participants in the local programs (c)Youth Program Requirements. With respect to youth workforce investment activities authorized in section 129 of WIOA,\u2014 (1) Identify the State-developed criteria to be used by local boards in awarding grants for youth workforce investment activities and describe how the local boards will take into consideration the ability of the providers to meet performance accountability measures based on primary indicators of performance for the youth program as described in section 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA in awarding such grants. As a single-area state, the District's WIC sets policies related to the awarding of grants and contracts for youth workforce activities and methods to take into consideration the ability of the providers to meet performance accountability measures based on primary indicators of performance in awarding funds. Current WIC policies can be found at http://dmped.dc.gov/node/637022 , and the WIC is currently in the process of re-evaluating policies to ensure compliance with WIOA. DOES selects providers of youth services and administers the WIOA Youth program through these policies and additional WIC oversight.155DOES's Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Youth providers was modified in 2015 to reflect the new performance accountability measures and eligibility requirements for ISY and OSY under WIOA. Interested service providers are required to demonstrate with their service strategy that there is a clear path for every participant to attain WIOA performance accountability. The plan must identify career pathways that include education and employment goals with appropriate services to meet those goals. The service strategy must also take into account an objective assessment of the young adult's basic skills, occupational skills, work experience, interests, aptitudes, academic levels, skill levels, and other needs of the individual. All services must be documented during the engagement to include weekly timesheets that verify participation and provide specifics of the activity. All youth services providers will be trained to use the DCNetworks (VOS) system to record enrollments, to outline and update service strategies, to document assessments, participant activities, status changes, and outcomes. Maintaining case notes of participant contact, interactions, and activities of the participant, progress, and methods to resolve barriers, is important documentation that provides a record of services. Accurate and timely data entry in VOS is required to ensure mandated accountability for performance indicators on both a federal, state and local level, in addition to individual providers. All WIOA Title I Youth activities for ISY and OSY will be delivered by contracted vendors, after responding to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and then negotiating a Human Care Agreement (HCA) contract outlining the details of their program and service strategy. In addition to requirements regarding performance accountability detailed above, service providers must also describe which of the fourteen program elements are included in their service strategy, their methodology for providing those program elements, and what, if any, subcontractors and other partners will be utilized to ensure comprehensive service delivery to ISY and OSY. Contractors will demonstrate the ability to enhance design, coordinate and deliver year round activities and services for WIOA eligible youth that promote: Earning a high school diploma or GED Preparation for postsecondary education and training Career preparation Work-based learning Employment in demand driven occupations Earning postsecondary credentials Describe the strategies the State will use to achieve improved outcomes for out-of-school youth as described in 129(a)(1)(B), including how it will leverage and align the core programs, any Combine State Plan partner programs included in this Plan, required and optional one-stop partner programs, and any other resources available.156As noted above in Section II(c) - State Strategy, the District's strategies for supporting youth (Goal 5) are focused on ensuring that the District's full range of programs are coordinated with WIOA Youth activities. SYEP has been a significant component of the District's local youth workforce development system over the last 37 years, and is an important asset in providing exposure to the world of work to thousands of youth each year. To help drive enrollment in WIOA Youth programming - a key challenge the District is working to address - DOES's Office of Youth Programs (OYP) will use the applicant pool from SYEP to recruit youth for its WIOA programs. OYP will also use various strategies including, but not limited to, social media, e-mail blasts, text messaging, Workforce on Wheels, and community events through various school partnerships to conduct youth outreach. Referrals from Youth Earn and Learn, the Pathways for Young Adults Program, and the DC High School Internship program will also be leveraged to help drive enrollment gains and identify youth that can best benefit from WIOA Youth services. Finally, OYP will visit all High Schools in the District on a regular basis, in order to ensure these essential partners have a basic understanding of the services and program offerings that are available to all graduates who do not have post-secondary engagement plans. Additionally, programs such as the DC Career Connections Program (DCCC) are designed for specific demographics including youth who have been involved in the criminal justice system, are pregnant or parenting, have low educational attainment, are homeless, or have documented behavioral health challenges. This program will be coupled with WIOA programs that will provide necessary support including barrier removal techniques and innovative strategies to keep youth engaged. OYP also has strong partnerships with many educational institutions throughout the District including, the District of Columbia Public Schools, the Public Charter School Board, the OSSE Re-Engagement Center, the Potomac Job Corps Center, and the University of the District of Columbia-Community College, which enables it to operate a streamlined process to move jobseekers into training or connected them to needed resources. The District will also ensure that WIOA Youth services are well linked to core partner programming, including leveraging the Virtual One-Stop (VOS) database, employer services, and well-coordinated referrals and/or co-enrollment in vocational rehabilitation and adult education services where relevant. In addition to the strategies related to recruiting youth into WIOA programming from other District- funded initiatives noted above, DOES's OYP is also undertaking significant efforts to recruit additional District youth into WIOA services that are not participating in other initiatives. Recruitment efforts include community outreach events, social media engagement, and an online platform where youth can request services needed. OYP will also work closely with AJC staff in ensuring that youth in partner programs such as Job Corps, YouthBuild, TANF, and Vocational Rehabilitation programming have access to WIOA services, or alternately that youth enrolled in WIOA programming can access these additional resources. As many youth may also be eligible to transition into WIOA Adult and Dislocated worker services, OYP staff will also work with AJC staff to ensure effective transitions as needed. The development of online, easy to access surveys regarding services offered, services desired and requesting actual feedback on the DOES OYP experience will provide a pathway for DOES performance evaluation. The surveys will provide real-time and reflective data to determine where157changes can be made immediately and strategically in the future. The data used in a scorecard dashboard setting creates dialogue and open forum discussion for improved services, greater community outreach, and best practice case management that seamlessly connects youth participants to the services that best meet their needs across all available federal and local programming. (3) Describe how the state will ensure that all 14 program elements described in WIOA section 129(c)(2) are made available and effectively implemented. All WIOA Title I Youth activities for ISY and OSY will be delivered by contracted vendors, after responding to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and then negotiating a Human Care Agreement (HCA) contract outlining the details of their program and service strategy. In addition to requirements regarding performance accountability detailed above, service providers must also describe which of the fourteen program elements are included in their service strategy, their methodology for providing those program elements, and what, if any, subcontractors and other partners will be utilized to ensure comprehensive service delivery to ISY and OSY. Contractors will demonstrate the ability to enhance design, coordinate and deliver year round activities and services for WIOA eligible youth that promote: Earning a high school diploma or GED Preparation for postsecondary education and training Career preparation Work-based learning Employment in demand driven occupations Earning postsecondary credentials (4) Provide the language contained in the State policy for \"requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment\" criterion specified in WIOA sections 129(a)(1)(B)(iii)(VIII) and 129(a)(1)(C)(iv)(VII) and for \"requiring additional assistance to complete an education program, or to secure and hold employment\" criterion for in- school youth specified in WIOA section 129(a)(1)(C)(iv)(VII). The District expects to approve a final state policy defining \"requiring additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program, or to secure and hold employment\" by the end of the second quarter of PY 2016. As this policy is finalized, DOES has issued the following set of criteria as guidance for identifying out-of-school youth \"requiring additional assistance.\" The final policy is expected to contain the same or similar criteria. Incarcerated parent Victim of violence Behavior problems at school158Family literacy problems Domestic violence Substance abuse Chronic health conditions One or more grade levels below appropriate for age Attending a Title I school, or school that is currently meeting the failing criteria as identified by the stated accountability system Lives in, or attends school in, a PSA identified as a high-crime area (5) Include the State definition, as defined in law, for not attending school and attending school as specified in WIOA Section 129(a)(1)(B)(i) and Section 129(a)(1)(C)(i). If State law does not define \"not attending school\" or \"attending school,\" indicate that is the case. There are currently no laws in the DC Code that define \"not attending school\" or \"attending school.\" (6) If not utilizing the portion of the basic skills deficient definition contained in WIOA Section 3(5)(B), include the specific State definition. The District does not intend to use the basic skills deficient definition contained in WIOA Section 3(5)(B) for its WIOA youth program. The District will use WIOA Section 3(5)(A), which states as follows: \"Basic skills deficient\": The term ``basic skills deficient'' means, with respect to an individual- (A) who is a youth, that the individual has English reading, writing, or computing skills at or below the 8th grade level on a generally accepted standardized test.\" The District intends to use the CASAS exam as its standardized test of record. The agencies that comprise this unified plan are working toward completing a comprehensive MOU, and this comprehensive MOU will include uniform CASAS standards and procedures across all WIOA- funded programs, including a definition of Basic Skills Deficient. However, the WIC will evaluate this policy to ensure that the use of the CASAS exam does not pose a barrier for participants who can otherwise demonstrate basic skills proficiency by other means. (d) Single-area State requirements. In States where there is only one local workforce investment area, the governor serves as both the State and local chief elected official. In such cases, the State must submit any information required in the local plan (WIOA section 106(d)(2)). States with a single workforce area must also include: (1) Any comments from the public comment period that represent disagreement with the Plan. (WIOA section 108(d)(3).)159(2) The entity responsible for the dispursal of grant funds, as determined by the governor, if different from that for the State. (WIOA section 108(b)(15). During the thirty-day public comment period, February 12 through March 14, 2016, the District's draft WIOA State Plan was made available for the public to view and comment on through a variety of ways. The plan was posted on the site drafts.dc.gov which allows readers to attach comments directly to specific portions of the plan or leave overall feedback. The plan was also posted in PDF format on the WIC's website, dcworks.dc.gov. The public was able to email comments to the WIC atwic.dmped@dc.gov or mail them to the WIC offices. Hard copies of the plan were made available at DC public libraries in all eight wards. Additionally, the WIC held several public engagement events throughout the public comment period to educate the public on the plan and encourage feedback. The WIC organized the following events: Table 17: WIOA State Plan Engagement Events Date Time Co-host/Audience/Theme Location February 17, 2016 12pm-2pm Council for Workforce Development Audience: Members of the public, Advocacy groups, workforce stakeholdersRise Demonstration Center, 2730 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave., SE February 19, 2016 9am-11am DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Audience: Members of DCAFLCThe Meyer Foundation, 1250 Connecticut Ave NW, Suite 800 March 3 , 2016 9:30am-10:30am Disconnected Youth Change Network Audience: Members of Raise DC, DYCNVenture Philanthropy Partners, 1201 15th St NW, Suite 510 March 8, 2016 1pm-3pm DC Interagency Council on Homelessness Audience: Stakeholders working on homelessness, residents who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.Wilson Building, 1350 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, RM G-9 March 9, 2016 8:30am -12:30pm Community Foundation Audience: Members of the public, Advocates Breakout sessions on adult literacy, adult workforce, youth servicesThurgood Marshall Center, 1816 12TH St NW March 10, 2016 4pm-6pm DOES, ReEngagement Center (OSSE) Audience: Youth Dialogue session to hear from youth on their education and workforce needs.DOES Community Room, 4058 Minnesota Ave. NE March 11, 2016 10am-12pm New Communities, in partnership with DHS Audience: DHS in WIOA section 108(d)(3), public comments that disagree with the plan can be found in Appendix 7; in addition to more information on how feedback was addressed. DOES serves as the District's fiscal agent and disburses grant funds. The WIC sets policies related to WIOA funds and provides oversight. (3) The type and availability of WIOA title I Youth activities, including an identification of successful providers of such activities. (WIOA section 108(b)(9).) Due to the District having only one local workforce investment area, the following local plan information is required to be included in the WIOA Plan. DOES's Office of Youth Programs (OYP) provides an array of programs and services designed to target and engage youth from ages 14-24. The services offered by both DOES OYP and its providers are described in Table 18. Table 18: Services Offered by DOES OYP and Providers Service Description Outreach/ Recruitment/ Eligibility DOES will conduct outreach and recruitment and verifying participant eligibility. DOES will also make program referrals of eligible youth and will assist in establishing connections with partner agencies such as OSSE, DHS, and CFSA. Providers are encouraged to perform outreach and recruitment activities. Providers may support youth with the collection of eligibility documents and for their timely submission to DOES. DOES will be responsible for determining and documenting participant eligibility prior to WIOA program enrollment. Providers are required to maintain all program documentation and ensure that DOES receives all required program updates through regular entry of data in the system.161Service Description Intake/Assessment DOES will conduct the initial intake process to include conducting intake interviews and the initial objective assessment. DOES will coordinate with partner agencies to collect pre-existing assessment data. Providers will be offered training and technical assistance to conduct the initial objective assessment as appropriate. Providers will be responsible for conducting assessments to measure progress throughout the duration of the program. Referrals DOES will be responsible for making the official referral to an eligible service provider. This does not prevent providers from conducting outreach and recruitment of participants, however, the provider may not enroll a participant until DOES has deemed that participant eligible and made the appropriate referral. Case Management/ISS DevelopmentCase Management is the foundation of the service delivery in the workforce system and is effectively managed by the provider Case Manager and DOES. Comprehensive case management includes the development of Individual Service Strategies (ISS), follow-up services, case note updates, and on-going file maintenance. DOES will be responsible for ensuring that the provider maintains a comprehensive case file per youth. The Individual Service Strategy (ISS) is developed in conjunction with the youth participant, Case Manager, and educational counselor in an effort to establish a concise path towards meeting educational/occupational goals. Program Services The provider is responsible for ensuring program services are effectively developed, delivered, and made readily accessible to all referred youth participants. Providers will be required to demonstrate how their program meets the fourteen (14) required program elements under WIOA. However, providers will not necessarily be responsible for delivering all 14.162Service Description Placement of Jobs or Continuing EducationThe provider is responsible for establishing internship opportunities for work based learning experience and/or facilitating the development of professional development skills for each participant. Follow-Up/Exit Youth service providers are responsible for maintaining twelve (12) months of follow-up services for the youth participants. DOES and the provider work collaboratively to ensure a successful exit is completed and captured in the Virtual One-Stop System. DOES will work to ensure that all program participants have access to the array of services and programs that are part of its youth and adult workforce systems and of the District's larger workforce development system.163TITLE I-B ASSURANCES TheStatePlanmustincludeassurancesthat: 1.The State has implemented a policy to ensure Adult program funds provide a priority in the delivery of training services and individualized career services to individuals who are low income, public assistance recipients or basic skills deficient; Yes 2.The State has implemented a policy to ensure local areas have a process in place for referring veterans with significant barriers to employment to career services provided by the JVSG program's Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) specialist; Yes 3.The State has established a written policy and procedure that set forth criteria to be used by chief elected officials for the appointment of local workforce investment board members; Yes 4.The State established written policy and procedures to ensure local workforce investment boards are certified by the governor every two years in accordance with WIOA section 107(c)(2); Yes 5.Where an alternative entity takes the place of a State Board, the State has written policy and procedures to ensure the alternative entity meets the definition under WIOA section 101(e) and the legal requirements for membership; Yes 6.The State established a written policy and procedure for how the individuals and entities represented on the State Workforce Development Board help to determine the methods and factors of distribution, and how the State consults with chief elected officials in local areas throughout the State in determining the distributions; Yes 7.The State will not use funds received under WIOA Title I to assist, promote, or deter union organizing in accordance with WIOA section 181(b)(7); Yes 8.The State distributes adult and youth funds received under WIOA equitably throughout the State, and no local area suffers significant shifts in funding from year-to-year during the period covered by this plan; Yes1649.If a State Workforce Development Board, department, or agency administers State laws for vocational rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, that board, department, or agency cooperates with the agency that administers Wagner-Peyser services, Adult and Dislocated Worker programs and Youth Programs under Title I; Yes 10.The State agrees to report on the impact and outcomes of its approved waivers in its WIOA Annual ReportYes 11.The State has taken appropriate action to secure compliance with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR 200 and 2 CFR 2900, including that the State will annually monitor local areas to ensure compliance and otherwise take appropriate action to secure compliance with the Uniform Guidance under section WIOA 184(a)(3); Yes WAGNER-PEYSER (a) Employment Service Professional Staff Development. The Wagner-Peyser Act offers employment services to job seekers and employers alike. The District is working to create new directives for its Wagner-Peyser program in order to address the challenges employers encounter in obtaining highly skilled talent. The demand driven system is create benefits the job seekers by directing individuals to prepare for jobs that are in-demand and matching talent to those jobs that are in-demand. Stronger partnerships are being created and renewed in order to improve service delivery, to avoid duplication of services we are working on sharing data across programs. (1) Describe how the State will utilize professional development activities for Employment Service staff to ensure staff is able to provide high quality services to both jobseekers and employers. To utilize professional development activities for Employment Services staff, the Business Services Group (DOES) will continue coordinating with AJC and other core agency staff. The activities will be designed to enable staff to provide high-quality services to job seekers and employers. The activities will educate, inspire and train staff to meet the demand of the District system. Staff from BSG will be cross trained by all partner agencies to ensure that they will work with these agencies to enable successful job matches with employers based on the skills and abilities of the resident, and the corresponding needs of the employer.165(2) Describe strategies developed to support training and awareness across core programs and the Unemployment Insurance program and the training provided for Employment Services and WIOA staff on identification of Unemployment Insurance (UI) eligibility issues and referral to UI staff for adjudication Strategies to develop training and awareness for staff ranging across various programs began in 2015 when workforce started working with the unemployment insurance division to cross train staff. Cross training around eligibility issues have been critical to our reemployment activities. The trainings will continue in 2016, and will include all AJC staff including those from one-stop partners at OSSE and DDS/RSA. The trainings focus on 3 areas: The importance of identifying and reporting eligibility issues How to identify eligibility issues How to report eligibility issues. (b) Explain how the State will provide information and meaningful assistance to individuals requesting assistance in filing a claim for unemployment compensation through one-stop centers, as required by WIOA as a career service. Staff training and development will help to improve the One-Stop experience for UI claimants. Additionally, there are multiple resources to assist an individual needing assistance or information in filing an unemployment compensation claim at a One-Stop Center. Workforce and unemployment insurance have been collaborating for the last few years to provide meaningful assistance to claimants filing for unemployment through the AJC. The two divisions have been actively working to sync systems so that information regarding claimants can be shared in \"real time\". This assistance will allow unemployment insurance to connect and verify a claimant's activity with our virtual one stop system and case notes regarding job search. (c)Describe the State's strategy for providing reemployment assistance to UI claimants and other unemployed individuals. UI claimants are able to receive reemployment assistance through the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) Program. RESEA provides services to claimants selected by unemployment insurance department and has three main focus areas: 1) to help those who are most likely to exhaust unemployment insurance benefits 2) to reduce erroneous payments and 3) to assist all returning veterans. In PY 2014, DOES made significant upgrades to the RESEA technology systems. The up- grades allowed the agency to fulfill administrative and programmatic activities in accordance with federal166guidelines. Reemployment program attendance reports were shared with the Unemployment Insurance (UI) staff on a weekly basis. Non-compliant RESEA customers became subject to interruption of benefits. Information about REA customers who returned to work full-time was timely entered in the database. And staff performed wage bumps and made follow-up telephone calls to ascertain the employment status of participants. During a customer RESEA session they receive an orientation of the center services, UI disqualifications, resume review, work search review, LMI review and one on one job counseling. RESEA sessions are held every Monday at the AJC Northeast. (d) Describe how the State will use W-P funds to support UI claimants, and the communication between W-P and UI, as appropriate including the following: (1) Coordination of and provision of labor exchange services for UI claimants as required by the Wagner-Peyser Act; Wagner-Peyser funds, including items/services paid for by Wagner-Peyser funds, may also be utilized to support UI claimants. Each AJC in the District has a resource room that contains computers, Internet access, telephones, printers, fax machines, unemployment staff and information and a variety of job search and career exploration aides including the labor exchange. The unemployment insurance claimant may access these via self-services or individualized career services. These services are available to all job seekers in the AJC, with a designated self-help area with light touch services available when needed by the claimant. The Districts AJC have unemployment insurance staff housed in each center. Those staff coordinates all claimants that they assist in speaking with an AJC workforce staff person for job search assistance. Currently under development are IT system changes that will allow both workforce and unemployment systems to request UI and Workforce services in \"real time\", upon application. This development will allow for pop up messages for all claimants as they file each week, also reminders about how many more weeks they are allowed to receive benefits and also workforce activities scheduled for that week. DOES OIT is working to develop this program and will allow both sides to share information. In addition, DOES is exploring full replacement of the UI and workforce systems to enable better system integration. (2) Registration of UI claimants with the State's employment service if required by State law; Currently all claimants must register with workforce services when they are initially filing a claim. The claimants must create a profile that includes career type, desired positions and educations. Employers are able to search and view information stored in the claimants workforce profile to locate the best candidates for an interview. As workforce staff meets with claimants around job search and if an issue is detected during this time, the claimant is redirected back to the167unemployment insurance staff. The staff will then speak with the customer directly about the detected issue. (3) Administration of the work test for the State unemployment compensation system, including making eligibility assessments (for referral to UI adjudication, if needed), and providing job finding and placement services for UI claimants; and In addition to the joint registration expansion, the District intends to expand its current model for the administration of the UI Work Test. The current model provides Employment Services (ES) staff with the ability to conduct the Work Test after a claimant has been randomly selected to attend an RESEA session or through Profiling, which both usually occur after weeks of receiving benefits. The new UI Work Test model will provide an earlier point of entry, by allowing the ability to administer the Work Test, which includes conducting a work search review and providing the claimant with labor market availability data, at the onset of the unemployment insurance (UI) certification process. In accordance with the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act, and as an additional condition of eligibility for UI benefits, claimants will be required to complete mandatory enrollment with Employment Services, which will include an automated assessment tool. A weekly report will be generated and distributed to both UI and ES that will include a list of all claimants who have successfully completed the full registration process and as such, are eligible to move forward in the UI application and ES service referral processes. ES will use this report to ensure that contact is made with each claimant within a certain radius, to conduct a skill assessment and to administer the UI Work Test which will consist of the following: 1. Referring UI claimants to jobs for which they qualify according to the skills and employment assessments. 2. Detecting any possible issues that have the potential to affect the claimant's eligibility to receive UI benefits and report the potential issues to UI resources to appropriately address. 3. Closely monitoring the accepted referral to determine whether a proper work search was conducted, including verification of employer contact by the claimant and verification of reporting or any failure on the claimant's part to report to an interview. 4. Determining the outcome of any interview, including if a job offer occurred and acceptance or rejection of the job offer. (Rejection of the job offer would also result in a referral to a UI resource to determine if the claimant rejected suitable work.) 5. Determining if the claimant if the claimant reported to work and monitoring the duration of the claimant's employment through a specified period. The District recognizes its responsibility to provide reemployment services to UI beneficiaries and plans to ensure that claimants receive the full range of services available in an effort to reduce the duration of unemployment and to yield the best results to get the unemployed back to work.168(4) Provision of referrals to and application assistance for training and education programs and resources. Wagner-Peyser services are aligned with Adult and Dislocated Worker services in the District. AJC staff members refer job seekers to training, support services and a more intensive level of service that Wagner-Peyser dollars do not fund. Workforce staff routinely refer job seekers to training for high-demand occupations. If Workforce Development Specialists are unable to serve jobseekers after their initial visit and assessment, and the jobseeker is interested in continued service, Specialists will ask that jobseekers make an appointment to return and to bring the necessary documentation to assess eligibility and become enrolled in WIOA. Workforce staff routinely refer job seekers to training for high-demand occupations. This will provide employers with the talent they need and job seekers with the jobs they desire. (e) Agricultural Outreach Plan (AOP). Each State agency must develop an AOP every four years as part of the Unified or Combined State Plan required under sections 102 or 103 of WIOA. The AOP must include\u2014 1. Assessment of Need Provide an assessment of the unique needs of farmworkers in the area based on past and projected agricultural and farmworker activity in the State. Such needs may include but are not limited to: employment, training, and housing. The District of Columbia had zero employment in all agricultural and food processing sectors related to Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers (MSFWs) in 2014 and 2015, based on the available data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), as seen in Table 19 below . No jobs are projected in these sectors in the District in 2016-2020.169Table 19: Agricultural and Food Processing Sector Related to Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers: Employment and Growth NAICS Description2014 Jobs2015 Jobs2014 - 2015 % ChangeProjected 2016 JobsProjected 2020 Jobs 111000 Crop Production 0 0 0% 0 0 112000 Animal Production and Aquaculture 0 0 0% 0 0 113110 Timber Tract Operations 0 0 0% 0 0 113210Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products0 0 0%0 0 113310 Logging 0 0 0% 0 0 114111 Finfish Fishing 0 0 0% 0 0 114112 Shellfish Fishing 0 0 0% 0 0 114119 Other Marine Fishing 0 0 0% 0 0 114210 Hunting and Trapping 0 0 0% 0 0 115111 Cotton Ginning 0 0 0% 0 0 115112 Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating 0 0 0% 0 0 115113 Crop Harvesting, Primarily by Machine 0 0 0% 0 0 115114Postharvest Crop Activities (except Cotton Ginning)0 0 0%0 0 115115 Farm Labor Contractors and Crew Leaders 0 0 0% 0 0 115116 Farm Management Services 0 0 0% 0 0 115210 Support Activities for Animal Production 0 0 0% 0 0 115310 Support Activities for Forestry 0 0 0% 0 0 311411Frozen Fruit, Juice, and Vegetable Manufacturing0 0 0%0 0 311421 Fruit and Vegetable Canning 0 0 0% 0 0 311611 Animal (except Poultry) Slaughtering 0 0 0% 0 0 Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), District of Columbia, 2014- 2015, via EMSI. In Program Year 2015, there have been very few instances of Wagner-Peyser customers counted as MSFWs (in the ETA 9002 reports) based upon the information they have provided when self- registering for DCNetworks. Reviews of these customer files in DCNetworks (including work history and skills listed) have revealed these MSFWs to be misidentifications. As such, the District determines that there is no need for MSFW-specific services and outreach, and there are no plans to identify grantees to deliver services listed in WIOA Section 167, National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP).1702. Outreach Activities The local offices outreach activities must be designed to meet the needs of MSFWs in the State and to locate and contact MSFWs who are not being reached through normal intake activities. Describe the State agency's proposed strategies for: With no MSFW needs identified in the District, there are no plans to conduct specific outreach for MSFWs. A. Contacting farmworkers who are not being reached by the normal intake activities conducted by the employment service offices. With no MSFW needs identified in the District, there are no plans to conduct specific outreach for MSFWs. B. Providing technical assistance to outreach workers. Technical assistance must include trainings, conferences, additional resources, and increased collaboration with other organizations on topics such as one-stop center services (i.e. availability of referrals to training, supportive services, and career services, as well as specific employment opportunities), the employment service complaint system, information on the other organizations serving MSFWs in the area, and a basic summary of farmworker rights, including their rights with respect to the terms and conditions of employment. With no MSFW needs identified in the District, the District does not staff outreach workers for the MSFW population. C. Increasing outreach worker training and awareness across core programs including the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program and the training on identification of UI eligibility issues. With no MSFW needs identified in the District, the District does not staff outreach workers for the MSFW population. D. Providing State merit staff outreach workers professional development activities to ensure they are able to provide high quality services to both jobseekers and employers. With no MSFW needs identified in the District, the District does not staff outreach workers for the MSFW population.171E. Coordinating outreach efforts with NFJP grantees as well as with public and private community service agencies and MSFW groups. With no MSFW needs identified in the District, the District does not have outreach efforts to MSFW groups. While the District does not have an NFJP grantee, we plan to coordinate with neighboring NFJP grantees in Virginia and Maryland in order to educate AJC staff on available services for MSFWs from fellow practitioners in the region. 3. Services provided to farmworkers and agricultural employers through the one-stop delivery system. Describe the State agency's proposed strategies for: (A) Providing the full range of employment and training services to the agricultural community, both farmworkers and agricultural employers, through the one-stop delivery system. This includes: How career and training services required under WIOA Title I will be provided to MSFWs through the one-stop centers; How the State serves agricultural employers and how it intends to improve such services. Given the possibility of the growth of the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) population, the District's American Job Center staff will be prepared to provide the full range of employment and training services to farmworkers and their families who are in need of services, as they would for any individual. If these services are found to be insufficient, AJC staff will work to connect the individuals with appropriate MSFW services offered by neighboring jurisdictions, such as the NFJP grantees in Maryland and Virginia. As there are no identified agricultural employers in the District at this time, no services are provided to them. (B) Marketing the employment service complaint system to farmworkers and other farmworker advocacy groups. With no MSFWs needs identified in the District, DOES does not market an employment service complaint system to farmworkers or advocacy groups. (C) Marketing the Agricultural Recruitment System to agricultural employers and how it intends to improve such publicity.172With no agricultural employers identified as being established in the District, DOES does not market an Agricultural Recruitment System to agricultural employers. 4. Other Requirements (A) Collaboration Describe any collaborative agreements the state workforce agency (SWA) has with other MSFW service providers including NFJP grantees and other service providers. Describe how the SWA intends to build upon/increase collaboration with existing partners and in establishing new partners over the next four years (including any approximate timelines for establishing agreements or building upon existing agreements). While the District has not historically seen MSFWs visit the AJC system, DOES will ensure that AJC managers and staff are aware of the services available in neighboring states Virginia and Maryland\u2014both of which contract with Telamon Corporation as their WIOA 167 National Farm Workers Job Program grantee. As a first stage of collaboration, DOES will issue periodic directives and a fact-sheet to AJC staff informing them of the MD and VA locations that MSFWs can receive specialized services. According to the Maryland WIOA State Plan, just 3% of outreach activities take place in the counties closest to the District of Columbia. For MSFWs interested in Eastern Shore, Maryland, they will be referred to the Salisbury American Job Center, where the MD NFJP grantee is co- located. According to the Virginia WIOA State Plan, Winchester is the closest region to the District of Columbia with agricultural services staff, with one full-time Farm Placement Specialist based out of the local Winchester VA office at 100 Premier Place. The nearest Telamon site offering NFJP services is located in Montross, Virginia, roughly seventy-five miles from the District. MSFWs interested in receiving services and/or relocating to Virginia for work will be referred to these sites. Additionally, DOES will reach out to representatives at the Virginia Workforce Connection (VAWC) and Maryland Jobs Now (MJN) to request agricultural services staff and/or Telamon representatives to host an event or webinar, so that DOES AJC system staff can learn more about NFJP and other available services for MSFWs from fellow practitioners in the region. (B) Review and Public Comment. In developing the AOP, the SWA must solicit information and suggestions from NFJP grantees, other appropriate MSFW groups, public agencies, agricultural employer organizations, and other interested organizations. In addition, at least 45 calendar days before submitting its final AOP, the SWA must provide a proposed plan to NFJP grantees, public agencies, agricultural employer173organizations, and other organizations expressing an interest and allow at least 30 days for review and comment. The SWA must: 1) Consider any comments received in formulating its final proposed AOP; 2) Inform all commenting parties in writing whether their comments have been incorporated and, if not, the reasons therefore; and 3) Transmit the comments and recommendations received and its responses with the submission of the AOP. The AOP must include a statement confirming NFJP grantees, other appropriate MSFW groups, public agencies, agricultural employer organizations and other interested employer organizations have been given an opportunity to comment on the AOP. Include the list of organizations from which information and suggestions were solicited, any comments received, and responses to those comments. With no MSFW needs identified and no agricultural employers established in the District, the District determines that there is no need for MSFW-specific services and outreach. Consequently, the District did not solicit information and suggestions regarding MSFW services and outreach. (C) Data Assessment. Review the previous four years Wagner-Peyser data reports on performance. Note whether the State has been meeting its goals to provide MSFWs quantitatively proportionate services as compared to non-MSFWs. If it has not met these goals, explain why the State believes such goals were not met and how the State intends to improve its provision of services in order to meet such goals. The data provided in section VI.e.1 shows the District has no identified MSFW needs and consequently did make goals to serve this population. (D) Assessment of progress The plan must include an explanation of what was achieved based on the previous AOP, what was not achieved and an explanation as to why the State believes the goals were not achieved, and how the State intends to remedy the gaps of achievement in the coming year. With no MSFW needs identified, the District has not conducted outreach to MSFWs or agricultural employers in the past and, consequently, did not make goals addressing these efforts. (E) State Monitor Advocate The plan must contain a statement confirming the State Monitor Advocate has reviewed and approved the AOP. The District does not have a State Monitor Advocate.174WAGNER PEYSER ACT ASSURANCES 1. The Wagner-Peyser Employment Service is co-located with one-stop centers or a plan and timeline has been developed to comply with this requirement within a reasonable amount of time. (sec 121(e)(3)); Wagner-Peyser Employment Services are currently co-located in each of the District's four AJCs. Most Wagner-Peyser employment services are also available in the DOES partnership with DC Jail, as well as the mobile unit and at pop-events (Workforce on Wheels). 2. The State agency is complying with the requirements under 20 CFR 653.111 (State agency staffing requirements) if the State has significant MSFW one-stop centers; The District of Columbia is in compliance with the requirements in that there is no significant MSFW one-stop center. 3. If a State Workforce Development Board, department, or agency administers State laws for vocational rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, that board, department, or agency cooperates with the agency that administers Wagner-Peyser services, Adult and Dislocated Worker programs and Youth Programs under Title I; and The Department of Disability Services / Rehabilitation Services Administration (DDS/RSA) administers state laws for vocational rehabilitation cooperates closely with the administration of Titles I and III by DOES. DDS/RSA currently provides services at two of the four American Job Centers five days per week, and two sites one day per week, with plans for expansion of co-location to all sites moving forward. 4. State agency merit-based public employees provide Wagner-Peyser Act-funded labor exchange activities in accordance with Department of Labor regulations. State agency merit-based public employees provide Wagner-Peyser Act funded labor exchange activities in the District of Columbia.175ADULT EDUCATION AND LITERACY PROGRAMS (a) Aligning of Content Standards. Describe how the eligible agency will, by July 1, 2016, align its content standards for adult education with State-adopted challenging academic content standards, as adopted under section 1111(b)(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(1)). Aligning adult education content standards is an integral part of proper WIOA planning and implementation. To ensure alignment with State-adopted challenging academic content standards, OSSE has adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS) as the adult education content standards for the District of Columbia. OSSE AFE began its effort to align instruction with CCSS and CCRS in FY 2012. In collaboration with the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), OSSE held a conference for adult educators that included several workshops that focused on the CCSS and CCRS. As a follow-up to the 2012 Conference, OSSE AFE, in partnership with UDC, has offered three Professional Development Institutes for adult educators in the District of Columbia. Each of the institutes focused on the integration and implementation of the CCSS and CCRS and CASAS competencies and basic skill content standards in adult education. The Summer 2014 Professional Development Institute, titled \"Promoting Teaching Effectiveness: Methods of Teaching Adult Learners,\" included the following workshops: 1. Effective Teachers: Professional Learning and State Policy; 2. Linguistic and Cultural Assumptions in High School Equivalency Testing; 3. Preparing Adult Learners for the 2014 GED; 4. Essential Education 2014 GED Resources for Adult Educators; 5. Beyond ABE/GED/HSD - Preparing Adult Learners for College and Careers; 6. Methods of Teaching Math to Adult Learners; 7. Methods of Teaching Reading and Language Arts; 8. Adult Education and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: Focus on Teaching Quantitative Problem Solving, Rational Numbers and Measurements; 9. Adult Education and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics: Focus on Teaching Algebraic Problem Solving, Linear Equations and Expressions, Graphs and Functions; 10.Oral Language, Math, and Science for Adult English Language Learners; and 11.Planning Instruction for Adult English Language Learners The Spring 2015 Professional Development Institute, titled \"Promoting Teacher Effectiveness: A Standards-Based Approach to Teaching Adult Learners\" included sessions on the following topics: 1) Overview of the CCSS/CCRS; 2) Implications for Teaching and Learning;1763) Using Standards for Assessments; 4) Designing Standards-based Instructional Plans; and 5) Theory to Practice: Demonstrating and Modeling the Use of Standards. The Summer 2015 Professional Development Institute, titled \"Winning Strategies for Teaching Adults in the District of Columbia\" included sessions on the following topics: 1 Integrating Career Awareness into the ABE and ESOL Classroom; 2) Team Teaching an Integrated Curriculum; 3) Helping Students Stay: Exploring Program and Classroom Persistence Strategies; and 4) Winning Strategies for Integrating Standards in ABE and ESL Instruction. Each of the institutes was well attended by over 60 adult educators each day. OSSE AFE will continue to work with UDC, Graduate School USA and other partners, to provide additional professional development and technical assistance to adult educators on the CCSS/ CCRS. Furthermore, the CCSS/CCRS are embedded in the 2014 GED and NEDP which are the two primary alternative pathways to a secondary credential for adults in DC. Moreover, in the next competitive grant, OSSE AFE will include the requirement that all AFE funded programs adopt and align instruction with the CCSS/CCRS. OSSE AFE will also work with its PD/TA partners to develop a CCSS/CCRS implementation timeline for local program providers and monitor for compliance. Adult educators in OSSE AFE programs are required to integrate the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS) competencies and basic skills content standards in their lessons/programs. As such, the OSSE AFE team has drafted a crosswalk that links the CCSS/CCRS and CASAS competencies and basic skill content standards by test and test item for use by the adult educators in employing a standards-based approach to teach adult learners. (b) Local Activities. Describe how the State will, using the considerations specified in section 231(e) of WIOA, fund each eligible provider to establish or operate programs that provide adult education and literacy activities, including programs that provide such activities concurrently. The Unified or Combined State Plan must include at a minimum the scope, content, and organization of local activities. Adult Education and Literacy Activities (Section 203 of WIOA) Adult education; Literacy; Workplace adult education and literacy activities; Family literacy activities; English language acquisition activities; Integrated English literacy and civics education; Workforce preparation activities; or Integrated education and training that\u20141771.

In providing family literacy activities under this title, an eligible provider shall attempt to coordinate with programs and services that are not assisted under this title prior to using funds for adult education and literacy activities under this title for activities other than activities for eligible individuals. After ensuring the alignment of adult education content standards, the next step is to describe how eligible providers of adult education and literacy activities will be funded.

OSSE AFE will provide oversight of the grants administration process using EGMS (Enterprise Grants Management System) for the submission, review and approval of applications for funding, processing of cost reimbursements for payment tied to SOAR and for programmatic and fiscal monitoring of its sub-grantee. Additionally, OSSE AFE will continue to partner with two institutions of higher education, University of the District of Columbia (UDC) and the Graduate School USA, and other partners to offer professional development, technical assistance, consultation and evaluation services to adult educators and the leadership/support teams of local program providers. These services are aimed at both professionalizing the field of adult education and increasing providers capacity to plan for and embrace impending changes to adult education and workforce development as a result of the WIOA. Please also see the following sections: Aligning of Content Standards, Correctional Education and other Education of Institutionalized Individuals, Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education Program, State Leadership and Assessing Quality. (c) Corrections Education and other Education of Institutionalized Individuals. Describe how the State will establish and operate programs under section 225 of WIOA for corrections education and education of other institutionalized individuals, including how it will fund, in accordance with the requirements of title II subtitle C, any of the following academic programs for: Adult education and literacy activities; Special education, as determined by the eligible agency; Secondary school credit; Integrated education and training; Career pathways; Concurrent enrollment; Peer tutoring; and Transition to re-entry initiatives and other post release services with the goal of reducing recidivism. Each eligible agency using funds provided under Programs for Corrections Education and Other Institutionalized Individuals to carry out a program for criminal offenders within a correctional185institution must give priority to serving individuals who are likely to leave the correctional institution within 5 years of participation in the program. Programs for Correction Education and Other Institutionalized Individuals (sec. 225) Types of Programs Included within adult education is corrections education and education of other institutionalized individuals. In regard to requirements for such programs, OSSE AFE shall require that each eligible provider receiving funding under Sec. 225 of WIOA carry out corrections education or education for other institutionalized individuals, including academic programs using grant funds to operate education programs as follows. (1) Basic education; (2) Special education, as determined by the eligible agency; (3) English literacy programs; and, (4) Secondary school credit programs. In addition, OSSE AFE shall ensure that all eligible providers receiving funding under Sec. 225 will have direct and equitable access to apply for AEFLA grant funds. OSSE AFE will encourage collaboration with literacy and job skills programs that promote self- sufficiency and community responsibility to enable returning citizens to become productive citizens, and increase the likelihood of their successful reintegration into the community after release. Priority OSSE AFE has given priority to serving individuals who are likely to leave a correctional institution within five years of participation in the program. All funding is slated for use by programs that serve adults who will be released within 1 to 5 years. Types of Institutional Settings Correctional institution means any 1. Prison; 2. Jail; 3. Reformatory; 4. Work farm; 5. Detention Center; or 6. Halfway house, community-based rehabilitation center, or other similar institution designed for the confinement or rehabilitation of criminal offenders. OSSE AFE will not spend more than the 20percent of the 82.5 percent of the State grant for this activity. OSSE requires all eligible providers for sections 225, 231, and/or 243 to use the same application process. This ensures that all applications are evaluated using the same rubric and scoring186criteria. OSSE ensure that all eligible providers have direct and equitable access to apply for grants. It also ensures that the same grant announcement, application, and proposal process is used for all eligible providers through OSSE's Enterprise Grants Management System. See section III.b.5.B.1 above for a description of how AEFLA grants, including funding associated with section 225, will be competed and awarded. This section outlines how the State will comply with the requirements of Subpart C (competition, direct and equitable access, same grant process, and use of 13 considerations). (d) Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education Program. Describe how the State will establish and operate Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education programs under Section 243 of WIOA, for English language learners who are adults, including professionals with degrees and credentials in their native countries. OSSE has a longstanding history of funding four eligible providers who offer English literacy and civics education to District residents under WIA. These agencies provide integrated instructional programs and services that incorporated English literacy and civics education. Limited English Proficient adults participating in these programs gain competency in English and skills needed to exercise rights and responsibilities of citizenship as members of their communities. DC will leverage these past successes to meet the new requirements under WIOA. OSSE's AEFLA grant application will require applicants seeking funding under section 243 to describe and provide evidence as to how they plan to offer English language acquisition and civics education instruction concurrently and contextually to District residents. The eligible applicants' proposed activities for the provision of IELCE services and budget will be reviewed by a panel of independent reviewers and OSSE to ensure that they meet all statutory requirements under section 243. Based on our past experience, we expect that this would include similar successful activities and services such as: Sub-grantees capitalizing on election year opportunities to teach a range of Civics lessons explaining the U.S. political system (including the Electoral College vs the popular vote) and the District's political system (including the District's limited Home Rule autonomy and unique status when it comes to national representation in the House and Senate). Parent educators explaining parental and student rights and the process for students with special needs to receive special education services and the advocacy role that many parents play to ensure that their children receive the education and ancillary services they need. Students writing letters and/or providing testimony to the DC City Council asking members to support specific proposals or programs that are important to the District's English language learner population.187Furthermore, since Program Year 2014, in addition to AEFLA funding, OSSE has awarded additional local funding to these four providers to offer occupational skills training, occupational literacy services and workforce transition services to English language learners in the District of Columbia. OSSE believes that these experiences will also strengthen the District's ability to meet the new requirements under WIOA and better support the District's adult English language learners, including professionals with degrees and credentials in their native countries. OSSE AFE will continue this approach and will award funding to eligible providers to offer English language acquisition and civic education instruction to a specific cohort of students, while simultaneously offering occupational skills training, as appropriate for particular participants from the cohort. For grant year 2017-2018, AEFLA section 243 funds will be used to support the operational expenses of local IELCE programs, including teacher salaries and benefits, classroom supplies, textbooks, and other items necessary to carry out instruction in English language acquisition, workforce preparation activities, and civics education. While OSSE plans to issue additional guidance and technical assistance to eligible providers on how to co-enroll participants in occupational training, as appropriate, OSSE anticipates that some section 243 funds may be used for similar expenditures to provide occupational training as part of an integrated education and training program. Describe how the State will fund, in accordance with the requirements of title II, subtitle C, an Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education program and how the funds will be used for the program. OSSE requires all eligible providers for sections 225, 231, and/or 243 to use the same application process. This ensures that all applications are evaluated using the same rubric and scoring criteria. OSSE ensure that all eligible providers have direct and equitable access to apply for grants. It also ensures that the same grant announcement, application, and proposal process is used for all eligible providers through OSSE's Enterprise Grants Management System. See section III.b.5.B.1 above for a description of how AEFLA grants, including funding associated with section 225, will be competed and awarded. This section outlines how the State will comply with the requirements of Subpart C (competition, direct and equitable access, same grant process, and use of 13 considerations). (e)State Leadership. Describe how the State will use the funds to carry out the required State Leadership activities under section 223 of WIOA. Describe how the State will use the funds to carry out permissible State Leadership Activities under section 223 of WIOA, if applicable. To meet the requirements of Section 223(a)(1)(A), (B), (C) and (D) of WIOA, OSSE AFE will use federal and local state leadership funds to enhance the quality of programming in the District's adult education and workforce development system. Not more than 12.5% of the federal grant funds made available will be used to carry out the state leadership activities under section 223. Activities to be supported with federal state leadership funds and extended using local funding include the following:188(A) OSSE will work collaboratively with key stakeholders to align adult education and literacy activities with the WIOA core programs as specified in the District's Unified State Plan under section 102. Priority emphasis will placed on the development of career pathways that provide access to integrated education and training services, that lead to postsecondary education and/or high-wage and high-demand employment for District residents in adult education and literacy activities. This initiative is being lead by the District's Workforce Investment Council (WIC), the Career Pathways Task Force and other key stakeholders. State leadership funds will also be used to build the capacity of WIOA core program providers to better assess and address the needs of District residents. Efforts will include cross-training staff on a shared process for client orientation, intake, assessment, learning needs screening, career mapping, and referral and receipt of services. (B) To meet future teacher qualification requirements, OSSE will continue to partner with the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) to offer a Graduate Certificate Program in Adult Education (24 credit hours), Master of Arts in Adult Education (36 credit hours), and one (1)- credit professional development modules, workshops and seminars for adult educators using state leadership funds. OSSE will also work in collaboration with UDC, the Chicago School of Professional Psychology, and other PD partners to provide high quality professional development (PD) programs to adult educators to improve instruction to adult learners. State leadership funds will be used to bring national trainers from StandardsWork, World Education, the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS), the National External Diploma Program (NEDP), the Center for Applied Linguistics, the American Institute for Research, and GED Testing Service to provide high quality professional development to program administrators, teachers and staff at all levels. Topics will include, but are not limited to, implementation of the College and Career Readiness Standards in Reading/Language Arts and Mathematics, Differentiated Instruction, Contextualized Instruction, Evidence-Based Reading Instruction (EBRI), instructional strategies for teaching ABE and ELL students, occupational literacy, strategic planning, effective program management, leadership, integrated education and training, bridge programming, technology integration, distance education, and supporting adults with special needs. OSSE will also engage in evaluation activities to assess the effectiveness of the PD provided and employ continuous improvement strategies to improve state and local program performance and outcomes. (C)OSSE will support the provision of technical assistance (TA) to eligible providers of adult education and literacy activities to enhance local program effectiveness. TA will be offered to increase the ability of providers to meet established performance standards, and to fulfill obligations associated with being a WIOA and one-stop partner. Eligible providers will receive one-to-one and/or small group technical assistance. Key personnel from PD provider agencies will also provide TA to eligible providers on strategic planning, organizational development, project management, program design, program and student level outcomes,189Career Pathways models and implementation, integrated education and training strategies, CASAS implementation, National External Diploma Program implementation, GED Testing, bridge programming, supporting adults with special needs, curriculum development and instruction, technology integration, distance education and other related topics. OSSE will also use State leadership funds to support the development and dissemination of instructional and programmatic practices based on the most rigorous or scientifically valid research available and appropriate, in reading, writing, speaking, mathematics, English language acquisition programs, distance education, and staff training. OSSE will re-institute its best practices series to help facilitate the sharing of promising practices among adult educators. (D)OSSE will continue to promote technology integration in providers and partner agencies to improve instruction, services, and system efficiencies. OSSE will make web-based assessments, curriculum and instructional resources (eCASAS, GED Academy, News for You, The Change Agent, MyFoundationsLab and other software) available for use by eligible providers. State leadership funds will support the use (for potential and new users) and/or increased use (for existing users) of the DC Data Vault, a web-based transactional data system designed to help facilitate a shared intake, assessment, referral, and tracking system for WIOA Core Programs and partners. (E) OSSE will continue to conduct monitoring activities and the evaluation of the quality of, and the improvement in, adult education and literacy activities. OSSE will monitor local program performance on a monthly and annual basis and work with eligible providers to improve local program performance. Desk reviews, monthly reports, self-assessments and monitoring reviews and visits are employed to assess average attendance hours, educational functioning level gains, and other student performance, progress and outcomes. These methods allow OSSE monitors and eligible providers to review the operational aspects of the program including the draw down and expenditure of grant funds, staff completion of required professional development, and local program adherence to accountability and reporting requirements. Based on the evaluation findings, OSSE, in collaboration with its PD/TA providers, will provide professional development, technical assistance, and resources to adult education administrators, teachers and staff at all levels to ensure continuous improvement at the local program level. (F) OSSE will prioritize the facilitation of partnerships with between adult education providers and local postsecondary institutions and employers in an effort to create pathways and bridge programs from adult education to higher education and/or employment in high-wage and high-demand industries for adult learners in the District of Columbia. OSSE will collaborate, where possible with the WIC, WIOA Core Programs, partners, providers and other stakeholders to avoid duplicating efforts in order to maximize the impact of the activities described above.190(f) Assessing Quality. Describe how the eligible agency will assess the quality of providers of adult education and literacy activities under title II and take actions to improve such quality, including providing the activities described in section 223(a)(1)(B) of WIOA. OSSE will work in collaboration with its PD/TA providers to assess the quality of local program providers of adult education and literacy services and take actions to improve such quality through its robust web-based monitoring system - Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS). The OSSE AFE monitoring system will measure local program performance in four key areas: 1) Student performance, progress and involvement, 2) Instructional Models and Methods, 3) Program Management and Leadership, 4) Data Collection/Reporting. OSSE AFE will monitor and evaluate providers on a monthly and bi-annual basis via desks reviews and onsite monitoring . Eligible providers will be required to: Prepare monthly/quarterly Diagnostic Search Reports in LACES (Literacy Adult Community Education System) to ensure the validity and accuracy of data; Participate in a Self-Assessment/Preliminary Monitoring Review; Participate in Follow-up Monitoring Visits and Classroom Observations; Participate in a Self-Assessment/Final Monitoring Review; Participate in Desk Reviews; Submit a Student Roster, Student Performance Report(s) and Student Outcome Report(s) monthly; Submit Student Follow-up Data and Program Income Expenditures Quarterly; Develop and implement continuous improvement plans; and Provide and maintain evidence of how data is used for continuous improvement purposes. OSSE will monitor local program providers throughout the program year to: Evaluate the local program's progress to-date toward contracted goals and outcomes; Determine if the local program will be able to achieve the contracted goals and outcomes by program year-end; Ensure that the local program has qualified staff, procedures, and systems in place to achieve contracted outcomes; Ensure that the local program is following OSSE's Assessment, Goal Setting, and Follow-up policies and procedures; Ensure that the data management system is producing accurate and reliable information; Assess a funded program's instructional quality; Compare the program's grant expenditures to-date with approved budget; Identify program strengths and areas needing improvement; Identify and address local program technical assistance, professional development and resource needs; and Facilitate continuous improvement at the local program levels.191State leaderships funds will be used to support the state's management information system - LACES (Literacy Adult Community Education System ). LACES will be used by the state to evaluate state and local program performance. OSSE AFE staff will monitor local programs on their compliance to the DC Local Follow-Up for Core and Secondary Outcome Measures Policy to ensure that local programs meet the National Reporting System (NRS) requirements for follow-up of core and secondary outcome measures. Local programs will use a combination of direct program reporting and survey to collect follow-up data from students who exited the program so that the data is reflected on NRS Table 5. OSSE AFE will include a requirement in its Fiscal Year 2017 grant application that eligible programs describe the extent to which they employ scientifically based research in the design, implementation, and evaluation of their program. OSSE AFE will explore the use of one or more of the following activities for this measure including self-evaluation of program activities; assessments of progress in achieving state goals for adult education and literacy activities; the extent to which adult education goals for specific populations of adult learners have been met; the extent to which state education technology needs have been met; follow-up studies of former participants at 6-month, 12-month, and 15-month intervals; reviews of the effectiveness of teacher training; and the use of evaluation results to determine achievement of levels of performance for each of the core indicators for the eligible provider agencies. OSSE AFE will uses State leadership funds to conduct a comparative analysis of the outcomes achieved by local program providers implementing different instructional strategies to gain insight into their relative effectiveness and to identify those strategies that may merit further exploration and research. Information and insights gained from these evaluations and program monitoring will be used to inform state planning and the allocation of resources, professional development and technical assistance to local program providers. When an instructional strategy appears to be promising based on the results of program evaluation, the state will consider investing additional resources to further investigate the effectiveness of the strategy and/or will disseminate information about its findings to other local program providers for replication. Professional Development Quality Assessment The OSSE AFE bases professional development and technical assistance activities on the results of the prior year monitoring data so that the state can address the categories in which sub-grantees had earned the lowest number of points. Over the past three years, OSSE AFE has directed its PD efforts toward promoting teacher effectiveness and improving student outcomes. OSSE AFE modified its classroom observation tool to reinforce the state's expectation that 1) teachers align assessment, curriculum and instruction to address and accommodate different student learning needs and 2) students achieve their desired outcomes as evidenced on NRS Tables 4 and 5. Since PY 2014, adult educators have been participating in professional development activities including: the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment Systems (CASAS) Implementation Training; Literacy Adult Community Education System (LACES) Training; the National External Diploma Program (NEDP) New Advisor/Assessor Training, and workshops on other related topics. Adult educators also have participated in workshops on contextualized instruction, models of192integrating education and training, improving instruction towards the new GED, implementation of College and Career Readiness standards, and integrating technology into their programs, with an emphasis on the use of state sponsored educational software products (GED Academy, News for You, The Change Agent) to meet the needs of students via classroom instruction, blended learning or distance education. OSSE AFE will assess the quality of its professional development programs via participant surveys after all workshops, webinars, presentations and PD institutes. Participant feedback will be used to inform future PD offerings and the continued use of specific PD training providers; to modify the format of future workshops; and/or to determine if there is a need for technical assistance and/or additional resources for the training participants to successfully operationalize their lessons learned. OSSE AFE, in collaboration with its PD providers, will also conduct an annual PD survey to determine adult educators' PD needs, preferred delivery formats (face-to-face, webinars, hybrid), and preferred schedule (days, evenings, weekends) for offerings. The annual PD survey will also be used to assess local program staff's satisfaction with the training they have received throughout the program year and provide participants with an opportunity to share examples of how they applied the lessons learned during training in their programs, classrooms and every day practices. The annual PD survey will also provide local program staff with an opportunity to identify resources and supports they may need to be more effective in their roles in adult education and family literacy programs. OSSE AFE monitors and PD/TA providers will also assess the quality and application of PD lessons via the review of programs' lesson plans, classroom observations and data collected and reported through the OSSE AFE Self-Assessment/Monitoring Tool and student surveys. Furthermore, OSSE AFE will review local program and student data in LACES, the state's management information system, to evaluate the impact of professional development on local program performance and student progress and outcomes. To illustrate OSSE AFE's evaluation of the implementation of PD lessons an example of this process has been included below. Since CASAS is the approved assessment for the District of Columbia, local program staff are required to participate in CASAS PD training and implement either the paper-based or web-based assessment system. OSSE AFE monitors generate assessment reports in LACES to determine if local programs are administering tests appropriately and generating Diagnostic Search Reports to identify and address discrepancies in the data. OSSE AFE monitors review local program data to determine that the staff are adhering to OSSE AFE's Assessment Policy, including ensuring that enrolled students who have a minimum of 50 (maximum of 70 to 100) instructional hours have validly matched CASAS pre-tests and post-tests in reading and math or other ESL instructional areas (writing, speaking, listening comprehension). They determine whether enrolled students who are post-tested are making educational gains as evidenced by percentage of enrolled students who complete educational functioning levels. Furthermore, local program staff are required to complete and/or generate CASAS student profiles by competency and class profiles by competency and to work with students to establish goals. They are also required to develop lesson plans that incorporate student learning needs as specified193on student profiles by competency, class profiles by competency, and student goals as well as use appropriate curricula, multiple delivery methods and approaches to meet the diverse learning needs of students. Program managers are required to conduct classroom observations to assess the quality of the instruction being provided by teachers and the level of student satisfaction with the instructional services they are receiving. OSSE AFE monitors review the lesson plans, conduct classroom observations and review student surveys to determine if teachers are employing the instructional strategies, utilizing instructional resources and improving their practices based on the training that they have received.194ADULT EDUCATION AND LITERACY CERTIFICATIONS AND ASSURANCES CERTIFICATIONS 1.

In order for the DC Rehabilitation Services Administration (DCRSA) to receive federal assistance, the District of Columbia must establish the SRC to: Review, analyze, and advise the agency regarding eligibility for services, quality of services, and activities of the agency promoting employment of persons with disabilities; In partnership with the agency, develop and assess relevant goals and evaluate the DCRSA's effectiveness; Assist in developing the State Plan of the vocational rehabilitation agency for administering its own program, annually submitted to the federal Rehabilitation Services Administration; Review and analyze effectiveness of the agency and consumer satisfaction with it, and; Assist in coordinating the activities of the agency with various other agencies. Federal law specifies community representation in the composition of the State Rehabilitation Council. Impact of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act With the release of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) joint regulations from the United States Departments of Labor and Education, the SRC and DCRSA have been working together on two significant initiatives throughout 2015: 1. Updating the current State Plan to include DCRSA's 2016 emphasis on how extended supported employment services will be implemented and provided to client consumers with intellectual and developmental disabilities. 58U.S Department of Education. Office of the Commissioner. http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/ioc.html1972. Development of the Unified 2017-2020 State Plan due to the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor by March 3, 2016. WIOA implementation required revisions to DC Department on Disability Services' 57F59(DDS) overall service implementation policies, service priorities, and budget utilization for 2015 and 2016, especially services related to transition and supported employment. Federal policy requires that fifteen percent (15%) of the DDS annual budget be expended on pre-employment and employment services for transition students with disabilities aged 14 - 22 in accordance with WIOA regulations. Additionally, service provision now requires inclusion of mandatory job readiness services as outlined in WIOA. The DC Department of Human Services, Department of Employment Services, Office of the State Superintendent of Education, and DDS are the identified core agencies selected to assess, develop and recommend one-stop shop service guidelines for the service delivery provision. This inter-agency initiative is attempting to create a unified intake application and create a more coordinated intake process among the Core Partner agencies at the American Job Centers. Currently, 5-day per week service expansion for RSA is utilized at two of the four American Job Centers in the District of Columbia. Key Performance Indicators in Fiscal Year 2015 The SRC members believe that we can all serve as leaders and change-agents developing the appropriate path to ensuring that our District residents with disabilities can exercise their right to contribute their skills and talents in a competitive working environment. 59DC Rehabilitation Services Administration and Developmental Disabilities Administration are both located under the Department on Disability Services.198The following table shows the agency's consistent commitment to our charge: Table 20: VR Performance Measures Key Performance MeasureFiscal Year 2015 TARGETFiscal Year 2015 ACTUALExecution of Completion (%) Number of people placed by RSA that remained employed for 90 calendar days or more645 670 105% Percent of people with a plan developed within 90 calendar days of eligibility determination.90% 95% 106% Percent of people for whom eligibility is determined within 60 calendar days90% 95% 106% Average entry level wages for people whose cases are closed successfully$13.00 $13.52 104% Percentage of eligible transition youth for whom an Individualized Plan of Employment is developed.90% 86% 96% DCRSA not only met, but exceeded, many of the key performance measures set aside by the agency for the fiscal year. The SRC encouraged the agency to improve upon many of these measures in the past. Additionally, the table represents several important themes that have been communicated and emphasized by the SRC previously: A.More District residents with disabilities need to obtain and maintain competitive, integrated employment for longer periods of time. B.Improved quality and overall effectiveness of customer service provided to clients receiving supports and services from the agency increases their likelihood of obtaining and/or maintaining competitive, integrated employment in shorter periods of time. C.Higher wages allow people with disabilities to: maintain their level of independence; improve their own financial situation and combat poverty; and remain as residents of the District of Columbia where the cost of living is astronomically high.199D.Greater emphasis needs to be given to our students with disabilities, age 14-22, to ensure that they possess better employment outcomes as they transition into adulthood. Though these indicators are impressive and provide evidence that DCRSA is doing its part to improving the service delivery system and, ultimately, the quality of life of its customers, the numbers do not provide a comprehensive summary of the accomplishments achieved by the agency and SRC in fiscal year (FY) 2015. DCRSA made measurable progress in improving the quality of employment services and supports offered to our District residents with disabilities. Specifically, four agency objectives were emphasized during the fiscal year: 1.Increase the number of DC residents with disabilities who achieve employment and the quality of employment outcomes 2.Improve RSA service delivery through more efficient operations and a more effective and skilled workforce 3.Expand and improve the quality of transition services and improve coordination with the state education agency and all local education agencies 4.Develop a Self-Employment/Entrepreneurship Program Summary of FY15 Accomplishments Objective 1: Increase the number of DC residents with disabilities who achieve employment and the quality of employment outcomes Three initiatives were developed and implemented during FY15 in support of this first objective. A. Continue outreach efforts within the community by expanding services to other sites that serve people with disabilities with a particular focus on serving underserved populations identified in the 2013 Comprehensive State Needs Assessment and expand the VR presence within the American Jobs Centers Outcome - Fully Achieved: DCRSA established outreach sites with: 1) One additional agency serving District residents who speak Spanish; 2) Two sites serving residents who are Ethiopian and Eritrean, and; 3) One site serving residents who are Asian/Pacific Islanders. Additionally, the agency established one new site in Ward 7, an area of the District that has historically been underserved. DCRSA also worked with its human relations office to develop a recruitment plan to hire additional Spanish speaking staff personnel. B. Revise the payment structure in place for Supported Employment and Job Placement Providers to provide incentives based on entry level wages and availability of benefits Outcome - Fully Achieved: DCRSA revised the current payment structure for the community rehabilitation providers that offer Job Placement and Supported Employment Services. As a result, the revised system emphasized: 1) Payments to providers based on their performance; 2)200Rewarding providers for timely job placements; 3) Assisting our District residents to job stabilization more timely, and; 4) Placement in higher quality jobs (i.e., including at least DC living wage or meeting or exceeding the standard established for RSA's federal performance goal of 52% of the current average wage in the District and availability of health benefits). More significantly, the Notice of Final Rulemaking was published on August 28, 2015 in support of this specific initiative. C. Increase the effectiveness of current and new Supported Employment service providers and Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRPs) Outcome - Partially Achieved: DCRSA hired an Employment Coordinator in May 2015 responsible for maintaining current information on all training and education providers approved for placements by the agency. The Employment Coordinator visited the local community colleges to connect with representatives in the Disability Resource Offices. Additionally, the Coordinator created a template for collecting information on career training program requirements, description of services, outcomes and customer service feedback, and conducted an analysis on the culinary arts/hospitality training programs operated by the National Children's Center and the Hands on Hyatt Educational Program. Objective 2: Improve DCRSA service delivery through more efficient operations and a more effective and skilled workforce Three initiatives were developed and implemented during FY15 in support of this second objective. A. DCRSA will use the automated case management system and regular supervisory case reviews to ensure that the agency complies with federal timeline requirements regarding determination of eligibility and development of Individualized Plans for Employment (IPEs) and that quality services are provided in compliance with District and federal regulations Outcome - Fully Achieved: During FY2015, DCRSA exceeded its goal by developing 95% of all IPEs within 90 days or less of eligibility determination. The agency developed and implemented a three-month pilot on the process to convert paper documentation into digital formats. This pilot process would lead to implementation of an improved process for FY16. DCRSA procured three desktop and seven portable scanners to implement the pilot program with one Youth in Transition unit. At the end of the pilot, the agency scanned and uploaded into System 7 (DCRSA's case management system) approximately 100 paper case files that were closed during fiscal year 2015. Furthermore, several RSA non-client service divisions began scanning and saving files onto electronic shared drive folder. It is the goal of DCRSA to reduce the hard copy paper files before the end of fiscal year 2016. B. Review and revise all program policies, procedures and protocols and make them available on the DCRSA's website201Outcome - Fully Achieved: Through collaboration with the SRC and its other stakeholders, DCRSA developed and finalized several policies and procedures directly related to the provision of VR services. As required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in October 1992, and as codified in 34 CFR Sec. 361.20 ,a public hearing was held on March 25, 2015 to solicit comments from the general public on each of the newly developed documents. C. DCRSA will implement a Community Rehabilitation Provider module on its electronic case management system Outcome - Fully Achieved: In order to implement this initiative, a number of revisions was required in the agency's contract with the external vendor designated as providing support to DCRSA's management information system. The new, modified contract was executed in August 2015. The new provider module was fully implemented into the case management system in September 2015, and training was provided to all provider agencies and staff in October 2015. Objective 3: Expand and improve the quality of transition services and improve coordination with the state education agency and all local education agencies Two initiatives were developed and implemented during FY15 in support of this third objective. A. Improve coordination with all schools working with DC youth, including public, public charter and non-public schools, to ensure that DCRSA is fully integrated into the transition planning for youth Outcome - Fully Achieved: DCRSA developed and implemented a comprehensive outreach plan involving all schools in FY15. The agency worked with a not-for-profit provider, School Talk Inc., to develop outreach materials to provide information on the transition process to youth, their families, and school staff personnel. DCRSA has assigned VR counselors to all schools, and the counselors meet with students who are possibly eligible for VR services. Furthermore, VR staff participated in school staff meetings to provide information about vocational rehabilitation services available to transition students. Finally, DCRSA staff met on a monthly basis with DC Public School transition staff to monitor referrals received from each school to ensure that cases are moving timely through the VR process. B. DCRSA will establish agreements with Public Charter Schools regarding referrals and coordination of transition services Outcome - Partially Achieved: DCRSA was unable to establish a Memorandum of Understanding with the Public Charter School Board in order to establish the same kind of supports to each public charter school that are currently provided by the DC Public School Transition Office - as providing direct service in this manner goes beyond the authority of the Public Charter School Board. Therefore, DCRSA issued a solicitation to procure the services of an external vendor with experience with Public Charter Schools in order to assist in working with all of these schools to202provide supports in referrals of students for VR services. Furthermore, DCRSA is assisting in developing processes and methods of implementing pre-employment transition services in each of the public charter schools. This requirement is a new mandate under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) passed into federal law in July 2014. Memorandum of Agreements with eight (8) public charter schools will be finalized by March 1, 2016. Objective 4: Develop a Self-Employment/Entrepreneurship Program One initiative was developed and implemented during FY15 in support of this fourth and final objective. A. Implement the Self-Employment/Entrepreneurship Program Outcome - Fully Achieved: In coordination with the SRC, the development of the Self-Employment policy and procedure was completed during the fiscal year. As required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in October 1992, and as codified in 34 CFR Sec. 361.20, a public hearing was held on March 25, 2015 to solicit comments from the community. The documents became effective June 1, 2015, and were posted to the agency's website. Training was provided to VR counselors and supervisors on September 1, 2015. In Closing Fiscal Year 2015 represented a highly productive and successful year for the District of Columbia Rehabilitation Services Administration and the State Rehabilitation Council. The two organizations valued our collaborative partnership as we focused on improving access to and the quality of employment outcomes for all District residents with disabilities who are seeking competitive, integrated work. This process also included placing greater emphasis on: a) improving customer service b) more training and supports provided to VR staff personnel & service providers, and; c) the overall effectiveness and efficiency of services and supports provided to eligible District residents seeking assistance from the agency. As one fiscal year ended and another begins, the SRC looks forward to strengthening its partnership with DCRSA, as we update the current 2013-2016 State Plan to include the addition of supported employment services in the agency's 2016 Transition Plan and developing the Unified 2017-2020 State Plan. On behalf of the members of the State Rehabilitation Council, thank you very much for your consideration and steadfast commitment to ensuring that all citizens with disabilities are given the right to serve as productive workers in today's modern workforce. Highlighted Issues for the Mayor Future Appointments to the SRC. Federal law allows an SRC member to no more than two consecutive three-year terms. Additionally, federal law provides specific guidance on the composition and representation of the Council's membership. Because so many people were new this year, the SRC has had an abrupt start. To prevent a recurrence of that abruptness as current members end their terms at the same time, new appointments should be made on a rolling basis while meeting the federal law's requirement on the Council membership's composition and representation. We invite the Mayor and representatives of the Mayor's Office of Talent and203Appointments to partner with us on creating an appointment schedule and recruitment process that ensures ongoing success for the SRC. The SRC recommended continued, improved coordination between the SRC and the designated state unit. It also made recommendations regarding how appointments are made to the Council, to ensure a consistent, complete complement of required members to undertake the work of the Council. This past year has presented a steep learning curve for the Council and through carrying out the recommended changes in appointments, to ensure rolling appointments of new members we would ensure that we always have a greater number of experienced Council members. The SRC agrees with this recommendation and will work with the Mayor's Office of Talent and Appointments to make recommendations for necessary appointments. The designated unit also agrees to continue working closely with the SRC and looks forward to close collaboration in the coming year. The parties have been working together closely on development of the goals and priorities for the state plan, and as indicated above, there are a number of policy changes that will need to be considered in the coming year. We anticipate working closely with the SRC to consult on these changes. (b) Request for Waiver of Statewideness. This agency has not requested a waiver of statewideness. (c)Cooperative Agreements with Agencies Not Carrying Out Activities Under the Statewide Workforce Development System. Describe interagency cooperation with and utilization of the services and facilities of agencies and programs that are not carrying out activities through the statewide workforce development system with respect to: Federal, State, and local agencies and programs; State programs carried out under section 4 of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998; Programs carried out by the Under Secretary for Rural Development of the Department of Agriculture; Non-educational agencies serving out ofschool youth; and State use contracting programs. DCRSA values its relationships with its federal, state and local partners including those that are not a direct part of the Workforce Investment System. These partnerships allow for DCRSA to collaborate with other organizations to expand our services in community settings and increase our reach to more District of Columbia residents with disabilities. The Administration has finalized cooperative agreements or Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) with several community partners204and is working to address any outstanding agreements. DCRSA currently has thirty (30) community outreach sites in place with other government agencies and local organizations that provide locations for satellite sites with established schedules, allowing for expanded outreach and services in community settings reaching hard-to-reach residents. These community sites include the following diverse settings such as rehabilitation centers, mental health clinics, hospitals, community health centers, homeless shelters, other DC Government Offices, and the court system. DCRSA offers services in the following community sites: DC Government Child and Family Service Agency, DC Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, Unity Health Care (three sites), N Street Village, Salvation Army Rehabilitation Center, The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, George Washington University Hospital Acute Rehabilitation Unit, Gallaudet University, Washington Literacy Council, Model School for the Deaf, Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center, Langston Lang Housing Program, Covenant House, The Arc of DC, Ethiopian Community Center, DC Aging and Disability Resource Center, DC Department of Employment Services American Job Centers (three sites), Central Union Mission, Washington Hospital Center Outpatient Psychiatric Unit, DC Office of Asian Affairs, DC Superior Court House, DC Office of Veterans Affairs, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (two sites), Office of Returning Citizens Administration (ORCA), National Rehabilitation Hospital, Providence Hospital, Smithsonian, Seabury Blind Center and KRA Corporation. Along with sites in community settings, DCRSA has several other partnerships for services reflected in Memoranda of Agreements (MOAs) and Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) with the following agencies and entities: The National Multiple Sclerosis Society agreement establishes the terms, conditions, and procedures for a DCRSA satellite office for the purpose of conducting outreach services to person(s) currently receiving or interested in receiving vocational rehabilitation services. These services may include: receipt of referrals or applications for services and counseling. The agreement with Project Search provides services and support to staff and students in this combined education and work experience program for students with disabilities and is focused on preparing students in their last year of high school. This agreement also allows for participation in the program by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities who have already completed school. The program includes participants between the ages of 18 and 30. The current agreements are with the Smithsonian Institution and the National Institutes of Health. In addition, in FY 2015, DCRSA expanded to include a new Project Search site at the Embassy Suites Hotel. This site exclusively serves students in their final year of high school. In its first year, the program includes eight participants. The hope is to expand to additional Hilton hotels in the city, if the first year is successful. The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA's) agreement establishes a partnership in which CSOSA will refer eligible people to DCRSA programs, providing vocation rehabilitation services to adult offenders supervised by CSOSA to improve their employment opportunities. The agreement with the District of Columbia Public Library allows for the provision of the National Federation of the Blind Newsline Services to be available for DC Regional Library patrons who are blind and physically disabled. The DCRSA counselors use the facilities at various itinerary sites including Community Connections, DC Superior Court, DC Aging and Disability Resource Center and National Rehabilitation Hospital. DCRSA works closely with the Assistive Technology Center at Disability Rights DC at University Legal Services. The AT Center is a very helpful resource that has supports available for VR205clients, as well as other people with disabilities in the community. The AT Center also works very closely with schools in the District. DCRSA invites staff from the AT Center to our all staff meeting once or twice each year to provide information to staff regarding the resources available there. In addition, the AT Specialist at DCRSA sits on the AT Advisory Council. DCRSA also works with a number of community agencies in an attempt to reach out of school youth. In the past year, DCRSA has strengthened its partnership with the Department of Employment Services (DOES), including with the Youth Services Programs. DCRSA coordinates closely with DOES on its Summer Youth Employment Program. This program provides an excellent opportunity for paid work experience for transition age youth, both in school and out of school youth ages 14-24 participate in this program. DCRSA also has an agreement with the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) to provide a full time VR Counselor to offer vocational rehabilitation services to eligible DYRS youth and strengthen placement and re-entry service strategies and further enhance employment opportunities for youth with disabilities returning from secure confinement. In addition, DCRSA and the Children and Family Service Administration (CFSA) have an MOA to coordinate services for youth transitioning from the foster care system to independence. This is an agreement between CFSA and the Designated State Agency, DDS. The MOA covers services provided by the Developmental Services Administration, as well as the Rehabilitation Services Administration. Within DCRSA, the agreement addresses both Independent Living Services, for youth with developmental disabilities, other than intellectual disabilities, who are not eligible for DDA services. The agreement ensures that these youth will receive appropriate independent living supports as they transition into adulthood. In addition, the agreement provides for DCRSA to have one VR counselor stationed at CFSA's Office of Youth Empowerment one day per week, in order to provide information about RSA services and conduct intake interviews and be available to meet with existing DCRSA clients who are also current clients of CFSA. During the coming year, DCRSA hopes to increase its coordination with the Office of the State Superintendent for Education (OSSE), in its work with out of school youth. DCRSA and OSSE have a very strong relationship in working with students with disabilities. However, the Office of Adult and Family Education also provides very robust services to out of school youth. In FY 2014, OSSE established the Youth Re- engagement Center, located at the headquarters of DOES. This office works with youth between 16 and 22 who are out of school and seeking to continue their education. As part of our discussions in the Unified state planning process, DCRSA and OSSE have been talking about how to ensure coordination of services for the youth served by the Re-Engagement Center, who may also be eligible for VR services. (d) Coordination with Education Officials. Describe: (1) The designated State unit's plans, policies, and procedures for coordination with education officials to facilitate the transition of students with disabilities from school to the receipt of VR services, including pre employment transition services, as well as procedures for the timely development and approval of individualized plans for employment for the students.206(2) Information on the formal interagency agreement with the State educational agency with respect to: (A) consultation and technical assistance to assist educational agencies in planning for the transition of students with disabilities from school to post school activities, including VR services; (B) transition planning by personnel of the designated State agency and educational agency that facilitates the development and implementation of their individualized education programs; (C) roles and responsibilities, including financial responsibilities, of each agency, including provisions for determining State lead agencies and qualified personnel responsible for transition services; (D)procedures for outreach to and identification of students with disabilities who need transition services. DCRSA and the local education agency, DC Public Schools (DCPS) have had an agreement in place since 2011, which allows for sharing of information and establishes the referral process for youth in DCPS placements or youth in Dependent Public Charter Schools (these are Charter Schools that are part of the DCPS Local Education Agency). With the passage of WIOA, DCRSA and DCPS updated the MOA to include provisions related to the provision of pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities. This MOA was finalized in October, 2015. In addition, in October 2015, DCRSA and DCPS finalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in order to transfer funds to DCPS to allow for staff to provide support for provision of pre-employment transition services in 10 DC Public Schools, including establishing relationships with employers to create work based learning experiences, providing career counseling and counseling on post- secondary options and providing independent living skills training. In August, 2013, DCRSA and the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) established an MOA between their agencies that outlines the process by which all youth in public, public charter and non-public schools are identified and referred to DCRSA for consideration for eligibility for VR services. In May, 2015, DCRSA staff met with OSSE staff and developed a Draft MOA to amend the current agreement in place in order to make necessary changes to address issues related to provision of pre-employment transition services for youth. This MOA is currently being reviewed by legal staff at OSSE. We anticipate a revised final MOA to be in place before the beginning of the first program year of this plan. In FY 2015, DCRSA established a human care agreement with a community based agency that provides special education technical assistance to Public Charter Schools in the District in order to enlist their assistance in improving coordination between DCRSA and the Public Charter Schools in the efficiency and effectiveness of referrals for VR services, from Pubic Charter Schools to DCRSA and for assistance in coordinating the provision of pre-employment transition services to students in Public Charter Schools. There are currently twenty two Public Charter High Schools in the District and nine Public Charter Adult Education Schools that provide services to students with disabilities. With assistance from this community based agency, DCRSA plans to establish MOAs with all Public Charter Schools. Because each school is its own LEA, this will take some time. The207plan is to establish five MOAs by March, 2016; and an additional eight by June 30, 2016; with the remaining to be developed during program year 2016 - 17. The Vocational Rehabilitation Services Division within DCRSA now has two (2) Youth and Transition Units, including two supervisors, fourteen VR specialists and two Rehabilitation Assistants. The agency is also currently recruiting for a transition project manager, who will be responsible for program development and will conduct outreach to secondary school youth with disabilities and their families through workshops and informational sessions; and provide consultation and technical assistance to school staff regarding the DC/RSA processes. The VR Specialists are assigned to schools within the DCPS as well as all Public Charter and non-public schools. They conduct intake and eligibility interviews at the schools. The VR Specialist determines a student's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services, develops an approved Individualized Plan for Employment, and makes referrals for necessary transition services to assist the student to plan for and obtain successful post-school employment. They also coordinate with workforce development specialists in DC Public Schools to provide monthly work readiness workshops for students with disabilities who are potentially eligible for VR services. These workshops also serve as a means of outreach and education about VR services. DCRSA works with OSSE, DCPS, DBH, DYRS and DOES on the Secondary Transition Community of Practice. This group meets monthly to coordinate all services to District high school youth with disabilities. In FY 2013, a committee of the Secondary Transition Community of Practice developed a \"Tool Kit\" that includes comprehensive processes and procedures that effectively reach eligible secondary school youth with disabilities and their families in a timely and efficient manner that supports them as they transition from school to post-school activities. The materials are also available in Spanish. The materials are available in both hard copy and on-line at dctransition.org/rsa. DCRSA has also been working closely with the Department of Employment Services (DOES) Youth Services Division to better coordinate services. DCRSA staff work closely with DOES Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) staff to ensure that students with disabilities who participate in SYEP have any necessary supports or accommodations in order to be successful in their SYEP placement. In addition, DOES is working with DCRSA to ensure that all Title I Youth Programs for in-school students are available to students with disabilities. Lastly, DCRSA, DOES, DCPS, OSSE and two Public Charter Schools have worked together to create an SYEP Institute for students with most significant disabilities. In this Institute, students receive a one week \"boot camp,\" which provides work readiness training prior to the start of SYEP, then supported employment services and any other necessary supports are provided to the students in their work site. This was a pilot project that was developed through the DC Secondary Transition Community of Practice, which served 22 youth in the summer of 2015. In the summer of 2016, we anticipate serving 50 students.208(e) Cooperative Agreements with Private Nonprofit Organizations. Describe the manner in which the designated State agency establishes cooperative agreements with private non profit VR service providers. The State Agency establishes its cooperative agreements with service providers according to District regulations. In order to add new vendors for client services, the State Agency follows the District Regulations, found at 27 DCMR 100 et seq. The District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) refers to the District Statutes of the permanent rules and statements of general applicability and legal effect promulgated by executive departments and agencies and by independent entities of the Government of the District of Columbia. The code represents titles, of which Title 27 states the rules for contracts and procurements. Thereby, the establishment of cooperative agreements with service providers occurs through the Office of Contract and Procurement's solicitation process using the 27 DCMR 100 et seq. There is a wide range of DDS /RSA services partnerships through the current forty-six (46) Human Care Agreements (HCAs) and eighteen (18) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that represent local private non-profit, community rehabilitation providers as indicated in the charts below: Table 21: DDS/RSA Services Partnerships HCA Provider's Name Description Specialty America Works of Washington DCProvide job placement servicesJob Placement services Anchor Mental Health Provide Mental Health services and employmentEvidence Based Supported Employment Behavioral and Educational SolutionProvide Psychological servicesPsychological Evaluation Capitol Hill Supportive ServicesProvide day program and employmentJob Placement Center for Therapeutic ConceptsProvide Psychological servicesPsychological Evaluations Cognitive Solutions, LLC Provide Psychological servicesPsychological Evaluations209HCA Provider's Name Description Specialty Columbia Lighthouse Club for the BlindProvide services for Vocational Rehabilitation, Older Blind and Independent Living, job placement and supported employmentBlind Services Community Connections Provide Mental Health services and employmentEvidence Based Supported Employment Complete Psychological Services, PCProvide Psychological servicesPsychological/neurological evaluation Contemporary Family Services, Inc.Provide Mental Health services and employmentEvidence Based Supported Employment DC Center for Independent Living IncComprehensive Independent Living SkillsILS services DC Public Charter School cooperativeSecondary Transition coordination ServicesTransition Services Deaf Access Solution, Inc.Interpreting Service Interpreting Service Deaf Reach Inc.

Describe the designated State agency's efforts to identify and make arrangements, including entering into cooperative agreements, with other State agencies and other appropriate entities in order to provide supported employment services and extended employment services,213as applicable, to individuals with the most significant disabilities, including youth with the most significant disabilities. The Administration's Supported Employment program (SE) for persons with persistent mental illness utilizes an evidenced-based approach to help individuals with the most significant disabilities to secure, retain, or regain competitive employment in an integrated setting that pays minimum or better wages, and provides benefits. Supported Employment services are individualized and include, but are not limited to: Counseling and guidance Job coaching (on-the-job training) Rapid job search and placement Short-term training Follow-along (unlimited supports) Development of natural supports The Administration coordinates EBSE services with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH). The administration has significantly improved its coordination with DBH in the past year. The number of EBSE providers has more than doubled, from four providers to now ten; staff from the two agencies and the provider agencies meet monthly to ensure good coordination of services, and VR Specialists provide services at the EBSE provider locations in order to work as a team in provision of services and to ensure smooth transition of referrals to DCRSA and of transition to extended services with DBH. In addition, DCRSA has improved its partnership with DDS's Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA). DDA now requires all of its Medicaid waiver supported employment providers to become providers with DCRSA. This improves the transition from DCRSA to extended services with DDA. In addition, DCRSA and DDA have developed a protocol outlining the procedures for referral and coordination of services, and provided training for all staff on this protocol. In FY 2016, DCRSA established one VR unit that is now responsible for working with the cases that are referred from DDA or DBH. This has improved the coordination between the agencies as there are now five dedicated VR Specialists and one VR Supervisor. This has facilitated improved coordination and communication. DDS/RSA and DDA have continued to establish Human Care Agreements with additional supported employment providers who serve people with developmental disabilities. The Administration's supported employment staff continues to streamline the application process to ensure that notifications of appointments, eligibility determinations, and the Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) are completed in accordance with federal requirements. Extended services for consumers are provided by DDA and DBH. DDS/DDA administers a Medicaid Home and Community Based waiver, which includes long term supports for consumers with developmental disabilities in Supported Employment as well as an array of other services, such as residential, transportation, and homemaker services that may be required to support an individual. DBH provides on-going support through its core mental health agencies. Ten (10) private non-profit organizations (Anchor Mental Health; Community Connections, Inc.; Contemporary Family Services, Inc.; Deaf-Reach, Door; Services, LLC; Housing; PSI Services LLC; Psychiatric Center Chartered Inc.; and Psychiatric Rehabilitation Service, Inc.) are providing people with persistent mental illness with Evidenced Based Supported Employment. Thirteen (13) providers (Columbia Lighthouse for Blind; Deaf214Reach Inc., Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Institute, MBA Non-Profit Solutions, MBI Health Services, LLC, National Children's Center, Inc., Pendergrast Alston Consulting, Project John's Community Services; the ARC of DC; and Work Opportunities Unlimited), provide supported employment services that include, but are not limited to, work adjustment training, job coaching, and job placement services. Twelve (12) providers (America Works of Washington DC; Capitol Hill Supportive Services; Columbia Lighthouse for Blind; MBA Non-Profit Solutions; ARC of DC Inc.; Village Academy of Washington DC; and Work Opportunities Unlimited) provide general job placement services, but not be limited to trial work experience and job coaching. DCRSA also utilizes supported employment services to support students and youth in Project Search. There are currently three Project Search sites, including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Institutes of Health, and the Embassy Suites Hotel. In addition, DCRSA provides supported employment supports for students participating in work experience, either through the District's Summer Youth Employment Program or during the school year in DC Public School's Career Academy or Career Explorations courses. One of the challenges in the District has been the lack of an extended service provider for people with developmental disabilities, other than an intellectual disability. The only current source of support for extended services in the District for people receiving supported employment services are the HCBS Waiver with DDA, that provides services to people with intellectual disabilities, supports provided through the Department of Behavioral Health for people with SMI or SED, Ticket to Work, and natural supports. The changes in WIOA related to the provision of extended services for youth have been helpful in allowing the agency to provide extended supports to youth with developmental disabilities. In comments to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we sought clarification whether these services had to terminate when the youth turned twenty four, or if the services were available to any youth for up to four years, if the youth initiates services prior to age twenty four. DCRSA expects to spend a considerable amount from its VR grant for the provision of supported employment services. The following are the agency's plans for distribution of Title VI, Part B Funds Number of Individuals with a Disability to be Served, Number to be Rehabilitated Supported Employment Model Projected, Project Search - we plan to serve twenty youth through Project Search at a cost of $161,000 in Title VI funds, and $15,000 local match; our success rate with this program has been approximately 75%; therefore we expect 15 successful closures. We will utilize the remaining $139,000 to support the EBSE program. This amount will allow us to serve approximately 70 people. Historically, we have had a success rate of 20% in the EBSE program, although we are hoping to see improvement in this through our improved coordination. However, based on the historical data, we expect to see 14 successful closures.215(g) Coordination with Employers. Describe how the designated State unit will work with employers to identify competitive integrated employment and career exploration opportunities in order to facilitate the provision of: (1) VR services; and (2) Transition services, including pre employment transition services, for students and youth with disabilities. DCRSA's Business Relations Unit was established to develop relationships with businesses throughout the Washington DC Metropolitan Area. The BRU collaborates with businesses to educate them about RSA services and to identify their staffing needs for the purpose of gaining exposure and identifying employment opportunities for qualified RSA job seekers. BRU services to businesses include: conducting disability awareness education training creating opportunities for businesses to market themselves to people with disabilities through Industry Spotlights, where job seekers learn about various businesses and the expectations for successful applicants and employees creating opportunities for businesses to participate in Mock Interviews with job seekers and provide feedback sharing employment announcements with job seekers employers are invited to career day events which are industry specific to meet job seekers and share information to assist job seekers with identifying or solidifying their employment goal. screening and identifying qualified employment candidates educating business about tax incentives sharing resources to assist businesses with retaining existing employees and sharing sources for reasonable accommodations brain storming potential opportunities to increase the pipeline of qualified talent to businesses identify candidates for internship/volunteer opportunities Since the passage of WIOA, DCRSA has identified one dedicated employment specialist to provide services to support the transition units. These services include supports to employers, job seekers, and students with disabilities. The employment specialist assigned to the transition units identifies businesses willing to provide paid part-time work experiences for students, as well as identifying permanent employment options for youth who have completed their education or training. This employment specialist also works in the DC Public Charter Schools to provide work readiness training for students with disabilities. In addition, he provides the same technical assistance to employers identified above, as the employment specialists in the General VR units provide.216(h) Interagency Cooperation. Describe how the designated State unit will collaborate with the State agency responsible for administering each of the following programs to develop opportunities for competitive integrated employment, to the greatest extent practicable: (1) the State Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act; (2) the State agency responsible for providing services for individuals with developmental disabilities; and (3) the State agency responsible for providing mental health services. The District of Columbia currently has availability for provision of extended supported employment services through Medicaid only for people with intellectual disabilities and people with serious mental illness or serious emotional disturbance. The Medicaid Waiver in the District for Elderly and Persons with Disabilities does not currently include Supported Employment as a covered service. Furthermore, the District currently has no other Waiver Services to provide extended supported employment services to people with developmental disabilities (e.g., autism, without an intellectual disability), traumatic brain injury, or other physical disabilities. In planning for extended services for these populations, DCRSA must rely on either Ticket to Work Employment Networks or natural supports. The waiver services for people with intellectual disabilities are managed by the Developmental Disability Administration within the same designated state agency that houses DCRSA. In April, 2014, the agency finalized a protocol regarding the coordination of services between the two administrations, i.e., DCRSA and DCDDA. This protocol addresses referrals from DDA to RSA for supported employment services; coordination between the VR Specialist and DDA Service Coordinator, while a person is served by both administrations, and the provisions for ensuring referral back to DDA for extended services through the Medicaid Waiver, including a provision that DCRSA will maintain the case open for sixty days after waiver services are initiated to ensure there are no gaps in services. The DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) is responsible for providing mental health services in the District. DCRSA and DBH have been working together to provide Evidence Based Supported Employment Services since 2010. In 2015, the agencies worked together to expand these services, adding additional community based agencies to provide services. In addition, the agencies developed a Memorandum of Agreement (currently in draft awaiting legal review by DBH). This agreement clarifies the process for referral to DCRSA for supported employment services, and identifies when a case will be referred back to DBH for extended services. In addition, the agreement includes provisions for regular meetings between all parties, as well as the provision of cross-training, to ensure that all DCRSA VR Specialists are aware of all mental health services that are available, including Evidence Based Supported Employment and are aware how to make referrals for these services.217(i) Comprehensive System of Personnel Development; Data System on Personnel and Personnel Development. Describe the designated State agency's procedures and activities to establish and maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development designed to ensure an adequate supply of qualified State rehabilitation professional and paraprofessional personnel for the designated State unit, including the following: (1) Data System on Personnel and Personnel Development (A) Qualified Personnel Needs. Describe the development and maintenance of a system for collecting and analyzing on an annual basis data on qualified personnel needs with respect to: (i) the number of personnel who are employed by the State agency in the provision of VR services in relation to the number of individuals served, broken down by personnel category; (ii) the number of personnel currently needed by the State agency to provide VR services, broken down by personnel category; and (iii) projections of the number of personnel, broken down by personnel category, who will be needed by the State agency to provide VR services in 5 years based on projections of the number of individuals to be served, including individuals with significant disabilities, the number of personnel expected to retire or leave the field, and other relevant factors. The Administration maintains annual employee profiles within the DDS Office of Human Capital. This office tracks and documents counselor completion of college courses and in-service training credits needed to earn and/or maintain CRC certification. In addition, the administration has hired a VR trainer, who also coordinates closely with the Office of Human Capital and is tracking provision of training to all VR staff. The Office of Human Capital also provides information to supervisors, counselors and support staff on relevant training opportunities to enhance service delivery to our customers. The Administration's trainer provides training monthly, works closely with the George Washington School of Rehabilitation Counseling, which also provides monthly training for VR staff, and monitors to ensure the provision of continuing education for all VR Specialists, in order to maintain CRC certification, as well as, identifying appropriate courses for staff who still require additional courses to become CRC eligible. The total number of personnel employed by the Administration in the provision of providing vocational rehabilitation service is 107, with 7 current vacancies. The total number of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Specialists is 43. However, this includes one person who does vocational evaluations, one who works in re-engaging clients, and does not carry an ongoing caseload, and one person who works primarily with independent living and people receiving services through the independent living, older blind program, although there are also 3 VR Specialist vacancies. The total number of support staff for VR counselors is 10. The total population served in FY 2015 was approximately 7000 persons with disabilities. The current number of active cases is approximately 4600. The current average counselor/person ratio 1:115; once the three vacancies are filled, this will reduce to 1:107. The caseload standards will continue to be as follows: VR general caseloads - 125-150:1; Blind and Visually Impaired or Deaf and Hard of Hearing Caseloads - 75-100:1; Transition Caseloads - 150-175:1. The transition unit works with youth referred by schools, the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services and the Child and Family Services Agency. There are additional transition age youth who apply directly to the agency for services, and are no longer in218school. These youth are currently served by counselors in the General VR units. The agency currently has 9 Supervisors (including two who are second level supervisors; one is responsible for supervising four General VR units and the other supervises the transition units and the sensory unit, which serves people who are blind, deafblind and deaf) - this also includes 2 Transition Supervisors, 4 General VR supervisors, one supervisor for the unit serving persons who are sensory impaired, including people who are blind or visually impaired, deaf or deafblind. Because of the size of the sensory unit (i.e., only five VR Specialists), this person also supervises blind services staff whose time is spent primarily providing independent living services, we anticipate the funds for this position will be charged 80% to VR, and 20% to IL and ILOB). There are currently ten rehabilitation assistants and two administrative Support Specialists supporting counselors in the transition units. There are currently two second level supervisory VR Specialists, one supervises the four general VR units and the other supervises the special services units, including transition, sensory and independent living services (one VR specialist in the sensory unit provides services to people in the IL and ILOB programs). There are currently only three counselor vacancies. The agency is specifically recruiting for at least one VR counselor who is certified bilingual in Spanish/English. We have taken a number of steps in this recruitment strategy, including working with the District Office of Latino Affairs and reaching out to various graduate VR programs across the country attempting to identify new graduates who are bilingual, who may be interested in moving to the District. The outreach has expanded as far as Puerto Rico. The agency has filled one position (planned start date in February 2016) but plans to continue recruiting to hire at least one additional bi-lingual VR Specialist. The estimate of the number of persons needed by the agency to provide VR services over the next five years is based on the estimate of the number of persons expected to retire or leave the agency with the next five years. In FY 2015, the agency lost one staff person (an administrative support staff person) through retirement. The agency expects that the QA supervisor and at least two more administrative staff will retire within the next five years. There are also two staff within Business services and three VR specialists who will be eligible for retirement within the next five years. DCRSA's State Plan required that all VR Specialists be eligible to sit for the CRC examination by October 1, 2015. There are currently twenty three VR Specialists who have their CRC; eleven are eligible to sit for the CRC examination; and are currently scheduled to take the examination; there are nine staff who still require additional course work to be eligible to sit for the examination. DCRSA pays the cost for a VR Specialist to take the examination one time. The agency also pays for staff to take any necessary course work to be eligible to sit for the examination. With the changes to the CSPD in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, DCRSA reviewed its decision to require that all VR counselors be eligible to sit for the CRC examination by October 1, 2015, in light of the requirement that the agency have staff who have a 21stCentury understanding of the evolving labor force and of the needs of people with disabilities. In reviewing the performance of the staff that are not yet eligible to sit for the CRC examination, the agency noted that many of these staff are also high performers, in terms of number of people placed in employment. Although the staff does not have the professional credentials the agency prefers its staff to have, they do seem to demonstrate an understanding of the evolving labor force and the needs of people with disabilities. Therefore, the agency made a determination not to terminate these individuals, but to continue to work with them toward earning the required219credentials. The agency will continue to only hire new VR counselors who are eligible to sit for the CRC; and will continue to provide the necessary support to all existing staff.

Describe the development and maintenance of a system for collecting and analyzing on an annual basis data on personnel development with respect to: (i) a list of the institutions of higher education in the State that are preparing VR professionals, by type of program; (ii) the number of students enrolled at each of those institutions, broken down by type of program; and (iii) the number of students who graduated during the prior year from each of those institutions with certification or licensure, or with the credentials for certification or licensure, broken down by the personnel category for which they have received, or have the credentials to receive, certification or licensure. The State Agency Office of Human Capital maintains relationships with the local universities that have rehabilitation counseling programs. There are currently two programs in the District of Columbia, one at the University of the District of Columbia and one at George Washington University. In addition, the Deputy Director sits on the Advisory Committee for the rehabilitation counseling program at Coppin State University, and has provided letters of support for the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore (UMES), to receive grant funds to support its program, from which a number of current DCRSA counselors have graduated. During FY 2015, the agency had220interns from both UDC and George Washington University. The agency has hired recent graduates from GW, UDC and UMES. The internship coordinator for the agency works closely with both institutions to coordinate internship opportunities. In addition to fostering this relationship as a means of recruiting new staff, the agency's training coordinator works with these institutions to coordinate continuing education opportunities for staff, in order to help them maintain their CRC, or to identify appropriate classes for our staff who have outstanding course work in order to sit for the CRC exam. The agency remains committed to assisting all current staff to become eligible to sit for and obtain their CRC, and continues to provide as part of this plan sufficient funds to pay for staff to take the CRC exam, and for staff with remaining course work, to take three credits per semester.

Describe the development and implementation of a plan to address the current and projected needs for qualified personnel including, the coordination and facilitation of efforts between the designated State unit and institutions of higher education and professional associations to recruit, prepare, and retain personnel who are qualified, including personnel from minority backgrounds and personnel who are individuals with disabilities. In FY 2012, the Administration began recruiting counselors at grade 12 pay level, the highest grade level for a rehabilitation specialist. Applicants at this level must have completed a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling with at least one year of experience and CRC. Furthermore, the administration only hires new VR Specialists who are eligible to sit for the CRC examination. The administration does not limit hiring to only VR Specialists with a CRC because this could preclude hiring of new graduates from VR counseling programs in the area, one of the best means of recruiting new staff for the agency. The Administration has a recruitment plan in place to address the hiring of a sufficient number of vocational rehabilitation counselors within DCRSA. These recruitment efforts include (1)posting vacancy announcements on the D.C. Office of Personnel website (at the time any vacancy occurs), and (2) posting vacancy announcements at community programs and through professional organizations, (3) visiting classrooms and faculty at universities, and (4) increasing its use of221interns and volunteers. The recruitment plan consists of two major goals: Goal 1: Expand recruitment efforts Objective 1.1 Contact graduate school programs and develop relationships with the program chairs. Maintain appropriate contact information to mail notices of job openings. Objective 1.2 Schedule attendance at job fairs at colleges and universities Objective 1.3 Develop opportunities for paid and non-paid internships with colleges and universities Objective 1.4 Participate in research projects, classroom visits, and other activities to raise DCRSA's profile with the above institutions and therefore increase access to potential counselors. Goal 2: Increase retention efforts Objective 2.1 Continue DCRSA new counselor orientation program Objective 2.2 Increase opportunities for professional growth through increased opportunities for continuous learning through in-service training and workshops Objective 2.3 Expand opportunities for employee recognition DCRSA has developed an formalized onboarding program with several weeks of prescribed activities to orient new staff to DCRSA as well as to provide the training needed to effectively utilize the case management system, understand the organizational structure, and develop an understanding of the DC population of job-seekers at large and the subpopulation of job-seekers with disabilities. This orientation is comprised of 7 modules. Informed Consent, Ethics (All staff receive 1 CRC credit), Overview of the VR Process, Intake & Eligibility, Comprehensive Assessment, IPE Development, Overview of Internal Database System, and DC Policy Review (Review with Supervisor during initial week of employment). DCRSA implemented a 12 session supervisor training \"boot camp\" in the summer of 2012 to help supervisors support counselors and other staff through prevailing practices in management. The goal of this management training was to help ease morale concerns amongst both supervisors and their subordinate staff and serve to attenuate counselor attrition. In addition, all supervisory staff has requirements for on-going management training each fiscal year required as part of their individual performance plans. DDS provides an annual awards event that celebrates employee success. Awards are presented to employees for outstanding Customer service and teamwork. In addition, as indicated below, DCRSA has established an agreement with the George Washington University VR counseling program for provision of monthly continuing education for all VR Specialists, and has hired an internal training coordinator to supplement this training. The Administration encompasses a uniquely diverse staff. Currently, it has a number of bilingual staff. However, there is a current shortage of VR Specialists who speak Spanish. Therefore, we are expanding our outreach to attract employees proficient in Spanish. This outreach has included posting job announcements on the local Office of Latino Affairs website, and doing outreach to graduate VR counseling programs across the country seeking qualified bi-lingual graduates. The administration has had success with recruiting qualified supervisory staff, both from within the agency and from other parts of the country. All VR supervisory positions are currently filled. Of the nine current supervisory VR Specialists, five have been promoted from within the agency and four were hired from outside the state. (3) Personnel Standards. Describe the State agency's policies and procedures for the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards consistent with section 101(a)(7)(B) and to ensure that designated State unit professional and paraprofessional personnel are adequately trained and prepared, including:222(A) standards that are consistent with any national or State approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements that apply to the profession or discipline in which such personnel are providing VR services; and (B) the establishment and maintenance of education and experience requirements, to ensure that the personnel have a 21st century understanding of the evolving labor force and the needs of individuals with disabilities. Prior to the passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, DCRSA had established standards requiring that all VR Specialists be eligible to sit for the CRC examination. The agency supported all staff to prepare for and sit for the examination through a number of strategies. As of the end of calendar year 2015, DCRSA has forty three VR Specialists and nine VR supervisory staff. All VR supervisors have a CRC. Of the forty three VR specialists, twenty three have a CRC and eleven are eligible to sit for the CRC examination. The agency still has nine VR Specialists who are not eligible to sit for the examination. However, these are all staff that were hired by the agency prior to the CRC requirement being established. As indicated above, the agency considered, in light of the WIOA changes regarding ensuring that the agency has personnel with a 21stcentury understanding of the evolving labor force and the needs of individuals with disabilities, whether the staff who lacked the CRC credential and were not currently eligible to sit for the examination could still contribute to the mission of the agency to help people with disabilities obtain employment. Based on the performance of these employees, it was determined that they can continue to contribute to the mission of the agency, that they have the required skills. However, the agency will continue to make supports available to help all VR Specialist staff work toward obtaining a CRC credential. The agency will also continue its policy of only hiring as VR Specialists those individuals who are eligible to sit for the CRC examination. In order to work toward ensuring that all staff both have the education and experience to ensure the personnel have a 21sst century understanding of the evolving labor force and the needs of individuals with disabilities, as defined by WIOA, and to maintain standards consistent with recognized certification, i.e., CRC licensure, DCRSA will continue to take the following steps to support current staff: DCRSA will pay for 3 credit hours a semester including books for on-line or classroom courses. DCRSA will pay the one-time cost of the CRC examination. DCRSA will allot hours during the work day for staff to attend training. After negotiation with a university offering the rehabilitation counseling program, DCRSA will arrange to offer courses on site.223(4) Staff Development. Describe the State agency's policies, procedures, and activities to ensure that, consistent with section 101(a)(7)(C) of the Rehabilitation Act, all personnel employed by the designated State unit receive appropriate and adequate training in terms of: (A) a system of staff development for professionals and paraprofessionals within the designated State unit, particularly with respect to assessment, vocational counseling, job placement, and rehabilitation technology, including training implemented in coordination with entities carrying out State programs under section 4 of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998; and During FY 2015, staff began participation in a comprehensive, year-long, program of core vocational rehabilitation trainings, often developed and presented in conjunction with the George Washington University (GWU) Center for Rehabilitation Counseling Research and Education (CRCRE). Training provided to all vocational rehabilitation specialists and supervisors during these trainings included Foundations of the Rehabilitation Act; Supported Employment Overview and Policy; Initial interviewing; Career Assessments; IPE Development; Case and Caseload Management; Job Development and Placement; and Motivational Interviewing. In 2015, DCRSA provided additional monthly trainings to all vocational rehabilitation specialists and supervisors including Working with Transition Students, Vocational Rehabilitation Ethics, Financial Management / Fiscal Responsibility, Trial Work, Eligibility Determination Extension, Supported Employment, and Self-Employment. A comprehensive in-house training program for all new and currently employed vocational rehabilitation specialists as well as supervisors with DC RSA was developed and implemented in FY 2015. This program will continue its development and implementation to incorporate classroom, small group, and direct consumer work over a multi-week period to ensure a complete understanding and thorough synthesis of both the vocational rehabilitation process and practice. Topics that will be covered are inclusive of but not limited to: Vocational rehabilitation for individuals experiencing substance use disorders Comprehensive treatment services- Comprehensive Assessment Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Vocational Rehabilitation Specialists & Supervisors will receive training in the same areas as noted above in FY 2016 collaborative training with the Region 3 TACE at GWU, In addition, training topics will cover: Psychosocial and Medical Aspects of Disability Traumatic Brain Injuries Mental Illness and Vocational Rehabilitation Understanding Addiction Resume Development Intellectual Disabilities and Employment Cultural Awareness and Competence Internal Case Management Electronic Filing System.224Additionally, staff may also have the opportunity to attend regional and national conferences and trainings, including the: National Federation of the Blind BLAST Conference Project Search National Conference; National Council on Independent Living Conference; National Federation of the Blind National Convention; National Rehabilitation Training Conference; The 9thAnnual Summit on Vocational Rehabilitation and Program Evaluation, The Annual Association of People Supporting Employment First (APSE) national Conference; The National Convention for Rehabilitation Educators; The Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference; The Advancing Ethical Research Conference The YAI Network International Conference. (B) Procedures for the acquisition and dissemination of significant knowledge from research and other sources to designated State unit professionals and paraprofessionals. Administrative staff within the Office of Human Capital are charged with the responsibility to seek out, plan and coordinate on-site and offsite training opportunities for staff on an on-going basis. Additionally, the agency continues outreach activities in vocational training programs and colleges and universities to attract young professionals interested in embarking in a career in Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling. DCRSA continues to improve coordination with the DC Assistive Technology Center in order to ensure that VR counselors are aware of services available there, and aware of AT services available for persons with disabilities, in order to know when a referral for an AT assessment is appropriate. The training institute in DDS keeps data on counselors who have attended trainings. Pre- and post-training evaluations and reports on trainings and conferences attended are being conducted. The Human Capital Administration training coordinator monitors conferences available around the county, and advises staff when relevant conferences or trainings are available. The agency supports staff in attending these conferences. Staff who attend outside conferences and trainings provide updates and trainings at all staff meetings upon their return, in order to ensure dissemination of knowledge learned. (5) Personnel to Address Individual Communication Needs. Describe how the designated State unit has personnel or obtains the services of other individuals who are able to communicate in appropriate modes of communication with or in the native language of applicants or eligible individuals who have limited English speaking ability.225The Administration will continue to employ personnel who are able to communicate in the native languages of applicants for services and clients who have limited English speaking ability. The Administration provides accommodations for special communication needs such as interpreters, specialized services and materials for individuals who are deaf, blind or deafblind. Sign language skills are considered a minimum qualification for positions providing services to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Administration's services population continues to expand because of increased outreach efforts. The agency seeks to serve individuals with disabilities from the six languages identified by the D.C. Office of Human Rights. The languages include Spanish, Chinese, French, Vietnamese, Korean and Amharic. The agency will continue emphasize the bilingual capacity of staff in recruitment efforts. The agency includes a preference in hiring for candidates who are bilingual, and as indicated above, currently has a focused recruitment to identify qualified VR Specialists who are bilingual in Spanish/English. This is of particular importance based on the current make up of the client base of the agency, which includes approximately 150 people whose primary language is Spanish. The Agency is in compliance with the DC Language Access Act. Staff from the DC Office of Human Rights provides training annually to all staff regarding the DC Language Access Act and provision of services to non-English and limited English proficient persons. The bilingual capacity of the DDS/RSA staff is as follows: Staff who speak Spanish: 1 Deputy Director, 1 Intake Specialist, 1 Sign Language Interpreter; Staff who are fluent in American Sign Language 2 ASL Interpreters, 3 Managers/Supervisory VR Staff, 2 VR Specialists, 1 Program Monitor, 1 Business Relations Specialist, 1 Provider Specialist; Staff who speak Amharic: 1 VR Specialist; Staff who speak French: Staff speak Yoruba: 1 VR Supervisor; Staff who speak Ibo: 1 VR Specialist, 1 Clerical assistant; Staff who speak Kiswahili: 1 VR Supervisor; Staff who speak Kikuyu: 1 VR Supervisor. Within DDS, in the offices shared with RSA, there are additional staff who speak some of the languages above as well as staff who speak Haitian Creole, Telugu, Hindi, German, Japanese, Yoruba, Mandarin, Portuguese and Kru. In addition, the administration uses the Language Access Line to provide interpretation for consumers who are limited English proficient, or non-English proficient, when bilingual staff are unavailable. In FY 2014, the administration specifically recruited for a bilingual Intake Specialist. This has reduced the administration's reliance on the Language Access Line, as this Intake Specialist is available to assist applicants. (6) Coordination of Personnel Development Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. As appropriate, describe the procedures and activities to coordinate the designated State unit's comprehensive system of personnel development with personnel development under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Administration staff receives training on a continuous basis. The Administration is fully committed to providing effective, coordinated transition services. The agency has created two Transition Units that currently employ two supervisors, fourteen VR specialists, two rehabilitation assistants, and is currently in the interviewing process for hiring a Transition Project Manager, to assist in coordinating with all local education agencies and fully implementing pre-employment226transition services for students with disabilities. DCRSA staff participates actively on DC's Secondary Transition Community of Practice, coordinated by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). DCRSA staff also remain active in Partners in Transition activities, which included on-going activities with DCPS, OSSE and other public and private partners who work with youth with disabilities in the District of Columbia. The transition project manager will work with DCPS to develop cross training for education and VR staff on VR and special education issues in transition. (j) Statewide Assessment. (1) Provide an assessment of the rehabilitation needs of individuals with disabilities residing within the State, particularly the VR services needs of those: (A) with the most significant disabilities, including their need for supported employment services; (B) who are minorities; (C) who have been unserved or underserved by the VR program; (D) who have been served through other components of the statewide workforce development system; and (E) who are youth with disabilities and students with disabilities, including, as appropriate, their need for pre employment transition services or other transition services. (2) Identify the need to establish, develop, or improve community rehabilitation programs within the State; and (3) Include an assessment of the needs of individuals with disabilities for transition career services and pre employment transition services, and the extent to which such services are coordinated with transition services provided under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. DCRSA, in coordination with the SRC contracted with San Diego State University (SDSU) to conduct a Comprehensive Statewide Needs Assessment (CSNA). SDSU had completed the agency's prior CSNA in 2013. This CSNA was supposed to be completed in 2011. However, there had been delays in conducting this assessment and therefore, the 2011 CSNA was not complete until May, 2013. SDSU conducted both the 2013 and 2014 CSNAs. In both instances, this organization was selected through a competitive process. Proposals were evaluated by a team including representation from DCRSA and the SRC. SDSU had demonstrated experience with completing needs assessments for a number of other state rehabilitation programs across the country. The 2014 assessment was able to build on the findings of the previous assessment. The focus of the 2014 assessment was expanded to thoroughly evaluate independent living services in the District, as well. There were increased efforts in the 2014 assessment to ensure that focus groups included people with disabilities who have not been served by the agency, as well as groups that include populations identified in the previous assessment as unserved or underserved. Lastly, SDSU worked with DCRSA's Business Relations Unit to obtain more input227from employers. The needs assessment identified the following themes, and made the following recommendations for follow up: 1) Overall Agency Performance The most common theme that emerged in this area concerned the narrow range of jobs that DCRSA consumers are obtaining. Most of the jobs are in the service industry, typically custodial jobs, which are not consistent with the functional capacities of many DCRSA consumers. The responsiveness of the organization to consumers remains an area of concern. Recommendations for follow up in this area include: DCRSA has been receiving training and technical assistance from the George Washington University regarding improving program performance. It is recommended that they continue this process even though TACE Center funding has been discontinued. Federal RSA has encouraged VR programs to use their basic grant funds for the purchase of training and technical assistance, so it is recommended that DCRSA utilize a portion of these funds to continue what they consider to be valuable training and TA. DCRSA has created brochures and marketing materials for the general program that are similar to what it has created for the transition program. The organization is encouraged to continue to develop and share these materials with the community to support the outreach efforts that have taken place in the last 18 months. The intake/appointment process at DCRSA needs to be modified to ensure that wait times are diminished and it is easy for the Receptionist to contact someone to escort clients to meetings. It may be that having one or two points of contact acting as Counselors of the Day could be charged with connecting consumers to their Counselors quickly. DCRSA should consider factoring in generational responses to organizational changes and initiatives, especially as it relates to motivation. There is a mix of millennial, Generation X and Baby Boomers in their staff. As the work force moves to a younger demographic, the organization might consider how to tailor organizational change efforts to different age groups before the change effort is implemented. This might help address some of the consistent concerns about resistance to change that were brought up from staff and partners. A recurring theme that arose was the power of positive examples and \"telling the story\" of the consumers touched by the organization as a motivating factor. DCRSA should gather and share best practice stories as teaching and motivation tools and gather success stories and share them with staff and the community via their website. If DCRSA is going to widen the range of employment outcomes for their consumers, they will need to approach the solution from a number of different angles. First, they will need to educate their staff on the extent of the issue and gather feedback from counseling staff228on why the range of employment outcomes is limited. Second, they need to provide their counseling staff with tools and training on the use of labor market information to broaden their knowledge-base on available jobs. LMI tools like the Career Index can help counselors and consumers investigate a wide array of job possibilities. The use of tools like the Career Index also encourage the career exploration process, which was cited by several participants as a \"lost art.\" Third, counselors need to be evaluated by more than just the number of employment outcomes they obtain so that they will be comfortable working on longer term plans with consumers. The performance measures under WIOA will help tremendously with this issue, so some advance training on these performance measures will be helpful. Fourth, counselors need to understand that they can spend case service funds for placement as an interim step to help a consumer obtain employment to survive while working on a longer-term plan with the client to obtain employment more consistent with his/her primary employment factors. Finally, counselors will need to nurture important partnerships that provide their consumers with skills and abilities that will prepare them for higher-level jobs. These partnerships include literacy programs (including both language and math literacy), adult vocational training and other short-term training programs, housing assistance, benefits planning, etc. A combination of these approaches should contribute to developing independence and self-sufficiency for DCRSA consumers and reduce the number of clients that return for services. The underutilization of Schedule A hiring by DCRSA remains a frequent comment by participants. A focused initiative that promoted Federal hiring by coordinating with Federal hiring managers, perhaps in partnership with CSAVR's Business Relations Manager and the local NET Point of Contact could result in increased awareness and employment opportunities in career-level jobs. 2) Needs of persons with the most significant disabilities, including their need for supported employment The needs identified most frequently in this section included benefits planning for Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSI/DI) beneficiaries, the need for increased and improved supported employment (SE) providers and services, the need for expanded SE services for persons with mental health impairments, housing, and improved literacy. The need to approach the VR process holistically to meet the many and varied needs was a common theme. Recommendations for follow up in this area include: DCRSA should engage in a training program for staff on the role of DBH as an extended service provider for persons with mental health impairments that need SE services to successfully obtain and retain employment. Many staff were not aware of the availability of extended services from DBH.229One possibility for funding for extended service provision for SSA beneficiaries not covered by DDA or DBH would be through the Partnership Plus model for Ticket to Work holders. DCRSA should consider working in concert with a CRP that is an approved Employment Network and \"handing off the case\" once the individual has achieved stability on the job. It was reported that DCRSA does use three Employment Networks for Partnership Plus, but has not done so for extended service provision. Given the significant and numerous challenges that many DCRSA consumers face with substance abuse and literacy, long-term successful vocational rehabilitation must include connections with helpful organizations that will address their literacy and sobriety needs. It was reported that DCRSA closes homemaker cases as IL-OIB cases rather than as \"successfully rehabilitated.\" DCRSA should examine whether this is in fact occurring and should be changed. Conduct a holistic assessment of consumers during the intake process that identifies support systems and needs in areas such as housing, finances, clothing, child care, and family. This type of holistic assessment will help DCRSA connect consumers to important resources and will encourage joint planning. Because of the long gaps in work history for many of DCRSA consumers, work experiences become important to help them acquire work skills and demonstrate their ability to potential employers. Consequently, DCRSA should continue to develop the capacity to provide these work experiences whenever possible. One possible avenue for this would be the use of temporary placement agencies like Manpower. DCRSA's BRU has been providing employment readiness workshops for consumers. These are important helps in preparing consumers to obtain employment. Pursuant to available resources, DCRSA should consider expanding the scope of these workshops to target the identified needs of many of their consumers such as basic computer skills acquisition and soft skills development (including social skills). It is recommended that DCRSA examine the case recording process for the identification of the receipt of SSI/DI by consumers. The information shared with the project team about the number of consumers on SSI/DI during the interview process appears to be incongruent with the data in DCRSA's case management system. 3) Needs of persons with disabilities from different ethnic groups, including needs of persons who have been unserved or underserved by the VR program Persons with disabilities that are Hispanic, Ethiopian, Asian, Veterans, and persons with significant physical disabilities were cited as being underserved by DCRSA. The improved outreach efforts of DCRSA, especially to Wards 7 and 8 were noted by several persons. Recommendations for follow up in this area include: It remains a challenge for DCRSA to easily identify the Ward of residence for consumers that they are serving. It is possible, but is labor intensive. It would be helpful for the sake230of monitoring service patterns and referrals to ensure that this information is readily gathered and searchable on the case management system. DCRSA should increase targeted outreach to rehabilitation hospitals that serve persons with spinal cord injuries and other traumatic physical disabilities in order to increase service to this population. Although the persons being treated at these hospitals may not be ready to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program while they are in the hospital, there is great value in having a counselor present to share information with the individual and families about DCRSA and the services that are available once the individual is ready to start thinking about training and work. DCRSA needs to review their case recording process as it relates to identifying Veterans and provide training to staff if there are case recording needs in this area. If the number of Veterans served as reported in their case management system is accurate, then DCRSA should ensure that it reaches out to the VA in DC to strengthen their liaison relationship and increase referrals. As indicated in the previous report in 2013, DCRSA needs to target Hispanic, Asian and Ethiopian persons with disabilities for outreach. It is difficult to track the effectiveness of outreach to Ethiopian persons as DCRSA's current system does not track these individuals, so DCRSA should consider including a data field that will allow for the tracking of this indictor to gauge the effectiveness of their outreach. DCRSA should consider replicating outreach programs like Minnesota VR's New Americans Project (NAP). Since there are numerous immigrants to the DC area, the only way that DCRSA can hope to reach them is to establish partnerships with, and meet potential consumers at community programs serving the needs of those persons. One of the unique elements of the NAP program is that VR program staff spend a considerable amount of time investing in information sharing, education and discussions about work needs and requirements before they even broach the subject of applying for services. In effect, the VR program is an educator and partner in the community before it is a direct service provider. A program like this in DC might help to establish important partnerships for future referrals while increasing awareness of DCRSA. 4) Needs of persons with disabilities served through other components of the statewide workforce investment system America's Job Centers (AJCs) were characterized as being unfriendly to persons with disabilities and several people noted accessibility issues for people with blindness and deafness. Although the relationship between DCRSA and the Department of Employment Services (DOES) was characterized as improving, the AJCs are still not serving persons with disabilities well according to most of the people interviewed for this assessment. Recommendations for follow up in this area include:231The passage of WIOA will require that DCRSA, DOES and the entire workforce system collaborate at a deeper level than they have in the past. The requirement for a unified state plan, common outcome measures and alignment of systems will have a profound impact on VR programs everywhere. Consequently, any activity that promotes the partnership between DCRSA and the AJCs should be encouraged. This includes collocating on a permanent basis and shared funding of cases. DCRSA should explore the possibility of developing a customized training program that will target training persons with disabilities for employment in high-demand occupations. It is likely that DOES has developed these programs in the past, but there are models of collaboration between VR and workforce programs developed specifically for persons with disabilities that should be considered as DOES and VR strive to respond to the President's job-driven initiative. DCRSA should consult with the National Employment Team related to the development of customized training programs and the replication of such programs in the District. DCRSA should consider requesting intensive TA services from the job driven TA center recently funded by Federal RSA to help develop customized training opportunities with employers. The NET has developed customized training programs with the Hyatt, and these programs might be able to be duplicated in DC. DCRSA should consult with the NET Point of Contact and CSAVR's Business Services Manager to determine if the development of such a program is a possibility in the District. It was reported that short-term vocational training programs have better outcomes for DCRSA consumers. Consequently, DCRSA and the AJCs should consider developing an initiative that focuses on the availability of these programs and utilizes funding from both organizations to maximize resources, broaden the range of employment outcomes, and meet client needs for quick placement. DCRSA should identify ways that transition-aged youth can increase their utilization of the youth services at the AJCs. Some of the best practices include youth site visits to AJCs, in-school presentations by DCRSA and DOES staff together, summer youth set-aside positions for youth with disabilities, career exploration events, job fairs, etc. 5) Needs of persons in transition - Continued outreach including development of professional marketing materials and improved communication with schools Transition was cited as an area where DCRSA has made improvements in the last year. The transition unit has expanded and this has allowed the agency to increase outreach and serve more consumers. The needs of transition-aged youth continue to include soft-skills development, literacy development and job search skills. Several improvements in DCRSA's outreach to schools were noted including the development of professional marketing materials and improved communication with schools. Recommendations for follow up in this area include:232Develop and enforce policies for attendance and support at out-of-state postsecondary education institutions. In addition, there should be clear progress measures and timelines contained in the IPE that are reasonable and developed in partnership with the consumer. These policies must be shared as early as possible with young people and their families so that they can plan for their share of cost if they choose to attend an out of state institution. The concern expressed in this assessment had more to do with a clear and consistently shared and enforced policy than it did about the level of funding. Although there is a clear sense of the transition model for DCRSA, it would be helpful to have a readily available visual map of the model and how transition works ideally for staff to ensure consistency across persons and between the way staff interact with public and charter schools. Continue to develop work experience opportunities like Project Search for youth in transition. It would be helpful to work with the Department of Employment Services' Youth programs to ensure that the workforce initiatives they develop for youth includes young people with disabilities. These initiatives include the Grow your Own Program and Summer Youth Employment program. As DCRSA strives to identify strategies to increase the capacity of young SSA beneficiaries to move toward self-sufficiency through work, it would be helpful to include education of the young person's family and try and encourage high expectations for the youth regarding work rather than striving to remain dependent on SSI. High expectations have been proven to have a positive effect on outcomes and earnings for young beneficiaries1 (Olney, Compton, Tucker, Emery-Flores & Zuniga, 2014). DCRSA's BRU conducts employment readiness workshops that would be very helpful for young people while they are still in school. DCRSA should try conducting some of the workshops in the school setting to help students understand what is required for work and to model the process for school staff that might want to develop the workshops for the future. DCRSA should consider including the development of self-advocacy skills as a component of an in-school training program for youth. The need for youth to advocate for themselves was cited by several persons that were interviewed for this assessment. Ensure that public and charter schools share information about DCRSA with 504 students so that these students do not experience delays in service upon graduation. 6) Need to establish, develop, or improve CRPs in the District The quality of vendor services remains a recurring theme during this assessment. Improved placement services for persons with sensory impairments was a recurring theme, as was the need for bilingual staff at HCA providers. Recommendations for follow up in this area include: Follow-through with placing the vendor performance summaries online in order to facilitate informed choice and inspire vendors to excellence. DCRSA has been working to ensure that their contracts with CRPs include measurable deliverables in the Statement of Work. This should contribute to CRP accountability and to improvement of the quality of service delivery. DCRSA should continue to develop performance-based contracts in all cases.233DCRSA should consider providing an ACRE or APSE certified training program in employment services for their BRU staff and for HCA provider staff in the community. This would ensure a minimal level of competency in providing employment services for DCRSA consumers. Pilot a fast-track process for the purchase of certain types of AT products that are purchased regularly to assist consumers. Convene a workgroup of DCRSA and CRP staff serving people with blindness to identify ways to improve the speed and quality of services for people with blindness. 7) Business needs, relations, and services The need for assistance recruiting, hiring, retaining and accommodating qualified persons with disabilities was identified by businesses in the District. Many of the businesses contacted had never heard of DCRSA, but the ones that had worked with DCRSA 6 indicated a need to ensure that persons referred for jobs were ready for work and qualified for the position. Businesses identified a need for training on different disability types and what to expect from them in the work environment, as well as possible successful accommodations for these persons. Recommendations for follow up in this area include: DCRSA should embark on an education campaign for local employers regarding the hiring of persons with blindness. They do employer spotlight events for education and disability awareness workshops (which they are strongly encouraged to continue), but should consider focusing on targeted education for specific disability types like blindness. DCRSA should investigate expanding its partnership with the National Employment Team (the NET) to determine if there are ways to increase employment opportunities for their consumers as a result of the new Section 503 rules. DCRSA should consider training their BRU staff on specific job analysis as an employer service and as a way to consider job carving, if needed, for consumers who might benefit from the customized employment model. (k) Annual Estimates. Describe: (1) The number of individuals in the State who are eligible for services. (2) The number of eligible individuals who will receive services under: (A) The VR Program; (B) The Supported Employment Program; and (C) each priority category, if under an order of selection. (3) The number of individuals who are eligible for VR services, but are not receiving such services due to an order of selection; and234(4) The cost of services for the number of individuals estimated to be eligible for services. If under an order of selection, identify the cost of services for each priority category. The District of Columbia labor force data indicates that there are 424,300 working age residents. Of those of working age (18-64) 37,300 are estimated to have a disability, which represents 8.8% of the District's working age population. The employment rate for people with disabilities in the District is 32.8%. This compares with an employment rate of 76.9% for people without disabilities. Table 24: Cost of Services Category Title I or Title VIEstimated FundsEstimated Number to be ServedAverage Cost of Services Title I Part B (Priority Category 1) Title I $8,347,200 3700 $2,256 Title VI Part B Title VI $300,000 90 $3,333 Title I Part B (Priority Category 2) Title I $5,175,415 2345 $2,207 Title I Part B (Priority Category 3) Title I $319,515 255 $1,253 Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2013 American Community Survey (l) State Goals and Priorities. The designated State unit must: (1) Identify if the goals and priorities were jointly developed and agreed to by the State VR agency and the State Rehabilitation Council, if the State has a Council, and jointly agreed to any revisions. (2) Identify the goals and priorities in carrying out the VR and Supported Employment programs. (3) Ensure that the goals and priorities are based on an analysis of the following areas: (A) the most recent comprehensive statewide assessment, including any updates; (B) the State's performance under the performance accountability measures of section 116 of WIOA; and (C) other available information on the operation and effectiveness of the VR program, including any reports received from the State Rehabilitation Council and findings and recommendations from monitoring activities conducted under section 107. In Fiscal Year 2015, the District of Columbia State Rehabilitation Council (SRC) had scheduled five meetings; only four meetings occurred due to a lack of a quorum at the July meeting. These sessions are public forums structured to gather information about the employment of persons with disabilities, and for the designated state unit to provide information about services provided. Every effort is made to provide a variety of avenues for public input whenever issues, concerns, or policy235changes are considered. The SRC has an active policy committee that reviews and comments on proposed regulatory, policy and procedure changes. Meetings of the SRC are held at our District of Columbia State Rehabilitation Administration offices at 1125 15th Street, NW, Second Floor Conference Room, Washington, DC 20005. In addition, the designated state unit held a number of meetings with agency staff, the SRC and VR providers seeking input into the development of priorities and goals. The most recent Comprehensive Statewide Needs Assessment was published in December 2014; this assessment, as well as agency consumer satisfaction surveys and agency performance reports informed the development of this plan. The District will publish its Unified Workforce Development State Plan in January 2016, and will hold a number of public forums to hear feedback on the plan, including the program specific plan for vocational rehabilitation and supported employment services. The Goals and priorities for the Vocational Rehabilitation and Supported employment program are in response to both National and State issues, as mandated by Section 105 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The focus of their goals and activities includes but are not limited to consumer satisfaction, statewide needs assessment, state plan and amendments, policy, extent/scope/effectiveness of services, interagency agreements, and District of Columbia employment programs. These goals were developed, reviewed, and approved by DC RSA and the SRC. Planned program goals to be accomplished by the DC Department on Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration were based on agency performance on standards and indicators. Planned program objectives and initiatives to be accomplished by the DC Department on Disability Services, Rehabilitation Services Administration are: Goal 1: Increase the number of DC residents with disabilities who achieve quality employment outcomes in competitive integrated settings Objective 1.1: Increase outreach efforts, with a particular focus on ensuring accessibility of services for people identified as underserved or unserved in the 2014 Comprehensive Statewide Needs Assessment, and for people living in wards 7 and 8.

DCRSA will have at least two business roundtables throughout the year. b. DCRSA will increase the number of small businesses with which it has relationships by 10% yearly. c. DCRSA will provide services, in terms of disability education, to these businesses.247(m) Order of Selection. Describe: (1)The order to be followed in selecting eligible individuals to be provided VR services. (2) The justification for the order. (3) The service and outcome goals. (4) The time within which these goals may be achieved for individuals in each priority category within the order. (5) How individuals with the most significant disabilities are selected for services before all other individuals with disabilities; and (6) If the designated State unit has elected to serve eligible individuals, regardless of any established order of selection, who require specific services or equipment to maintain employment. The above listed goals and objectives highlight where and how VR services will be analyzed, tracked, and evaluated. In order to successfully reach these goals and objectives the District has established an order of selection for which eligible individuals will be provided VR services. Order to be followed in selecting eligible individuals to be provided VR services DCRSA established Order of Selection priority categories as follows: Depending upon agency resources, the categories are closed for services in order beginning with Priority III, then II and, finally Priority Category I. Categories may be closed based on the following circumstances Limitations of case service dollars or limitation in adequate staff to serve all eligible individuals. Notwithstanding these priority categories, DCRSA will continue to provide pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities, because these services are made available to students who are potentially eligible for services. However, students who require vocational rehabilitation services, in addition to pre-employment transition services, will receive those services based on the priority category into which they are assigned based on the determination made upon consideration for eligibility for VR services. In addition, DCRSA will provide services to people who require specific services or equipment in order to maintain employment, regardless of their priority category. This exception will be made for this individual service. People may receive these specific services only. If a person who receives this service requires other VR services, unrelated to those services or equipment necessary to maintain employment, they will be subject to the same order of selection as all other persons eligible for VR services, based on the priority category into which they are assigned. The agency will continue current outreach efforts, particularly those aimed at communities that were identified in the 2014 CSNA as underserved or unserved, and will continue on-going efforts to coordinate services with the State Education Agency, and all Local Education Agencies, in order to248conduct outreach and education for transition youth, their families, and school personnel regarding transition services. Description of Priority categories Priority Category I: An individual with a most significant disability is an individual who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits three or more functional capacities. (mobility, communication, self-care, self-direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance, or work skills) in terms of an employment outcome; whose vocational rehabilitation can be expected to require multiple vocational rehabilitation services over an extended period of time; and who also satisfies the requirements for Category II (directly below). Priority Category II: an individual with a significant disability is an individual who has a severe physical or mental impairment that seriously limits one or more functional capacity. (mobility, communication, self-care, self-direction, interpersonal skills, work tolerance, or work skills) in terms of an employment outcome; whose vocational rehabilitation can be expected to require multiple vocational rehabilitation services over an extended period of time; and who have one or more physical or mental disabilities resulting from amputation, arthritis, autism, blindness, burn injury, cancer, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, deafness, head injury, heart disease, hemiplegia, hemophilia, respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction, intellectual disability, mental illness, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, muscular-skeletal disorders, neurological disorders (including stroke and epilepsy), spinal cord conditions (including paraplegia and quadriplegia), sickle cell disease, specific learning disability, end-stage renal disease, or another disability or combination of disabilities determined on the basis of an assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs to cause comparable substantial functional limitation. Priority Category III: an individual with a physical or mental impairment which does not meet the criteria set forth in priority categories I and II; and whose disabilities constitute or result in a substantial impediment to employment; and who can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. Justification for order of selection Over the past three years, DCRSA has seen a consistent increase in the number of people receiving services, the cost of services, and related personnel costs, as the agency has addressed issues identified in the Administration's monitoring review in FY 2013 and the Comprehensive Statewide Needs Assessments published in May, 2013 and December, 2014. In addition, with the changes required by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, DCRSA has had to shift resources to ensure that it complies with required priorities in the Act, including increasing services to transition youth, including the provision of pre-employment transition services to students with disabilities, and focusing even more on the provision of services for people with most significant disabilities to help them find competitive, integrated employment. Due to these changes we have seen significant increases in the number of assessments completed. This has been necessary because of the increase in the number of transition youth249served, many of whom apply for services with a current IEP, but not current documentation of a disability that creates a substantial impediment to employment. From FY 2014 to FY 2015 there was a 13% increase in the number of assessments completed - reflecting both the increase in the number of assessments to determine eligibility and career assessments provided as a PETS services; we expect to see this number continue to increase as we continue our efforts to provide PETS services to all potentially eligible students with disabilities. The cost of providing supported employment services almost doubled from FY 2014 to FY 2015, from approximately $225,000 in FY 2014 to approximately $430,000 in FY 2015. Lastly, the number of people for whom DCRSA is providing support to attend college or university increased by 27%, from 438 in FY 2014 to 558 in FY 2015. Fortunately, due to changes in the regulations in FY 2015, the cost of providing this service decreased modestly, as the agency limited the amount of support provided to students who chose to attend school out of state when there is an in-state alternative; the decrease in overall cost for this service from FY 2014 to FY 2015 was 1%, from $3.71 million to $3.675 million. In addition, the Administration has engaged in outreach efforts in order to ensure that services are being offered to individuals and communities identified as unserved or underserved in the 2013 and 2014 CSNAs. These populations include people who are Hispanic, Asian and Ethiopian; people who are Blind; and residents of Wards 7 and 8. This outreach has been done primarily through agreements with other government agencies (including the workforce agency) and private service providers in the community, to accept applications and see clients in the partner agency locations. These efforts resulted in significant increases in the number of new referrals in FY 2014; and this increased number has been maintained throughout FY 2015. The decision to close Priority Categories will be based on availability of funds, projected number and types of referrals; and, the number of eligible individuals and counselor caseloads. If the Order of Selection is implemented, RSA will work with the SRC to develop an effective information and referral system to ensure that individuals with disabilities who do not meet the agency's order of selection criteria have access to information, referrals, and guidance so that they can access other workforce development support. Service and outcome goals and the time within which the goals will be achieved In FY 2014, the agency had a significant increase in referrals, both to general VR, as well as transition services. The increased number of transition youth in particular affects the cost per client because of the high current costs paid by the administration for post-secondary education and the number of transition applicants that require updated evaluations (changes to IDEA has resulted in schools in the District not being required to update evaluations for students with disabilities once they enter the special education system. Therefore many referrals from the school system have evaluations that do not reflect the applicant's current functioning). While the referrals have not continued to increase, the rate has remained stable at a rate approximately 65% higher than the referrals received in FY 2012. In addition, the agency has seen a significant increase in the cost of providing assistive technology services, particularly to consumers who are blind. Consistent with the recommendations from the CSNA completed in 2014, the administration has increased outreach and is providing more services to people who are blind.250In addition, with the new requirements under WIOA, to reserve 15% of the grant funds and expend this exclusively on pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities has created additional budget pressure. In FY 2014, the agency began expanding outreach to transition students, with a goal of beginning to work with students in their final two years of school. However, this work consisted primarily in planning for post-secondary services. The agency is now providing services to students in school. The expected cost of this is approximately $1.5 million, as the agency already had assigned VR counselors who were providing some pre-employment transition services. Fortunately, the agency has received an increased local fund allocation in FY 2016 of $1.75 million to reduce the budget pressure created by the new requirement to provide pre- employment transition services. Based on the increased outreach and the continued high rate of referrals, we anticipate serving approximately 8400 in FY 2016. There are currently approximately 4600 current, active VR cases. From 2012 through 2014, the agency saw consistent increases in new referrals, with a leveling off in 2015. (Referrals in 2012 approximately 2300; 2013 - app. 3100; 2014 - app. 4000; 2015 - app. 3800). We expect that this higher rate will continue in 2016. The following chart shows the estimated number of individuals to be served in the state fiscal year 2016 by priority category and the estimated number of successful employment outcomes (Status 26 closures). In addition, even if the agency is required to impose a waiting list for services, we will still be required to reserve and expend funds for pre-employment transition services, as these services are required to be provided to students with disabilities who are eligible or potentially eligible for VR services. Therefore, this service would continue regardless of the VR status of individual students. Number to be Served Employment Outcomes (Status 26 Closures) Projected Cost of Services Priority Category I 4950 (clients served) 400 (successful outcomes) - $11,167,200 Priority Category II 3110 (clients served) 250 (successful outcomes) - $6,863,770 Priority Category III 340 (clients serviced) 25 (successful outcomes) - $426,020 Total Costs Total 26 Closures 9000 (clients served) 675 (successful outcomes) -$18,456,990 Table 25: Projected Service Estimates Priority CategoryNumber of individuals to beEstimated number of individualsEstimated number of individualsTime within which goals are to be achievedCost of services251served who will exit with employment after receiving serviceswho will exit without employment after receiving services 1 4,950 400 285 07/01/2016 - 06/30/2017 $11,167,200 2 3,110 250 07/01/2016 340 25 20 07/01/2016 - 06/30/2017 $426, 020 (n) Goals and Plans for Distribution of title VI Funds. (1) Specify the State's goals and priorities for funds received under section 603 of the Rehabilitation Act for the provision of supported employment services. In addition to the goals, objectives, and order of selection previously addressed, the District has established goals and priorities for the funds allotted for the provision of supported employment services. In FY 2015, DCRSA significantly strengthened its partnerships with the Developmental Disability Administration (DDA) of the Department of Disability Services, which supports people with intellectual disabilities and with the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), which supports people with serious mental illness (SMI) and serious emotional disturbance. As described elsewhere in this plan, this improved coordination has included development of a protocol with DDA regarding the referral process from DDA to DCRSA for VR services, the referral from DCRSA to DDA for extended supported employment services through the Health and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver, and coordination of services between the administrations when a person is being supported by both administrations. In addition, there has been improved coordination with DBH, including the development of a Memorandum of Agreement regarding referral, coordination of services and training of staff, as well as a significant expansion in the number of Evidence Based Supported Employment (EBSE) community rehabilitation providers, from six providers in FY 2014 to ten providers in FY 2015. We expect a very significant increase in the number of people referred by DDA and DBH, as well as, a significant increase in successful employment outcomes. Due to the very significant increase, we expect that the funds received under section 603 will only be sufficient to cover the cost of serving seventy people referred from DBH. We plan to serve the remaining expected 380 referred from DBH and expected 200 referred from DDA through the use of approximately $1.5 million in 110 funds. (2) Describe the activities to be conducted, with funds reserved pursuant to section 603(d), for youth with the most significant disabilities, including: (A) The provision of extended services for a period not to exceed 4 years; and252(B) How the State will leverage other public and private funds to increase resources for extended services and expanded supported employment opportunities for youth with the most significant disabilities. It is also imperative that the District describe how funds reserved for youth with significant disabilities will be utilized for extended services, as well as how the District will leverage public and private funds to extend and expand employment opportunities for these youth. The 603(d) funds reserved for youth will be used primarily to support youth who participate in Project Search. The agency currently supports three Project Search sites, at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Institutes of Health and Embassy Suites Hotel. These sites are able to serve up to twenty youth, this currently includes youth who have completed the Project Search program year but have not yet transitioned to an extended service provider. The funds available to support youth in extended services are very helpful in the District, as the District's developmental disability agency supports only persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). There is currently no Medicaid waiver support for extended services for people with developmental disabilities, other than ID. Therefore, DCRSA will use extended services to support youth with developmental disabilities (typically youth with autism spectrum disorder) as they achieve stabilization in employment, as defined by the agency's supported employment policy, but continue to require ongoing supports to be successful in employment. The agency will also rely on natural supports and ticket to work support in developing long-term planning with youth with disabilities, to ensure comprehensive supports are in place to support youth who transition from supported employment with the VR program. In addition to the supports provided to youth in Project Search, DCRSA will continue to provide supported employment support to youth who participate in work experience, as a pre-employment transition service and to youth who are exiting school and entering the job market. The amount required to fund supported employment for Project Search will exhaust the funds DCRSA receives through the Title VI grant. Therefore, the additional supported employment provided will be funded through the use of 110 funds. We expect expenditures for supported employment to youth, not covered by the Title VI grant to be approximately $375,000 per year. (o) State's Strategies. Describe the required strategies and how the agency will use these strategies to achieve its goals and priorities, support innovation and expansion activities, and overcome any barriers to accessing the VR and the Supported Employment programs (See sections 101(a)(15)(D) and (18)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and section 427 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA)): (1) The methods to be used to expand and improve services to individuals with disabilities. Having expressed the goals, priority of service, and funding for VR services, it is important for the District to describe the strategies it will employ to achieve such goals. DCRSA has engaged in a number of efforts over the past three years to expand and improve the services it provides to253people with disabilities in the District of Columbia. Based on results from the 2013 CSNA, the agency expanded and directed its outreach activities in order to reach people who were identified as unserved and underserved in the state. Unserved and underserved included people who are blind, people of Hispanic and Asian origin and Ethiopians. The 2013 CSNA had identified wards 7 and 8 as underserved; however, in the 2014 CSNA, people in these wards of the city were no longer identified as underserved, as they now represent approximately 50% of the people served by DCRSA. However, these are two wards of the city that have much higher rates of unemployment and less access to services. Therefore, DCRSA continues its efforts to further expand outreach to these wards in order to ensure that services are accessible in these wards where the services are most needed. In addition, in order to address concerns about the unserved and underserved groups, a number of new outreach sites were established. These included Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind, the Ethiopian Community Center and the Mayor's Office of Asian and Pacific Island Affairs. In addition, services are provided in the American Jobs Center; located in the same building with the Mayor's Office of Latino Affairs, and a new agreement was established in FY 2014, to locate a counselor at Unity Health Care, in Upper Cardozo. These outreach efforts provide easier access to applicants and clients to complete applications and see a VR counselor. As indicated in the CSPD, the agency is very concerned about the current lack of Spanish speaking counselors. Therefore, there is a concerted recruitment effort to hire qualified VR Specialists who are bilingual in Spanish and English, as this is the largest minority group served by DCRSA (the majority of the people currently served by DCRSA are US born African Americans). In 2013 and 2014, the agency undertook a number of steps to improve compliance with federal requirements regarding timely determination of eligibility and timely completion of IPEs. Compliance with these measures improved considerably, and has been maintained at over 90% in both areas during all of FY 2015. In FY 2016, DCRSA has instituted new quality review protocols, to ensure high quality service provision. In addition, in FY 2016, the agency established a new position, a VR Specialist for Re-Engagement. This new position was created as the agency recognized the high number of people who lose contact with their counselor. This VR Specialist will be referred people who have had no contact with a counselor for more than three months. She will attempt to engage the person and identify any barriers to continuing in services, determine their interest in returning to services and once services are re-established, refer them back to the VR Specialist for ongoing services. Beginning in program year 2016-2017, DCRSA will establish a mechanism for reaching out quarterly to people whose cases are closed successfully in order to check on their status in employment and remind them of the availability of supports that are available to assist them in retaining employment. The rehabilitation assistants in each VR unit will be responsible for sending notices quarterly, from the unit supervisor in order to identify any barriers to people continuing in employment early to ensure positive outcomes on the new WIOA performance measures related to post-closure employment.254DCRSA is engaged in a number of efforts with the state education agency, local education agencies and the Department of Employment Services in order to improve outcomes for transition youth. These efforts are described in more detail above in the section on Goals and Priorities. These efforts will primarily be funded using funds reserved for Pre-Employment Transition Services dollars, rather than innovation and expansion funds. DCRSA is working with the Center for Independent Living and the Statewide Independent Living Council to improve coordination of independent living and vocational rehabilitation services. The need for improved coordination between DCRSA and the CIL was identified as a need in the 2014 CSNA. In addition, the passage of WIOA, and the adoption of an additional IL core service, i.e., transition (from nursing home to the community and from secondary school to post-secondary education, training or employment), further highlights the need for closer collaboration. DCRSA will assist in supporting the resource plan of the SILC, in order to maximize the limited resources available in the District to meet IL needs of people with disabilities. Consistent with requirements under WIOA to assist people, particularly those with most significant disabilities to obtain competitive, integrated employment, DCRSA has significantly increased the level of supported employment services it is providing. In FY 2016, we have doubled the number of Evidence Based Supported Employment Providers that contract with the agency, and are in the process of finalizing an MOA with the Department of Behavioral Health to clarify the coordination between our agencies in provision of supported employment services to people with serious mental illness (SMI) and serious emotional disturbance (SED). In addition, we have improved coordination of services with the Developmental Disability Administration in the Department on Disability Services in order to increase the number of people with intellectual disabilities who receive supported employment services. We expect to see a significant increase in the number of people with SMI, SED or IDD who achieve successful employment outcomes. However, we also expect to see a very significant increase in the cost of providing supported employment services, far in excess of the amount provided in the supported employment grant. (2) How a broad range of assistive technology services and devices will be provided to individuals with disabilities at each stage of the rehabilitation process and on a statewide basis. Expanding upon the strategies listed above, the District has also taken steps to assure the provision of assistive technology services and devices to individuals with disabilities. In FY 2013, DCRSA hired an Assistive Technology Specialist. This individual is available to all staff to consult regarding AT questions. In addition, the agency is purchasing the necessary resources to allow the AT specialist to conduct AT assessments on-site at DCRSA's office. In addition, to conducting assessments, the AT specialist also meets with individual clients when they have questions related to AT. Lastly, this individual serves as the DCRSA representative on the AT Community Advisory Board at ULS, the DC Assistive Technology grantee. DCRSA works closely with the AT Center at255University Legal Services. ULS conducts presentations at DCRSA all staff meetings at least once a year to advise VR Specialists about the services provided by the AT Center. The Director of the AT Center was appointed as a member of the State Rehabilitation Council in November 2015, and has been assisting in the development of the state plan. Aside from having its own AT specialist on staff, DCRSA also maintains a human care agreement with a private community based provider that conducts AT assessments. Lastly, the DCRSA AT specialist, as well as staff at the AT Center at ULS, have been providing technical assistance to the Department of Employment Services to conduct an assessment of current accessibility of all One Stop locations and provide recommendations for necessary accommodations to ensure accessibility services at the American Job Centers. DCRSA currently provides support to make the National Federation for the Blind Newsline available to District residents. Through a Memorandum of Understanding with DC Public Libraries, outreach and training on how to access this service is provided (funded as part of the State Plan for Independent Living). However, the license to make the Newsline available is funded by DCRA. In addition, the District funds the Washington Metropolitan Ear, in order to make local publications and many local events (e.g. live theatre) available to District residents who are blind or visually impaired. These funds are included in the budget of the Mayor's Office, in the Office of Disability Rights, and are transferred to DCRSA through an MOU. DCRSA currently uses those funds to ensure the availability of services through a Human Care Agreement with the Washington Metropolitan Ear. (3) The outreach procedures that will be used to identify and serve individuals with disabilities who are minorities, including those with the most significant disabilities, as well as those who have been unserved or underserved by the VR program. Additional VR strategies relate to outreach procedures to identify and serve eligible minorities, including those who have been unserved or underserved by the VR program. During FY 2013, DCRSA began aggressive efforts to increase outreach to individuals with disabilities, attempting to focus on unserved and underserved communities. As indicated above, the agency has established agreements with other government agencies and community based, non-profit agencies that are in communities or serve clients identified in our 2008 needs assessment as unserved or underserved (i.e., Wards 7 and 8 and individuals who are non-English speaking or limited English speaking).. Currently, the administration has agreements with agencies and is conducting intake interviews and seeing clients in 30 different offices across the city. The administration has focused on identifying agencies that represent unserved and underserved in locating new partner agencies, including Columbia Lighthouse for the Blind, Ethiopian Community Center and various health and community centers in wards 7 and 8. The administration continues to see significant increases in the number of new referrals as a result of these outreach efforts. DCRSA will track the referral numbers from each of the new referral sites in order to ensure that relationships are maintained256with those sites that result in increased referrals to DCRSA. In FY 2015, the agency was able to recruit a VR Specialist who is Ethiopian; she will work at the outreach sites targeting people who are Ethiopian. In addition, the agency is currently engaged in intensive efforts to recruit bilingual Spanish/English staff to ensure that language appropriate services are available to people whose primary language is Spanish and are Non-English Proficient or Limited English Proficient. Pending our ability to hire bi-lingual staff, the agency relies on the Language Line, which provides interpretation via telephone. This service is available to all languages. In addition, the agency currently has staff who are fluent in ASL, including both Deaf and hearing staff; including two VR Specialists and two VR Supervisors. (4) The methods to be used to improve and expand VR services for students with disabilities, including the coordination of services designed to facilitate the transition of such students from school to postsecondary life (including the receipt of VR services, postsecondary education, employment, and pre employment transition services). VR services are also available for students with disabilities. The District has engaged in practices to improve, expand, and coordinate VR services to facilitate the transition of students from school to postsecondary life. DCRSA has engaged in a number of efforts with both the state education agency, the local education agencies and other non-education agencies providing services to youth, including the Child and Family Services Agency, which provides services to foster care youth, the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which provides services to youth in the Juvenile Justice System and the Department of Employment Services. The District has a current MOA with the State Education Agency, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). We have a draft, updated agreement, which addresses issues related to the provision of Pre-Employment Transition Services. We expect this agreement to be finalized during FY 2016. There is an updated MOA with the largest local education agency in the District, the DC Public School system. This MOA includes provisions regarding referrals for VR services, data sharing and agreements regarding the provision of pre-employment transition services. The District has a unique challenge with the number of Public Charter Schools, each of which is its own local education agency. DCRSA has been working to develop agreements with each of these schools. There are currently twenty two secondary schools and nine adult education schools that serve students with disabilities, under the age of 22. In order to assist in engaging with these schools, DCRSA established a contract with a community based agency that has experience in providing technical assistance around IDEA to the Public Charter Schools. This agency is assisting in engaging with each of the schools, and in developing plans for the provision of PETS at each of the schools. In FY 2015, DCRSA worked with the Secondary Transition Community of Practice to create a summer institute, providing job readiness training and necessary supports to help students with most significant disabilities participate in the city's summer youth employment program. In its first257summer, the program provided support to 22 students. In FY 2016, we expect to have 50 program participants. DCRSA is also working closely with DOES in order to ensure that students with disabilities have access to the summer youth employment program, and that we are able to provide any necessary supports, including supported employment services, in a timely manner, to ensure the success of students in their summer work experience. In the summer of 2015, students with disabilities were represented in the summer youth employment services at about the same rate that these students are represented in the school system, i.e., 12% of program participants were students with disabilities. DCRSA is working closely with DOES in order to identify students who have accommodation needs so that supports can be in place on day one of the student's summer work experience. DCRSA will also participate in all DOES summer youth employment orientations, for program participants and businesses, in order to provide information about workplace accommodations and the availability of support services from DCRSA. DCRSA works with OSSE and other members of the Secondary Transition Community or Practice to provide an annual transition forum for transition students and their families. In FY 2016, this forum is expanding in size. We expect to serve approximately 400- 500 transition students. Workshops will be co-facilitated by youth and will cover a number of topics related to transition, including job readiness, preparing for post-secondary education, connecting to services after high school, availability of peer support networks, and information about public benefits. (5) If applicable, plans for establishing, developing, or improving community rehabilitation programs within the State. Additionally, the District of Columbia Rehabilitation Services Administration continues to add new Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRP) that partner with us to provide an array of vocational rehabilitation services to consumers and help improve community rehabilitation programs. As indicated above, the agency doubled the number of evidence based supported employment providers in FY 2015. Additional services available to our consumer through the Human Care agreements include job readiness services, trial work experiences, job placement and benefits analysis and planning. The human care providers are now working collaboratively with the agency's Business Relations Unit to provide job readiness training and supports to our consumers, and to link consumers to potential employers. The Administration has two staff who work as provider relations specialists, who are responsible for supporting the network of approved CRPs. In addition, DCRSA has two additional staff who serve as quality assurance monitors to identify needs, and maintain and improve their quality. The Administration provides joint training with our Human Care Agreement CRP partners, to ensure that our collaboration yields the desired results in supported employment, job placement, and career assessment services and increased employment outcomes for consumers, particularly those with developmental disabilities and chronic mental illness. This happens, in part, through monthly meetings in addition to other training.258In FY 2015, DCRSA established new agreements with all job placement and supported employment providers. These are performance based agreements. Some changes were made in the payment structure in order more closely align payment to the providers with successful employment placements. In addition, we added payment support to supported employment providers to provide Discovery Assessments and Customized Employment. The District is also currently participating in the Employment First State Leadership Mentoring Program. As part of the technical assistance that will be provided through this program, technical assistance is being provided to some of our community rehabilitation providers. In addition, our counselors will receive training on how to better engage with providers in partnership to help people with most significant disabilities achieve employment outcomes. (6) Strategies to improve the performance of the State with respect to the performance accountability measures under section 116 of WIOA. As for strategies to improve the District's performance in relation to VR performance and accountability measures, it is important to note that the performance measures for the VR program will be changing with the introduction of WIOA. In Section (I)(3)(B) above, the District described its performance accountability measures for WIOA Section 116. Because all of these measures are new, DCRSA is proposing to use the first two years to collect sufficient data on the new measures in order to develop realistic goals to implement as the new performance standards. In order to prepare for these new measures, the administration is taking a number of steps, including: working with the agency that provides the electronic case management system to ensure that we are capturing all data we are required to report; working with the other workforce agencies in the state to ensure that all measures have a common definition; improving monitoring of progress in training and education programs in order to provide accurate information on performance regarding completion of training and measureable skills gains, and to obtain more complete data about the performance of existing training providers to assist in improved informed choice of providers and improved outcomes for clients; and establishing new protocols for following up with clients post- closure to check on their progress and provide information about availability of ongoing services. The administration has also taken the following steps to improve performance on the standards that existed prior to the passage of WIOA. The administration continues to track these measures and currently uses many of these measures in its performance measures for its City Plan. Standard I Indicator 1.1 Annual Change in Employment Outcomes: the difference in the number of individuals exiting the VR program who achieved an employment outcome during the current performance period as compared to the previous performance period. DCRSA continues to perform well in this Standard. In FY 2015, the performance goal was 644 successful closures; the agency achieved 670 successful closures. The agency has employed the following strategies to improve its performance on this indicator: Strategy 1: Increase counselor and client participation in activities sponsored by DCRSA's Business Relations Unit including: \u00b7 Monthly Job Readiness Workshops,259Monthly Employer/Industry Spotlights, Quarterly Career Fairs. Strategy 2: Strengthen collaboration with the DC Department of Employment Services (DOES), expand the number of days that a VR specialist is located at American Jobs Center sites. Require all VR applicants to register with American Jobs Centers at time of VR application. Strategy 3: Continue to expand the number and types of employers participating in the Project Search program, enabling transition-aged students the opportunity to gain valuable work experience while receiving on-the-job support. In school year 2015-16, DCRSA established a new Project Search site at a local hotel, Embassy Suites. This is a particularly positive development as work in the hospitality industry is one of the growth industries in the District. Strategy 4: Coordinate with the Department on Disability Services Ticket to Work program to ensure that eligible ticket holders are referred to ticket agencies for post-closure follow on support services. Indicator 1.2 Percent of Employment Outcomes: the percentage of individuals exiting the program who have achieved an employment outcome after receiving services. Strategy 1: Adopt and implement an enhanced communication policy ensuring counselors communicate at least monthly with service providers ensuring services are delivered in accordance with established contract/agreement; Monitor to ensure that counselors are maintaining regular contact directly with clients to monitor progress. Conduct periodic site visits to CRPs and other training programs Strategy 2: Host quarterly Provider Fairs to provide counselors and clients the opportunity to meet and \"interview\" providers face to face; Strategy 3: In FY 2016, DCRSA established a new position, VR Specialist for Re-Engagement. This person is responsible for reaching out to people with whom a counselor has not had contact for three months or more. This person then engages with the person to identify barriers to continuing with VR services and attempts to re-engage the person in services in order to work toward a successful outcome. Indicator 1.3 Competitive Employment Outcomes: the percentage of individuals who exit the VR program in employment in integrated settings with hourly rate of earnings equivalent to at least the federal or state minimum wage rate, whichever is higher. Strategy 1: Continue quarterly CRP meetings to provide a forum for discussions and to ensure all providers are aware of the agency's policies, regulations and expectations governing the provision of services. Strategy 2: Continue to develop the agency's Employment First initiative, a concept designed to facilitate the full inclusion of people with the most significant disabilities in the workplace and community. Indicator 1.4 Significance of Disability: reflects the significance of disability served by the VR agency and is the percentage of those identified in Indicator 1.3 who have significant disabilities. Strategy 1: continue to identify new programs and services to ensure persons with most significant disabilities receive appropriate and quality services leading to successful employment outcomes. DCRSA and DCDDA developed a protocol for coordination of services for persons supported by both administrations (i.e., people with intellectual disabilities who are interested in seeking employment), continue implementation of this protocol and increase the number of persons with intellectual disabilities services by the administration and successfully placed in employment; and in FY 2015, DCRSA improved its coordination with the Department of Behavioral Health to provide Evidence Based Supported Employment (EBSE) Services to people with serious mental illness (SMI) or serious emotional disturbance (SED); the agencies have260drafted an MOA, which will be final in FY 2016. This increased coordination has also included the doubling of EBSE providers that contract with DCRSA, significantly increasing our capacity to provide for this population. Indicator 1.5 Earnings Ratio: indicates that VR consumers who achieved competitive outcomes are earning, on the average, at least 52 cents for every dollar earned hourly by all employed individuals in the state; and Strategy 1: Provide job seekers with up-to-date information on employment trends in the District; Strategy 2: Connect with local colleges and universities to disseminate to students with disabilities information related to the agency's services; Strategy 3: Encourage enrollment in short-term training/certificate Workforce Development programs offered by community colleges the DC metropolitan area; Strategy 4: Ensure counselors serving transition- aged youth provide timely services to help students develop career goals, and achieve employment and self-sufficiency; Develop incentives in contracts with CRPs to reward placement in jobs that meet this standard. Indicator 1.6 Self-Support: for those identified in Indicator 1.3, the difference in the percentage of individuals who at program entry reported their income as the largest single source of support, and the percentage that reported their personal income as the largest single source of support at program exit. Strategy 1: Increase the number of SSI/DI recipients referred for Benefits Counseling; Strategy 2: Encourage enrollment in short-term training/certificate Workforce Development programs offered by community colleges the DC metropolitan area. Strategy 3: Continue to develop the agency's Employment First initiative, a concept designed to facilitate the full inclusion of people with the most significant disabilities in the workplace and community. Strategy 4: Increase the use of Customized Employment enabling persons with significant disabilities the opportunity to achieve successful employment outcomes. (7) Strategies for assisting other components of the statewide workforce development system in assisting individuals with disabilities. In combination to the above listed strategies to improve VR performance accountability measures, the District has also developed strategies for coordinating with other portions of the workforce development system to assist individuals with disabilities. The Deputy Director for the Department on Disability Services - Rehabilitation Services Administration represents the agency on the Workforce Investment Council. In this capacity, in FY 2015, he served on two work groups that seek to improve the coordination and quality of services provided through the workforce investment system. The two work groups include one that is working on reviewing the certification process for the American Jobs Centers in the District, and on the American Job Center Sub-Committee, which began meeting monthly in the summer of 2014, in order to discuss how to coordinate services among core service providers at the American Job Centers. The District has four American Jobs Centers. The facility located in Southeast Washington, serving wards 7 and 8, is the first one going through the certification process. All agencies that provide services through this center are members of the work group and the AJC sub-committee. In FY 2015, DCRSA increased its261presence at the American Job Centers, increasing the number of days each week that DCRSA provides services at the two of the four American Jobs Center, from one day per week to five days per week. The agency hopes to be in all four AJCs five days per week by the end of FY 2015, however, there are currently space and resource limitations on the part of the AJC operator. We expect these issues should be resolved so that we can ensure full integration of services for people with disabilities into all four AJCs. A new Workforce Investment Council was sworn in during FY 2015, and a new Chair was selected by the Mayor in December, 2015. This new WIC will be establishing its committees in its January meeting. At this time, there is only one official committee of the WIC, i.e., the Executive Committee. However, the WIC staff has recommended establishment of a committee to address the needs of people with disabilities and a committee to address the workforce needs of youth. In FY 2014, the prior Mayor issued an Order requiring the WIC to develop a strategic plan for the development of Career Pathways, which would initially focus on adults with low literacy. The Deputy Director of DDS/RSA served on the Career Pathways Task Force and assisted in the development of this strategic plan. Many of the discussions related to the Career Pathways Strategic Plan are also informing the Unified Workforce Development State Plan. (8) How the agency's strategies will be used to: (A) Achieve goals and priorities by the State, consistent with the comprehensive needs assessment; All previously mentioned strategies will allow the District to achieve the goals and priorities consistent with the comprehensive needs assessment. The Department on Disability Services has a robust performance management system that promotes ongoing strategic planning and close oversight of DCRSA's progress in achieving the goals and priorities identified in the State Plan and the CSNA. These goals are also aligned with goals established in the agency's City Plan. DDS has a monthly performance review meeting, which reviews current agency performance, measuring performance against goals established in the State and City Plans. On a quarterly basis, these reviews include an evaluation of DCRSA's progress on all strategies and initiatives identified in each plan. In addition, within DCRSA there are monthly senior staff meetings at which each manager is responsible for reporting on progress on performance and initiatives. In order to monitor ongoing performance, each supervisor utilizes the agency's electronic case management query system to monitor the progress of all cases within their unit. The Quality Assurance and Compliance (QA) unit conducts quarterly consumer satisfaction surveys. In addition, in FY 2016, DCRSA instituted a new quality review system, which requires each supervisor and QA monitors to conduct quality review of a number of cases (depending on the VR Specialists current performance) from each VR Specialists case load. The results of these surveys will be used to guide future training or identify the need for policy or procedure updates. As any new policy is introduced, training is provided for all staff, and a QA review of compliance with the new training is262provided. Consistent with the recommendations regarding outreach to immigrant communities from Ethiopia and Latin America, the HR department of DDS has been engaged in an aggressive outreach plan to hire Spanish speaking VR Specialists. The agency hired an Amharic speaking VR Specialist in FY 2015. These staff will be assigned to work in community based agencies that serve people from Ethiopia or Latin America, in order to improve the agency's outreach to these communities. (B) Support innovation and expansion activities; and Additionally, the previously mentioned strategies will allow the District to innovate and expand VR services. One way to accomplish this is to have DCRSA fully implement the Community Rehabilitation Provider Module in its case management system. This will improve coordination of services with CRPs, improving the efficiency of referrals, receipt of progress reports and payments for services. It will also allow the agency to collect reliable, complete data on CRP performance in order to be able to publish this information on the agency web site to be made available for consumers to use in making informed decisions regarding selection of Job Placement and Supported Employment providers. DCRSA will take steps to address the high number of people whose cases are closed unsuccessfully due to loss of contact and to improve continued success for people whose cases are closed successfully through assigning new responsibilities to staff in outreach to current clients with whom the agency has lost contact and following up with people whose cases close successfully to monitor continued progress and remind them of the availability of post-employment supports. In FY 2016, DCRSA is assigning a VR Specialist to conduct outreach. She will be assigned to work with people with whom other VR Specialists have not had contact for at least three months. She will reach out to the individuals in an attempt to determine what barriers exist to the person continuing in services. She will then work to remove these barriers and, when the person is available to continue in VR services, refer the case back to the assigned VR specialist for ongoing work. As cases close successfully, the assigned RA in each unit will maintain a list of people whose cases have closed and contact the individuals quarterly, through a letter developed by DCRSA, to check on the person's progress and remind them of the availability of post- employment services. (C) Overcome identified barriers relating to equitable access to and participation of individuals with disabilities in the State VR Services Program and the State Supported Employment Services Program.263The District also took into account within their VR strategies ways to overcome barriers to equitable access and participation for eligible individuals. Since FY 2013, DCRSA has been working on improving outreach in order to overcome barriers to access to VR services. The administration increased from 4 to 27 outreach sites in FY 2013, and further increased to 30 in FY 2014. In FY 2015, DCRSA expanded the number of days we have counselors available at the AJCs. Our plan was to expand to five days per week in all AJCs, however, there are currently space and resource issues with being able to do so in two of the four facilities. We expect over the first program year (i.e. 2016-17) to have VR Specialists in all four AJCs, five days per week. The administration is now ensuring that it targets these outreach efforts to reach populations identified in the FY 2013 and FY 2014 CSNAs as unserved or underserved in the District. In addition, the administration is using its electronic case management system to monitor the number of people seen at each outreach site to ensure that the administration's resources are being used efficiently. DCRSA has made considerable progress in the past year in expanding supported employment services to people with intellectual disabilities (ID) and people with serious mental illness (SMI) or serious emotional disturbance (SED) through improved coordination with the Developmental Disability Administration at DDS and the Department of Behavioral Health, the two entities responsible for managing extended supported employment services. (p) Evaluation and Reports of Progress: VR and Supported Employment Goals. Describe: (1) An evaluation of the extent to which the VR program goals described in the approved VR services portion of the Unified or Unified State Plan for the most recently completed program year were achieved. The evaluation must: (A) Identify the strategies that contributed to the achievement of the goals. (B) Describe the factors that impeded the achievement of the goals and priorities. In order to be held accountable for ensuring that the above mentioned strategies are being implemented and VR goals are being met, it is important to have a system tin place to evaluate and report on the progress being made. The District proposed the following related to evaluation and goal attainment: Goal 1: Increase the quantity and quality of employment outcomes DCRSA was successful in increasing the number of employment outcomes, and has made considerable progress in improving the quality of the employment outcomes. In FY 2014, DCRSA had 643 successful closures, in FY 2015, the administration achieved 670 successful closures. Over the past three years, we have seen consistent improvement in the number of successful closures, going from 501 in FY 2012, to 620 in FY 13, up to 670 this fiscal year. This is a higher number of successful closures than the agency has achieved in a number of years. In terms of quality of outcomes, DCRSA has finally seen significant improvement in entry level wages for people who achieved employment during the fiscal year. The average entry level wages in FY 2014, were $12.06 per hour. This increased to $13.56 in FY 2015. A number of strategies264contributed to the administration's success in increasing the number of successful closures. The administration significantly expanded its outreach efforts, expanding to provide services at 30 different locations across the city. In addition, changes were made to the administration's intake process to minimize barriers to applicants entering the VR process. The administration expanded it Business Relations Unit, and refocused its efforts on supporting job placement. Lastly, the administration hired external monitors, who provide monitoring and technical assistance to contract provider agencies. In FY 2014, the administration is focusing more on quality, developing a training schedule with the GW Technical Assistance and Continuing Education Center, to improve the quality and consistency of services provided. The administration has also been reviewing and beginning to revise all policies and procedures, and providing training to staff on any changes, to ensure that services are consistent with District and federal regulations. Goal 2: Improve the efficiency of RSA operations The Administration has completed the implementation of the new case management system, which enables efficient tracking of cases throughout the VR process to improve timeliness of services. The implementation of the Quality Assurance component of DCRSA has enabled the state vocational rehabilitation Administration to effectively monitor case compliance to federal performance indicators. The Administration made significant progress in updating policies and procedures during FY 2015, updating policies, procedures and protocols in the following areas: Postsecondary Education and Training Policy and Procedure, Maintenance Policy, Policy Regarding Rates of Payment for VR Services, Self-Employment Policy and Procedures, Protocol on Quality and Supervisory Case Review, Eligibility Determination Extension Protocol, and Trial Work Protocol. As each new policy, procedure or protocol was implemented, training was provided to all relevant staff on implementation, and subsequent quality review regarding implementation has been conducted. The agency made the changes in its system in order to implement the Community Rehabilitation Module in its case management system. We expect this change to improve coordination of services between VR Specialists and staff providing direct services at the CRPs. The agency was not able to fully implement this module during the fiscal year, due to competing fiscal demands, some of the necessary changes to the case management system could not be completed until FY 2016. Although this was not completed in FY 2015, to date in FY 2016, almost all providers are now in the case management system and are using the new system. Training has been provided to all but three of the CRP agency's staff. The agency needed for the CRP module to be implemented in order to fully implement a vendor report card process to provide information and support to RSA customers in exercising informed choice when selecting vendors and providers for the provision of vocational rehabilitation services under the Authority of Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as Amended in 1998; CFR Section 361.52. We expect to have thorough accurate data to provide to consumers during FY 2016, and to publish performance data. Over the past three years, the administration has made significant progress in improving the efficiency of operations in terms of compliance with federal standards related to timeliness of determining eligibility and developing Individualized Plans for Employment. In FY 2013, the administration determined eligibility within sixty days 83% of the time, increased from 68% in FY 2012; and timely developed IPEs 92% of the time, compared with 80% of the time in FY 2012. In FY 2015, both of DCRSA performed at 95% for both of these measures. To ensure continuous265improvement, the DCRSA Office of Quality Assurance and Federal Compliance conducted quarterly caseload reviews on active (St.10-18) and closed (St. 26 and 28) cases. Unit supervisors monitor status of all cases weekly in order to ensure compliance. In addition, in FY 2016, DCRSA has instituted the Quality Review Protocol, to ensure that we are monitoring not only compliance, but quality of VR services provision. Goal 3: Transition - Expand and improve the quality of transition services and improve coordination with the state education agency and all local education agencies DCRSA continues to have success in coordinating with the largest local education agency, DC Public Schools (DCPS), which serves 55% of students with disabilities. In addition, the administration participates with the Secondary Transition Community of Practice, facilitated by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). Through coordination with DCPS, OSSE and the Department of Employment Services (DOES), DCRSA implemented a very successful Summer Institute for students with most significant disabilities participating in the Summer Youth Employment Program. Supports were provided to twenty two students, including a one week \"boot camp\" prior to the start of SYEP, in which the students learned soft skills necessary to be successful in their SYEP placements, and provision of supports throughout the summer, including travel training, supported employment, and weekly check-ins with the student and their supervisors. This program was so successful that it will be expanded to 50 students in the summer of 2016. DCRSA and DCPS is coordinating in the 2016 school year to implement pre-employment transition services at all DCPS comprehensive high schools. In addition, DCRSA is working with DCPS to provide paid work experience during the school year to students participating in the Career Academy at River Terrace (a high school for certificate track students) and for students participating in the career exploration courses at DCPS. In FY 2015, DCRSA provided supports for paid employment for 70 students in the Spring of 2015 in the career exploration course and placements in paid work experience related to the students' career choice from the Career Academy (i.e., health care, hospitality or horticulture) for 40 students in the Fall of 2015. In August, 2013, with technical assistance from the Department of Education, DCRSA finalized a Memorandum of Agreement with the state education agency (the Office of the State Superintendent for Education, OSSE). This MOA defines how outreach and intakes will be conducted; and describes how DCRSA will coordinate with all local education agencies. In the Spring of 2015, DCRSA updated this MOA to address implementation of PETS services for all District students with disabilities, attending DCPS, DC Public Charter Schools and non-public schools in the DC-Baltimore Metropolitan area. DCRSA has developed a very good working relationship with DCPS. This is part of a Memorandum of Agreement that was developed in 2011. This MOA was updated in FY 2015 to include coordination of services for the provision of PETS services. In addition, DCPS and DCRSA established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), providing funding (using PETS funds) to allow DCPS to hire workforce development coordinators to conduct job development in areas around each DC public school, to create paid work experiences for students, and to assist in the provision of job readiness training and provision of other PETS services to students in DC public schools. DCRSA continues to work closely with266School Talk, Inc. a local private non-profit education advocacy group. School Talk helped to facilitate interagency coordination of transition services, and helped DCRSA to develop outreach materials, including a Transition Tool Kit and outreach and orientation materials for school staff, youth and their families, is assisting in the development of a handbook for VR Specialists on the provision of transition services, provides an annual transition forum for students with disabilities and their families and coordinated the Summer Institute in FY 2015. DCRSA has been working to improve its collaboration with DC Public Charter Schools. In FY 2015, we contracted with a community based agency that has experience in working with the Public Charter Schools to assist in this coordination and in implementation of PETS services in Public Charter Schools. Due to issues related to contracting and procurement, we were not able to establish this contract until August, 2015, therefore, we hope to see improvement in the coordination of services with Public Charter Schools in FY 2016. OSSE has also been helping with improving this coordination. In September, 2015, OSSE held two training sessions for all Public Charter Special Education Staff and DCRSA transition staff, in order to provide information about transition provisions in IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act and WIOA, regarding the provision of PETS services. In addition, this provided an opportunity for VR Specialists and staff at their assigned schools to discuss how coordination would be handled at each school during the 2015-16 school year. OSSE monitoring staff are providing regular updates to DCRSA on the progress they observe in provision of transition services at the Public Charter Schools. Goal 4: Develop a Self-Employment/Entrepreneurship Program DCRSA was able to fully achieve this goal during FY 2015. Through close consultation with the SRC, DCRSA developed a Supported Employment Policy, held the necessary public hearing and finalized the policy. In addition, training was provided to all DCRSA staff on implementation of this policy. In addition to the training on the self-employment policy, DCRSA has provided training on PASS plans, which may support people with most significant disabilities who are interested in a self-employment goal. (2) An evaluation of the extent to which the Supported Employment program goals described in the Supported Employment Supplement for the most recent program year were achieved. The evaluation must: (A) Identify the strategies that contributed to the achievement of the goals. (B) Describe the factors that impeded the achievement of the goals and priorities. Similar to the section above, the District proposes the following to evaluate the extent to which the Supported Employment program goals were achieved, including strategies contributing to goal achievement and factors impeding goal achievement:267Goal 1: Provide continued support to six (6) mental health supported employment providers to increase successful employment outcomes for individuals with mental health disabilities The Administration will continue to support the Human Care Agreements with six (6) providers of mental health supported employment services to support staff at each site to assist in increased referrals to DDS/RSA and the development of placement and employment opportunities through supported employment. Goal 2: Implement improved procedures with DCDDA in order to ensure that more persons referred from DDA achieve a successful outcome. One VR counselor is being designated and assigned to work specifically with this population. This counselor will then develop relationships with DDA staff, in order to ensure an effective referral. In addition, this counselor will participate in all Employment First training, in order to be familiar with customized employment services available to DCRSA clients and participate in customized employment assessment and discovery training. DCRSA made a number of changes throughout FY 2015 because we were not achieving the identified goals. In the summer of 2015, DCRSA and the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) worked closely to make necessary changes. First, DCRSA identified one counselor to handle all existing Evidence Based Supported Employment cases. This significantly improved the coordination of services and timeliness of referrals and moving people from referral into supported employment services. Through the coordination with DBH, DCRSA also significantly expanded this program. There are now two VR Specialists specifically assigned to EBSE cases and one VR Specialist who is assigned 50% to these cases. These three VR Specialists attend staff meetings at each of the EBSE provider agencies. The staff at DBH, DCRSA and provider agencies meet monthly. With all of these changes, we expect to see results in FY 2016. DCRSA and DDA have similarly struggled with effective coordination of services. DCRSA has now assigned a VR supervisor to be responsible for the unit that provides supported employment services to people referred from DBH or DDA. This includes the three VR Specialists who work with DBH referrals and two VR Specialists to work with DDA referrals. This supervisor meets weekly with DDA supervisory staff and the VR Specialists to review the progress of all cases referred from DDA. We are finally beginning to see results from this as the number of people referred for supported employment has increased, but we have also been seeing substantive reports of progress from the provider agencies working with these individuals. We plan to institute regular provider meetings, like the ones currently occurring with the EBSE providers, in FY 2016. (3) The VR program's performance on the performance accountability indicators under section 116 of WIOA. DCRSA has not yet begun collecting data on its performance on the new performance accountability measures identified under section 116 of WIOA. DCRSA is currently working with268the Office of the State Superintendent of Education and the Department of Employment Services in order to establish necessary Memoranda of Agreement to collect the data necessary to report on these measures. (4) How the funds reserved for innovation and expansion (I&E) activities were utilized. The District is continually advancing in terms of the utilization of funds reserved for innovation and expansion efforts. Through the contract with School Talk, the administration is developing a client handbook, which will be available in English and Spanish. This will provide information about available services and the VR process. These handbooks will be available at DCRSA, as well as at partner agency sites in order to increase community awareness of VR services and how to access them. School Talk worked with agency staff during 2015 to begin drafting the handbook, which will be completed and printed during FY 2016. DCRSA staff time was allocated to the development of a new human care agreement with community rehabilitation programs providing job placement services to a more performance based contracting system in order to improve outcomes in quantity and quality of job placements, including incentives based on entry level wages, provision of services in the language of the consumer and achievement of SGA for people on SSI/SSDI. DCRSA translated its Transition Tool Kit and all other outreach materials to Spanish, and developed information cards regarding services in French, Korean, Vietnamese, Amharic, and Tegrinha. (q) Quality, Scope, and Extent of Supported Employment Services. Include the following: (1) The quality, scope, and extent of supported employment services to be provided to individuals with the most significant disabilities, including youth with the most significant disabilities. The District is continually taking steps to advance the quality, scope, and extent of supported employment services. Supported Employment services are available to any DCRSA client who is certified as having a most significant disability and for whom competitive employment has not traditionally occurred or has been interrupted or intermittent as a result of that disability, and for whom an appropriate plan for extended services can be developed. DCRSA has identified two primary populations that require the use of supported employment services: persons with serious mental illness (SMI) or serious emotional disturbance (SED) and persons with intellectual and other developmental disabilities. The community rehabilitation providers provide to the two populations supported employment services which include intake, assessment and job coaching. In addition, in new human care agreements issued in FY 2015, DCRSA included Discovery Assessment and Customized Employment as services in our supported employment agreements. Other consumers may require a job coach model for their initial placement but do not require the extended services269as provided under the provisions of supported employment services. Each provider provides individualized services to consumers. Their efforts are geared toward competitive placements in an integrated work environment. At times, a company or a government agency may hire several clients, but the clients are not placed within the same work area to ensure that they are in an integrated work setting. With their rehabilitation specialist's assistance, clients make informed choices to select their vocational goals. If a client chooses to change that goal during the supported employment process, their VR specialist assists and the new goal is implemented. Every effort is made to ensure clients are placed in jobs that are consistent with their interests and abilities. An \"any job will do\" attitude is never acceptable. Employment Specialists/Job Coaches spend valuable time with clients teaching them about the workplace's expectations and the required tasks, assuring also that they know who to ask when assistance is needed. Time is spent with the person on the worksite who is identified as the natural support person as well to ensure that they are comfortable and prepared to provide workplace support as needed. The person identified as the natural support completes training in techniques and strategies to assist the assigned consumer to complete tasks required and identify the areas in which prompting or feedback may be appropriate in order to assure accurate completion of all assigned work tasks. The client is also provided with the name and telephone number of the Employment Specialist/Job Coach in the event of questions or problems. The workplace supervisor also receives training in order to assure that, if the primary natural support person leaves, another person can be identified who is willing to accept that role. Contacts are made by the Employment Specialist/Job Coach with the consumer on an as-needed basis. Additional follow-up contacts are made each month with the supervisor to ensure problems are identified early in the employment process and consumers receive the assistance they need to maintain employment. The Employment Specialist/Job Coach also provides travel training as needed. The Employment Specialist/Job Coach makes certain that transportation funds are available to assist the consumer in his/her job retention as needed. Additionally, all decisions are discussed jointly by the committee and with the consumer. Issues are seldom presented to consumers by only one party to ensure consumers see the group as united toward their goal of employment. Supported Employment providers are monitored, as are all providers. Some visits are announced while some are unannounced. The services being provided are reviewed and a report is returned to the Administration's Vocational Rehabilitation Services Division that includes the monitors' observations regarding the program. Problems are discussed with the provider and, when necessary, a corrective action plan is developed and implemented. (2)The timing of transition to extended services. As for the timing and transition to extended services, in FY 2015, DCRSA finalized changes to its Supported Employment Policy, which clarified issues related to the timing of transition to extended services. For people who will receive extended services through the Home and Community Based270Waiver, when the person receiving supported employment job coaching services achieves stabilization in employment, which is defined as not requiring more than 20% of support hours during a work week, or having reached maximum benefit from services, a referral is made to the DDA service coordinator advising him or her that the person is ready for transfer to extended services, that the services through the VR program will end in 30 days, and the VR case will be closed 60 days later. This allows sufficient time for the service coordinator to get supported employment services approved through the HCBS waiver. VR services remain in place until the services are in place through the waiver, ideally 30 days after notice is provided. Once waiver services are in place, DCRSA maintains its case open for an additional 60 days in order to ensure that the person has transitioned successfully to extended services. For people who will receive services through the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), the agreement between DCRSA and DBH provides that the transition from services paid through VR to extended services funded through DBH occurs 90 days after placement. DCRSA provides support for the full 90 days after a person begins employment. If the person loses the job, the 90 days starts over in the new position.

Due to the input and suggestions received, as well as additional guidance released by the U.S. Department of Labor, we made some additions to the plan to provide greater transparency and clarity to the agreed upon strategies. These changes, though not substantive, are important in ensuring our plan is effective in moving our workforce system forward. Many of the comments received will also be useful in informing ongoing implementation efforts over the next four years. 1. Implementation of WIOA: Added specifics about our implementation process, priority areas, and how the public will be engaged. a. The WIC will convene a WIOA Implementation Work Group to track and oversee activities and system changes with its first meeting slated for April 2016. This work group will be made up of District agency leadership, employers, and members of the public. Progress of the WIOA Implementation work group will be made available to the public through meeting minutes posted on dcworks.dc.gov. b. Added a chart listing priorities of implementation in three phases, separated by goal area. c. Provided additional implementation information on data vault implementation, performance tracking, and youth services. d. Listed opportunities for stakeholders to contribute to the conversation on implementation (regular meetings, WIC email, etc.) 2.Career Pathways Innovation Fund: Included more specifics on how funding with be used. a. Remaining FY16 funding will be used to create a community of practice for all District adult basic education practitioners to take part in. The goal of this community is to provide training and professional development to ensure providers have the resources and ability to incorporate national best practices for adult learners to successfully enter career pathways. b. The FY17 funds will support career pathways partnerships in high-demand sectors with special attention to helping residents with low levels of literacy and barriers to employment. The grants made through these funds help398address workforce system strategies related to system alignment, sector strategies, and access to career pathways. 3. Business Engagement: Provided more details on business engagement and sector strategy efforts. a. Goal 3 on Sector Strategies/Alignment with Business Needs was updated to be more comprehensive as follows: The District's business community gains access to a broader pool of District residents with the skills necessary to meet their needs and advance within their organizations; and informs workforce investments and incentives that effectively match jobseekers with their needs. b. Additional content was included on improving coordination between agency business services teams to build a unified business services plan and business engagement efforts to ensure the District is makes informed workforce investments and offers business-driven training models. 4.Blended Funding: Provided more details on how federal and local funding will be leveraged to maximize resources. a. Examples include: Alignment of year-round youth services programming and connections to the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP); referrals of WIOA participants to locally funded training options, including UDC-CC course offerings; and alignment of adult education offerings funded through various sources. Public Engagement Feedback Summary WIC and partner agency staff compiled information from each public engagement session held during the 30-day public comment period during which the District's Draft State Plan was available for review (February 12 - March 14, 2016). The following is a summary of feedback received during those sessions. System Alignment: for youth and adults Data Vault: timeline, scope (agencies + data systems), intake + assessment, providers' inclusion in the development process and access to data, privacy/security, tracking performance -Coordination of Federal and local programs -eliminating duplication - how? Provider inclusion in the \"system\" generally Data integration; accessible by providers to help improve service \"No wrong door\" (see youth reengagement model); not clear in the plan how this will work A team that ensures alignment and liaises between agencies to ensure alignment/no duplication399Access CASAS testing is being used as a tool to pass/fail instead of a tool that can be a foundation for where to start an individualized training/learning goals Collocation in one-stops to address expanding access to disconnected residents is missing from the plan; strategy? Steps? Should include staff for returning citizens, TANF, and business services Need to increase awareness about workforce system and services (internally and externally); global list of programs/services available to the public; conducting outreach and information sessions for targeted populations (teams should include individuals of the population so they are relatable); going to where people are; navigators who know the system and can help navigate to ensure necessary outcome is reached; access/entry points for hardest to serve is missing from plan; include success stories in communications plan Information should be in non-technical terms so community can understand it Eligibility requirements shouldn't exclude the very people programs are designed to serve Staff (AJC specifically) customer service and cultural competency for dealing with various populations Eliminating ID requirement for immigrant population; supplement programs with locally funded dollars to support these individuals Older population not left out (unique population/needs); no longer interested in transitioning to post-secondary education or work Increased investment in entrepreneurship training Career Pathways: for youth and adults Timeline for creating Informing businesses on career pathways for their entry level positions(shake shack example of clear pathway from entry level positions to management) Requirements for training providers, including transitions services, government building capacity with providers? Innovation fund - next steps? How will funds compliment Workforce Intermediary funds Serving ESL learners (in general, not just career pathways) Expanding earn and learn opportunities that lead to full time employment and building capacity for providers; also used for more than just earning money (i.e., college credit, mentoring); Contextualized learning: many providers don't understand; adult literacy community disagrees that this method works at all levels; need to explore different models Support services, including mentoring and coaching for youth and returning citizens, persons with disabilities; motivation and life coaching; expanding eligibility for services to include employed people experiencing hardships; retention and follow-up services Assessing wages and benefits to ensure sustainable wages400Including demand-driven, vocational training in schools Map non-traditional skills to business needs; system to verify skills for those who do not have official credential (alternative credentialing) Offer concurrent training and education (adult literacy and workforce training); strategy, implementation and metrics missing for adult literacy Ongoing soft skills training (SOME has a good program); universal programming recognized by the business community First source: tax for employers who don't comply with agreements (funds go to workforce); incentives for businesses that include support services in agreements Expand focus beyond \"hardest to serve\" and entry-level, low wage positions Community college role should be better highlighted and pathway should start with CC (see NOVA model) Providers Making funding goes to providers tied to business needs; too many people with certificates that aren't tied to jobs Scorecards: provider involvement in development process, aligned with existing performance, timeline, Increased capacity for adult education providers - timeline? Constant feedback loop built into implementation (for providers and advocates); publicize progress and priorities on a regular basis; expand monthly meeting to include providers and other stakeholders Systemic way to notify partners/advocates of meetings and events; portal on dcworks Performance Processes for setting goals/benchmarks Tracking individuals without social security numbers Monitor programs and outcomes consistently; however, measures should be appropriately based on population being served (3rdgrade reading level vs. 8th grade reading level) or where they are on the educational continuum Performance should be tied to the plan goals (see vocational rehab section) Transparency; data/metrics/outcomes available to the public Funding Being more systematic about funding; current funding contradicting providers; blended funding (particularly under 2.3); we should not align local funding parameters to federal parameters if it results in denying access to residents in need of services (immigrant community) General Safety is a concern in Ward 7 (disengaged youth are committing crimes)401Public Comments Received The following public comments were received in writing during the 30-day public comment period during which the District's Draft State Plan was available for review (February 12 - March 14, 2016). Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen hopes that additional detail regarding the use of these funds in FY16 and FY17 will be made available. There is a clear need for front-line providers to access capacity building and innovation funds that will allow them to adjust to the new landscape shaped by WIOA and this state plan, as well as right-size their services to meet important, ambitious system-wide goals. Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen agrees that employment services for homeless individuals must be proactively delivered and purposefully designed so that they reduce barriers to accessing such services. The Homeward DC plan is an important document but leaves significant room for additional operational detail about its plan to provide employment services. Moving forward, we hope that the process of providing 'targeted job training and placement assistance' will be fleshed out in greater detail. Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen sees real value in the use of performance-based contracts and has demonstrated success in working with District on such contracts. However, performance-based funding is inherently retroactive and is meant to reward work already done with existing capacity -- not to build the capacity already identified as needed elsewhere in this plan. We would encourage the District to use multiple funding models to ensure the development of a broad and robust workforce training system that is built to meet the diverse needs of a significant number of District residents. Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen agrees that shared case management is a critical need and efforts to progress in this area must be a top priority as we build a system that is customer- driven. Integrating case management will be an extraordinarily complex challenge and we had hoped for more detail from the State Plan about how this goal will be achieved. A study of outside best practices is an understandable starting point, but we hope the District will pursue this effort with real urgency and focus. Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen shares this belief. However, we believe this emphasis on data will only achieve its full value if data is democratized and if it smartly informs action by government and providers. We would encourage District leaders to continue thinking through how data systems can be of the greatest utility for job seekers and frontline providers, not just oversight bodies and District employees. Will there be financial and402training resources available to help providers become savvier collectors and analyzers of data ourselves? Alexander Moore DC Central Kitchen concurs with these findings. We would also hope that as the District sets important quantitative goals and time-frames for placing 60,000 adult residents on career pathways in the near future, that there be a meaningful assessment of the current number of 'seats' at DC's training providers -- do we in fact have the capacity to support that many adult learners, and if not, how much capacity must we add? Alexander Moore While the source document from CSOSA does define 'employable', we would suggest clarifying that term here. Otherwise, it seems to write off 38% of our community's returning citizens from participating in the District's workforce without evident justification. First Tuesdays Business services is not the same as \"business engagement\" and the plan as a whole suffers from inattention to \"Sector Partnerships,\" truly putting businesses in a position to guide the workforce development system. One reason they are hassled by multiple agencies and partners is that the agencies and partners are not getting the information they need to succeed. True sector partnerships with a well-designed structure can help close the loops. First Tuesdays How will business engagement efforts be aligned between activities of DOES and the WIC? How will information from the business community be aligned with education/training for the 5 high growth sector? First Tuesdays How will the work of the Career Pathways Taskforce align with WIOA implementation? First Tuesdays Will efforts around business engagement include the identification of key credentials they look for jobs all along the career pathway for the 5 high growth industries? First Tuesdays We support this comment. Additionally, how will the certification program be modified or enhanced to accommodate the need for more I-BEST like models? First Tuesdays Additionally, what will be the process for setting performance goals as stated in the plan and going forward?403First Tuesdays Building onto the question, what is the timeline for building pathways for high demand occupations? And will the government prioritize which industry to begin this work? First Tuesdays What is the existing capacity of the training providers now as it relates to the occupations identified? What changes will need to be made to our ETPL list and when will those changes be implemented? First Tuesdays We support this comment. Has the government performed an assessment to determine how many potential employers within the 5 high growth industries are on board with providing \"earn while you learn\" opportunities to residents Seamus Kraft Customer feedback. Love it. What is the format you will be collecting the feedback in? Will it be open? DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Career Pathways are difficult for those with below 3rd grade proficiency and limited English proficiency. The plan notes that this is a special population, but few details are provided on what the trajectory look likes for these folks. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The draft plan requires adult ed providers to offer \"transition services towards the next step in the educational continuum.\" We agree that efforts to ensure residents are not falling through cracks between programs are essential, as are supportive services to help individuals overcome personal barriers or challenges to ensure they remain on a career pathway. There are examples of providers already doing this and getting results across the city, but coordinating and scaling-up these efforts is exactly what WIOA is intended to support. Additionally, more detail is needed regarding what \"providing transition services\" means in practice, how it will be tracked, and what support providers will receive to build capacity to meet this goal. Specifically, how will providers be trained and adequately funded to deliver these services? We would suggest that this is an ideal area for more dedicated funding for capacity-building and professional development to service provider; this is perhaps the best use for the Career Pathways Innovation Fund. Further, recognizing that such supportive services are critical to future job placement, and acknowledging that Title I funding is only sufficient to serve a limited number of participants, blended funding (for example, through interagency funding) between Title I and Title II allocations to support these activities makes sense. In relation to tracking the provision of transitional services, we would like more information about whether the data vault or other data programs have the capacity to record assessments of barriers, record of referrals for resources, or other important notes about service provision.404DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition We support making access easier and avoiding client duplication of effort in providing forms, etc. At the same time, we need to ensure that clients' rights to privacy and confidentiality are not compromised for the sake of sharing data. The list of sensitive information would include legal residency status, substance abuse history, history with the criminal justice system and/or incarceration, and mental health diagnoses. Clients need to be informed of exactly how their information will be used and with whom it will be shared. Additionally, because providers may serve residents that pose challenges to the data input requirements - such as workers in the informal economy - we have a few operational challenges that we would like to see addressed in the plan or future implementation documents, including: 1. What is the plan to track performance from providers serving residents without social security numbers? 2. How do we capture data for employment without relying fully on tax data? Will surveys continue to be an allowable way to report? DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The mention of these additional supports is very important, including counseling. We would like more specific information on the following: 1. Is there a plan to expand the case management services within providers? 2. How can the plan take into account these barriers and help providers better meet these needs DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition There is a desire for more training and capacity-building among providers, as well as possible funds to do so (i.e. the Career Pathways Innovation Fund.) We would like to see more information in the state plan about this. While the plan does make reference to training that has been provided through OSSE and DOES, often in the form of conferences or \"cohort programs\" like the Occupational Literacy Project, training alone is not the only way for programs to build capacity. Building capacity often requires programs to hire workers with specialized skills or to seek consultants from outside entities. Additionally, what is the timeline for this planning and for providers to increase capacity before performance measures come on line? DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The funding levels differ quite a bit between the titles. For example, Title I funding is $2.6 billion but Title II funding is only $700 million. Mindful that the two titles are more closely tied together in terms of performance outcomes, we would like to see specific strategies mentioned in the plan to address this discrepancy. For example, can any of the supportive or transitional services furnished by adult ed providers be funded through Title I funds? Could the funding from vocational rehab be aligned with support for405people with learning disabilities served by adult education providers? This is an area that we would like to see expounded upon in the plan or implementing documents. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The plan states that \"it is clear that the existing capacity is insufficient to meet the District's needs.\" Despite that fact, providers have heard from OSSE that grants will soon be re-competed and that process could result in fewer slots being funded (though at a higher rate per pupil). Consideration should be given to how providers\u2014who are already struggling to meet the demand\u2014can be supported to prepare for the additional requirements mandated by the plan, especially while also facing possible reductions or losses of funding. Given the momentum toward better system alignment, we urge the agencies involved to consider funding across agencies and/or better optimizing resources across the WIOA titles to support OSSE sub-grantees as they scale up to meet new requirements. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition We appreciate the need to align policies and promote efficiency between agencies. We understand that one way to achieve that will involve examining where there may be a duplication of procedures (ie proving residency, taking CASAS tests, and filling out forms at multiple agencies), but efforts to streamline or downsize can often also lead to cutting vital services. For example, if two locations are doing the same task, cutting one location could be considered eliminating duplication. However, closing one location would threaten access to a certain neighborhood or population. We recommend that any efforts to eliminate duplication of procedures should be sure to do so without threatening accessibility to services. More detail is also needed on a timeline. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition At the lowest levels, \"integrated education\" is often referred to as \"career awareness.\" What does OSSE mean when they talk about \"career awareness?\" Because working with low-level learners requires specialized interventions, it is important that career awareness delivered in DC reflects nationwide best practices. At the Hubb Center in Minnesota, for example, pre-bridge programs help lower-level learners explore industries where there are established career pathways programs by giving them lessons appropriate to their skill level that introduce concepts from the these target industries. How will it be measured? Will providers be involved in the development of a definition and protocols for these services? DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition We understand the desire to break down silos and ensure learners are being introduced to appropriate workforce information. We see this as a key element in an effective career pathways system. However, we would like to see more recognition in the plan that resources are very limited, especially for embedding workforce development into an ESL curriculum with those under a 6th grade education level. Some providers have noted that attempts to partner with workforce development providers are hindered by 1)406lack of programs in Spanish, and 2) lack of social security numbers of clients. As referenced in above comments, we would like to see greater detail on how these populations are accounted for in the state plan and objectives. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Even though Language Access is a right, in reality there is a mountain of evidence that shows that many services in the District (such as DMV, One-Stops, Insurance) are not consistently available in Spanish or other languages. How can this be better addressed in this plan and in implementation? This is of particular importance for providers who serve populations with diverse language and backgrounds, as well as for the tasks of transitional services and remediation of individual barriers to the next step on the career pathway. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Understanding that the federal regulations have not yet been published with the details for the core outcome metrics (such as the definition of \"measurable skill gains\"), providers are unclear how to prepare to meet the fast-approaching measures and a possible scorecard. This is particularly important to providers in how it relates to future funding. While the federal regulations are pending, we would like to see specific answers to the following addressed in the plan: 1. What is the government's vision for that scorecard? 2. Will providers have the opportunity to weigh in on its development? 3. What's the timeline for developing and implementing the scorecard? 4. Will efforts be made to align this scorecard with already existing performance measurements, so that the burden on providers doesn't increase? 5. Is there a potential for flexibility within the definitions and measures, such as \"measurable skills gains\" since the official federal definitions will likely be released later than state plans are submitted? 6. What data and research will be used to inform the measures? There is a large and growing body of evidence-based research that could be employed, including research done at NIH. Providers can be a helpful resource in identifying potential sources of data. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The state plan emphasizes a commitment and emphasis on working with UDC-CC. We are encouraged by this commitment and look forward to continuing to work with UDC. In the past, however, many English Language Learners have experienced difficulty due to inadequate ESL programming or immersion programs at UDC-CC. The lack of clarity in the administration's office surrounding whether undocumented students were permitted to enroll also resulted in confusion and potential learners being turned away. It is no secret that UDC-CC loses many students and millions of dollars to Montgomery College and NOVA as they have better ESL College and Career readiness programs. Our state plan should address these issues at UDC and outline how providers can better partner with local community colleges such as Montgomery College that have well established ESL programs DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition407We appreciate the role UDC-CC plays in our adult education and workforce development systems. A number of providers have established dual-enrollment agreements with UDC-CC and are continuing to build on those partnerships. Currently, however, adults without a high school credential and those with a high school credential but scores below the required CASAS levels cannot access UDC-CC programs. While we understand that some specific programs need requirements so that learners are not set up to fail, this blanket enrollment policy unnecessarily creates a divide where otherwise a clear transition pathway could exist. Furthermore, a number of the credentials that UDC-CC offers, including IC3, CFC, and A+ are also offered by community-based organizations like SOME CET, Academy of Hope, Four Walls, and Byte Back. Residents can enroll in these programs through CBOs without a high school credential or with lower CASAS scores than are required at UDC-CC. We understand that restrictions on federal funding mandate certain policies but we implore the District government to seek ways to leverage local dollars to open UDC-CC programs to residents who are ready and able to capitalize on the opportunity. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition The WIOA state plan lacks a definition of industry-recognized certificates or a process by which the state is going to determine how certificates are \"recognized.\" While we understand that the concept of an industry-recognized certificate is indistinct, we also recognize that in many industries (especially in Healthcare), a variety of certifications are available and the \"weight\" that each certification holds varies by employer and by region. If certifications are not well-researched, the District could fund programs which provide participants with certifications that will not enhance their employability. Currently, it is incumbent upon individual programs to conduct this research, typically through informal conversations with employers and Technical Advisory Committees (TAC). The WIOA state plan gives the District the opportunity to convene employers and ask these questions in a more rigorous way. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition \"Earn while you learn\" is a proven best practice, and we're pleased to see it leveraged in the plan. We would like to see more specifics on the plan for integrating this practice more fully across the system, especially as it relates to interagency coordination and work with employer partners. Our questions include: 1. What is the government's vision for these \"earn while you learn\" opportunities and who are the partners on the employer side? 2. How do we ensure these opportunities are also \"learn while you earn\" and lead to full time, self-sustaining employment in the future? 3. Given the high burden on government agencies that it takes to establish these positions, how do we ensure they are coordinated opportunities and not just one-offs? 4. What can be done to help to ensure that young adults, particularly those trying to enter the workforce after prison, jail, or juvenile detention, receive real-time feedback, mentoring and coaching when they are entering these opportunities?408DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Research consistently shows that when a parent learns, both the parent and the child benefit. Given wide support for Family Literacy as a best practice, we are concerned that OSSE is not emphasizing intergenerational strategies more in the plan. In particular, we are concerned that giving priority to learners who are in a position to not only earn their high school credential but also move to the next step within 12 months (as is required in the state plan) will divert funding from populations that are not prepared for the next step or have no interest in it, such as older adults who may have children or grandchildren in their care. We recognize the challenges of limited funding, but would like to see these concerns explicitly addressed in the plan. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition We would like to see the plan speak more to how these credit allocations were decided. Is there flexibility here to increase the number of credits for professional development modules to more than one? As it currently stands, professional development workshops are not counting towards the Master of Arts in Adult Education. If educators were able to do count these workshops as credit toward the Master's degree (and do so immediately) it would motivate those educators to complete the program. DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition We agree. We would like to see more information about the process for setting these benchmarks\u2014are they based on past performances, best practices, or otherwise? How are goals that are new to the system going to be derived, since we lack past performance? DC AFLC DC Adult and Family Literacy Coalition Both DOES and OSSE AFE programs have CASAS tests to determine prospective students' math and reading proficiency. Despite the fact that both agencies use these exam, differences in testing policy have slowed DOES participants' entry into OSSE AFE programs. DOES-funded programs and one stops have historically used form 130 as an entry assessment (despite the fact that CASAS certified trainers have advised against this in past years), and DOES programs often do not keep a record of student scores and test responses. Because it is often difficult to get records from DOES programs and because many AFE providers have abandoned form 130, many OSSE AFE programs have to re-test students who have taken form 130 or who cannot get their records from DOES. This slows enrollment into DOES programs. While OSSE AFE providers have begun delivering E CASAS tests for DOES and teaching best practices to DOES employees, inconsistencies still exist and continue to slow enrollment in AFE providers. Other states, such as Maryland, have developed revised CASAS testing policies as part of the process of implementing WIOA. Since under WIOA, OSSE, DCRSA, DOES, and UDC-CC WDLL will all be responsible for administering CASAS tests, these agencies need to work together to develop a common policy that will help \"streamline enrollment,\" a stated goal in the unified plan. These revised policies need to409provide guidance for administering CASAS tests to students with learning and other disabilities. Though extended testing time is recognized as a best practice for accommodating students with learning disabilities, current OSEE AFE testing policies mandate a 75 minute-per-test time limit for all students and do not give guidelines as to when extending testing time is appropriate. As a result, many students attempting to enter WIOA Title I and Title II programs may not achieve the test scores required for entry because they have not received appropriate accommodations. Since one of the stated goals of the Unified State Plan is to \"avoid unnecessary requirements that tend to screen out individuals with disabilities\" and guarantee that everyone can have equal access to workforce development and training, a revised CASAS testing policy must contain guidance around accommodations and this policy must be established and implemented consistently at all sites where CASAS tests are delivered. Ilana Boivie Will current providers be brought to the table as implementation moves forward, to provide input as to capacity building and programmatic changes? Ilana Boivie When will the new youth plan be made available to the public? Will stakeholders and providers be engaged in the process? Ilana Boivie How will customer feedback be collected and reviewed? Will the information gathered be made publicly available? Ilana Boivie The inclusion of DHS and UDC into the Unified Plan is positive. The more agencies and services that come under the WIOA framework, the better. However, a few questions: Is there a goal to transition to a Combined Plan in the future? o Are there plans for the TANF Employment Program (TEP) to be absorbed into the AJCs entirely, or is the goal for TEP to simply be better coordinated with DOES and the AJCs? Similarly, are there plans to fully incorporate the Food Stamp Employment & Training Program? Ilana Boivie What is the timeline for fully incorporating all aspects of the Data Vault as outlined here? Ilana Boivie How will DC government share with the public the important lessons learned or action steps coming out of the annual CAPSTAT? Ilana Boivie How will the business community be better engaged as WIOA implementation moves forward? Are there goals to have a more robust business presence at the WIC?410Ilana Boivie Will performance measures be included in the Data Vault? If so, who will be responsible for following up with past participants to assess job outcomes, etc? What could be the role of stakeholders and providers in shaping how the Data Vault is built and thus used? Ilana Boivie What was the process for setting the performance goals? Ilana Boivie Is there a process in place for reassessing and potentially refining the goals in the future? How will stakeholders and providers be involved? Ilana Boivie Not all of the high-demand occupations identified here align with the career pathways identified in Appendix 3. Are there plans to attempt to incorporate every high-demand occupation into at least one pathway? Ilana Boivie How will it be ensured that training providers are incorporating the career pathways outlined here? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) The State Plan is vague on the District's plans for rolling out these services. Is the intention that WIOA funding for in-school youth (capped at 25% of youth formula funds) will be blended with RSA's reserved 15% of vocational rehabilitation grant funds for pre- employment transition services for students with disabilities? The State Plan should make explicit: 1) Whether or not students without disabilities will still have access to WIOA-funded workforce development programming, and if not, what programs will be created to continue to serve them with local dollars; 2) Whether or not the District currently has the capacity within the provider community to serve youth with disabilities; 3) What technical assistance will be available to prepare providers to serve youth with disabilities; 4) The timeline for this shift in funding and program structure. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Important to establish pre-Recession unemployment for youth 16-19 and 20-24. Youth unemployment skyrocketed in 2008 and has yet to recover, but it's important to establish what \"good\" youth employment targets are moving forward. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Would be helpful to have an analysis of the breakdown of youth seeking workforce development services in the District by literacy and numeracy levels. Many youth currently enrolled in WIOA youth programming are basic skills deficient, and require increased duration and dosage of programming to meet federally-established performance benchmarks. If the majority of youth are testing into workforce programs411below an 8th grade literacy/numeracy level, local funds should be used to support \"ramp-up\" programming that precedes their inclusion in federal programs. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) In District Performance Oversight Hearings, representatives of the city's workforce team have made reference to a Youth Strategic Plan that is under review by DOL. What is the timeline for the release of this strategic plan, how does it complement the youth provisions of the WIOA State Plan, and how is provider feedback being incorporated into the development of that plan? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) One of the most persistent concerns for youth 22-24 is a lack of access to transportation supports that students ages 5-21 enjoy in the District. The Plan should make explicit any policies or practices it intends to roll out to support older youth (22-24) with transportation costs. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) These contract and procurement issues have continued into the District's latest WIOA youth contracts. While an RFQ was released in August 2015, providers were waiting to officially enroll WIOA-eligible youth into their programs as of February 2016. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Will any efforts be made to invest in less effective services/providers to increase their quality to ensure the needs of the District's residents can be met across the city? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) By aligning policies, procedures, and performance measures and sharing data across programs, will providers benefit from a more streamlined reporting process that shares reported data across agencies on the back end? The State Plan could go further to establish major benchmarks in this integration process and provide a timeline for on- the-ground implementation. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will provider feedback be incorporated into the design of the uniform intake, assessment, and referral system that will occur on the agency level to ensure that the intake and assessment elements reflect what's needed on a programmatic level to design services around youth's needs? How do providers and government partners collaborate on this design to ensure this process is as minimally duplicative as possible for youth accessing these services (i.e. youth are not unnecessarily assessed by both an agency and the provider they're referred to.) DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) What lessons on streamlined intakes can be learned from the DC Youth Re- engagement Center and applied to youth employment services?412DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Is there a timeline to begin the development of career pathways for youth? Will youth career pathways include apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship opportunities for both in-school and out-of-school youth? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) What lessons on streamlined intakes can be learned from the DC Youth Re- engagement Center and applied to youth employment services? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Is there a timeline to begin the development of career pathways for youth? Will youth career pathways include apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship opportunities for both in-school and out-of-school youth? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) What additional staff capacity, and therefore budget capacity, will this require for agency partners in each of the strategic planning fiscal years (2016-2020)? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will the privacy of individuals be protected within cross-agency data sharing? Specific concerns for the following groups: adjudicated youth, immigrant youth, youth with mental health diagnoses, and youth with a history of drug use. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will youth apprenticeships be developed within the District's strategy to expand earn and learn opportunities? Understanding that apprenticeships show great promise for out-of-school youth to move into paid training and long-term careers relatively quickly, how does the District plan to scale up the business engagement and occupational skill training capacity of youth providers to expand these opportunities? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) What budgetary implications will the expansion of the Workforce Intermediary program have in each of the strategic planning fiscal years (2016-2020)? How will the funds dispersed through the Workforce Intermediary complement or supplement the funds available in the Innovation Fund to build the capacity of providers as they develop career pathways programming? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Will youth populations be targeted in the development of sector pathways? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Which sectors will be prioritized in initial pathway development, and what is the timeline for starting this work on the youth side? b. Will any funding or technical assistance be413available to youth providers who pilot sector partnerships and pathway building ahead of a District-wide effort? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will residents without social security numbers be tracked within this comprehensive system? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) While the broad performance outcome goals are essentially set at baseline levels by DOL for youth programming, will there be an opportunity to negotiate the terms of the District's interim outcome measures? In the development of the provider scorecard, fair and accurate representation of performance must be paramount to ensure the scorecard is as much of a \"carrot\" as it is a \"stick\". Providers committed to populations of the hardest-to-serve residents should not be penalized for low overall performance if their interim outcomes demonstrate considerable progress. This is especially important for youth who may use the scorecard as a tool in choosing their best-fit program (i.e. while one program's outcomes might be great, that program might not be equipped to serve youth with intense needs). As a program selection tool, it will also be important to release scorecards on agency-run programming as well so youth can assess their full portfolio of program options. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) The State Plan should include more detail on how the District plans to align its WIOA youth programs (so far YEALP and ISY contracts) with the local offerings of Pathways for Young Adults (PYAP) and Career Connections (the State Plan does include information on integration between SYEP and the year-round programs). DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) This section of the State Plan should make explicit the strategic approach and associated goals of each youth workforce program offered within the District in order to parse out how each program fits in the District's continuum of youth services, and what specific needs (based on the demographic information outlined in the State Plan pgs. 23-24) each program is seeking to address? Maintaining fragmented planning approach across agencies without explaining the various entry points, eligibility requirements, targeted populations, strategic interventions, and short- and long-term outcomes of each youth workforce program limits system alignment and obscures gaps in the system. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) The State Plan does not make clear how in-school youth, besides those who are identified as having disabilities will be supported through federally- or locally-funded programming. With reductions in ISY spending required by law, how does the District plan to supplement this loss so current in-school youth do not lose access to in-school workforce programs.414DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Please expound on the options that are being explored (i.e. virtual re-engagement center, brick and mortar youth one-stop, co-located intakes during SYEP/other short term youth workforce development programs). DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Enhancements to the Virtual One Stop (VOS) system should play into the District's efforts to draw youth into year round programming. Are there plans to build the VOS interface into the Virtual Re-engagement platform the REC is spearheading? The State Plan should include benchmarks for the development of this platform and any significant budgetary restrictions to its roll out. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) It's important to involve providers in the development of this intake and referral process to ensure key program-level questions are answered to ensure best-fit program matches. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Beyond Kids Ride Free for WIOA youth 16-21 who are in school, the State Plan should include the development of transportation supports for both in-school and out-of-school youth 22-24. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) A main goal of the summer's badging pilot should be the development of employer buy- in in the badging system. It's important that youth be able to carry their experience and exposure to the workforce with them beyond the 6 weeks of SYEP, but it's equally important that employers understand that badges mean they are getting access to well- trained employees. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Please expand on the efforts to make VOS more youth-friendly. For example, will youth be directed to a distinct landing page, is there an effort to ensure communication is clear and concise, how will youth be encouraged to access VOS, etc.? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will the District ensure equitable access to technology-based supports? Will core partners be training DCPL and DPR staff in the VOS system to increase community- based access to these tools? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will youth apprenticeships be developed within the District's strategy to expand earn and learn opportunities? Understanding that apprenticeships show great promise for out-of-school youth to move into paid training and long-term careers relatively415quickly, how does the District plan to scale up the business engagement and occupational skill training capacity of youth providers to expand these opportunities? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) What supports will be developed on the front end to ensure that youth with the highest barriers to employment (youth with disabilities, English language learners, reengaging youth, youth experiencing homelessness, and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth) are prepared to excel within work-based learning placements? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) A main goal of the summer's badging pilot should be the development of employer buy- in in the badging system. It's important that youth be able to carry their experience and exposure to the workforce with them beyond the 6 weeks of SYEP, but it's equally important that employers understand that badges mean they are getting access to well- trained employees. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Please expand on the efforts to make VOS more youth-friendly. For example, will youth be directed to a distinct landing page, is there an effort to ensure communication is clear and concise, how will youth be encouraged to access VOS, etc.? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How will the District ensure equitable access to technology-based supports? Will core partners be training DCPL and DPR staff in the VOS system to increase community- based access to these tools? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Please indicate which program(s) you plan to leverage for these flexible work placements. In terms of roles and responsibilities, which District stakeholder will take the lead in vetting, monitoring, and supporting the employer placements for this highly vulnerable population of youth? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Is this the youth-friendly VOS interface mentioned earlier? If not, how will these two resources align/integrate? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) The draft plan says that DOES will work with the REC to identify out-of-school youth who don't have a high school diploma that are participating in both the SYEP and year- round youth employment programs for participation in REC services, but does not expand on what the roles and responsibilities of these two agencies will be in connecting identified youth to REC services. Will DOES spearhead communication and recruitment of disconnected youth through their communication system, or will the REC be given access to youth contact information for direct outreach? Will events be416coordinated or co-hosted by DOES and REC partners that are targeted towards these youth? If so, how many events per year? As a measure of performance, what percentage of disconnected youth identified through District-run workforce programming to you plan to connect to the REC? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Understanding the complex logistics of delivering a comprehensive and engaging SYEP orientation, it would be helpful to establish a protocol for connecting SYEP youth to both REC and postsecondary supports throughout the 6-week program. Is it possible to establish multiple REC and postsecondary engagement targets within the State Plan? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How can this collaboration be replicated to better serve English language learners and homeless, pregnant and parenting, disconnected, or court-involved youth? Specialized, pre-SYEP training seems to be a promising practice to scale up. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How does the District plan to align its WIOA youth programs (so far YEALP and ISY contracts) with the locally-funded Career Connections program? For example, what needs, circumstances, or characteristics make a youth more suited to an OSY WIOA program versus Career Connections? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Are there plans to fund the Career Connections program through WIOA dollars in PY 2017-18 once the FY15 Supplemental Budget Dollars that fund it now expire? If this is the case, how will Career Connections services be competitively bid in future program years? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How can these programs be expanded to serve more out-of-school youth? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) How does the District plan to align its WIOA youth programs with Career Connections? Where do these programs fit in the District's continuum of youth services, and what specific needs (based on the demographic information outlined in the State Plan) does each program seek to address? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) The Plan references a successful partnership between the REC and OSSE's Division of Early Learning that cross-trains front line staff in childcare voucher program eligibility requirements to determine eligibility and provide vouchers on the spot. Given this growing capacity within District agencies to provide this service, would it be possible to deploy these staff into the community to co-locate eligibility determination and voucher provision to youth who require this support?417DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) As the District moves towards a career pathways framework of service provision, will youth providers be encouraged/required to identify the partners/next steps appropriate for the youth they transition out of their programs in their contract agreements to create a continuum of services? Will additional career pathways capacity building funds be offered to youth providers within the timeframe of this State Plan (2016-2020)? DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) We recommend the inclusion of regular reporting on the percentage of youth seeking workforce development services who are testing below 8th grade literacy and numeracy levels to help inform future investments in the District's workforce system, and to better integrate the education and workforce systems' outcomes and joint efforts. DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) We recommend these (work- based learning and career exploration opportunities are reported separately.) DC Alliance of Youth Advocates (DCAYA) Important to note that providers have reported an inability to officially enroll WIOA youth as of February 2016, indicating a 7-month procurement process and nearly 9-month gap in services for WIOA-eligible youth. Year Up Strengthened focus on out-of-school youth: Strongly support increased funding for those young adults that can benefit most from the limited training dollars available: out-of-school and disconnected youth. Core Program Performance Goals: We support strong outcomes data and transparency to ensure youth participants achieve successful outcomes. We understand that the District is still building capacity within the youth provider space, yet, Year Up's outcomes demonstrate that training providers can be held to a high standard and ultimately, better serve the young adults supported through WIOA funds. One way to approach this is to gradually increase outcomes measures from year to year as the capacity of provider's shifts and improves. Beyond the planning stage, through implementation, it will be important to obtain input from the providers on performance reporting, including the assessment tools and Data Vault. We look forward to opportunity to engage in this dialogue. We see great value in a continuous and ongoing dialogue between the District and the provider community in ways that establish and sustain a shared commitment around the plan's ambitious goals and desire for better outcomes. Performance-based contracts for Youth Program: Year Up believes that holding providers accountable for their outcomes will dramatically improve the services418provided to the District's young adults. We are encouraged by DOES' exploration of performance-based and hybrid-performance contracting. Targeting performance-based contracting for providers who already have a track record of successful participant outcomes will enhance overall system performance and can balance the need to dramatically increase the number of youth served with the need to engage quality providers that can deliver positive outcomes. For new contracts, we hope DOES looks towards past performance as well as an indicator of future success. Career Pathways : Year Up supports DOES' thorough examination of growing career fields in the District and hope that youth in the city will have the opportunity to pursue training and education in those high growth, middle to high wage jobs that offer self-sufficiency. Year Up has proven that disconnected youth are capable of and eager to learn the skills necessary to succeed in the IT, Finance, and Cybersecurity fields. We hope the District creates similarly high expectations for those youth ready to learn. We also understand and appreciate the need for immediate workforce attachment and exploration for many young adults and would like to see resources are available to explore pathways to in- demand career sectors Supportive services for youth : Strongly support increased supportive services for youth, especially transportation, child care, and housing, as increased costs of living are pushing our young adults further away from the city. Addressing these barriers in a systemic way will only increase the ability of providers to effectively serve these youth and therefore increase their success rates, and allow the District's young adults to remain in their neighborhoods. Not only should WIOA funds allow for these services, but ideally we hope to see additional funding support from the City Council and coordination of available services across the District. Centralized intake, referrals, assessment, and outcomes tracking : Year Up is encouraged by DOES' plan to create the Data Vault system, and oversee intake and outcomes reporting. We have seen other workforce boards achieve success by having board staff members handle the intake/paperwork process and this level of coordination will save training providers money and allow them to better utilize DC's dollars for the job training they are best suited to provide. Regional training: Year Up hope DOES' planning and funding reflects the regional economy developing around the District. As a training provider located outside of the District who largely419MARCIA HUFF - YOUNG WOMEN'S PROJECT Our comments are limited to the aspects of the plan that pertain to youth and young adults ages 16-24. We have the following comments: General Operational Plan-Companion Documents are Needed: The plan lacks any actionable steps, target number for participation, timeline or operational details that inform the staff and programs. This state plan will mean nothing if an operational plan is not created. Participant Volume: Low participant numbers have plagued DC workforce programming for decades\u2014especially in youth employment programing. WIOA requires a focus on youth who high significant barriers to employment. This usually means that more wrap around and support services will have to be provided and these services are expensive. There is also significant need in the city\u2014tens of thousands of young people who are unemployed and living in poverty. How will DC provide support yet still engage and serve a significant number of youth and young adults in programming and services? What partnerships will be put in place to support participants but not result in extremely high cost-per participant? Employer Training and Support: Employers need support, training and guidance so that they can property support youth. DOES should create core competencies that employers can work toward\u2014many are unfamiliar with working with youth and lack youth development backgrounds. This will be especially important with the shift to supporting youth with significant barriers to employment. System Alignment Goal As DC moves to align strategies and share data between agencies and programs how will information be protected? How will participants who are court involved how have their information shared in a way that can negatively impact their active court cases? Also, how will the system serve and support people with disabilities but also protect their right to self-identify? Creating a multitier system would be ideal to serve youth with a span of needs and barriers. WIOA requires that programs serve youth with barriers such as low literacy, no secondary credential or those who have a disability. Currently all programming seems to be one-size-fits-all. Only youth who are extremely high functioning truly benefit and succeed. What are the plans to create programing to serve youth with various needs? What is the plan for aligning WIOA youth programs with the locally funded programs?420Federal dollars only make up a small percentage of youth programming funding but a significant portion of local dollars are used for the MBSYEP that only covers 6 weeks during the summer. Are there any plans to reduce participant numbers during the summer to support year-round programming? Performance and Accountability Goals When it comes to creating standardized methodologies for ensuring accountability and transparency-- how will programs and contractors be evaluated who serve youth with significant barriers? How will evaluation change to have more of a focus on achieving benchmarks that work toward a goal rather than achieving tangible milestones like graduating from high school or receiving a GED. In-School Youth Programming DOES will partner with RSA to serve youth with disabilities in high school. This is an important partnership but plans should be made to include youth without IEPs and 504 plans in employment programming. Will DOES partner with DCPS to include work readiness training in the curriculum? A system should be created for community organizations who would like to employ youth on a part-time basis\u20146-12 hours a week. An infrastructure similar to what is used during the summer would support this type of program. Youth One-Stop How will OSY be supported through a one-stop system? There are various one- stops in the city- DC REC, DYRS Youth Achievement Centers, etc.\u2014will DOES partner with these offices to support youth? Co-locate staff? How will the newly purchased DOES mobile units be used to serve and support youth? DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY, KURT RUNGE, -MIRAM'S KITCHEN Goal 1 1.1 The homeless services system for individuals has an assessment called the VI/SPDAT, to determine a person's housing needs and vulnerability. We recommend incorporating the uniform intake and assessment for employment, into this assessment and/or other homeless services intake systems. 1.2 Consider expanding key partners to include staff who run the DBH supportive employment program and DHS Food Stamp Employment Program. 1.5 Partner with Rapid re-housing programs, which have a goal of increasing one's income through employment.421Goal 2 2.1 Individuals who are homeless may have many barriers to employment (gaps in employment history, criminal record, etc). It can be hard to find employers for entry level jobs willing to give people a chance. Do targeted outreach to businesses willing to hire people who have experienced homelessness and have barriers. 2.3 Ensure programs that serve people who are homeless can address barriers to employment that this group often faces, including: lack of clean clothes, lack of storage for personal belongings, limited resources for transportation, lack of a phone, computer literacy challenges that affect online applications, large gaps in employment history, criminal record, and challenges finding employment due to age. 2.3 Navigating the programs that exist can be complicated. Have support staff that can meet a person, assess them, and help them through the process of getting employment. 2.5 Bring programs to places where people who are homeless are, including the shelters, feeding programs, libraries, and homeless service centers. 2.5 Consider having specialized staff at the American Job Centers who are trained to work with people experiencing homelessness. 2.5 Ensure clear information is available to homeless service providers about all programs that are available and how to access those programs, and that the information is advertised in places where people who are homeless are located. ERIC SHEPTOCK My comments on WIOA are as follows: 1 -- CAREER PATH: Being as the WIOA legislation is said to put people on a \"career path\", this implies that some form of social services will be offered even AFTER a person is connected to employment. DC's minimum wage will rise to $11.50 on July 1st, 2016. DC's 5-year plan to end homelessness says on page 17 (by electro-PDF counter) or page 13 (by typed-in number at page bottom) that DC's living wage is $28.25 per hour. It fails to indicate that this figure is for a single person and that income for a family have to add up to $45 per hour or 360 per work day. Please invent and publish modifications to the local implementation of this federal law which indicate how DC Gov will ensure that singles remain in the social services system until they are making a living wage, as opposed to being dropped from the rolls as soon as they get a minimum- wage job. Show how they will flow from one part of the system to another until they make enough money to hold their own. 2.) LIVING WAGE JOB (or no cookie): I was informed by a former DOES director that the dept. gets people to the interview but doesn't do anything beyond that to ensure that422they are hired. They don't incentivize employers to employ hard-to-employ populations by perhaps bonding the employees for a time. If WIOA mandates that people be put on a \"career path\", then they need to remain on SOMEBODY'S list until they have a career that pays a living wage. (See item #1.) WIOA should mandate that governments which receive DOL funding actually get people all the way to the job, not just to an interview which might end without a job offer. If that job doesn't pay a living wage, the state or local government should not be able to chalk that individual's case up as a success. 3.) NO CREAMING: The \"anti-creaming\" element needs to be spelled out better and even modified such that it ensures that the easiest to serve are not put on a wait list for an employment program where they end up waiting for three or more years because the legislators and government officials want to focus on the most difficult to employ. The anti-creaming clause should specify that people from these specific categories as well as other categories will be served simultaneously and that agencies only get full credit if they connect 20% of those from each category to living-wage jobs each year. The categories I'll specify are: A. The illiterate B. Those with little or no work experience C. The long-term unemployed D. Homeless parents and singles E. Any adult who can demonstrate that their only realistic path to employment is through a WIOA-sanctioned program 9even if they've been unemployed for less than six months). 4.) WIOA should mandate better data collection. We have now way of knowing how much we are improving in terms of connecting homeless people to employment if governments have not been keeping data on how many people have successfully completed employment programs that target the homeless.423Workforce Advocates Meeting Prepared Questions KEY QUESTIONS FOR ADULT EDUCATION BREAKOUT System alignment 1.

The more agencies and services that come under the WIOA framework, the better. oIs there a goal to transition to a Combined Plan in the future? oAre there plans for the TANF Employment Program (TEP) to be absorbed into the AJCs entirely, or is the goal for TEP to simply be better coordinated with DOES and the AJCs? Similarly, are there plans to fully incorporate the Food Stamp Employment & Training Program? Stakeholder Engagement: Four public engagement sessions, regular meetings with the advocacy community, and the ability to post live comments on the website are all very positive steps in engaging stakeholders in the WIOA process. oHow have education and training providers been engaged in the process? What is the vision for the future? oThere are proposals in the plan to engage the business community more. How has the business community been engaged in the WIOA state plan process thus far? Data/Performance: The Data Vault will be key in aligning intake systems, avoiding duplication, and basically ensuring an efficient process to assess and refer candidates to programs that best fit their needs. oWhat is the timeline for fully incorporating all aspects of the Data Vault? oMultiple data systems, across several agencies, are identified in the report\u2014will all of these data systems be incorporated into the Data Vault? oWill performance measures be included as well? Who will be responsible for following up with past participants to assess job outcomes, etc? oWhat could be the role of stakeholders in shaping how Data Vault is built and thus used? Accountability: Activities such as: monthly meetings among agency heads on implementation; annual CAPSTAT; streamlined customer feedback; and 2-year system evaluation are great steps to foster accountability and transparency through the implementation process. oHow will customer feedback be collected and reviewed? Will the information gathered be made publicly available?432oHow will DC government share with the public the important lessons learned or action steps coming out of the monthly meetings and CAPSTAT? Career Pathways: oHow will it be ensured that training providers are incorporating the career pathways outlined in Appendix 3? oWill it be ensured that each career pathway identified in Appendix 3 is offered by at least one training program in the District? oNot all of the high demand occupations listed in Appendix 2 align with the career pathways outlined in Appendix 3. Are there plans to attempt to incorporate every high demand occupation into at least one pathway? Performance Goals: oWhat was the process for setting the performance goals? Was comparability to other states a factor? oWhat is there a process in place for reassessing and potentially refining the performance goals in the future? How will stakeholders be involved? Funding: oMany new initiatives / compliance measures will require additional funding. Is there a sense of how much additional money will be required to pay for these activities? Is there a sense of priorities for new funding? Immediate Next Steps: oMany operating/implementation plans are outlined in the state plan. What are some measureable steps for 2016 and 2017?433GOVERNMENT OFTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA "}
