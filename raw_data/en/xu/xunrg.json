I chose SCU because I met Dr. Anu and saw her give her beautiful speech about the Ayurveda program, and she led us all through yoga. I knew from that day that SCU was for me. The clinic was the best part of the program because you get to see everything we're learning inside the classroom, all the theories and the principles applied in real life. You get to see the patients' lives turn around, their body pain goes away with the body treatments and the herbs, and you get to see them making these dietary changes and lifestyle changes. The other aspect of the Ayurveda program at SCU that I enjoyed was the hands-on approach, and that's not only in the clinic where we get to work with patients hands-on but also in the classroom setting. I chose SCU because it focuses on integrative health, which is important to me. I wanted to be part of a program that focuses on looking at these traditional forms of medicine, bringing them forward into the modern present-day, and finding ways to utilize them with other practitioners. So, I think one of the most incredible things here at SCU is the teachers' focus on the tradition of Ayurveda but also on how to bring it into the modern medical world. \"There are a lot of things that I love about the program at SCU. The first one is that the faculty come from a long line of Ayurvedic knowledge deeply rooted in ancient classical text. They studied Ayurveda, but they also lived it. When you learn from people who embody this wisdom, it's much easier to grasp this knowledge. The second thing I love is the camaraderie within the cohort. The combination of the training, supportive faculty, and the support of my peers and classmates has given me the confidence I need to start my own practice.\" Students seeking reasonable accommodations or support services while enrolled at SCU can do so through the [Student Services Office (SSO)](https://www.scuhs.edu/accessibililty/).
