[[1]](#footnote_1) Fortunately, there are many treatment options available, such as prescription medications and talk therapy. But if you're interested in looking beyond therapy and medication, there are evidence-based lifestyle changes that have the potential to offer symptom relief, too. Here's a look at five natural remedies for anxiety, including advice on how to implement them. What Is Anxiety? Anxiety is an emotion that leads to feelings of worry, fear and/or dread. It may be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as sweating, rapid heartbeat and restlessness. The American Psychological Association (APA) distinguishes anxiety from general fear by noting that anxious thoughts focus on the future, while fearful thoughts arise in response to an acute threat or danger. It's normal for people to feel anxious in response to stressful moments, like air travel or a medical test, and to a certain degree, anxiety is even beneficial, as it helps alert you to danger. But when anxious feelings persist, an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or panic disorder, may be the reason. 5 Natural Remedies for Anxiety While anxiety is a common mental health condition, it's also highly treatable, and common treatment plans include prescription medications, talk therapy or a combination of both. In addition, there are simple lifestyle changes and natural remedies that may be helpful in easing the symptoms of anxiety. Exercising \"Regular movement\u2014up to 30 minutes a day, five times a week\u2014is proven to alleviate anxiety and depression,\" says Suzanne Bartlett Hackenmiller, M.D., an integrative medicine physician in Carefree, Arizona, and the chief medical advisor for AllTrails. One research analysis studying the impacts of physical activity on anxiety found that exercise significantly lowered anxiety levels for those who engaged in it. Furthermore, groups participating in high-intensity exercises, such as jogging, showed lower anxiety levels when compared to groups engaged in low-intensity activities, such as walking and stretching. [[2]](#footnote_2) But don't let high-intensity exercise dissuade you, says Ashley McMann, a licensed professional therapist in Austin, Texas. \"Being that everyone's physical abilities and circumstances are unique, individuals should come up with a regular exercise plan that best fits their abilities. Any movement is better than none,\" she notes. Limiting Alcohol In 2017, an analysis of 63 research studies uncovered a link between limiting alcohol consumption and alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression, among several other physical and mental health benefits. [[3]](#footnote_3) The connection between alcohol and anxiety is a complex one, says Sara Modlin-Tucker, D.O., an osteopathic physician in Waterville, Maine. Ending a stressful day with a glass of wine may make you feel more relaxed, but it's only temporary, notes Dr. Modlin-Tucker. What's more, she adds that drinking can ultimately worsen your anxiety symptoms. \"Alcohol acts as a depressant and disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to increased feelings of anxiety and even triggering panic attacks,\" she adds. \"It is advisable for individuals with anxiety to limit or avoid alcohol consumption to support their mental well-being.\" Explore Our Featured Online Therapy Sponsors |Company Logo||Forbes Health Website||http://www.betterhelp.com/forbes\" rel=\"nofollow\"| |Human, virtual insurance||Learn More||On Talkiatry's Website||https://www.trv6hh.com/4RQSJ/2CTPL/\" Cerebral's Website||https://cerebral.sjv.io/c/1955282/999612/12128\" rel=\"nofollow\"| Limiting Caffeine If you're someone who reaches for the coffee pot throughout the day, you may want to reconsider your caffeine intake. \"Caffeine increases your heart rate and can often mimic the physical sensations [of] having a panic attack,\" says McMann. \"These symptoms can manifest themselves into actual anxiety.\" A small study of Florida State University students found a direct correlation between the number of caffeinated drinks participants enjoyed per week and an increase in GAD symptoms, such as trouble falling asleep and becoming easily irritable. [[4]](#footnote_4) But this doesn't mean everyone with anxiety must avoid caffeine altogether. \"[Each individual] should gauge their tolerance for caffeine based on their own experience,\" adds McMann. \"Listening to your body's physical reactions to certain stimuli is really important when struggling with anxiety.\" Eating a Healthy Diet Studies show adopting healthier mealtime habits may contribute to lower levels of anxiety. After reviewing 17 studies involving more than 157,000 participants, researchers found that an anti-inflammatory diet\u2014rich in foods such as fruits, vegetables and olive oil\u2014contributed to lower anxiety levels. A pro-inflammatory diet, which is a diet high in red meat, animal oils and processed foods, raised the risk of anxiety by 80% in women and 47% in men. [[5]](#footnote_5) \"Consuming nutrient-rich foods supports optimal brain function and balances mood-regulating neurotransmitters,\" says Dr. Modlin-Tucker. She recommends a diet consisting of whole grains, proteins, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids, a component found in fish and flaxseed. \"Avoid highly processed flours and sugars; stick with whole foods, which will benefit your body immensely,\" she adds. \"Our digestive system has the largest production of serotonin in our body, and making sure we are feeding our bodies nutritious foods can have a huge effect on our emotional well-being as well.\" Meditation and Mindfulness A small study of 276 men and women living with anxiety disorders found that an eight-week mindfulness course performed similarly to a daily dose of Lexapro, a common prescription medication used to treat symptoms of anxiety. [[6]](#footnote_6) \"For those consulting a doctor to address their stress and anxiety, mindfulness and meditation-especially those that are nature-based-are beneficial practices to complement an existing treatment plan,\" says Dr. Hackenmiller. \"While there are many different types of meditation and mindfulness practices, working with your doctor to find ways to integrate them into your health plan will have added benefits to your mental wellbeing.\" One meditation technique she recommends is breathwork, in which you breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth, focusing on the exhale. When to See a Doctor for Anxiety If you find your anxiety is disrupting your daily life and causing you significant distress, it may be time to seek guidance from a medical professional. \"Discussing your symptoms with a healthcare provider is always important if you suffer from anxiety. You might need medication to help you get control of your symptoms. It is important to remember that you can always combine [strategies such as] mindfulness practices and medication management to have a dual approach to controlling anxiety,\" Dr. Modlin-Tucker says. While many natural remedies may contribute to lower levels of anxiety, if you've been practicing these lifestyle changes consistently for a minimum of six months without marked improvement, it may be time to seek professional help, "}
