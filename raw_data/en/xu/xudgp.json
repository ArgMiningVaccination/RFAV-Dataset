But per-haps now more than ever, the oncology world is stirred by astonishing breakthroughs in lifesaving medicines simultaneous with ever-higher and more complex barriers to access for patients who need them. When it comes to the science of cancer, these are definitely the best of times. Exciting discoveries occurring in every area of cancer research are producing treatments targeted to the unique molecular and genetic characteristics of each person's cancer. Add the excitement over new immunotherapies that train a patient's immune system to destroy cancer and it is clear that the transformative change of precision medicine is well underway. For some cancer patients seeking to utilize these life-saving thera- pies, however, all the world's medical innovation might as well never have occurred. Even as medical advances create new, potentially life-saving medicines for patients - and more quickly than ever before - ready access to these life-enhancing therapies is not assured. Why? The path is blocked in two critical ways. The first is governmental. What we call \"new\" cancer treatments are often 8-10 years old by the time they reach patients. Why isn't this a mat-ter of months? The main reason is that FDA regulations were designed to evaluate the modernism of the VCR and 8-track tapes. Appropriate for their time, perhaps, but increasingly ill-equipped to co-exist with today's speedy scientific advances. The second is access. Tens of thousands of cancer patients are custom- arily confronted with rising copays, restricted coverage and all too often, insurance practices that deny access completely. This is the bitter reality of today's access fights - with patients and their doctors denied medica-tions every day by a complex coverage and reimbursement insurance system that surely does not want to be seen as standing in the way of sick people and their disease-altering treatments. In response, a patient revolution has ignited and touched down in 39 states and Washington, D.C. to address the problem of inequitable cover-age by requiring health plans to equalize the patients' out-of-pocket costs between oral and intravenous therapies. Further state-by-state reform efforts will surely follow. As a nonprofit organization working to improve cancer care, Vital Options International (VOI) believes patients should not be forced to battle the system and their cancer at the same time. This is why VOI supports energetic and innovative movements underway to update the drug ap-proval process using 21st century computing capabilities, genomic analysis and a new understanding of cancer on a molecular level. We also hope legislators and regulators will work with doctors, patients, caregivers and payors to provide faster and easier access to the latest medications - and do so in a way that prioritizes patient safety and supports the integrity of new drug evaluations. To almost countless patients, there is only one obvious move left: Towards a regulatory future that embraces access and accepts nothing less than the right patient, the right medicine and right now. Addressing the Barriers to Patient Access PARTNER PROFILE \"We have a health insurance failure for innovative medicines. If you get cancer today, your copays can prevent you from accessing the medicines you desperately need. That's a failure of health insurance.\" T omas Philipson, Ph.D., Professor, University of ChicagoThe definition of \"conundrum\" is \"a confusing and difficult problem or question,\"\u2014a definition that clearly applies to the growing number of cancer patients who are prescribed state-of-the art cancer medicines and yet, delay taking them or don't take them at all. According to the latest projec- tions, nearly half of Americans diagnosed with a chronic disease take their medicine as directed only 50 percent to 60 percent of the time. The consequence of this poor medication adherence is more doctor visits, trips to the emergency room, and hospitalizations, all of which is estimated to cost the health care system between $100 billion and $300 billion annually. However, for Americans fighting a deadly cancer, the consequences can also be life-threatening and thus, the conundrum: Why are can-cer patients skipping doses or tak - ing less than the prescribed amount of their cancer medicines? The answer is simple: In the name of cost-containment, insurance com-panies increasingly restrict patients' access to breakthrough cancer medicines through high copays and practices that require patients to fail on medication after medication until their insurance companies finally agree to pay for the drug prescribed by their doctors. One disturbing and wasteful insur- ance practice is what is euphemisti-cally called \"step therapy\" or \"fail first.\" In this practice, although a doctor may prescribe a medication most suitable to the patient's indi-vidual needs, the insurance company usurps the doctor's prescribing authority by requiring the patient to first fail on several inferior medica- tions before it will pay for the drug that the doctor originally prescribed. Equally onerous is placing new can-cer medicines into the highest phar-macy (\"specialty\") tier and forcing patients to pay a large percentage of the drug's price. According to a re-cent Leukemia & Lymphoma Society report, even the new state exchange plans implemented under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for previously uninsured patients use this cost containment strategy. This means patients can pay up to 50 percent of the costs of new can-cer therapies, which leads to poor adherence. Then, there is the practice of shifting as much as 25 percent of the cost of oral anti-cancer medicines to patients in high co-pays\u2014even though these drugs are less invasive than intravenous infusions, they carry fewer side effects, and patients don't have to travel to the doctor's office every week, resulting in time away from work or family. Yet, be-cause the co-pays can be hundreds or thousands of dollars per month, studies find almost 10 percent of insured patients choose not to fill their initial prescriptions for oral anti-cancer medications. T o save lives, the patient com- munity, cancer advocacy groups, and public health organizations are pressing Congress and state legis- latures to cap co-pays on specialty medicines and ensure equality of access and insur-ance coverage for all anti-cancer regimens. T o date, 39 states and Washington D.C. have enacted oral chemotherapy access laws, while 15 states and the District of Columbia have either introduced or passed bills to limit what patients pay for specialty medicines. The Alliance for the Adoption of Innovations in Medicine supports these policies because adhering to cancer medicines is a necessity. It is time to end the adherence conun-drum by reducing the cost-sharing barriers for cancer patients, so they can fill their prescriptions and take the medicines they desperately need. It's the right thing to do for patients, the healthcare system and our economy. By STACEY L.

We are proud to have done this for seven years now, adding an objective, data-driven voice to an arena with a lot of unchecked cheerleading. This year, we add another data-led feature\u2014albeit far less quantitative\u2014titled The Worldview 100 (page 8), celebrating the most in - fluential people in biotechnology, as determined through nominations and selections from our international panel of experts. As with any list, this one will sure- ly spawn differences of opinion about the people on it and those missing. Ultimately, though, driving discussion lies at the heart of this publication's mission. We want to en - courage readers to explore biotechnology from a broad and global perspective. Two sections\u2014one on turning an idea into a product (page 22) and another on the successes, failures and fu - ture directions in communication about biotechnology (page 30)\u2014trigger fresh ways of thinking about these top - ics. We continue this focus on fostering new dialogue with articles about the impact of location on drug development (page 66) and which countries excel and flounder when it comes to attracting biotechnology investment (page 68). We did not, however, set out to spark debate from every element of the 2015 Scientific American Worldview . And few are likely to contest one \"list\" in this year's edition, which highlights some of the top innovators in medicine and two of the patients who reaped the benefits (page 72) of modern medical ingenuity. As in previous years, our \"Country Spotlights\" section (page 76) will take readers on a tour of science-in-action, showcasing biotechnology success stories around the planet. Last but far from least, the worldVIEWpoint (page 84) essay reveals a modern, data-infused approach to finding a science-based \"fountain of youth.\" The author, a pioneer in stem cell therapeutics, describes his journey into this field with an ironic story about turning what was once considered medical waste into cutting-edge medical treat - ments. His success proves that life-changing advances can and do materialize from highly surprising sources. But that's just what we seek to uncover\u2014the stories in which something unexpected makes the difference. One of the guiding themes of Scientific American Worldview is that innovation and ingenuity can occur in the most un - likely places. We've found evidence of that in every edition of our Scorecard. As our ranking system shows year after year, small or resource-challenged countries can dominate various aspects of biotechnology achievement, and even the giants can tumble on some metrics. This dynamic and developing industry continues to intrigue and amaze us. And we are once again delighted to bring you the people, places and perspectives that are moving it forward. As always, we offer our profound thanks to our sponsors and partners: Celgene Corporation, Cure Forward, Cred-ible Meds, and The Biotechnology Industry Organization. Sincerely, Jeremy Abbate, Publishing Director Mike May, Editorial Director Y ali Friedman, Head, Data Analytics your - PUSHING P4 In our article \"Trans-forming Medicine: A Manifesto\" (Scientific American Worldview , 2014), we challenged the founda-tion of \"evidence-based medicine. \" We noted that methods used to generate this evidence, the basis for medical practice and reim- bursement\u2014randomized clinical trials (RCT) and comparative effectiveness research\u2014are dangerously broken. There is a broad biparti- san effort to move towards personalized and precision medicine because getting the right treatments to the right patients at the right time can reduce the cost of healthcare and save lives. But good policy has to be guided by good science and a systems-driven medicine that is predictive, preven-tive, personalized and par-ticipatory (P4). Marginal changes to evidence-based medicine (e.g., comput-erizing data collection) will themselves have only marginal effects on improv-ing healthcare and reducing its costs. Specifically, the RCT, our gold standard, typically fails when there is multicausality for any disease, phenotype or bio-logical feature(s) of clinical importance. Medicine is empirically, and with some knowledge of mechanisms, climbing multi-peaked clinical landscapes suc-cessfully\u2014where RCT fails. In addition, patients are unique genetically and environmentally, and hence should not be averaged in large populations. Rather, the personalized multi-dimensional data clouds of each individual should be analyzed independently, and then patients with similar features can be aggregated into related groups of interest (e.g., those responding effectively to a drug). We are throw-ing away unknown hoards of relevant data about both the variability of response and multiplicity of causes at the genetic and pheno-typic level when we average patient populations. With the analysis of individual patients we can gain fun-damental new insights into disease through N=1 experiments and appropri-ate statistical power can be gained through the aggre-gation of related patients. Further, the one drug- one disease model of inno-vation (based on Pasteur's germ theory) is outdated. Genetic, environmental, behavioral and demograph-ic factors regulating well-being have turned single illnesses, such as cancer, into multidimensional diseases for which no single drug can be successful. Cells, tissues, organs and organ systems are networks of causal interactions, best treated by smart combina-tions of drugs, nutriments and other strategies, such as immune therapy. Y et, virtually every researcher, company and regulatory agency is organized around the one drug-one disease business model. Consumers\u2014via social networks, multi-dimen- sional data clouds and digital tools\u2014are decipher-ing biological complexity to match people to combina-tions of treatment. They are bypassing large clinical trial networks to get better answers more quickly with individualized approaches to their disease. We should enable this movement to accelerate personalized medicine. COLIN HILL LEROY HOODSUI HUANGSTUART KAUFFMAN \u2014founders of Transforming Medicine: The Elizabeth Kauffman InstituteTRANSFORMING THE FUTURE OF HEALTHCARE In the past two decades, the pace of medical progress has accelerated. The human genome has been sequenced, hepatitis C can be cured, HIV has been turned into a chronic condition and remission has become more common and attainable in several forms of cancer. Despite progress, chal- lenges remain in translating basic science discover-ies into medical practice. Whereas the 20th century saw a focus on develop-ing better treatments for disease, there has been far less attention to preven-tion, early detection and interception of disease. The impact of condi- tions like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, rheuma-toid arthritis and diabetes continues to burden global healthcare systems. Patients affected by these diseases often spend years of their lives in a state of declining health. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the United States alone, about half of all adults, 117 million people, live with at least one chronic condition. Earlier this year, Jans- sen Research & Develop-ment, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, announced the launch of three new research platforms focused on disease prevention, disease interception and the mi-LET'S GIVE 'EM SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT... ... patients are unique genetically and environmentally, and hence should not be averaged in large populations. + THE 6TH ANNUAL WORLDVIEW SCORECARD Confirming a recovery TRANSFORMING CANCER CARE Novel approaches spark a new dawn for all medicine ON THE BEAT IN BRAZIL Partnering its way to powerful solutionsSPECIAL REPORT TRACKING INNOVATION'S VALUE TO SOCIETY We want to encourage readers to explore biotechnology from a broad and global perspective. LETTERS / OPINIONS / CRITIQUESYOURVIEWS YOURVIEWS 7 6 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEWcrobiome. These new teams will collaborate closely with Janssen's five therapeutic areas and external partners to propel science in an effort to change an approach from \"disease care\" to health care. Our healthcare system is strapped with the bur - geoning costs of chronic care and will ultimately seek more cost-effective approaches. As of 2006, patients with chronic diseases accounted for 84% of all healthcare spending. By taking advantage of our ability to rapidly sequence the human genome, we are able to understand an individual's susceptibility to disease, calculate one's risk and intervene before illness occurs. Today, early disease in- terception and prevention strategies are still largely unexplored for many of the illnesses that plague our societies. The Janssen Prevention Center (JPC) will focus on the preven-tion of chronic, non-com-municable diseases such as Alzheimer's, heart disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases, which increasingly impact aging populations and burden healthcare sys-tems globally. The JPC will leverage the world-class vaccine discovery expertise of the former Crucell Vac-cine Institute (The Nether-lands) in collaboration with laboratories in the United States and United Kingdom to discover solutions to extend people's healthy life span. The Disease Interception Accelerator (DIA) is a new incubator-like group based in New Jersey that seeks to identify the root causes of disease and enable the de-velopment of interventions that stop the progression to disease. Our first disease area of focus for the DIA is type 1 diabetes (T1D). Janssen scientists will work to develop new diagnostic, therapeutic or combination approaches for T1D inter-ception by understanding the role of potential triggers and initiating steps on the pathway to T1D. The Janssen Human Microbiome Institute (JHMI) was designed to explore the relationship of the organisms that inhabit our body in maintaining health and causing disease. Ultimately, this unique Janssen initiative will de-velop new ways to maintain health and treat disease. External collaborations for this organization will be fostered through anchor research centers located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Beerse, Belgium. During the last 120 years, Johnson & Johnson has pushed forward many \"firsts\"\u2014evolving from being the first company to develop baby products that allowed for \"no more tears, \" through the Band-Aid and disposable contact lenses, medical devices and blood typing, to developing the first treatment for tubercu-losis in 40 years. It is our responsibility as a leading healthcare company to continue to drive innova-tion and make a difference for people and society. As an industry, we have accomplished great things and have laid the founda-tion for a bright future. The launch of ambitious, forward-thinking initiatives will further propel us into a bold new era of research and development\u2014an era marked by the promise of new firsts, including a day when the term \"patient\" is a historical artifact. WILLIAM N. HAIT Global Head Janssen Research & Development, LLCRaritan, New Jersey THE EBOLA- VACCINE FUNDING GAP With the number of new cases of Ebola appear - ing to level off, and with clinical trials for Ebola vaccines now underway, there is an almost palpable sense that the crisis is over. The reality, however, is that even if a safe and effective vaccine emerges and the epidemic is brought under control, we are still in many ways no better prepared for future outbreaks than we were a year ago. Even now, with more than 10,000 people dead and 24,000 confirmed cases of Ebola in eight countries, it is still not clear who will pay if, or when, a vaccine becomes available. Millions of doses will be needed, and not just to help end the current epidemic but also, crucially, as a stockpile to prevent future outbreaks from getting out of control. The problem is that there is no market. It's one thing developing and approving a vaccine, and quite another getting it out to the people who need it the most. With a disease like Ebola, which kills ferociously but occurs sporadically and usually in remote areas, there simply is no commercial market. Who would buy it? Out-breaks usually involve only a couple of hundred cases and typically occur every few years in poor rural communities in Africa. So, manufacturers would be unlikely to see a return on that investment. This means that even if one of these candidate Ebola vaccines receives clinical approval, we'll still be left with a significant funding gap. Gavi, the Vac-cine Alliance, is committed to purchasing necessary vaccines for this outbreak and creating a stockpile for future outbreaks as well as incentivizing next-genera-tion vaccine development, but as a public-privately funded global health orga-nization we still have not yet determined who will provide these funds. We need to stop waiting for evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we treat it like one. If we want to prevent major outbreaks of diseases like Ebola then we need to invest in vaccine stockpiles and start viewing them as the ultimate deter-rent\u2014making sure they are there, and at the same time praying we never have to use them. SETH BERKLEY CEO Gavi, the Vaccine AllianceGeneva, Switzerland IPSCS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative recently pledged US$215 million to fund research to use per-sonalized genetic informa-tion as the starting place for understanding individual response to disease and treatment. While the initia-tive is necessary, it fails to address the questions that DNA and genetics alone cannot answer, questions that must be posed at the cellular level, where the answers may dramatically improve patient healthcare. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), with the potential to be manu-factured from virtually any patient's blood cells, set the stage for research to make enormous gains in understanding how to approach medical treat-ment. These personalized stem cells provide a more comprehensive system for understanding the behavior of particular diseases than current genetic sequencing approaches available. These cells enable us to study diseases\u2014Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, ALS, muscu-lar dystrophies, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiomyopathies and macular degeneration, among others\u2014at the phe-notypic level (i.e., how the cell's behavior or function is affected) rather than just via genotype. iPSC technology also offers the potential for a unique approach to preci-sion medicine: personalized cell transplants. A first look at this potential may come from the National Eye Institute and its collabora-tion with Cellular Dynam-ics International (CDI) that ultimately may lead to a treatment for macular degeneration with an au-tologous (the patient's own) iPSC-derived retinal cell transplant. This is expected to lead to the first clinical trial in the United States using iPSCs. The convenient criticism of personalized medicine is the perceived cost. But the price should decline, just as the cost of sequencing the human ge-nome rapidly declined. The time is right for the United States to fully embrace this rapidly developing field with research dollars. Personalized medicine has arrived, and the United States needs to lead this race to the finish line. BOB PALAY CEO and Chairman Cellular Dynamics International (CDI) Madison, WisconsinHEMATOLOGY TRIAL NUANCES Louis J. DeGennaro's \"Embracing The Process\" (Scientific American Worldview , 2014) draws much needed atten-tion to the lack of targeted treatment options available for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). I applaud the steps the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is taking to address this unmet medical need with the Beat AML initiative. Beat AML needs to also consider the impact clinical trial management has on commercial success and the nuances surrounding prop-er hematological oncol-ogy study design. Because hematologic oncology trials are fundamentally different than a solid-tumor study, it can be quite challenging to develop and implement successful trials. Oncolo-gists and drug developers need to understand that by better addressing the treat-ment agendas of individual patients, the more success the study will have in re-cruitment and completion. Unlike tumor-based cancers, which are classified based on their point of ori-gin in the body, hematolog-ical malignancies, such as AML, can develop into new cancers as they progress, making them very hard to define. The specificity of the disease also makes develop - ing t argeted therapies es- pecially critical to treating them. Advancing research through genetic testing and affecting change in the regulatory process should remain key areas of the initiative's multi-pronged approach. However, clinical trial management can't be forgotten. Enhancing and refin- ing our understanding of these cancer pathologies can increase the number of targeted therapies to enable truly personalized treat-ments. Moreover, ensuring careful trial design and precise trial execution will yield data that can inform, and perhaps significantly impact, the greater oncol-ogy community.

Contact us at: saworldview@sciam.comt just 40 years old, biotechnology is a relatively new industry. Its starting point, arguably, was the 1975 Asilomar Confer - ence on Recombinant DNA, at which the potential benefits and hazards of DNA manipulation and the ways it should be regulated were debated and essentially decided upon. Most of the seminal figures in the develop - ment of biotechnology are alive today. Indeed, many of them are still working in the field that they love. Here, we name 100 of the industry's leading lights in a list we've dubbed \"The Worldview 100.\" The honorees in - clude researchers who provided fundamental insights into biological processes, as well as their colleagues who devel - oped those insights to create the biology-based goods and services that are the essence of biotechnology. We also recog - nize the business experts who had the foresight to provide financial backing in this high-risk, nascent technology sector, along with the entrepreneurs who constructed and implemented the business principles that made those in - vestments pay off. Dotted throughout are several visionary legislators and administrators who understood the need to create fertile conditions enabling biotechnology to flour - ish, and a number of key media figures who have helped to convey its potential and successes to the community at large. The realm of biotechnology extends so far that some people on our list might not even consider themselves part of this industry. Nonetheless, these scientists and business builders are as complementary to the emergence of the field as two parents are to a child. Advances in biotechnology are the results of the efforts of many tens of thousands of people. The Worldview 100 could easily have been developed as The Worldview 500, The Worldview 1,000, or any multiple thereof. In identify -ing just 100 individuals, our intention is to illustrate the range and quality of its leaders, rather than to offer a de - finitive register of its \"most important\" contributors. Nev - ertheless, the list stands scrutiny as a collection of extraor - dinarily talented and effective people. To learn more about them, we provided each with an opportunity to respond to a few questions\u2014some serious and others less so\u2014and we share some of their answers. What traits do these leaders have in common? Creativity and enterprise are givens. Resilience and self-sacrifice are also critical, as the complexity of the science and its regula - tion demands they constantly strive to maintain momentum, however far away their goal appears. And since risk-taking is practically the norm in biotech, these figures have to pos - sess the confidence to outdare the crowd, to blaze a trail and to maintain their nerve, sometimes against overwhelming odds. Emotional intelligence is another prerequisite for The Worldview 100, who invariably have the ability to get along with others and the forthrightness to be constructive - ly critical when necessary. One suspects that many of biotech's key players would have stood out in whichever career they chose. So what en - ticed them into this field? Perhaps its newness, offering the thrill of putting a personal stamp on a fledgling industry, was part of the attraction. But surely the biggest draw was the scope and potential impact of the work: re-envisioning health and wellness, transforming agriculture, retooling traditional industries and providing solutions to the global energy crisis in a climate-friendly manner. What greater challenges does our world face? We present The Worldview 100, who are facing them head-on. \u2014The Scientific American Worldview team with key contributions from Alexandra Hariri and Richard Gallagher. THE WORLDVIEW 100 SURVEY METHODS We developed and finalized this list in several steps through a process carried out from December 2014 through March 2015. First, we invited dozens of leaders in biotechnology and biosciences to nominate their choices for the most influential people in the field. We encouraged the nominators to select living experts currently working in the sector from a range of contributing areas, including industry, academia, public policy, finance, law and beyond. That process generated a list of almost 400 nominees. We then recruited more experts\u2014many of them from the original group of nominators\u2014to suggest anyone on the list of nominees worthy of selection to a more refined coterie of the 100 most influential figures in today's world of biotechnology. For the final step, we tallied the votes, and the 100 people most selected formed The Worldview 100. Here, we highlight the 10 individuals who received the highest number of votes. We present the other 90 honorees in alphabetical order. THE WORLDVIEW 100 9 8 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW10 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW THE WORLDVIEW 100 11professor of genetics | Harvard Medical School | Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. Church started his career with sequencing, especially through the development of advanced devices, and he continues to help scientists collect and analyze data about the most basic life traits. As the director of PersonalGenomes.org, he pro-vides open access to data that explore the foundation of human traits around the world. His work on next-generation sequencing and cellular and tissue engineer-ing spawned a dozen companies based on medical genomics or synthetic biology. Kirkus Reviews called his book Regenesis, coauthored with science writer Ed Regis, \"a valuable glimpse of science at the edge. \" director | U.S. National Institutes of Health | Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. \"I think my greatest contribution to biotechnology arose from the charge I was given to lead the international Human Genome Project, \" Collins told Scientific American Worldview. \"Through the dedicated work of 2,400 scientists in six countries, we successfully sequenced and made immediately available the 3 billion base pairs in the human genetic blueprint\u2014ahead of schedule and under budget. \" To make biotechnology even more effective, he said, \"It is especially important to support the creative minds who are pursuing high-risk projects that, if successful, may yield high rewards for expanding biological knowledge or fighting human disease. \" co-chair and trustee | Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | Seattle, Washington, U.S. Best known as the cofounder of Microsoft, Gates turned his wealth into philan-thropic giving through his and his wife's foundation, which, its website states, works to \"bring about the kinds of changes that will help people live healthier and more productive lives. \" Clearly, innovation has always played a fundamental role in his career. He once noted, \"I believe in innovation and that the way you get innovation is you fund research and you learn the basic facts. \" That thinking took him a long way. co-chair and trustee | Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | Seattle, Washington, U.S. In her 1982 high school valedictorian address at Ursuline Academy in Dallas, Texas, Melinda Gates offered the following wisdom: \"If you are successful, it is because somewhere, sometime, someone gave you a life or an idea that started you in the right direction. Remember also that you are indebted to life until you help some less fortunate person, just as you were helped. \" At that time, no one could even imagine the help that she would bring to the world. According to her foundation's website, it has given grants totaling US$32.9 billion. former commissioner | U.S. Food & Drug Administration | Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S. Born to a two-physician family, Hamburg joined the family business\u2014but in a managerial capacity. Before working for the FDA, she served as commissioner of the New Y ork City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, where she significantly slowed the spread of tuberculosis. When President Obama named Hamburg the FDA commissioner in 2009, Georges Benjamin, then executive director of the American Public Health Association, said, \"She's all about integrity and science.... She can be tough when she needs to be, and she's going to need to be real tough in that job. \" How right he was.president & cofounder | Institute for Systems Biology | Seattle, Washington, US Hood played a role in the development of five instruments that drive today's bio-logical sciences: automated DNA sequencers, DNA synthesizers, protein sequenc-ers, peptide synthesizers and an ink-jet printer for constructing DNA arrays. Today, he works on integrating biology, computation and technology to build so-called P4 medicine, which is predictive, personalized, preventative and participatory. In the 2012 Scientific American Worldview , Hood posited that the traits of a successful entrepre- neur are \"having a clear picture of the future that is very different from what other people have, and an ability to drive towards that future. \" professor of biology | MIT | Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. After publishing a 2005 article in Nature on the chimpanzee genome, Lander said, \"The goal is not just butterfly collecting or mammal collecting to simply describe mammals. All of that comparative work across mammals is about informing the human genome for medicine. Until we actually understand all the working parts within our genome, we won't really be able to practice the most informed medi-cine. \" As a core member of the Broad Institute, Lander continues to explore what genomics can tell us about human physiology and diseases\u2014especially how to treat them. David H. Koch Institute Professor | MIT | Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. Langer described his greatest contribution to biotechnology as \"discovering how to create materials that enable the controlled release of macromolecules. \" Such devices can deliver drugs\u2014even genetically engineered proteins\u2014for long periods, and Langer is even working on versions that can be controlled through magnetic, ultrasonic and enzymatic methods. The best way to increase the effectiveness of biotech today, he said, is to provide \"more funding for basic research. \" Langer's output\u2014including more than 1,000 patents, which have been licensed to over 300 companies\u2014attests to his indefatigable drive. founder | J. Craig Venter Institute | La Jolla, California, U.S. In 2013, Venter told Bloomberg, \"Genome design is going to be a key part of the future. That's why we need fast, cheap, accurate DNA synthesis so you can make a lot of iterations of something and test them. \" By then, he and his colleagues had already created a bacterial genome from scratch. Now, as the CEO and cofounder of Human Longevity, Inc., Venter hopes to combine information about various biological features\u2014including the genome, proteome, biome and more\u2014with advanced algorithms and computing to create new therapies to extend our years of high-quality life. director | Center for Drug Evaluation & Research | U.S. Food & Drug Administration Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S. Woodcock helped to develop a regulatory framework to accommodate future advances in biotechnology. Nonetheless, the discipline's effectiveness could be en-hanced even more, she said, through \"greater attention to translational science. \" So far, the biggest impact biotech has had on our daily lives is \"the food revolution, \" she said, adding that \"forms of gene therapy may be 'coming of age.

To increase the effective-ness of biotechnology, we need to build public support and trust. In order to do this, scientists need to stop telling people what they do and start telling them why they do it. It's only after you build trust that science matters. \"MARY BOOTE CEO | Truth About Trade and Technology Des Moines, Iowa, U.S. \"Speaking specifi- cally about agricul - ture, \" Boote said, \"the ability of a farmer to add a much-needed room to his home or pay a child's school fees because of an increased yield due to biotech-crop access is a quality-of-life success story. \" DAVID BOTSTEIN CSO | Calico | South San Francisco, California, U.S. With genomes avail- able for a growing list of organisms, Bot-stein takes the next step\u2014using them to explore complete biological systems. This includes learning to analyze and display biology's genomic big data. BOB BRADWAY chairman and CEO | Amgen Thousand Oaks, California, U.S. Regarding a new manufacturing plant in Singapore, Bradway recently told the Pacific Coast Business Times , \"This is an approach to manufacturing that we think will enable us to reduce our cost per gram of proteins by an order of magnitude of about 60%. \"STEVEN BURRILL CEO | Burrill LLC | San Francisco Bay Area, California, U.S. Looking back on biotech's history, Burrill opined, \"On balance, the science has moved far faster than anyone could have assumed, and the business a little slower. 1,000 years from now when they write the then 3,000 years of recorded history of mankind, this will go down in history as mankind's greatest moment\u2014when we truly, for the first time, understood the basis of life and our ability to improve it, transforming healthcare, agriculture, energy and industrial production. \" ATUL BUTTE director | Institute of Computational Health Sciences | University of Cali-fornia, San Francisco | San Francisco, California, U.S. Discussing the new institute, Butte notes, \"W e hope that we will be successful in making discover - ies and developing diagnostics and therapeutics.

When Ntseoane planted these seeds on two hectares, they pro - duced 7 tons of corn per hectare.

The next year, the Bt corn again produced 7 tons per hect - are for Ntseoane. Even in the follow - ing draught year, every hectare of the Bt corn yielded 5.5 tons. As Ntseoane says, \"Had I not used the new technol - ogy, I wouldn't have harvested much.\" Ntseoane's story illustrates a fun - damental truth in the field of bio - technology: getting the most out of a technical innovation requires vision, courage and commitment\u2014plus the ability to take advantage of available resources. ACCELERATING INNOVATION'S APPLICATION \"Innovation is the creative lifeblood of every country,\" wrote The Honorable Birch Bayh in the forward to Michael A. Gollin's Driving Innovation . Many would argue that the same could be said for the complex and promising field of biotechnology. The question is: How can scien - tists turn \"eureka moments\" into useful products and services more quickly, more effectively? In Think Like a Freak , Steven D. Levitt and Ste - phen J. Dubner write: \"The modern world demands that we all think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally; that we think from a different angle, with a different set of muscles, with a different set of ex - pectations; that we think with neither fear nor favor, with neither blind op - timism or sour skepticism.\" In addition to that new kind of thinking, would-be innovators must also learn from experience. As Lev - itt and Dubner point out, \"The key to learning is feedback. It is nearly In 2009, Scientific American Worldview was launched to bring you the stories behind the numbers presented in our Scorecard of biotechnology innovation potential (page 36). Since then, we have travelled the globe to discover the in-novative technologies that are transforming our field and the lives of those who reap their benefits. Nonetheless, inno-vation alone cannot build an industry. As Google cofounder Larry Page once said: \"Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and inno-vation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.\" Delivering cutting-edge biotechnology to people around the world requires a host of capabilities apart from simply having an innovative concept with great potential. This sec-tion delves into that journey \"from bench to business\" by meeting the researchers, men-tors, CEOs, nonprofit leaders, venture capitalists and end us-ers whose lives and livelihoods have been forever changed by it (see \"From Eureka to Useful,\" this page). Then, a look inside LabCentral's \"launchpad\" for bioentrepreneurs (page 26) and an essay by industry expert Stephen Sammut (page 28) attest to the countless ways people in our field get together to nurture the evolution of ideas into commercial products. As these stories illustrate, this process often takes a number of complicated, yet fascinating, turns along the way. Innovation is the creative lifeblood of every country. FROM EUREKA TO USEFUL Developing an idea into a productive tool demands experience, foresight and a persistent champion BY MIKE MAY For decades, a combination of politics and peer pressure pushed Eve Ntseoane away from farming in her native South Africa. Although her parents both grew up on farms, they couldn't stay there as adults. \"Black people were moved to townships, because of remnants of the Land Native Act of 1913,\" she explains. During school vacations, though, Ntseoane's mother would take her and her brother to a farm where her uncle worked. \"As a child I hated every first few days of the visit, but with chickens and puppies around, I would start enjoying it,\" she remembers. \"One morning my cousin and I climbed on the wagon carrying farmworkers to the corn fields. It was fascinating to help out, though we played most of the time.\" Ntseoane studied agriculture during her first three years of high school, but she says, \"It came with a stigma that farming was for the not-so-clever.\" Eventu - ally, she succumbed to the peer pressure and her parents' wishes, and became a teacher. She only taught for three years before moving to the corporate world, where she worked in communications. Nonetheless, her past and changing social circumstances eventually lured Ntseoane back to the corn fields. Through the South African government's Land Reform Strategy, she obtained a 539-hectare farm south of Johannesburg. The plot is situated \"near a little town called Vanderbijlpark, which is popular for the Vaal Dam that supplies water to most South African provinces,\" she says. She began farming corn, working with traditional varieties. But in 2011, she says, \"AfricaBio, an organization in South Africa, introduced me to Bt maize.\" This corn gains insect resistance through a bacterial gene derived from \u00a9KEITH NEGLEY BENCH TO BUSINESS In South Africa, Eve Ntseoane more than doubled her yield with genetically modified corn.impossible to learn anything without it.\" And when gathering feedback, it never hurts to turn to the best and the brightest, like Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and the author of over 1,000 patents, which have been licensed to more than 300 companies. Langer explains that determining which innovations will lead to great products \"depends a lot on your goal, because lots of things can be useful. I like it to be based on breakthrough sci - ence that could be really game-chang - ing.\" And when assessing the way for - ward\u2014from the discovery in the lab to working toward commercialization\u2014he warns against a common mistake: underestimating the task. \"The major thing people do is underestimate how long it takes, how expensive it is and how many difficulties you'll run into.\" In order to combat these issues, he encourages biotech entrepreneurs to be prepared. \"Surround yourself with great people,\" he says, \"and have more capital rather than less.\" Also, Langer firmly believes that any innovation with a good chance of successful commercialization requires a dedicated, unyielding campaigner. He watches many of his students take their own work down this road, and he says, \"They are real champions of the ideas, and having a champion is very important.\" In fact, Langer gains empowering feedback for himself by watching his students advocate for their own ideas. \"Having students do things that make them happy is very important to me,\" he says. Without a champion, even an amazing idea can fall flat. Langer of - ten cites the Apple corporation as an example. With Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Apple excelled. When the board decided to replace Jobs with a \"professional\" CEO, the organization stumbled through five of them while its business faltered. But when Jobs took over again, it rose to become the world's most valuable company. The lesson, Langer stresses, is that even the most astoundingly innovative ideas need the leadership of a cham - pion to succeed. MAKE THE RIGHT MEASURES The excitement of a eureka moment in the lab, however, can get some sci - entists moving too fast. \"If the ambi - tion is to commercialize an idea,\" says Anders Nordstr\u00f6m, a senior advisor at Sweden's Uppsala Innovation Centre, 24 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW BENCH TO BUSINESS 25\"many scientists focus too much on the technical science. They need to define what it means, the benefit, for the customer.\" Which is not to say that potential buyers can always artic - ulate their precise needs. \"The market need might be there, but the custom - ers might not know it yet,\" he says. Just because someone creates a technical solution of some sort, how - ever, doesn't mean that a market ex - ists for it or can even be created. To determine this, says Nordstr\u00f6m, you \"need to define the market and who will be the customer.\" For instance, Nordstr\u00f6m describes an experience that he had with Swe - den's Mentor4Research program, which was designed to help academic researchers commercialize their ideas. Olle Ericsson, then a researcher at Uppsala University, had a concept for a more efficient sample-preparation kit to be used in next generation se - quencing (NGS). \"Olle had no expe - rience whatsoever in business, but was extremely eager to learn,\" says Nordstr\u00f6m, who was Ericsson's Men - tor4Research advisor. \"Still, we un - derstood that the NGS market was growing tremendously.\" Nordstr\u00f6m helped Ericsson structure the ap - proach, make important contacts and build a company called Halo Genom - ics\u2014which Agilent Technologies soon acquired\u2014that eventually turned the innovation into a product called Halo - Plex. As Nordstr\u00f6m recalls, \"We knew we were in a very hot market.\" For most innovators, however, the road ahead is rarely that clear. Typically, says Nordstr\u00f6m, \"You have to start with assumptions, and then try to validate them through a net - work of experts. From that, you can see if the assumptions sound reason - able or not.\" Building a community of advisors helps scientists test these assumptions (see \"Room to Grow,\" page 26). Start-up expert Steve Blank, ar - chitect of the U.S. National Institutes of Health's I-Corps @NIH program, which teaches scientists and clinicians how to take their biotech ideas from lab bench to bedside, agrees. \"We now understand that innovation in life sci - ences requires two parallel paths,\" he says. \"First, making the science better and useful. But second, we need to understand how to commercialize the science. We never had a formal pro - cess to test whether the science could turn into a commercially successful product. We do now.\" The I-Corps/Lean LaunchPad methodology, which Blank devel - oped, allows for rapid testing and learning. \"People hypothesize in the lab but rarely think of things like 'Who do you think will pay for this?'\" he explains. To find out, Blank makes scientists in the program go out and talk to at least 100 potential customers. \"The princi - pal investigators must get out and see the people,\" he says. \"For one thing, you might find that the market wants something that you have but that you thought no one would want.\" What are the most common mis - takes made in turning an innovative idea into something commercial? \"The biggest mistake is thinking that your faith is fact,\" says Blank. The I-Corps @NIH addresses that problem when it makes an innovator take an idea to the real world. \"You start with faith in your idea and then replace as much of that with fact as soon as pos - sible,\" he says. Making the right assumptions about the market, however, solves nothing without the right science. Sean Ainsworth\u2014now CEO of Retro-Sense Therapeutics in Ann Arbor, Michigan\u2014learned that the hard way. \"In a previous company,\" he says, \"we were working on a science that hadn't been as fully validated as it needed to be.\" And unfortunate - ly, the company was already rais - ing capital and lining up customers when obstacles in its research turned up. \"We returned the money to the investors,\" Ainsworth says, \"and we took the science back to the lab.\" That experience made Ainsworth extra cautious with RetroSense\u2014a company with a gene therapy that repairs vision in people with retini-tis pigmentosa or age-related macu - lar degeneration. \"We ensured that it wasn't just one individual who had developed and published something,\" he says. \"In this case, it had been done with people around the world.\" With solid research in place, RetroSense has continued to thrive. In fact, it re - cently raised US$6 million to file an investigational new drug (IND) appli - cation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). SPREAD THE CAPABILITIES Indeed, developing an innovative product and finding a market for it is a challenging feat under the best of circumstances. But, not surprisingly, in some areas of the world it is far easier than in others. As the founder and CEO of Seeding Labs in Boston, Massachusetts, Nina Dudnik sees this disparity firsthand. Her organization works to bring advanced scientific in - struments and training to developing countries. When asked if scientists in developing nations suffer more from a lack of the tools needed to innovate or from a need for the means to com - mercialize their innovations, Dudnik points out that the two are inextri - cable linked. \"There are obstacles at every point along the way,\" she says. \"For the scientists we serve, the first barrier is usually related to a lack of access, not potential. Without access to the tools and infrastructure needed to make discoveries, the potential to innovate based on that research is se - verely diminished.\" Which is exactly why Seeding Labs is committed to providing that access. For the moment, the dearth of equipment seems to be the dominant concern in developing countries. As Dudnik says, \"From my observation, the difficulty in obtaining resources for research itself overshad-ows the focus on taking the discoveries out of the lab and into the market.\" Helping these nations become biotech innovators who can get their ideas or products to market also re - quires a highly-skilled workforce. \"Being in an innovation hub like Boston,\" Dudnik says, \"it's very clear that building human capability is ab - solutely critical to making the whole pipeline work.\" (See \"Biotechnology's Crucial Question,\" page 28.) Many groups work together to build human capacity in the Nor - dic countries, which consistently rank high on the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard. On this year's list, for example, Denmark, Finland and Sweden placed second, sixth and eighth, respectively. SCANDINAVIAN SUCCESS To power innovation, the Scandina - vian countries collaborate on many levels. For example, Sweden's non - profit Uppsala BIO works to promote regional and national growth in the life sciences. Uppsala BIO's CEO, Erik Forsberg, says, \"We try to identify gaps in the system. What could make the life science sector grow more ef - ficiently?\" He answers part of his own question, saying, \"It mostly comes down to innovation.\" Also, in terms of getting an in - novation onto the market, projects must cross the so-called \"Valley of Death\"\u2014that no man's land where a concept is not far enough along to attract financial support but des - perately needs it to move ahead. To increase the odds of crossing that di - vide, Uppsala BIO created the BIO-X program. \"Here,\" says Forsberg, \"we can provide support through a net - work of competence\u2014from users, such as clinicians, and from people with significant industrial experi - ence. In addition, BIO-X can provide participants with a couple hundred thousand dollars for a couple years.\" After that, says Forsberg, \"You'll need other funders.\" The \"other funders\" in Sweden, and most other countries, provide venture capital (VC). To gain a bet - ter understanding of how biotechnol - ogy VC works in Sweden, Scientific American Worldview talked with Eu - gen Steiner, CEO of Glionova Thera - peutics in Stockholm and a venture partner for HealthCap, a family of VC funds investing in international life science research. In addition, Steiner has served as the CEO for several small start-ups. Although he admits his bias as a partner in a VC firm, Steiner says, \"There would be no biotech industry if there were no VCs.\" Biased or not, few in the field would disagree with Steiner's blunt assessment, because it takes money\u2014often lots of it\u2014to commercialize an innovation. How VCs invest in biotechnol - ogy, though, depends on the overall economic environment, says Steiner. When the general economy is in de - cline, as in 2008, financing for biotech firms tends to dry up. This is a huge stumbling block for fledgling inno - vators. \"However, even when no one wants to invest in biotech,\" he says, \"there are always some companies seen as the best ones.\" Those busi - nesses tend to be further along, and in troubled economic times, they're the ones that get the VC. Such is the law of the VC jungle. And while being backed by excep - tional science greatly improves the odds of getting funding to turn an in - novation into a product, investors need to be convinced. \"Bring as much data to the table as possible,\" Steiner says. Impressive data, however, won't always be enough to ensure that one particular eureka moment leads to a groundbreaking product that's used around the globe, or anywhere, for that matter. Many other factors\u2014from Ntseoane's hard work on her farm in South Africa to Langer help - ing a student commercialize a re - search result\u2014come into play in mov - ing biotechnology forward. The best results emerge when great science is championed by an experienced team that lives and breathes persistence. Only then can biotechnology innova - tions change the world. The biggest mistake is thinking that your faith is fact.\u00ab Seeding Labs sends scientific equipment and expertise to developing countries.26 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW BENCH TO BUSINESS 27 a push-me/pull-you exchange of ideas made up a primary requirement in our specifications for LabCentral's design. The result is an open floor plan with a very deliber - ate traffic flow pattern and transparent work, lab and play spaces that inspire collaboration and sharing. The com - mon corridor gently insists that LabCentral's residents see each other multiple times per day. Labs are strategically located in the middle, with offices and amenities at either end. A key to the flow is the caf\u00e9. Food and good coffee bring people out of their workspaces, encouraging engage - ment and interaction, as do regular \"lunch and learn\" pro - grams, big-screen movie and sports-viewing parties, and social- and business-networking events. RAPID UPTAKE We quickly learned that Peter and I were not alone in thinking that start-ups in biotech needed LabCentral. In 14 months, 29 early-stage companies that work in the life sciences moved into LabCentral, and about 125 residents work here every day. Upon moving in, the typical company consists of four people or less, most of them from academic institutions or teaching hospitals. To move forward with their technol - ogy, they have already secured the rights to the underlying intellectual property through an option or a license agree - ment. Many are repeat founders or CEOs with experience launching and growing life science ventures. Others are first-time entrepreneurs. Having started working at LabCentral, companies may grow, adding headcount quickly. Because they have access to millions of dollars worth of the best lab equipment pos - sible, they can perform experiments that they could never have dreamed of if they had to do it alone. What's more, they can spend their capital and time on advancing their science rather than buying equipment or building infra - structure. This gives them the flexibility to morph their original vision into one with greater promise, to reach their milestones more quickly, and makes it more likely for them to succeed overall. Although some might call LabCentral an incubator, we eschew that term. It suggests that biotech start-ups are fragile, needing life support to survive. The opposite is true for the companies we select to take residency here. So, we call ourselves a launchpad\u2014speeding strong companies to take off. We accept only start-ups with the highest po - tential. In 2014 alone, our residents brought in more than $200 million in venture capital and other sources of fund - ing. That's about the same amount of venture capital raised by all of Switzerland's biotech companies in 2014. EARLY RETURNS Providing biotech entrepreneurs with a fertile environ - ment with the best infrastructure, equipment, services and programming to enable their unfettered practice of science on day one is LabCentral's raison d'\u00eatre . Already, LabCentral is at the center of the Kendall Square bioinno - vation ecosystem, which fosters collaboration and creative exchange of science and business ideas among our entre - preneurs and the countless scientists, thought leaders, in - dustry experts and potential funders who work at the aca - demic- and industry-research institutions, venture firms, law practices and equipment/service suppliers nearby. The LabCentral environment provides tremendous flexibility that spurs innovation. As Michael Schrader, cofounder and CEO of Vaxess Technologies, explains: \"LabCentral has allowed us not to expend a ton of money for equipment or long-term leases. As we look to expand, we have grown our network of contacts tenfold through the collection of compa-nies at LabCentral, compared to operat - ing on our own. We love the facility, the open floor plan and comingling with other teams who are not directly competing with our science, but rather com - plementing it\u2014 facing the same challenges in fundraising, science and business development, from whom we can learn and with whom we can share to the benefit of all.\" Schrader's neighbors agree. \"LabCentral makes it as easy to start a biotech company as it is to st art a purely IT company,\" says P. Shannon Pendergrast, cofounder and chief science officer of Ymir Genomics. \"It provides the critical infrastructure, including sophisticated scientific equipment bio-innovators need to excel.\" Most important, he adds, it allows Pendergrast and his fellow bioentrepre - neurs the freedom to focus on the work at hand: \"All I have to do is science.\" Johannes Fruehauf is the president and executive director of LabCentral.

ROOM TO GROW LabCentral gives start-ups the space and resources to thrive BY JOHANNES FRUEHAUF In 2006, when Peter Parker and I started Cequent Pharmaceuticals, we needed a place to work, to do our science. There were loads of space options for tech companies that only needed a good computer and a high-speed Internet connection to launch a blockbuster, but few options for biotechnology com - panies like ours. We needed labs with sophisticat - ed\u2014meaning expensive\u2014equipment, and the permitting, infrastructure and people to support it. Getting the right lab space setup took us six months and consumed precious resources, both human and financial, that we should have been spending on science. There had to be a better way. In 2010, we started to believe that sharing could be the answer. We had just sold Cequent, and Peter and I both started new ventures\u2014Bio-Innovation for Peter and Cam - bridge Biolabs for me\u2014at the Cambridge Innovation Cen - ter (CIC). At that facility, we thrived in the creative atmo - sphere of the shared space, and decided to try to adapt the co-working model into a shared laboratory environment for biotechnology. Cambridge Biolabs proved the concept that a biotech can get started on a small scale in a shared lab space. So Peter and I joined forces with Tim Rowe, CIC's founder and CEO, to found a nonprofit called LabCentral. A US$5 mil - lion grant from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center got us started, and we opened in late 2013 on Kendall Square in Cambridge. Over time, we leveraged that funding to bring in nearly $20 million in additional commitments of cash, state-of-the-art equipment and in-kind services. FILLING A VOID Biotech start-ups need lab space and resources to test out, challenge and nurture early ideas. To do that, these bud - ding companies usually need affordable, move-in-ready laboratory facilities. That's just what LabCentral provides, and more. It gives emerging life science companies the bench space, equipment, infrastructure and services that they need for the early-stage research that is necessary to transition into commercial-stage enterprises. Nonetheless, it's the \"more\" that makes up LabCen - tral's \"secret sauce.\" As the tech world figured out long ago, ideas expand when they can bump, mix and mingle with others; but this rarely occurs in life sciences start-ups, which typically set up in traditional lab settings with distinct and separate accommodations. Mingling hap - pens every day at LabCentral, and deliberately. In fact, Case Study: The result is an open floor plan with a very deliberate traffic flow pattern and transparent work, lab and play spaces that inspire collaboration and sharing.\u00a9KEITH NEGLEY / PHOTOS: \u00a9PAUL AVIS28 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW BENCH TO BUSINESS 29The reflexive answer to this question is most likely: the technology. Without a new meth - od, cure, device or something that makes a difference in the lives of people or communities, there has been no progress. As true as that rings, there is at the very least a code - pendence of the underlying technol - ogy and the people who turn it into reality. Some might argue\u2014myself included\u2014that the biotechnology in -dustry is entirely people driven and enabled. The very definition and re - alization of a product needs definers and builders who know how to find and marshal the necessary intellec - tual, managerial and financial capital to make things happen. The human resources biotechnology demands fall into four broad categories: Scientific and technical. This includes the Ph.D.s and other graduates in the life and medical sciences, whether they be recently minted or with decades of experience in the industry. The production of life and medical Ph.D. scientists has largely been addressed in most coun - tries throughout the world. Whether there are an adequate number of aca - demic or industrial positions for these scientists is a question that is beyond the scope of this article. Managerial & administrative. This category consists of the people educated or experienced as strategic thinkers, organizers and coordinators of either academic or commercial en - terprises. In biotechnology, many of the people in this category were trained as scientists and moved from the bench to the boardroom. While there are some forward-thinking academic programs that combine Ph.D. studies in the life sciences with MBA studies, managers in biotechnology usually emerge either from the marketing side of the bio-pharma industry or from the laboratory where they have accrued successive re - sponsibilities in research management. These managers are necessary for the success of an existing organization, but insufficient to drive the \"new.\" Entrepreneurial founders. Although these people make up a sub - set of scientists, managers or a com - bination of the two, it is best to break them out into a separate category, because the risk affinity\u2014or toler - ance\u2014of the entrepreneur is typically the starting point of new venture cre - ation in this industry and all others. Entrepreneurs possess a combination of native skills, education, experience and personality traits that put them in a category of their own. Some are aware early in their careers that en - trepreneurship is their career destiny. Others discover their inner-entrepre - neurship tendencies after years of commercial responsibilities that build their confidence and hone their skills. Entrepreneurial enablers. The entrepreneurial academic litera - ture implies, but seldom studies, this category. Entrepreneurial enablers are the experienced managers of functional areas\u2014such as technol - ogy and information management, strategy and marketing, finance and operations\u2014who have the risk toler - ance and drive to make something new happen, but who might not in - dependently have the vision for a new business. They know a talented founder and leader when they see one and a sound idea when they examine one, but they see themselves as team players and experts in their respec - tive fields. Without the enablers, there would still be entrepreneurs, but not many of them would be successful. ENTREPRENEURIAL EQUATIONS What, then, does the biotechnology industry need in the way of human resources? To answer that, we can look at the census of biotechnology companies. According to a 2011 OECD (Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development) study, the United States had the largest number of biotechnology firms\u20146,213\u2014with the 18 reporting countries from the European Union having a total of 5,398. That's about 11,500 firms before we start counting Japan, Australia, New Zealand or the emerging markets. For round numbers, let's stipulate that there are 15,000 companies globally in the industry. How does that census translate into people with entrepreneurial lean - ings? It means there must be 15,000 entrepreneurial founders. If each com - pany needs, say, six entrepreneurial enablers, that would compute to a to - tal of 90,000 of them worldwide. So, overall, the industry requires 105,000 bio-entrepreneurs. Beyond the numbers, these lead - ers have to possess many capabilities: Leadership: formulate human re - source needs and manage the hiring and development of teams. Strategic thinking: make choices based on alternatives and options.Tactical planning: organize resourc - es to achieve strategic ends. Technology assessment: manage a team that can review scientific opportunities and select those that justify a commercial strategy and al - locate resources proportional to the opportunity. Market assessment: recognize and measure the potential of a technology-driven product to meet unmet cus - tomer and commercial needs, com - pete with alternatives, achieve a level of pricing that justifies the investment and assures sustainability, and that can be promoted with a clear, dis - tinct, ethical and persuasive message. Regulatory development: define and manage the process through which the products must be assessed. Intellectual property management: form, maintain and maximize intel - lectual property assets internationally and domestically through a variety of strategies, including licensing and partnering. Capital formation, replenishment and stabilization: define capital re - quirements and sources over long time periods, and accumulate the fi - nancial resources necessary to meet the development and commercial ob - jectives of the company. Communication management: en - capsulate the mission and methods of the company into a succinct and persuasive message in order to attract human resources, build internal con - sensus, drive strategy and operations in an organized fashion, assure stake -holders that the company is mindful of the totality of challenges and ob - tain needed financing. Impact management: marshal the assets and resources of the company towards defined needs in an ethical manner that delivers the greatest good to the greatest number of people. This knowledge comes from for - mal training and experience. Al - though it is unreasonable to expect that an intensive approach to impart - ing the associated insights would ever compete with disciplined study over years or the lessons associated with making day-to-day and strategic choices, teaching can be developed to provide new entre - preneurs and entre - preneurial enablers with a toolbox for orienting their thinking and laying a groundwork for immediate action as well as long-term study. Achieving that, however, requires a conscious, deliberate effort aimed at identifying the needs of the industry vis-\u00e0-vis the talents and experiences of people willing to dedicate their careers to the field. Those needs will change over time, but like biology itself, education and training will adapt. What matters most in this industry is, therefore, its people. Stephen M. Sammut is a senior fellow, health care management at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and developer of the Biotechnology Entrepreneurship Boot Camp. BIOTECHNOLOGY'S CRUCIAL QUESTION In this industry, what matters the most: technology or people? BY STEPHEN M. SAMMUT Teaching can be developed to provide new entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial enablers with a toolbox for orienting their thinking and laying a ground-work for immediate action as well as long-term study. \u00a9KEITH NEGLEY30 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW COMMUNICATION 31 funding. Federal and provincial legislators pledged millions of dol - lars to support clinical studies. That research, however, failed to confirm Zamboni's hypothesis. The liberation procedure proved ineffective and pos - sibly dangerous. Shortcomings of Social Media The Zamboni escapade was not the first time that a scientific claim hyped in the media turned out to be wrong. Thanks to the growing power of social media, public campaigns built around questionable healthcare re - porting might have an increasingly large influence on medical research and healthcare. According to Roger Chafe, a health policy expert at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, the rise of Facebook, Twitter and other social networks reinforces the im - portance of professional healthcare journalism. After all, he says, reports from the mainstream media are often the ones that get passed around\u2014and those same stories are more likely to influence key policymakers. \"Without the link to traditional media,\" Chafe says, social media \" just doesn't seem to have the same kind of traction.\" Yet, according to Gary Schwit - zer, founder of the watchdog website HealthNewsReview, traditional media sources are still routinely disseminat - ing misleading health information. Schwitzer and a team of reviewers looked at about 1,900 health-related stories about drugs, medical devices or other interventions published by U.S. news organizations between 2006 and 2013. As Schwitzer reported in July 2014 in JAMA Internal Medicine , most of the stories overplayed ben - efits, minimized harms and ignored discussions of cost. This kind of poor reporting can have real-world consequences. For example, after U.S. regulators issued health advisories about a slightly in - creased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in young people who take antidepressants, widespread media coverage spurred a dramatic decline in antidepressant use. According to a study published in BMJ in June 2014, this had an unintended consequence: suicide attempts increased among ado - lescents and young adults, most likely due to an under-treatment of serious mental health disorders. \"The sexy sto - ry isn't 'Be cautious and think careful - ly about medicines,'\" says psychiatrist Steven Schlozman, associate director of the Center for Mental Health and Media at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \"The sexy story is 'These medicines might kill your chil - dren.' There's not much of a story if you report it in nuanced tones.\" Pushing Prescriptions More often, press coverage leads con - sumers toward increasing health - care utilization\u2014sometimes even for problems they might not have. In a phenomenon known as \"disease mongering,\" pharmaceutical compa - nies have even co-opted the media to convince people that they are sick and in need of medical treatment. Such was the case with restless legs syndrome. Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clini - cal Practice in Lebanon, New Hamp - shire, analyzed the media stories writ - ten in response to press releases in the mid-2000s from GlaxoSmithKline, the company behind the first drug ap - proved for the syndrome. As the re - searchers reported in PLoS Medicine in April 2006, most journalists un - critically reported GlaxoSmithKline's claims, encouraging more diagnosis and treatment. \"Many of the stories that we looked at sounded like com - pany press releases,\" says Schwartz. In a 2013 article in JAMA Internal Medi - cine, she and Woloshin documented similar campaigning through the me - dia to promote hormone-replacement therapy for low testosterone in men\u2014now a multi-billion-dollar industry. Beyond sloppy reporting, part of the problem could lie in the financial ties between medical journalists and drug companies. Wendy Lipworth, a bioethicist at the University of Syd - ney, has studied this issue in Austra - lia. She thinks that more disclosure is needed on the part of journalists and that some kinds of monetary re - lationships should be banned. But, she concedes, it might be difficult to implement these remedies in an in - creasingly fractured media landscape. It's not just journalists who are to blame, though. A December 2014 study in BMJ from Petroc Sumner of Cardiff University found that press releases from the UK's leading re - search universities often made their own overblown claims and unwar - ranted inferences about health stud - ies. Scientists usually vet and approve the press releases issued by their insti - tutions, and thus must shoulder some of the accountability for the inaccura - cies and exaggerations that creep into stories about their research. In the end, everyone carries some responsibility\u2014from the media con - sumers hungry for miraculous cures to the companies seeking profits, and everyone in between. As Sumner says, \"All of us are not watchful enough.\"The Zamboni escapade was not the first time that a scientific claim hyped in the media turned out to be wrong.In the field of biotechnology, the communication of ideas is often complicated by the variety of players taking part in the conversation. Companies address consumers through internal mechanisms and the media. The media speaks to company representatives and members of the public. Trade groups also get involved on many levels. The web of people talking to each other gets tangled. And often much more is at stake than merely the communication of an idea. Whether a start-up sinks or swims can be determined by its ability to clearly convey its strengths and objectives. More important, if the media gets a story wrong, the general population may face undue health risks as a result. Indeed, it's crucial to get communication right in biotechnology, and, as the following stories demonstrate, that's not always easy to do .On a Saturday night in November 2009, Canada's most-watched television network, CTV, ran a primetime documentary that would radically change the country's healthcare land - scape. The Globe and Mail \u2014a popular Canadian newspaper and part of the same media conglomerate\u2014carried a companion story on its front page. The story focused on Paolo Zam - boni, an Italian vascular surgeon who claimed to have discovered the true cause of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although physicians have long con - tended that MS is an autoimmune disorder, Zamboni theorized that it is actually a disease triggered by narrowing of veins in the neck. He asserted that this vascular constric - tion created a build-up of iron that, in turn, set off the cascade of inflamma - tion and nerve degeneration that are the hallmarks of the disease. Zam - boni advocated a treatment similar to balloon angioplasty. He even tested the surgical intervention on his MS-afflicted wife and, as the CTV docu - mentary displayed, her symptoms seemingly melted away. The treat - ment, nicknamed the \"liberation pro - cedure,\" was touted as a miracle cure. It was a powerful and emotional story, but scientifically unfounded. The media coverage\u2014based only on the most preliminary of Zamboni's findings\u2014spurred \"an over-enthu - siastic and inadvertent promotion of some shaky science,\" Andr\u00e9 Picard, the Globe and Mail journalist who coauthored the original newspaper story on the procedure, wrote in BMC Medical Ethics in February 2013. After the initial reports made the rounds on the Internet, the public started demanding that health au - thorities make the procedure avail - able in Canada. The media coverage snowballed, prompting an unprec - edented amount of political involve - ment in the allocation of research A HEALTHY DIALOGUE \u00a9ALEX NABAUMTHE TRICKY SCIENCE OF COMMUNICATION How the healthcare media impacts policymakers and the public BY ELIE DOLGIN32 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW COMMUNICATION 33Despite decades of global - ly expanding use of ge - netically modified (GM) crops, broad public ac - ceptance still eludes this technology. The history of the dialogue behind these crops, however, reveals what we can learn from communications science. Over the past 20 to 30 years, the world has changed considerably, with populations becoming aware of the risks in their everyday lives. Conse - quently, people in general have grown more averse to risk. With health scares in food and agriculture, like mad-cow disease in the United Kingdom and melamine in infant formula in China, people around the world have started losing trust in the people and organi - zations that regulate the risks. The evolution of how people deal with risk is a popular social concept\u2014dubbed the \"risk society\" by German sociologist Ulrich Beck\u2014that has resulted in an environment today where new technologies are scruti - nized more, and GM crops have been embroiled in controversy from their introduction. Such controversial sub - ject matter requires specific handling from a communications standpoint. The ongoing controversy shows how this has largely failed. Following Failed Philosophies In many cases, efforts to communi - cate about GM crops have followed a linear, educational, one-way delivery, focused mainly on technical elements of the science. Likewise, these efforts failed to discuss, or even acknowledge, broader interpretations of risk, such as psychological and social factors. Many of the messages focused on benefits to farmers and informing a \"rational\" debate. In the 1970s, however, Nobel laureate and Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahn - eman and his late colleague Amos Tversky showed that decision making about risk is neither purely rational nor purely \"irrational.\" Still, many biotechnology organizations employ a strategic and tactical mandate pred - icated on only \"rational\" thinking. Some experts know that informa - tion cannot be the sole source of com - munication about GM crops to re - ally get across the point. Recently, Paul Teng, chairman of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), said: \"Communication is key for GM prod - uct acceptance, but just sharing infor - mation alone is not sufficient. Infusing values into communication messages will contribute greatly to making GM products part of everyday life.\" Still, some groups try to get across those messages with techniques that are known to be flawed. For instance, creating \"independent\" third-party organizations to deliver the mes - sage\u2014a common technique among agencies retained to advocate for GM crops\u2014has been widely questioned at high levels. In a 2013 speech, for example, Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organi - zation, provided insight into the tac - tics of large regulated industries\u2014big food, big soda and big alcohol\u2014and said: \"They include front groups, lob - bies, promises of self-regulation, law - suits and industry-funded research that confuses the evidence and keeps the public in doubt.\" Likewise, the use of so-called credible experts, largely appointed for their technical expertise, has lost much of its value, yet it remains at the top of the list of approaches to com - munications about GM crops. Even worse, some groups have tried putting a modern twist on the tactics of big tobacco in 1950s and '60s, such as cre - ating fake online grassroots groups and identities extolling the virtues of GM crops. It's hard to imagine what could do more harm to earning trust. Even Facts May Fail Experts, including regulators, view risk as measurable hazard, the product of probability and magnitude. People facing the risks, however, tend to focus more on what concerns them, rather than the \"technical\" hazard itself. Peter Sandman, one of risk communi - cation's pioneering practitioners, calls this concern \"outrage,\" and it's a pow - erful force that can escalate if not ad - dressed. Moreover, outrage might even increase in the face of sound technical data, because the higher concerns are not addressed and these facts may con - flict with deeply held cultural views and commitments. Industry often shuns this higher level of the risk debate. Instead, indus - try tends to reframe the issues in terms of technical expertise and experience, where it is undoubtedly most comfort - able. Simply put, facts about the risk are not what those with concerns need to hear to address their reservations. Nonetheless, communications around GM crops continue to focus on the facts. The communicators have assumed that the public just needed more information, and that a better-informed public would be more in - clined to accept biotechnology for what it is. Both research and experience, however, fail to support this so-called \"deficit model\" of communication. Al - though the first academic papers that questioned the \"knowledge gap\" hy - pothesis were published in 1996, only recently have the critics of the deficit model been gaining traction. Seeking Solutions Changing deficit-model approaches will require a better understanding of why people oppose the use of ge - netically modified organisms (GMOs) from the perspective of risk and trust. Public engagement\u2014as a concerted exercise in understanding respect (based on shared values and inter - ests), uncertainties and, critically, vulnerabilities\u2014will be essential. Moving forward will require au - thentic communication that does not rely on public-relations strategies, such as propaganda and third-party techniques. It will require products that consumers personally benefit from and can control their expo - sure to. Furthermore, industry must make more concerted efforts to be trustworthy, and a major part of this will be to increase the perceptions of shared values and benevolence. Simi - larly, regulators must do far more to safeguard the public trust, especially in complex cases that often hinge around degrees of uncertainty. Many factors conspire to make the acceptance of GM crops diffi - cult. Nonetheless, communicators in biotechnology, especially in North America and Australia, now accept the need to address the cultural values that come into play in communicat - ing about GMOs. For example, GMO Answers\u2014a U.S. industry initia - tive\u2014is a first effort to be responsive to viewpoints in a direct and candid way. As this initiative is duplicated in other countries, cultural aspects of the communication process will need to be assimilated into the process. This could well be a first step toward the development of a cultural cogni - tion theory of risk communication for GM crops that aims to deeply as - similate cultural values into a process not aimed at acceptance, but aimed at putting people in the best possible position to make a decision consistent with their values and beliefs. Science communicators should continually monitor social-science re - search to gain further insights into the groups with which we are communi - cating. As a result, we will learn to un - derstand existing and new concerns\u2014not just about GMOs, but also about all areas of innovation. When there are perceptions of risk, we should use the science of communication in the com - munication of science. If we do, some of the glaring problems with GMO communication might be addressed.

BREAKING THE BAD-GUY IMAGE Johnson & Johnson's Seema Kumar urges companies to stay transparent \"For a long time, industry has been seen as the bad guy,\" says Seema Kumar, vice president of innovation, global health and policy communication at Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, New Jersey, \"but a huge gap exists in covering the important translational research that goes on in industry R&D.\" She points out that industry science, which involves translating basic research into practical healthcare solutions, has \"a huge impact on our health and well-being.\" Despite what she considers a wealth of newsworthy science and technology stories transpiring in industry, she doesn't see them getting covered, which disappoints her. \"I've been feeling that we are not doing enough as a community\u2014industry's science communi-cators and the press corps\u2014in talking about science in business and industry,\" she says. Improving this situation, Kumar explains, will require greater efforts from all members of the com-munity. Science writers have to be better educated about how science and R&D work in the industry, and industry science communicators need to do more to engage with the science press corps. Accordingly, she urges everyone in industry healthcare communications to \"be more welcoming, open and transparent.\" She adds, \"We have to spend time building relationships that engender trust and a sense of shared purpose.\" In one such collaborative relationship, for example, Johnson & Johnson has made its clinical trial data available for research through the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project. \"When we announced this agreement,\" says Kumar, \"the response was unbelievably positive inside and outside of our company.\" Ultimately, this type of cooperative exchange will result in a deeper understanding of the work being done. \"We absolutely can't underestimate the impor-tance of communication in science,\" says Kumar. \"The more we\u2014journalists and corporate science communicators\u2014can do to showcase how important science is to society, the more it will benefit all of us in building a scientific power-house, an innovative country.\" \u2014MIKE MAY COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN Looking at the GMO controversy through the lens of communications science BY ANDREW D. ROBERTS & ANDREW D. POWELL \u00a9ALEX NABAUM34 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW PROFILE 35PARTNER PROFILE The irony of our modern era, where precision medicine, molecular diagnostics, targeted therapies and other major medical innovations on the horizon are help-ing to individualize and personalize treatments while revolutionizing en-tire categories of disease, is that all of these tools and solution providers are not working as effectively and efficiently as they could. The stake-holder least able to take advantage of the progress of precision medicine is the patient. While patients may be informed, even empowered with medical information, they do not have any way to act upon the data, leveraging every possible avenue toward the best care options pos- sible for their very specific diagnosis and minimizing the chance of any potential treatment slipping through the cracks. The ultimate goal of our medical ecosystem is to identify the causes of disease and proceed with the most effective treatment as effi-ciently and timely as possible. While the last two decades have seen the rise in more available sources of information through web hubs, new apps and other platforms, the task of assessing large amounts of informa-tion and acting intelligently on it can be daunting for patients, as well as other stakeholders in the system. The fear that one is wasting time while the disease progresses brings that gnawing feeling in the pit of the stomach. The worry that a brand new therapy or clinical trial that might offer hope could be unseen, unavailable or simply unknowable is a source of frustration and some-times hopelessness. We all know too well, whether personally or through family members, the anguish of receiv - ing a difficult diagnosis of a deadly disease. Even in an era of boundless health information, digital connec-tivity and modern diagnostic tools, patients and their loved ones can feel powerless against the forces of their condition. Questions inevitably arise: \"Am I doing EVERYTHING that can be done to combat my illness? Do I truly understand the molecular diagnosis and am I able to have a thorough discussion with my doctor? Are there clinical trials available as an option for me to explore? How do I even do that?\" This questioning and trying to find relevant information quickly can, in short order, become daunting, time consuming and ulti-mately frustrating. ENTER CURE FORWARD, A PATIENT ACTIVATION COMPANY. Cure Forward is lead- ing the way towards innovative health solutions that put patients in the driver's seat and gives them the abil-ity to take advantage of every option of care available to them, activating ALL parts of the health ecosystem. Leveraging the power of sci- ence and the power of community, Cure Forward seeks to provide a 360-degree approach for the entirety of the medical ecosystem, Cure Forward puts patients in the driver's seat and gives them the ability to take advantage of every option of care available to them, activating ALL parts of the health ecosystem.For Patients - Cure Forward aims to make science relevant, understandable and action-able for patients. The proprietary platform will enable patients to: \u00bb Learn about diagnostic testing and clinical trials. This information will help them in dialogues with their doctor about ordering tumor-profil-ing and other tests that can provide better outcomes. \u00bb Electronically retrieve their test results from diagnostic labs into their Cure Forward account. If their lab doesn't make results available on the network, users will be able to enter results manually or send their report to Cure Forward for manual transcription. \u00bb Read Gene Stories, magazine articles written by journalists to tell the story of each gene and describe its importance in cancer care. The stories are designed to make ge-nomic findings understandable and memorable to ordinary people. \u00bb Post their information to a clinical trial exchange, a marketplace where trial sponsors can see them for the duration of their post and then invite them to apply to their trials. This is the opposite of blind searches on the Internet. \u00bb Interact with other patients on the platform. Patients will be matched to \"tribes\" who resemble them on molecular, clinical, personal, and demographic factors, or set up their own tribes. Within tribes, people will be able to ask and answer questions or share relevant information. For Health Care Providers - As personalized and \"precision\" medicine approaches become in-creasingly available and relevant in managing genetic-related diseases like cancer, health care providers (HCPs) are faced with the chal-lenge of effectively describing test results to patients. This is especially difficult in a short office visit. The Cure Forward Gene Stories will be available to HCPs as teaching tools. Additionally, through a linking process in Cure Forward software, patients will be able to connect with their HCPs and cooperate on trial matching. HCPs will also be able to view the Cure Forward test directory to find tests that might be useful for their patients. For Diagnostic Test Providers - Because patients, their families, and their physicians will use Cure Forward to find tests that may be relevant to their care, Cure Forward is a potent marketing channel for di-agnostic laboratory partners (DLPs). Cure Forward DLPs will have the distinction of being patient-friendly in their stance about patient access and use of their data. Patients inevitably have questions about their genomic test results. These are complex tests, often with many findings that are not read-ily understood. Cure Forward can answer many of the basic questions that otherwise might be handled by the testing laboratory. Consumer-level customer support can be time consuming, and partnering with Cure Forward will help a laboratory focus its time and resources toward its main objectives of providing high quality testing and interpretation. A recent U.S. Health and Human Services rule stipulates that patients can access their diagnostic test re-sults directly from the test provider. This rule, while progressive and potentially beneficial to the patient, can result in extra work for labora-tories, who may not have systems in place for constructive delivery of test results. Cure Forward can be a con-structive channel for results delivery, without added cost or time commit-ment from the DLP. Cure Forward does not charge its DLPs for this marketing presence and constructive results delivery.For Clinical Trial Recruiters - Clinical research is where trans-formational therapies are proven. But it can take 2-3 years to fill a targeted trial, and more than half of trial sites fail to accrue a single patient! 85% of patients don't know that clinical trials are an option to consider, yet 75% say they would seriously consider a trial if it were available. Patients in the community setting are simply not visible to trial sponsors until they apply for entry, and too often those applications never come. Cure Forward offers a mechanism for patients to instan-taneously make themselves visible to all recruiting trials that might suit them. Trial sponsors receive notifica-tions when relevant patients post, and can then invite those patients to apply through the platform. Patients choose from their available invita-tions, and Cure Forward makes the introductions. By applying a marketplace solu- tion to a scientific problem, Cure Forward aims to increase patient participation in clinical research, to help individuals gain access to new therapies and to help those new innovations get to market sooner for everyone else. No money will ever change hands unless a trial recruiter has already experienced success recruiting through Cure Forward. That means fast, broad, precise, low-cost recruit-ing, and pay-for-performance eco-nomics. This is a new way to accrue clinical studies.

It is truly the first Patient Activation Company. In the same way multi-sided technology platforms proactively connect relevant stakeholders to produce value for all parties, much like Airbnb or Kickstarter, Cure Forward will enable patients, with complete anonymity and privacy, to access their molecular data (a tumor profile), understand it through educational tools, connect with pa-tients across the world with similar conditions, and give the patients the ability to seek out clinical trials in a simple way without having to have an advanced degree to understand the complexities of the trial require-ments. A patient does not have to trawl endless trial descriptions or fear they won't connect to all of the information available. Innova-tive new therapeutics can quickly find their beneficiaries through an activated patient network. And com-munities, created around specific disease states, molecular profiles and other criteria, will be valuable sources of support, information and timely input.10 UNITED KINGDOMAUSTRALIA FRANCE CANADAUNITED STATES GERMANY DENMARK SWEDEN SWITZERLAND ISRAEL NETHERLANDSBELGIUM IRELAND NORWAY CHINA JAPAN HONG KONG INDONESIA AUSTRIA FINLAND POLAND TAIWAN, CHINA .30 .30 .27 .21 .14 .13 .10 .10 .07 .06 .06 .05 .04 .02 .02 .02 .02ITALY 1.1 .50 .31 .74 .58 POWER POINTS 2015 SCORECARD CATEGORY #1: PRODUCTIVITY In overall output, no one comes close to the U.S. Although a country's capabilities in biotechnology depend on many factors, perhaps the most impor-tant is gross productivity. Innovation is not worth much if it cannot be commercialized, and that's what our Productivity category measures. We compute productivity using two metrics: \"public company revenues,\" and the \"number of public companies\" (Lawrence, S. & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 626-632 (2014), and company disclosures). We favor public companies because\u2014relative to private firms\u2014their reporting requirements provide trans-parency, making it easier to compare them objec-tively. Further, it stands to reason that a nation with a favorable business climate will support the devel-opment of more public companies. In combination, these metrics assess a country's productivity. The United States\u2014the longstanding leader in this category\u2014remains at the top. In fact, the U.S. runs away with this metric, finishing well ahead of all competitors.

As any real estate agent will tell you, where a piece of prop - erty lies is the key to its value. And when that property is a groundbreaking new medicine or a cutting-edge business model, where it is being developed is crucial to its success. As Scientific American Worldview enters its seventh year of tracking international trends in biotechnology innovation, we continue to refine our focus on which countries provide the best conditions for ensuring that that innovation will grow and thrive. The 2015 Scorecard also examines the drivers of global investment. After so many years of reporting slow declines in the financial position of biotech firms around the world, data from our last Scorecard presented a clear indication of economic recovery. This year, we see even more evidence of bounce back, especially in one particular country. As in the past, we built the Scorecard using a diverse collection of metrics\u2014from education and political environment to intellectual property strengths and the performance of public companies. To quantify this infor - mation, we ranked each country's achievement on a series of individual components using a scale from 0 to 10, with the lowest-ranked nation scored as 0 and the highest-ranked as 10. We then generated scores for each category\u2014Productivity, Intellectual Property (IP) Protection, Intensity, Enterprise Support, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy & Stability\u2014by calculating the mean score of these com - ponents. (For detailed methods, see page 46.) Our analysis of gross and relative metrics provides a rich assessment of the biotechnology sector worldwide. The results reveal a number of surprising shifts in the in - dustry, as well as several unexpected players exceling in certain areas. As the biotech field continues to evolve, so do our methods for tracking those places around the globe where today's innovators have the best chance of bringing tomorrow's innovations to the fore. \u2014THE EDITORSOur Scorecard pinpoints the countries, communities and financial sources that enable innovation to flourish Our Scorecard analyzes and interprets data on the innovation potential in biotechnology for 54 countries. Based on seven Scorecard Categories \u2014created from 27 components\u2014this analysis combines information from biotechnology inputs and outputs through government protection and policies and far beyond. The results reveal the dramatic range of capabilities in this dynamic field, and which countries are moving ahead and which ones are falling behind. To get the most from this analysis, work your way through the introduction and Scorecard Categories on your way to the Overall Scores ahead. Beyond that, finer-grain analyses add even more depth to our understanding of the innovation potential in biotechnology around the world.

For example, a company may be inclined to abandon a drug lead if it cannot find profit-enabling markets for it. In prior issues of Scientific American Worldview, we have also shown that the strength of a country's IP protec-tion correlates with its concentra-tion of clinical trials. Accordingly, IP protection can impact whether a na-tion's scientists and physicians even play a role in global drug develop-ment, and if drugs will be developed for locally pervasive conditions. We measure IP protection both objectively and subjectively. \"IP strength\" is drawn from a study (Park, W.G. Research Policy 37, 761-766 (2008)) that calculates the unweighted sum of five measures: patentable inventions, membership in international treaties, duration of protection, enforcement mecha-nisms and restrictions (e.g., compul-sory licensing). Recognizing that per-ceptions also influence investment decisions, and that the perception of a country's IP protection might not match objective measures, we ac-count for subjectivity with Schwab's \"perceived IP protection\" metric (Schwab, K. The Global Competi-tiveness Report, 2014-2015. World Economic Forum (2014)). This index was created using feedback from a global group of business leaders when asked about their perceptions of domestic IP protection. Although the United States comes in first in the objective mea-surement, \"IP strength,\" Finland, Qatar and Japan take the lead when the \"perceived IP protection\" metric is added to the calculation.tion (Lawrence, S. & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 626-632 (2014)). For instance, dividing each country's employee counts by its population, as sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau International Database, produces the \"public biotechnology company employees per capita\" metric. Likewise, the measurement of \"public biotech-nology company revenues per GDP\" is generated by dividing a nation's Productivity score by its GDP, as sourced from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database. Data for both \"biotech patents per total patents\" (filed with the Patent Cooperation Treaty) and \"business expenditures on biotechnology R&D\" came from the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). And the PUBLIC COMPANIES / MILLION POPULATION PUBLIC COMPANY EMPLOYEES / CAPITAPUBLIC COMPANY REVENUES / US$B GDPBIOTECH PATENTS /TOTAL PATENTS FILED WITH PCT VAL UE ADDED OF KNOWLEDGE- AND TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES U.S. National Science Foundation's Science and Engineering Indicators was the source for \"Value added of knowledge- and technology-inten-sive industries.\" Last year, Denmark held its long lead in this category, followed by the United States, Australia and Singapore. This year the same three countries took the top three spots. Spain advanced to fourth place, largely due to a surge in the proportion of biotech patent appli-cations filed there.PATENT STRENGTHPERCEIVED IP PROTECTION AVERAGE SCORECARD CATEGORY #3: INTENSITY Top marks for Denmark in driving innovation We measure a country's overall efforts to boost biotech innovation by combining five characteristics into a measurement designated as Intensity. These characteristics are normalized for population size and overall economy. As a result, Intensity helps identify smaller nations that exhibit outsized activity in the sector . Whereas Productivity measures outputs, like commercial products, Intensity measures inputs\u2014the elements that propel companies to success. Those look-ing for research partners or a place to develop biotechnology should consider countries with high Inten-sity scores. The data used in the components of Intensity are gathered from vari-ous sources, including company disclosures and published informa-SCORECARD CATEGORY#2: IP PROTECTION Objective and perceived measure- ments can diverge considerably \"Intellectual property is the invisible infrastructure of innovation,\" writes Michael A. Gollin in Driving Innovation: Intellectual Property Strategies for a Dynamic World (Cambridge University Press, 2008). Nowhere is that state-ment more accurate than in the field of biosciences. The capital and time invested in a new drug can only be recouped through strong IP Protec-tion. Without that assurance, it is difficult to attract funding or convince ambitious scientists and business founders to take on the risks of pio-neering research and development. In addition, IP protection can encourage foreign development of 38 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 39UNITED STATES 6.60 NEW ZEALAND 6.23UNITED KINGDOM 5.71 LUXEMBOURG 5.29 AUSTRALIA 4.97 CANADA 4.34 SAUDI ARABIA 4.33 ISRAEL 4.28 FRANCE 4.25 IRELAND 4.22 GERMANY 4.20ICELAND 4.14 SINGAPORE 4.13 THAILAND 3.90 DENMARK 3.79 SOUTH KOREA 3.71 FINLAND 3.71 JAPAN 3.46 SWITZERLAND 3.40 AUSTRIA 3.36CZECH 3.20SLOVAK 3.14 SWEDEN 3.10 9.00 HONG KONG 8.93MALAYSIA 7.97NEW ZEALAND 7.83UAE 7.34 QATAR 7.33 CHINA 6.80 ESTONIA 6.52 ISRAEL 6.49 SWEDEN 6.18FINLAND 6.12 CANADA 6.07 NORWAY 6.06UNITED KINGDOM 6.00 ICELAND 5.50 THAILAND 5.44 AUSTRALIA 5.43 SWITZERLAND 5.33 CHILE 5.27 GERMANY 5.08 NETHERLANDS 5.06 SOUTH AFRICA 4.99 SAUDI ARABIA 4.92 DENMARK 4.89 CHINA 4.83 IRELAND 4.83 LITHUANIA 4.77 FRANCE 4.72 LATVIA 4.63 JAPAN SOUTH 4.53 4.26 RICO SLOVAK 4.20 AUSTRIA 3.97 KUWAIT SPAIN INDONESIA 3.46 CZECH REPUBLIC 3.41 INDIA 3.24 TURKEY 3.14 RUSSIA 3.12 PHILIPPINES 3.09 POLAND 2.55 HUNGARY 2.48 ITALY 2.46BRAZIL 2.30 GREECE 2.06 UKRAINE 1.29 ARGENTINA 0.402.82 ESTONIA 2.78 SPAIN 2.71BELGIUM 2.65 ITALY 2.65 NORWAY 2.61 RUSSIA 2.48 NETHERLANDS 2.32 TAIWAN, CHINA 2.27 PUERTO RICO 2.10 LITHUANIA 2.06 ARGENTINA 2.02 MALAYSIA 1.94 GREECE 1.85 CHILE 1.85 TURKEY 1.82 UKRAINE 1.81 INDONESIA 1.70 HUNGARY 1.61 BRAZIL 1.53 HONG KONG 1.53 LATVIA 1.39 MEXICO 1.22 PHILIPPINES 1.06 CHINA 0.88 SOUTH AFRICA 0.72 UAE 0.23 INDIA 0.11 KUWAIT 0.04 QATAR Without question, a healthy biotech industry is acutely reliant on the robust community of highly trained individuals who envision, develop and produce its products. Biotech-nology firms require employees with advanced degrees in a variety of disciplines, while the industry overall is dependent on a pool of workers skilled in very specific tasks, such as laboratory processes. The Education/Workforce category consists of five compo-nents. \"Post-secondary science graduates per capita\" is calculated using UNESCO figures for graduates divided by the population according to the U.S. Census Bureau Interna-tional Database. We also employed OECD figures for \"Ph.D. graduates in the life sciences per capita\" and \"R&D personnel per thousand employment.\" To assess \"talent re-tention,\" we used the percentage of a country's doctoral recipients who did not intend to stay in the United States following graduation there, as reported by the U.S. National Science Foundation. A higher score in \"talent retention\" signifies that more people earn their Ph.D.s in the United States and then return home, while a lower score means that more Ph.D. graduates expressed a desire to stay in the United States, creating \"brain drain\" for their home countries. We recognize that not every person who wants to stay in the United States after earn-ing a Ph.D. finds an opportunity to stay; the objective of this metric is to measure the sentiment to not repatriate, rather than the actual emigration rate. Even countries with high scores in other areas\u2014includ-ing Denmark and Finland\u2014suffer significant amounts of brain drain. Overall, the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom take the first three spots in the Edu-cation/Workforce category, in that order . Last year's leader and second-place finisher\u2014Luxembourg and Saudi Arabia, respectively\u2014dropped to the fourth and seventh spots. SCORECARD CATEGORY #5: ENTERPRISE SUPPORT A trio tussles for the top spot No one wants to start a business where there is no endemic support for it. The Scorecard's Enterprise Support metric quantifies a coun- try's business-friendly features and the availability of capital in various forms. Consequently, resolving en-terprise support problems\u2014to tap an underserved market, to reduce oper-ating costs or to enable new business models\u2014can yield great returns. The Enterprise Support metric is generated using the average of four elements. The \"business-friendly environment\" measure-ment was drawn from Doing Business 2014 (World Bank and the International Finance Corporation), which surveyed local experts on a synthetic business case\u2014admit-tedly limited because it relies on a specific company of a specified size and refers, usually, to conduct-ing business in a country's largest city. The \"biotechnology venture capital\" component was created us-ing measurements from the OECD. We employed an index based on an international survey (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2014-2015. World Economic Forum (2014)) for the \"venture capital availability\" metric. The fourth component, \"capital availability,\" comes from the Milken Institute Capital Access Index. The front-runners in this category have traditionally been Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States, with active jockeying for the top ranks. Last year Hong Kong came in first, followed by the United States and Singapore. This year Singapore leads, trailed by the United States and Hong Kong.

Moreover, Finland has taken the top spot for five out of the seven years of the Scorecard's history. That's quite a record. The Foundations metric repre- sents the quality of a nation's infra-structure as it relates to potential innovation in biotechnology. A com-pany can't succeed without a stable supply of electricity, efficient means of transportation and so on. Weak-nesses in the Foundations category are particularly troublesome, as they represent problems that cannot be resolved quickly. For example, it can take years to build a new power plant, port or network of highways. To assess a country's Founda- tions, we use four components. First, \"R&D business expenditures per GDP\" is generated from OECD figures. For \"government support of R&D per GDP,\" we rely on data from UNESCO. Our \"infrastructure quality\" component comes from the World Economic Forum (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2014-2015. World Economic Forum (2014))\u2014an index based on an in-ternational survey. The last compo-nent, \"innovation and entrepreneur-ship opportunity,\" is drawn from the 2014 Legatum Prosperity Index. This category includes com- ponents based on R&D spending, which can impact future founda-tions. Likewise, a strong showing in \"innovation and entrepreneurship opportunity\" may yield ventures that fuel organic domestic growth. Behind Finland, South Korea climbed from third to second place, pushing Switzerland down one spot in the process. SCORECARD CATEGORY #7: POLICY & STABILITY Nordic nations still on top, while the U.S. flounders As in the Foundations category, Finland takes first place in Policy & Stability. The Nordic nations dominate this area, holding four of the top seven spots, with Finland in first, Sweden in fourth, Norway in fifth and Denmark in seventh. This revealing section of our Scorecard demonstrates the dramatic impact of policy and overall stability on a country's innovation potential. Data for Policy & Stability are drawn from the World Bank's 2014 World Governance Indicators, which consist of \"political stability and absence of violence/terrorism,\" \"government effectiveness,\" \"regu-latory quality\" and \"rule of law.\" Perceptions that a government could be overthrown or destabi-lized are reflected in the \"political stability and absence of violence/terrorism\" metric. The \"govern-ment effectiveness\" component quantifies opinions on the quality of a nation's public services, of its civil service and the degree of its independence from political pres-sures, and of its policy formulation and implementation\u2014as well as the credibility of its government's commitment to such policies. \"Regulatory quality\" examines im-pressions of the ability of a govern-ment to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development. Finally, the \"rule of law\" component provides perceptions of confidence in and adherence to the rules of society, BUSINESS EXPENDITURES ON R&D (% of GDP) GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF R&D (% of GDP) INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY (roads, ports, electricity, etc.) ENTREPENEURSHIP & OPPORTUNITYPOLITICAL STABILITY & ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS REGULATORY QUALITYRULE OF LAW such as enforcing contracts and property rights. Edging out most of the Nordic countries in the Top 10 for this category, Singapore and New Zealand earn the second and third slots, respectively. The United States continues to place poorly, finishing 20th. 42 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 43Our 2015 Scorecard ranks the bio- technology innovation potential of 54 countries. A nation's aggregate performance in each of the seven categories\u2014Productivity, IP Protec-tion, Enterprise Support, Intensity, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy & Stability \u2014yields the final score.

In brief, for each country the aver-2015 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN WORLDVIEW OVERALL SCORES A growing lead for the United States, with fierce competition among the followers age of a category's component scores (e.g., \"IP strength\" and \"perceived IP protection\") provides the category score. A simple sum of the category scores generates the overall innovation score. We use normalization techniques that give each component and each category equal weight. This table lists all 54 countries in top-to-bottom order based on their overall innovation scores. It also illustrates a nation's rank in each category, showing the sub-score for each category color-cod-ed on a coarse scale in comparison to other countries. As a result, the table offers a quick overview of the final results, an indication of a nation's rough performance in each category and the oppor-tunity to compare the numbers when desired. Because the score is composed of averages of available data, any gaps in the data, indi-cated as blanks in the table, do not affect the overall scores. The United States remains at the top, extending its lead from last year over the second-place country. The next tier of finishers, however, is rather tightly packed. Second-place Denmark, for example, scored 13% higher than 10th-place Canada. And there was only a 22% difference in the overall scores between the second and 20th-place holder, Luxembourg.The table's color-coding helps to reveal the weaknesses of some high finishers and the strengths of certain countries with lower overall scores. For example, fifth-place Singapore performs poorly in the Intensity category. Conversely, 40th-place Saudi Arabia ranks rela-tively well in Education/Workplace. As the data make clear, the top finishers overall tend to score respectably in each category. That stands to reason, as a healthy bio-tech sector is dependent on so many factors\u2014from a diverse workforce skilled in both bench science and business to support systems includ-ing everything from the availability of capital to the access to ports.UNITED STATES 10 10 10 7.63 4.4 3.33 6.91 6.25 10 10 8.16 10 8.66 9.17 4.44 5.35 10 5.59 8.82 6.18 9.00 6.60 7.22 7.66 39.62 UNITED STATES 1

44 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 45This Scorecard assesses 54 countries on their innovation potential in bio- technology through a meta-analysis. The analysis includes 27 components arranged in seven categories: Productivity, Intellectual Property (IP) Pro-tection, Intensity, Enterprise Support, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy & Stability. The table shows the components of each category and the sources of data. For each component, countries are ranked on a scale from 0 to 10, with the lowest-ranked country scored as 0 and the highest-ranked one scored as 10. A nation's score in a category is derived from the average of the available component scores\u2014any gaps in the individual components were ignored in calculating the averages for each category. The overall innovation score is a sum of the category averages, indexed to a score from 0 to 50. The normalization involved in calculating the category and overall scores considers each component and each category on equal weighting. In short, the Scorecard gives equal importance to all components.

Argentina took last place, with the Ukraine right above it, just as in 2014. The news might be even worse for Indonesia, which dropped from fifth from the bottom in 2014 to third from the bottom this year . Other countries in this group, however, did show progress. India rose one spot, from third from last in 2014 to fourth from last this year . The Philippines\u2014now in its fourth straight year in the Bottom Five\u2014also succeeded in moving up one place, to fifth from the bottom. Perhaps 2016 will be the year the Philippines breaks free from the Bottom Five and begins to climb the Scorecard.SEVEN YEARS OF BIOTECH TRACKING BY RANK Our growing database reveals ongoing competition at many levels Analyzing the Scorecard data from year to year uncovers certain trends, such as movement or stasis in the Top and Bottom Five, but a longer perspective shows much more. The end results demonstrate how each country changed relative to itself and others. Likewise, these data show the expanding list of countries assessed, although some lack data for every year. Despite the fact that the United States has maintained its top spot throughout, it is still interesting to observe the dynamics of the other highest-ranked countries. In early years, for example, New Zealand did not crack the Top 10, but in 2012 it ranked 9th and has stayed in the Top 10 ever since\u2014breaking into the Top Five for the first time this year . Hong Kong may be following a similar path. Conversely, Canada started below the Top 10 in 2009, maintained a Top 10 ranking from 2010 through 2013, came in 11th last year, and is in 10th place this year . In the future, we'll be watch-ing to see if Canada continues to straddle the line, or if it can hold onto its position in the Top 10. These fluctuations in rank high- light important considerations in in-terpreting the Scorecard. First, the competition is fierce, and countries that do not invest in maintaining their positions may see others take their place. Second, the frequent movement makes it important to consider trends over time. COUNTRY 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 AVG.

There's no change for the United States, which has been the front-runner since the Scientific American Worldview Score-card launched in 2009. Some reshuffling took place among the other high-scorers. Denmark rose from third in 2014 to second this year . Singapore, on the other hand, dropped from second in 2014 to fifth this year . Australia held its ground in fourth this year and last.A SWAP AT THE TOP A familiar crew dominates the Top Five change since last year (neg. values = improvement) 48 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 492009 2015 2009 2015 AUSTRALIA CANADADENMARKFINLANDHONG KONGNEW ZEALANDSINGAPORESWEDENSWITZERLANDUNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATES 10 98 7 65432140 36 32 28 MOST LEADERS LACK CONSISTENT SCORES Ongoing ups and downs plague many countries at the top Some of the fiercest competition on the Scorecard is seen among the Top 10 countries. This graphic shows the volatility of their fin-ishes by overall scores. Although the United States is consistently in first place, its overall score does fluctuate, even though it was nearly the same this year and last. Compared to the others in the Top 10, the United States earned fairly steady scores for 2009-2015: 37.1, 36.6, 39.0, 38.0, 37.6, 39.6 and 39.6. That's a seven-year average of 38.2, with the annual scores remaining fairly close to that number . Going down the list, however, we see that all of the other Top 10 finishers have jumped up and down and back over the years. For example, Denmark's scores for 2009-2015 were 31.6, 27.3, 31.9, 37.2, 35.7, 29.7 and 29.8. New Zea-land's scores move all over as well in that time: 30.0, 23.3, 24.9, 32.7, 28.6, 27.5 and 28.1. So far, our growing database does not show any conclusive trends in scores at the top for any country except the United States.TOP 10 BY SCORE LESS ROCKING IN THE RANKING The order of the Top 10 countries varies less than the scores In comparison to the overall scores, the ranking at the top looks relatively stable. It starts with the United States earning a steady first place across all years. Next, Denmark grabs the second-highest ranking over the life of the Score-card\u2014placing second four out of seven years. Sweden also earned relatively steady ranks over the years, always in the Top 10 and in the Top Five six of our seven years. Likewise, Singapore has secured a Top 10 ranking throughout the Scorecard's history, never dropping lower than 8th place, and otherwise always reaching the Top Five. Not every top-placing country, however, was so constant. New Zealand, for example, started in 7th in 2009, then dropped to 18th for two years, before getting back in the Top 10 in 2012 and staying there\u2014moving all the way to 3rd in 2015. Hong Kong's ranking leaps around as well: 17th in 2011, 13th in 2012, then 20th, 12th and 11th in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Like any industry, biotechnol- ogy demands ongoing efforts to maintain a nation's standing on the world stage.TOP 10 BY RANK 50 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 51AUSTRALIA CANADA NETH ERLANDS FRANCE DENMARK SWITZ ERLAND BELG IUM QATAR GERMANY LUXEMBOURG ISRAEL SAUDI ARABIA THAILAND CHILE INDIA CHINA UKRAINE JAPAN SWEDEN NORWAY BRAZIL ARGE NTINA UNITED S TATES UNITED KINGDOM FINLAND SINGAPORE HONG KONG UNITED ARAB EMIRATES NEW ZEALAND SOUTH KOREA 2nd3rd 1st LARGE AND SMALL WINNERS, AND LOSERS Countries of all sizes can be giants in their category Freeman Dyson, now retired from his work as a physicist at the Insti-tute for Advanced Study in Prince-ton, New Jersey, once said, \"I see a bright future for the biotechnology industry when it follows the path of the computer industry, the path that von Neumann failed to foresee, becoming small and domesticated rather than big and centralized.\" Maybe it's a little early in the evolu-tion of biotechnology to call it small and domesticated. Thus far, many parts of the industry remain big and centralized. Nonetheless, the lead-ers in the wide range of categories shown here hail from all around the globe, and they vary dramatically in size. Small countries can be big players within a certain category. Take Qatar, for example. Not quite the size of the state of Connecticut, it is home to just a little over 2 mil-lion people, and its GDP is be-tween the Gross State Products of Hawaii and New Mexico. Even so, it takes the gold medal in \"greatest venture capital availability.\" And in some categories, such as relative ones, size doesn't even matter . For instance, Luxembourg\u2014smaller than Rhode Island, and with a population of only about half a mil - lion\u2014won \"most R&D personnel per total employment,\" designat-ing it as a highly educated, albeit undersized, nation. Ranking first, though, is not al- ways desirable. India, China and the Ukraine, for example, would surely prefer not to win the \"worst brain drain\" category, which means that they lead the world in the propor-tion of their students who would rather not return home after their Ph.D. studies abroad. This map illustrates the state of biotechnology today, both in the tools that it requires and the plac-es where it excels. Perhaps as time goes on, a map like this will look more and more like Dyson's vision of \"small and domesticated.\"GREATEST PUBLIC COMPANY REVENUES: United States, Australia, United Kingdom MOST PUBLIC COMPANIES: United States, Australia, CanadaGREATEST PUBLIC COMPANY MARKET CAPITALIZATION: United States, Australia, United Kingdom MOST PUBLIC COMPANY EMPLOYEES: United States, Australia, France GREATEST REVENUE PER PUBLIC COMPANY: Netherlands, United States, Denmark GREATEST REVENUE PER PUBLIC COMPANY EMPLOYEE: Finland, United Kingdom, Swit-zerland/United States STRONGEST MEASURED PATENT PROTECTION: United StatesGREATEST PERCEIVED PATENT STRENGTH: Finland/Singapore GREATEST PERCENTAGE OF PATENTS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY: Denmark, Singapore, Belgium GREATEST ENTERPRISE SUPPORT: Singapore, United States, Hong Kong GREATEST VENTURE CAPITAL AVAILABILITY: Qatar, United States/United Arab Emirates MOST PH.D.

Because they are publicly traded, public companies have greater transparency than private firms, and offer a clearer picture of a nation's business land-scape. We collect this information from a published study (Lawrence, S. & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 626-632 (2014)) and company disclosures. For most of Scientific American Worldview's history, the number of public companies has been falling around the world. As we've noted in the past, a decrease in public businesses should be considered in the context of other factors, such as employee counts, revenues or market capitalization. Increases in these other factors as company counts drop could indicate that the industry is consolidating, which can be a positive sign. This year, the tally of U.S. public biotechnology companies increased for the first time in the history of Scientific American Worldview. Most other countries have seen a decrease in the number of public firms, although France has demon-strated a positive trend in this area since we started measuring in 2009. Understanding the complete story, however, also requires an analysis of the market capitalization.CAPITAL GAINS The United States takes its biggest lead yet in public- company market capitalization One of the most telling metrics we use to chart the global biotech landscape is public-company mar-ket capitalization, or the market value of a business's outstanding shares. When considered in com-bination with the number of public companies in each country, this information provides a broad inter-national comparison of the industry. Our data on market capitalization was gathered from a published study (Lawrence, S., L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 626-632 (2014)) and company disclosures. The United States has histori- cally led the world in biotech market capitalization, and continues to do so this year . But what's striking is how much that lead has increased. A year ago, the U.S. market capitaliza-tion was close to four times that of the non-U.S. global total\u2014and this year it ballooned to nearly six times that total. Australia had the second-largest growth, adding nearly US$ 5 billion in market capitalization, or roughly the sum of all of Sweden's public biotechnology companies. While most of the Top 10 countries saw progress in this area, Ireland was the lone standout, continuing its two-year drop. The strong U.S. gains in both the number of public companies and public-company market capitaliza-tion indicate the likelihood of further growth ahead. In other nations, decreases in the number of firms, paired with increases in market capitalization, point to consolidation, which may help to support slower-growing domestic industries.

We report this as biotech R&D as a percentage of the business enterprise R&D expendi-ture, a metric that alters the country rankings derived from the simple sums. In this relative measurement, Switzerland and Denmark take the lead, which is not surprising as they are comparatively small countries with strong biotech industries. Ireland's position in third place, in the context of its relatively lower level of revenues, signifies that it is a desirable location for taking companies offshore. AUSTRALIA AUSTRIABELGIUMCANADACZECH REPUBLIC STATESWHERE R&D IS DONE A clear win for the U.S., and then it's a tighter race As we've noted in the past, countries promote domestic biotechnology industries for, among other things, the financial benefits of bringing in high-wage jobs associated with research and development. Accord-ingly, we take a look at where that R&D predominantly occurs. Using data from a published study (Lawrence, S. & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 626-632 (2014)) and company disclosures, we present the simple sum of R&D expenditures in 23 nations. Here, the United States is the world leader\u2014spending nearly 22 times as much as the United Kingdom, in second place. Then there is a near-tie between Australia, France, Switzerland and Denmark. Not surprisingly, these counties also rank high on market capitalization. This indicates that for many compa-nies the bulk of their research and development is located in the same country as their headquarters.all green tubes: spent on R&D in the U.S. Russia lags the field in relative biotech investingSUM OF R&D US$ MM R&D US$ MM 56 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 57100 80 60 40 20 THE SPENDING SPREAD BY SIZE Big businesses outspend small ones in biotech R&D Is Dyson's vision about the future of biotechnology\u2014that it may be head-ing toward an industry composed of small companies\u2014taking shape? Our data may hold the answer . Us-ing the OECD's \"Key Biotechnology Indicators\" for October 2014, we collected information for 25 coun-tries on the percentage of biotech R&D spent by small firms (meaning they have less than 50 employees) versus medium and large ones.These data consist of public and private companies, mak-ing this analysis more inclusive than the public company figures presented earlier . For the majority of the countries considered here, large businesses accounted for most of the spending on biotech R&D. That was especially true in Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland, where large compa-nies provided 94.6%, 92.1% and 90.9% of biotech R&D expendi-tures, respectively. The United States and South Korea were not far behind, with large firms mak-ing up 88.4% and 87.7%.Of all of the countries on this list, Israel was the only one in which small companies invested more in biotechnology R&D than medium and large ones. There, small companies supplied 67.1% of the spending. Clearly, the numbers suggest that it will take some time before the biotech industry reaches Dy-son's predicted point. THE SPENDING SPREAD BY APPLICATION While biotechnology encom- passes many sectors, the most investment is in healthcare In addition to knowing the size of the companies engaged in biotech R&D spending, understanding the indus-try also requires an assessment of where the money goes. To find out, we turned once more to the OECD's \"Key Biotechnology Indicators\" for October 2014, where we gathered data for 18 nations. Spending on bio-technology R&D is divided into seven categories: health, agriculture, food and beverages, natural resources, environment, industrial processing, and bioinformatics. In most countries there is significantly more R&D spending on health applications than on any other category. The second highest amounts spent were on industrial processing and agri-culture. In the majority of cases, however, these areas received far less funding than healthcare. For example, in the United Kingdom 84% of R&D investment was on health applications. The United Kingdom's next highest spending rate\u2014only about 13%\u2014went to industrial processing. In some nations, biotechnol- ogy spending is spread a bit more equally.For instance, New Zealand dedicated about 31% of its R&D expenditures to health applications, and roughly 20% each to food and beverages, agriculture and indus-trial processing. Somewhat surprisingly, bioin- formatics receives very little of the funding. In a field that is already very data-focused, one might expect more support of this area. It will be interesting to see if that trend changes over time.AUSTRIA BELGIUM CANADA CZECH REPUBLIC DENMARK ESTONIA FINLAND FRANCE GERMANY IRELAND ISRAEL ITALY KOREA MEXICO NETHERLANDS NORWAY POLAND PORTUGAL SLOVAK REPUBLIC SLOVENIA SOUTH AFRICA SPAIN SWEDEN SWITZERLAND UNITED STATES PERCENTAGE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY R&D EXPENDITURE PERFORMED SOURCE: OECD, Key Biotechnology Indicators, http://oe.cd/kbi, October 2014.

So if someone from France, for example, owns a business in Qatar, that would be considered FDI for Qatar . In this way, foreign capital and even expertise can flow to the host country, enhancing and expanding its domestic biotech industry. To examine the impact of FDI on various nations, we used a published study (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2014-2015. World Economic Forum (2014)) and analyzed three metrics: prevalence of foreign ownership, business impact of rules on FDI, and FDI and technology transfer . For the prevalence of foreign ownership metric\u2014which is scored from extremely rare (1) to highly prevalent (7)\u2014most of the coun-tries received a 4 or higher . The top score, 6.3, went to Luxembourg, and the lowest, 3.0, to Kuwait. The business impact of rules on FDI assesses to what degree a nation's business environment\u2014its rules and regulations\u2014encourages or discourages FDI. This metric is scaled from strongly discour-ages (1) to strongly encourages (7). According to our data, the rules and regulations in most countries encourage FDI. Ireland was ranked most encouraging, with a score of 6.6, which explains part of the rea-son it enjoys so much FDI. And even though Zimbabwe was saddled with the most discouraging score, 1.8, it still received a reasonable grade for the prevalence of FDI, suggesting that rules and regulations are not the only factors influencing foreign investment. Without a doubt, these metrics add to Ireland's appeal. It leads in \"business expenditures on biotech-nology R&D,\" ties for second in FDI and leads business impact of rules on FDI. That combination cements Ireland's position as a desirable location for foreign businesses to explore. To measure how FDI can devel- op a nation's biotech industry and increase its capabilities, we looked at the levels of new technology brought in by foreign investment. Using the same information source, we assigned scores from 1 (mean-ing FDI had no impact on bringing in new technology) to 7 (signifying it brought in new technology to a great extent) to each country. Not surprisingly, Ireland secured the highest score, 6.4. Most of the other countries also saw a significant amount of technology introduced through FDI. The lowest score, 3.1, went to Argentina. Countries with strong technolo- gy flows gain a second benefit from FDI. In addition to the increased employment in domestic enter-prises, this transfer of capabilities often seeds a new generation of homegrown tech-based companies.

In cases where a patent's inventors came from multiple locations, we assigned inventorship as the proportional representation of each country. For example, if a patent had two French inventors and one German one, then France would be given 66% credit for the patent, and Germany would receive 33%. The results, from Inventor- Watch.com, show that the United States leads with 34,159 patents for 2004-2014. Japan, Germany and South Korea come in 2nd, 3rd and 4th with 6,236, 3,084 and 1,715 patents, respectively.To measure biotechnology inven-torship in the United States, we employed a similar approach to our global patent data (overleaf). This allowed us to pinpoint the centers of innovation in the country that produced\u2014far and away\u2014the most patents from 2004 to 2014. For this metric, we counted the number of patents from each state, based on the WIPO categories for biotechnology. Echoing the methods used in the analysis by country, for U.S. patents with inventors in a sin-gle state, we gave that state credit for one patent, regardless of the number of inventors. For patents with inventors in multiple states, inventorship was assigned as the proportional representation of each state. If, for instance, a patent had three Californian inventors and one from Connecticut, then California received 75% of the credit for the patent, and Connecticut 25%. The results, available at InventorWatch.com, show Califor-nia generated the most patents, 6,017\u2014about 18% of the nation's total. Massachusetts came in a dis-tant second with 1,711, accounting for about 9%. Interestingly, every state in the union produced some patents, although North Dakota only obtained three in a decade.NUMBER OF PATENTSNUMBER OF PATENTS MOTHERLAND OF INVENTION Mapping the source of patents to track innovation around the world Our Scorecard relies heavily on economic indicators, such as public company revenues, to measure biotechnology innovation. But while revenues reflect the final output of commercialization, to get a full picture of the state of the industry worldwide it is critical to consider the inputs as well\u2014especially inventions. Inventions are notoriously difficult to measure. Academic institutions, which tradition-ally focus on research and do not \"develop\" products, might tally the output of research papers or inven-tion submissions to gauge their participation in innovation. Other metrics use patent applications as a surrogate. These methods share a common flaw: they lack an objec-tive performance bar . Just as most research papers or invention sub-missions never become commercial products, most patent applica-tions do not become patents. This section calculates biotechnology patents by country\u2014which also has a substantial weakness, because most patents never become com-mercial products\u2014but it does provide an objective measurement of substantial commitment to de-veloping a product. To count the number of patents in each nation, we identified patents aligning with the World Intellec-tual Property Organization (WIPO) categories for biotechnology. When a patent's inventors were from the same place, that country received BORN IN THE U.S.A. Which states generate the most biotech patents? 62 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 63As a meta-analysis, the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard is created from a broad collection of data comparisons. This year we added a new resource to this mix, the Nature Index (http://www.natureindex.com/), which tracks scientific publications. In past issues we've examined the connection between a nation's rank on the Scorecard and its publish-ing output, and the Index allows us to revisit that concept\u2014but with data from a far greater number of countries. Our results show that sev-eral nations in particular generate many more publications than might be expected. The Nature Index not only provides a data- base of scientific publications but it also keeps track of the institutional and country affiliations of each author . It divides articles in four main categories: chemistry, earth and environmental sciences, life sciences and physical sciences. Data for each country are collected by article count (AC), with each nation receiving a credit for any article in which it can claim one of the authors. The database also calculates a weighted fractional count (WFC), which indicates the percentage of authorship from a country (and includes an adjustment that addresses an imbal-ance in some of the journals being tracked). For each country, we compare the Nature Index 2014 WFC for life sciences articles to the overall Scorecard ranking (excluding Hong Kong and Puerto Rico, which are not in the Na-ture Index). Not surprisingly, the results show considerable scatter, especially since some segments of the life sciences do not relate to biotechnology. Likewise, other categories of the Nature Index, such as chemistry, include articles that would impact aspects of biotech-nology. Nonetheless, the graph shows that a higher overall Scorecard finish is associated with a higher article output. In fact, the findings suggest a potentially exponential correlation. Certain countries score much higher than expected. For example, the U.S. WFC lands nearly off the chart\u2014more than four times greater than predicted by the correlation equa-tion that best fits the data. China also exceeded expectations, publishing far more articles than other nations finishing as low as it does on the Scorecard. As we've noted in the past, however, publishing lots of articles is not the same as publishing lots of valuable articles. COMPARING COLLABORATIONS Leading countries team up the least Information from the Nature Index, a new database that tracks affiliations of high-quality scientific articles, enables us to generate an informal \"collaboration metric\" in peer-review publishing. Here, we present that metric for life sciences articles. The results show that coun-tries ranking higher overall on the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard tend to collabo-rate less in terms of article authorship. To make this calculation, we started with the Nature Index's 2014 article count (AC) and weighted fractional count (WFC) for the life sciences category. Then we computed each nation's percentage of collaboration, or how many of its articles included authors from other countries. (We calculated this metric as: [(AC - WFC)/AC] * 100.) Much like the comparison of life sciences AC versus the overall Scorecard results, the data show considerable scatter . In general, though, an increase in the overall Scorecard ranking correlates with a lower rate of collaboration with foreign authors for life sciences articles. Also like the previous comparison, some countries take the trend to an extreme. The United States, for example, earned a collaboration score of about 22%, while the trend would predict that number should be about 40%. This means that scientists in the United States collaborate with foreign authors far less than expected. The same can be said for India. Although it received a col-laboration score of about 45%, according to the trend its score should be closer to 80%. Japan's collaboration rate is also considerably lower than expected. The take-home message seems to be that countries with less potential in biotechnology tend to collaborate more on articles. That could be a pragmatic result: they have no choice. How-ever, keeping in mind Dyson's vision for the future of biotechnology\u2014as small and domesticated rather than big and centralized\u2014it's possible this trend may very well shift in the years ahead. In any case, comparisons like these reveal the vast potential of combining the power of two rich databases. The articles that follow\u2014\"Products of Their Environment\" (see page 66) and \"Laws of Attraction\" (see page 68)\u2014offer additional examples of how pooling more data sources helps us to dig ever deeper into the complexities of this industry.

By Yali Friedman Where are drugs currently invented, and where will future drugs come from? A key question facing drug de-velopers and policymakers is whether drug development will shift locations, in much the same way that manufac- turing jobs and business administrative jobs have moved from industrialized to emerging economies. Although the location of innovation might initially seem to affect primarily the economics of healthcare\u2014reducing drug prices or increasing throughput of new drugs\u2014it can also have qualitative implications. For knowledge-based activities, such as drug development, the scope of the research projects constrains the outputs. For example, strong research funding in Western coun-tries directed at locally endemic diseases results in the development of drugs directed at those diseases. Likewise, if tropical countries, for instance, participated more in biopharmaceutical research, then more new drugs directed at tropical diseases would be expected. While the precise outputs of innovative research proj- ects cannot be predicted (many successful drugs emerge as serendipitous tangents), the location, or context, of the re-search activities can influence which tangents are pursued. For example, offshoring R&D to emerging economies can lead to knowledge spillovers that seed an innovative industry, and the new enterprises would naturally target domestic needs. So, simply offshoring research to new locations might produce novel outputs. Accordingly, a shift of R&D away from Western countries may result in fewer drugs being developed for Western conditions, and more drugs being developed for previously neglected conditions. WHERE ARE DRUGS INVENTED? This study extends prior investigations (Friedman, Y . Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 9, 835-836 (2010) and Friedman, Y . Nat. Biotechnol. 32, 523-524 (2014)) and goes further to examine patents covering marketed pharmaceuticals by leveraging objective drug-patent linkages. The logic is as follows: 1) The United States is the world's largest phar-maceutical market, so most\u2014if not all\u2014globally valuable drugs should have U.S. patents. (The primary purpose of this study is to compare innovation outside the United States, so any potential bias emerging from focusing on U.S. patents must be weighed against the benefits of leveraging rigid U.S. patent inventor listing rules and the objective drug-patent linkages provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).); 2) For U.S. patents, all of the individuals who had \"intellectual domination\" of the research must be listed as inventors, along with their loca-tions, and listing too many or too few inventors can yield a patent that is either unenforceable or invalid; 3) The FDA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to submit a strictly CHALLENGING CHINA'S ROLEThe lack of drug inventors in China and India challenges the emergence of domestic innovative capacity. With virtually no existing inventors in these countries, who will seed growth? But, perhaps it is wrong to measure Asian innova- tion using the same metrics as for Western innovation. Innovation can differ substantially even among Western countries. For example, the MIT Production in the Inno-vation Economy (http://web.mit.edu/pie/) research group observed that innovative companies in the United States tend to emerge from new entities, but in Germany they are often built on lega-cies. So, using new company formation (i.e., the U.S. model) as a metric for innovation would create an unfair bias against Germany. The MIT group also noted that, contrary to popular opinion, Chinese firms excel in mass manufac- turing \"not because of low-cost labor, but because of their ability to move complex advanced product designs into production and commercialization. \" Accordingly, if Chinese innovation is based on process improvement, rather than low-cost labor or develop-ment of novel drugs, then one must ask: Why are China's policies directed at Western objectives? Through directed incentives, China has established itself as a world leader in scientific publishing and in patent filings (as shown in previous issues of Scientific American Worldview ). Low citation rates of scientific papers and low patent-grant rates demonstrate that these policies are not producing effective inputs for innovation. In other words, China's current strategy promotes Western-style outputs to anachronistically build founda-tions, rather than supporting its substantial capabilities already in place. A better development path would be to leverage China's unique strengths in advanced manufac-turing and design to improve on existing drugs and to develop global leadership in research in areas that other countries cannot address. Y ali Friedman is publisher of DrugPatentWatch.com, a competitive intelligence database focused on pharmaceutical patents.INVENTORSHIP BY REGIONFIGURE 2. defined list of patents covering the product and method of use of each of their drugs. By consulting the DrugPatentWatch.com database and following this logical chain, I assembled a list of patent inventor locations from 2000 through 2014. To ensure that every patent was counted on par, each nation was attrib-uted proportional ownership of each patent. For example, if a patent's inventors are all from a single country, that country would get credit for one patent. For a hypothetical patent with two Swiss inventors and one German inventor, Switzerland would receive two-thirds credit and Germany one-third credit. In the global continental distribution of drug patent inventors, North America\u2014largely the United States\u2014has maintained a roughly 50% representation, Europe about 30% and Asia approximately 10% (Figure 1). For all of the drug manufacturing occurring in Asia, there is little measurable innovation. The continued dominance of established pharmaceutical innovation hubs suggests that pharmaceutical innovation is very difficult to relocate. Just as Hollywood has maintained its position as the global hub of the television and movie industries, so too have the United States and Western European countries maintained their leadership in pharmaceuticals (data not shown). When asked which nations in Asia are responsible for its drug inventorship, many propose that India or China might be the regional leader. A closer look at Asian countries demonstrates otherwise (Figure 2). Japan is the source of more than 90% of Asia's drug patent inventors. Japan's dominance in Asia further proves the permanence of pharmaceutical innovation hubs. Innovation has not moved in decades. The continued dominance of established pharmaceutical innovation hubs suggests that pharmaceutical innovation is very difficult to relocate.

ASIAN DRUG PATENT INVENTORS (2000-2014)68 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 69 LAWS OF ATTRACTION How a nation' s policies attract and discourage biopharma investment By Meir Perez Pugatch, David Torstensson, Rachel Chu, Amir Dayan & Noa Weinstein Given the inherent challenges involved in the policymak-ing process, not least when it comes to healthcare and biomedical innovation, the question is often asked whether policies actually matter. At the end of the day, does the state of the policy environment really translate into more or less investment and innovative activities in the bio-medical sector? The answer is yes. A growing body of data shows that there is a positive link between a country's policy inputs\u2014all of the laws, regulations and initiatives in place affecting biopharmaceuticals\u2014and its outputs, such as biomedical R&D and the production of new health technologies. In other words, whether or not a nation provides, for instance, support for basic research, strong biopharmaceutical-related intellectual property rights, robust regulatory standards, streamlined processes and a fair price does in fact impact its competitiveness for bio-medical investment much more than might initially be expected. Such findings not only suggest that putting policies in place that support biomedical innovation is im-portant if countries want to actually attract investment and improve the competitiveness of the local sector, but they also shed light on which areas nations might want to focus on in order to enhance their chances of securing investment. a policy mix that attracts biomedical investment. Rather, nations that have introduced heavy-handed localization policies in the past few years, on top of not prioritizing policies that are also necessary conditions for biomedical in-novation, tend to score poorly relative to other countries. To illustrate, Russia has implement- ed top-down policies, such as preferen-tial treatment for domestic manufactur-ers, to meet its Pharma 2020 goals of increasing locally produced medicines and growing export markets. Y et, these policies came prior to adequately ad-dressing areas like quality of manufac-turing and scientific capabilities and the soundness of its regulatory and legal frameworks. Not surprisingly, Russia scores below 60% of the total possible BCI score, and is categorized as \"strug-gling to compete. \" Moreover, Russia is ranked lowest in the exact areas in which it seeks to be competitive, such as in manufacturing, where it scores well below the rest of the group at just 54% (Figure 2).

Concurrently, China hosts a very small number of clinical trials in per capita terms\u2014less than 1 trial per million population in a given year\u2014which is among the lowest globally. In general, policies that run contrary to the conditions needed for biomedical innovation are likely to translate into reduced biopharma investment. In addition, low costs, demand and market potential are not sufficient prerequisites for invest-ment; rather, the policy environment is an equally, if not more, important determinant. Finally, the outputs themselves, or the lack thereof, actu-ally shed light on which policy inputs are necessary to promote investment. Ultimately, looking at the policies of countries that secure biopharma investment might provide a roadmap for all nations seeking the same success.

Indeed, country managers and their teams often have a candid and accurate understanding of how different aspects of the local policy environment factor in when discuss-ing whether to allocate further re-sources in the nation. This is precisely what the Biopharmaceutical Com-petiveness and Investment Survey (BCI)\u2014a global survey-based index of countries' biomedical-investment attractiveness\u2014aims to understand. First presented in the 2012 Scien- tific American Worldview (\"Does your country deserve investment from biopharma?\"), the BCI ranks nations' biopharma investment environments based on the perspectives of local executives. The BCI is composed of 50 questions that capture the entire biopharmaceutical ecosystem, from scientific capabilities to market condi-tions. Using statistical analysis, re-spondents' answers are translated into a quantitative score, which is used to benchmark countries' performance and overall attractiveness for invest-ment. The first edition covered 11 developed and emerging markets. The second edition of the BCI, carried out in 2014, covers 16 nations. Among other insights, the 2014 BCI reveals a clear link between policy ac-tions and levels of investment. Those countries with market-based, pro-innovation policies in place\u2014such as the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland\u2014score at the top of the sample (Figure 1). In contrast, even considering their high levels of demand and future market potential, those markets that do not yet provide wide-ranging support for biomedical innovation\u2014such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRICs\u2014still tend to place at the bottom of the group. Take, for example, countries using protectionist-type policies or requirements to stimulate local biomedical manufacturing or R&D.

We found that nations with weak IP environments, as mea-sured by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce's GIPC International IP Index (GIPC Index), tend to host three to five times fewer clinical trials than countries scoring in the upper half (Figure 3). In fact, regression analysis of the data suggests that the strength of IP protection can explain over 40% of clinical trial intensity, which is sig-nificant given that a number of other factors\u2014such as adequate capabilities and infrastructure\u2014are also typically considered important for attracting clinical trials. China makes an interesting exam- ple.

The Auto-Pilot considers multiple factors in real time and provides the doctor and other healthcare providers with the most pertinent data needed to guide prescription therapy.

Assessing and communi-cating those benefits and risks has been the life's work of Dr. Raymond Woosley. Over the past thirty years, Dr. Woosley has matched his keen scientific acumen, vision and orga-nizational skills, carving out new areas of consensus science capable of tackling the complexities in both the efficient development and safe use of life-saving medications. He has made the greatest impact on medical progress as the founder of the Critical Path Institute and Credi-bleMeds\u2014both of which are guided by the concepts of collaboration and data sharing.CredibleMeds began as part of a national network of Centers for Edu-cation and Research on Therapeutics (CERTs) launched by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 1999 following a ten-year campaign by Dr. Woosley to obtain Congressional legislation and fund-ing for such programs. \"There was a critical need for research that drug companies would normally not perform,\" he explains, \"and that the National Institutes of Health just doesn't fund.\" Of particu-lar concern to Dr. Woosley was the potential for certain medications to induce sudden cardiac death (SCD). \"My brother died of SCD in 1996 Food and Drug Administration's Critical Path Initiative\u2014an effort to accelerate the drug development and regulatory process. C-Path's mission entails reach- ing across the boundaries separat - ing drug companies, academia, researchers, and regulatory agencies to facilitate unique cross-disciplinary collaborations, which take place in neutral, pre-competitive space. In its ten-year existence, C-Path has helped to improve the efficiency and efficacy of drug development by discovering and receiving regula-tory endorsement for standardized biomarkers (tools to help speed drug development) for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, skeletal muscle injury, kidney injury, and more. C-Path was also the first orga-nization to effectively pool patient-level data from multiple clinical trials shared by several major pharmaceu-tical companies in order to better understand the course of Alzheimer's disease. This database is now being used to design and simulate new clinical trials with greater likelihood of success in testing new treatments for this and other diseases. \"Today, digital and cloud tech- nologies allow us the ability to ana-lyze and communicate vast amounts of information in an instant,\" Dr. Woosley concludes from his office in Oro Valley, Arizona, where he works closely with scientists in the local Sanofi and Roche-Ventana facilities. \"I feel like the tools and infrastruc-ture now exist to enable research and healthcare delivery systems to fully utilize the enormous amount of data and knowledge our scientists are generating. But, partnerships such as those created by Credi-bleMeds and C-Path will continue to be essential for patients to reap maximum benefit from this invest-ment in science. Future advances will require collaborations among translational scientists, those who deliver healthcare and those who train healthcare practitioners.\" Safe Use Pioneer For more than 3 decades, life science innovator Dr. Raymond Woosley has revolutionized patient care by harnessing the power of collaboration.because his doctor, a well-trained and extremely capable physician, did not know that the heartburn medicine he had prescribed had the ability to cause sudden death.\" In 2000, Dr. Woosley moved his CERT from Georgetown University to the University of Arizona, where it became AZCERT and eventually CredibleMeds. Through its web por-tal, CredibleMeds gives clinicians, researchers and patients access to a robust and continuously updated list of drugs that are categorized by their risks for causing torsades de pointes (TdP), the heart arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Currently, Dr. Woosley is working under a contract with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to establish collaborations that can incorporate the potentially life-saving informa-tion created by CredibleMeds into the systems that support healthcare decision-making. This work is also supported by grants from the Bert W. Martin Foundation and Oracle Health Sciences and made possible by a new partnership between Credi-bleMeds, Banner Health Systems and the University of Arizona Col-lege of Medicine - Phoenix. \"We have developed a system to analyze drug safety evidence that can fuel a 'behind-the-scenes' software program that we call the 'Auto-Pilot,'\" Dr. Woosley explains. \"When a medi-cine is prescribed, all of the medical evidence about the safety of that medicine is com-bined with in-formation found in the patient's electronic medi-cal record. From that analysis, the system provides valuable guidance to the patient's healthcare team.\" (See sidebar.) Parallel to the development of CredibleMeds is the continued growth of the Clinical Path Insti-tute (C-Path), which Dr. Woosley founded in 2005 in response to the \u00a9BALFOUR W ALKER \"AZCERT's concept for 'Auto-Pilots' is a novel integration of innovative technologies that furthers the FDA's mission to reduce preventable harm from medicines.\" \u2014Ali Mohamadi, M.D. PARTNER PROFILESUPER SIMULATIONS For decades healthcare ex - perts predicted that computers would transform the field, but until Colin Hill came along we did not know precisely how. Hill is combining computational physics, systems bi - ology and personalized medicine to completely rewrite the way that clinical trials are done. Instead of running them in people, he plans to simulate them in computers. That night in California, I asked Wuest: \"Why test a drug in a computer?\" \"You can gain a lot of insights,\" she answered, \"and there are more opportunities to study disease on a ho - listic level in ways that are cheaper and in ways that are faster because we can take in data that's already being collected in the healthcare system.\" That information can then be used to find just the right treatment for each in - dividual patient. MINING NEW TARGETS Genetic solutions to cancer have been anticipated since the sequencing of the human genome more than a decade ago, and some of today's treat - ments do target changes in genes. But Patricia Ernst be - lieves that examining other cellular alterations will unveil even more targets. She looks at so-called epigenetics. \"Most people are familiar with the concept that when you get cancer one of your genes has suffered a mutation and that's why the cells grow uncontrollably,\" Ernst ex - plained, \"but there are a lot of other things that can happen to a cell.\" For example, the molecules that control genes\u2014known as regulators\u2014may also cause or affect the growth of cancer. This is an example of epigenetics, and such changes can impact the onset and severity of leukemia. \"There are many new drugs that are being developed that not only influence heritable changes in gene expres - sion,\" she continued, \"but also directly target epigenetic regulators that are mutated in particular leukemias.\"NATURAL HEALING As Abbate noted earlier, the \"tweaking\" of natural processes can lead to innovative dis - coveries, which was the case for Bob Hariri. \"We realized probably 20 years ago that for cellular medicine to have a meaningful impact on patients' lives we were going to have to identify a reliable, renewable source that could be turned into a product and put into the hands of physicians\u2014sort of the same way we provide them with pharmaceuticals,\" he said. While working as a neurosurgeon, he realized that stem cells would be particularly useful in treating head and spinal cord injuries, but he needed a source of them. So he turned to what he called \"the leftovers of full-term healthy pregnancies, namely, the placenta.\" He added, \"This organ is nature's stem-cell factory.\" At Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, Hariri and his col - leagues convert stem cells into new therapies for diseases including cancer. NEVER GIVE UP! When I asked the panel how we can be sure to keep innovation moving forward, June replied that scientists must be stubborn. \"Basically, I tell people when they start in my lab that you have to expect 90% of the time\u2014at least\u2014you are going to fail, so if you're play - ing baseball, that means you bat 100,\" he said. \"You have to get used to that, but when you do get something that works it's an amazing thing.\" The things that work change lives (see \"Marathon Man\" and \"Saving Dolphins Despite Disease\"). As Hariri said, \"I am moved and compelled by each story where the investment and the time of creating a new drug, a new therapeutic, has transformed those individuals' lives.\" As I thought over what the panel had said that night and looked over the crowd, I felt moved, too, and optimis - tic about a more powerful today and an even more innova - tive tomorrow.Today's visionaries battle cancer with cutting-edge science and the stubbornness to make it work BY MIKE MAY | Illustrations by MEEN CHOI Surviving cancer requires teamwork. On the evening of Monday December 8, 2014, a small army of some of the best \"soldiers\" in the battle against blood cancer mingled with patients and members of the press in \"The Swamp\" at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. Just feet away, Claude\u2014an albino alligator\u2014laid still, but deadly, much like an undiagnosed cancer waiting to unleash itself on an unsuspecting victim. The crowd gathered there that night to learn how sophisticated research from dedicated and driven scientists promises to\u2014and in some cases al - ready does\u2014cure cancer. This Top Medical Innovators forum was organized through a partnership between Scientific American World - view and The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest (CMPI). The event recognized eight experts for their work in the fight against blood cancer, from diagnosis to treat - ment (see \"Innovator Alley\"). Gaining ground in this dif - ficult battle demands crusaders like these to continue the mission of developing innovative new treatments. As Jeremy A. Abbate\u2014publishing director of Scientific American Worldview and global vice president for global media alliances at Scientific American \u2014said in his intro - duction, \"One of the most defining characteristics of the enterprise of innovating is taking nature and making it a little bit better, using what nature gives us and tweaking it just a little bit.\"Indeed, when a researcher's discovery yields a revolution - ary new medicine, that tweaking can change lives. \"Innova - tion is inventiveness put to good use,\" Bob Goldberg, one of the cofounders of CMPI, told the audience. \"Inventiveness springs from the imagination of our honorees this evening.\" As I took the podium, I started to call up four of the innovators who joined us that night: Patricia Ernst of the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Cam-pus; Bob Hariri of Celgene Cellular Therapeutics; Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine; and Diane Wuest, representing Colin Hill of GNS Healthcare. I felt awed to be there as I invited Carl June to the panel. CHANGING THE ODDS June's groundbreaking ap - proach to combating leukemia begins with the immune-sys - tem cells from a particular patient, genetically re-engineers those cells to kill that person's specific cancer and then injects them back into that individual. He first used this protocol in 2010 to treat an adult with the disease\u2014which typically kills 80-90% of its victims\u2014and the injected cells destroyed seven pounds of tumor. The man is alive and well today. In addition, June had recently completed a study in which 39 children with leukemia\u2014for whom several tra - ditional treatments had failed\u2014received their own re-engineered immune cells. Of these children, 35 went into complete remission. That translates into a response rate of 92%! As June said, \"It's a heartwarming story, because you see kids who have gone through all the kinds of things that chemotherapy can do, or radiation, and most of them al - ready relapsed after a bone marrow transplant\u2014but after immunotherapy, these kids have returned to a normal life.\" WORLDVIEW EVENTS 73 72 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEWWORLDVIEW EVENTSIn February, several weeks before he planned to run his 86th marathon, Don Wright made time to talk with Scientific American Worldview . A few years earlier, in December 2012, he had achieved his goal of finishing one marathon in each of the 50 states. Now, he wants to raise his marathon count to 100, a feat he hopes to reach by the end of 2016. But without a doubt, his greatest accom-plishment is staying healthy despite being diagnosed with multiple myeloma just after his first marathon, in 2003. Then, instead of giving in to the cancer, he decided to take on the Boston Marathon, followed by one race after another. His wife and daughter often come along and run the half marathon at the events he attends. Wright can keep running in spite of his myeloma because of a once-a-day pill. He has been on the therapy for seven years\u2014starting with a clinical trial five years before it was approved\u2014without any major side effects. Well, except for one, he laughs: \"The big side effect is that it makes me want to go run marathons!\" Jokes aside, Wright deeply appreciates his treatment as well as his health. And of his current cancer-fighting medication, he says, \"It's helped me live long enough to meet my grandchildren, and that's extremely important in my life. \"IANNIS AIFANTIS Professor and Chair Department of PathologyNew York University School of MedicineNew York, New York Aifantis uses blood stem cells to study cellular development and how cells turn into leukemia and lymphoma.

Vague Professor in Immunotherapy Department of Pathology and Laboratory MedicineDirector of the Translational Research ProgramUniversity of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of MedicinePhiladelphia, Pennsylvania He developed CTL019 immuno- therapy for B-cell cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The US Food and Drug Admin-istration gave CTL019 \"break-through therapy\" status in 2014 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory adult and pediatric ALL. Recently, he reported on a study in which this treatment put 35 out of 39 children with leukemia into complete remission. CHRISTOF VON KALLE Director of Translational Oncology National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Center Heidelberg, Germany Von Kalle researches techniques in therapeutic genetics, such as using a virus to deliver a drug. This process could lead to treat-ments for certain cancers and the prevention of others. He also works with colleagues on new ways to diagnose cancer sooner and more accurately. In 2000, life couldn't have been better for life-long diver and filmmaker Hardy Jones. Teaming up with actor Ted Danson, Jones founded BlueVoice.org to protect whales and dolphins. But in 2003, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. His treatment started with an oral cancer medication and a steroid, which stops the growth of cancer cells in the bone marrow. \"My myeloma burden was reduced by 97%, \" Jones says. \"It was very fast. \" He started on high doses of the medications, but his oncologist brought them down over time. Eventually, Jones got 16 months off without any treatment at all. \"In that 16 months, \" he says, \"I was quite stable, but then the myeloma began to creep up. \" So he tried another drug and experienced a similar cycle\u2014treatment, quick cancer-killing response, eventual treatment vacation, followed by cancer recurrence, which led to a new treatment. At 71 years old, Jones continues to receive treatment and pursue his work. When he spoke with Scientific American Worldview , he was deep in a project to save dolphins being killed in Peru for use as shark bait. \"We're making a film on it now, \" he says. \"If we don't stop this dreadful practice, they will wipe out the dolphins and sharks. \" While Jones saves the world's marine life, advanced drugs\u2014with ongoing innovations keeping his options coming\u2014save him. There is no better team-work than that.INNOVATOR ALLEY Scientific American Worldview and The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest recognized eight \"Top Medical Innovators. \" Each of them works on life science or medical research that is already changing lives, and is sure to affect many more in the future.

Last year, the six-to-eight-year drug lag these firms have had to contend with was lengthened another two years. \" A lot of products were asked to queue in the line again to get the approval for clinical trial stage, \" says Joseph Cho, who heads RDPAC, an association of 40 multinational R&D-based pharmaceutical companies working in China. The extension was unexpected. \"We say it is a shock, not a surprise, \" he relates. Since being recognized in 2005 as a nonprofit by the Chinese govern-ment, RDPAC has developed into a lobbying voice for improving China's pharmaceutical R&D environment. According to its website, the orga-nization is \"committed to securing patients timely access to innovative drugs\"\u2014a formidable task, particu-larly in China. As of early January 2015, the group reports that at least 34 applications from multinational drug companies have been delayed by a new step in the drug-approval process. And in addition to these global firms, says Cho, \"The domestic companies who are focusing on their own R&D products are facing the same challenges. \" RDPAC is working hard for change, but has had limited success so far. The real challenge is getting the ear of the right high-level decision makers. \"Policy making in China is so fragmented, so we are facing different ministries and sometimes they come up with different ideas about how things should be done, \" says Cho. At RDPAC's March 2014 meeting with China's State Food and Drug Adminis-tration (CFDA), officials revealed the government's rationale for the added two years. \"They think they have been making mistakes in the past, and they just want to do the right things, \" he explains. Indeed, the CFDA is playing catch-up with the pharmaceutical R&D industry. Whereas in the past it reviewed mainly generics, since China joined the World Trade Organiza-tion in 2001 the agency has seen an enormous increase in the registration of innovative medicines. \"Now they have their own R&D pipeline from China and around the world, \" Cho says. \"They need to be able to cope with the advancement of the pharma R&D here. That is a very huge chal-lenge. \" Last year, the CFDA announced the recruitment of 20 new Center for Drug Evaluation employees, adding to its existing staff of 80 overworked reviewers, and earlier this year they announced the addition of 53 review-ers. In May, CFDA deputy head Yin Li announced plans to outsource some of the reviewing to third-party organizations. Even so, its capabilities don't compare to the FDAs in other countries like the United States. As the agency struggles to get through the backlog of approvals and pick up the pace, Cho says foreign pharma is increasingly frustrated. \"I think the sudden change of prac-tice is making the lives of our R&D people and regulatory people on the ground and at headquarters frustrat-ing. A lot of investments are being affected by these uncertainties here in China. \" SEEDS OF CONTROVERSY German research provides clarity in the ongoing crop debate BY KEREN SOOKNE Despite numerous scientific studies demonstrating the benefits and risks of genetically modified (GM) crops, they continue to be the subject of vehement debate. Low levels of public trust regarding GM crop safety present a major problem for experts and governments, as the demand for technological advances focused on food security has never been more pressing. Seeing a need for an objective breakdown of the facts, Matin Qaim, an agricultural econo-mist at the University of Goettingen, Germany, and his colleague Wilhelm Kl\u00fcmper conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of GM crops on pesti-cide use, crop yields and farmer prof-its. Their report, based on 147 studies, was published on November 3, 2014. \"Many people in Europe believe GM crops do more harm than good, \" explains Qaim. \"We felt that a publicly funded analysis of studies carried out worldwide would be a useful contri-bution to the public debate. \" The re-sults indicate that farmers employing insect-resistant or herbicide-tolerant GM seeds earned 69% higher profits and 21% higher yields, while using 37% fewer pesticides, as compared to farmers utilizing non-GM seeds. Hoping to quell fears about in- dustry funding and publication bias, Qaim also incorporated data from studies not published in journals, such as working papers, conference presentations and reports in institu-tional series. Over 90% of the studies included were funded by public-sector sources. \" A typical allegation is that a study showing benefits must have been funded by industry, so results may be influenced by private-sector interests, \" says Qaim. \"But the results don't support that argument. \" Another widely cited concern is that journals would only publish studies with significant benefits. \"We didn't find any evidence of such publication bias, \" he notes. In addition, some GM-crop skeptics fear that the economic and agronomic benefits they provide are only short-term. \"This is often men-tioned in connection with resistance development in insect pests or weeds, \" Qaim says. But resistance develop-ment is not an issue that is specific to GM crops. \"This can also occur with conventional and biological pest control technologies, and it hap-pens faster when good agricultural practices aren't followed, \" he says. The bottom line: farmers cannot substitute GM seeds for recommended agrono-my techniques, such as crop rotation. As Qaim puts it, GM seeds \"are not magic bullets. \" As European consumer polls call for more public information, Qaim continues to participate in the GM debate by addressing public con-cerns through his research. He notes that even in the face of clear scien-tific data, it may take some time to overcome public distrust, as has been the case with countless other scien-tific advances in history. Still, Qaim remains hopeful: \"I'm optimistic that more evidence about the benefits of GM crops will contribute to wider public acceptance in the future. \" THE MODI OPERANDI Tackling India's social problems with IT BY ZACH GOLDBERG By 2001, the Western Indian state of Gujarat\u2014 known locally as the \"Jewel of the West\"\u2014was deep in the doldrums. Y ears of political instability, misman-agement and corruption had frittered away precious resources. The public cried out for a savior. Instead, they got an earthquake that killed 20,000 residents, destroyed nearly 400,000 homes and caused over US$5.5 bil-lion in damages. From the fallout, Narendra Modi, a former tea peddler and science enthusiast, was catapulted into power. Gujarat's unpopular government intended for him to be the deputy chief minister. But Modi refused: \"I'm either going to be fully responsible for Gujarat, or not at all. \" Some called him arrogant, if not authoritarian. In truth, Modi simply understood sci-ence and technology's ability to solve the seemingly unsolvable. His model is simple: Lay the infra- structure\u2014electricity, roads, schools, public transportation, broadband and so on\u2014and harness information tech-nology (IT) to streamline governance Last year, the six-to-eight-year drug lag these firms have had to contend with was lengthened another two years. ILLUSTRATIONS BY NICOLET SCHENCKCOUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS78 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW COUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 79and achieve synergy between public officials and grassroots society. Such a model calls for far-flung flows of critical, often scientific, knowledge to empower individuals. This means linking agro-scientists and technolog-ical engineers with local farmers and entrepreneurs, digitally educating the under-educated and creating respon-sive and transparent civil institutions that can be accessed and monitored from one's home. The \"Modi model\" worked won- ders in Gujarat, now India's premier e-governed state. Today, all 18,000 of its villages enjoy nationally unparal-leled 24-hour electricity and Internet access, 95% of its electronically sub-mitted public complaints have been addressed and its GDP and agricul-tural sector have grown at 10% and 9%, respectively, over the past decade. Having been elected, overwhelm- ingly, as India's Prime Minister in May 2014, Modi is poised to work his magic at the national level. Challeng- es\u2014including limited funds, infrastructural shortcomings and stifling regu-latory environ-ments\u2014abound. Nonetheless, with bullet trains, \"smart cities, \" new solar projects and sci-entific research hubs in the pipeline, Modi has faith in the force-multiplying effects of sci-ence and technology. Consider Modi's \"Digital India\" campaign: by expanding broadband and mobile Internet coverage across the country, virtual medical technolo-gies can then be used to ameliorate a health crisis compounded by the 700 million Indians who live isolated from the nearest hospitals. On this front Anita Goel, CEO of Nanobiosym and developer of the Gene-RADAR technology\u2014a wireless iPad-sized diagnostic tool that rapidly tests for many diseases at a cost of just a few dollars\u2014has been discussing plans with Modi \"to place this mobile device in every village throughout the country. \" India faces an arduous road ahead, but the significance of Modi's undertaking cannot be overstated. Modi, says Goel, \"wants to turn India into a technological wellspring. But most of all, he wants to inspire hope in hearts around the globe. \" NEUTRALIZING NEGLECT Japanese experts collaborate locally and internationally to fight neglected diseases BY ICHIKO FUYUNO Although Japan ranks third worldwide in develop-ing new pharmaceutical products, its contribu-tion to global health lags far behind. That imbalance may be shifting, however, with the launch of the Global Health Innovative Technol-ogy (GHIT) Fund, the world's first public-private partnership dedicated to supporting global health R&D. Since its establishment in 2013, the Tokyo-based, US$100 million initiative has funded 30 partnerships between Japanese and non-Japanese companies and public institutes aiming to develop drugs and vaccines to treat malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. These conditions affect over a billion people\u2014most of them living in poor conditions in Africa\u2014but limited financial returns prevent most major pharmaceutical companies from investing in research to treat them. \"The GHIT Fund addresses an important market failure, \" says BT Slingsby, the fund's CEO. \"The de-mand is there, but the global society still doesn't have the right tools. That is where and why we focus our work. \" The project was originally con- ceived by Tachi Y amada, who previ-ously led the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Global Health Program and is now chief medical and scien-tific officer at Takeda Pharmaceuti-cals, Japan's biggest pharma company. Five pharmaceutical firms, including Takeda and Eisai, helped jumpstart the fund by persuading Japan's foreign and health ministries to finance half of it. The remainder is currently backed by six Japanese pharmas, the Gates Foundation and the United Na-tions Development Programme. Although the GHIT doesn't seek financial returns, awarded developers must show that their potential products are innovative, feasible, cost-effective and accessible to the poorest of the poor. The fund's investment covers drug discovery to clinical testing, and it opens the door to access Japan's vast chemical compound libraries, which have not yet been screened for their potential to tackle the diseases that the program addresses. Slingsby says the fund's model of driving open innovation with good governance is changing the Japanese culture of innovation. To avoid any conflict of interest, for example, representatives of pharmaceutical companies are excluded from GHIT's selection committee and advisory panel, which includes some of the world's leading authorities on infec-tious disease. Experts outside Japan also agree that GHIT is already having an impact. For instance, Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV)\u2014a nonprofit research organization in Switzer-land\u2014has formed 10 partnerships with Japanese pharmaceutical com-panies, including one with Takeda to test a new drug for malaria. MMV's CEO David Reddy says the fund is effectively helping Japanese pharmaceutical compa-nies, which are \"looking to globalize themselves, deep-seated in social re-sponsibility and hold a rich chemical library. \" He adds, \"We share the same sense of responsibility and strong willingness to work together. \" GREEN SKIES AHEAD Norwegian wood may power tomorrow's air travel BY NANCY BAZILCHUK With more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline rumpled by deep fjords and rugged mountains, Norway seems tailor-made for the airline industry. In fact, industry ex-perts are known to joke that \"When God created Norway, he was think-ing about aviation. \" Now, a coalition of forest indus- try representatives, environmental organizations and aviation companies hope to make air travel in Norway greener by laying the groundwork for aviation biofuels. In November 2014, two jets operated by Norway's two major airlines, SAS and Norwe-gian, flew between domestic airports with a 48-52 blend of biofuel and conventional A-1 jet fuel. The blend cuts carbon dioxide emissions by 40% compared to regular jet fuel. In addition, Oslo Airport is the world's first biofuel \"hub, \" where biofuel will be supplied through the fuel pipelines and hydrants. Norway's first two biofuel flights \"were important to show people that this was possible, because there are a lot of myths about biofuels, \" says K\u00e5re Gunnar Fl\u00f8ystad, an adviser at ZERO, a Norway-based nonprofit that promotes cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and which helped organize the flights. Among the passengers traveling from Bergen to Oslo was Tine Sundtoft, Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment. While she was impressed with the flight, she said that the government would be reluctant to unilaterally require Nor-way's airlines to use a biofuel blend, because it is at least double the price of conventional jet fuel. In spite of the costs, the Lufthansa Group, SAS and KLM have signed an agreement to purchase biofuel from the Oslo Airport refueling facil-ity. Avinor, the government-owned company that runs 46 of Norway's 52 airports, will subsidize the cost of the biofuel, says Olav Mosvold Larsen, senior executive advisor at Avinor. Biofuel users will also avoid Norway's US$0.13 per liter carbon tax on do-mestic jet fuels, he says. One potential source of biofuels is wood, says Erik Lahnstein, execu-tive director of the Norwegian Forest Owners Federation, which represents 36,000 landowners and roughly 70% of the country's forest production. As demand for paper products drops, the industry has closed mills and factories. Two recent initiatives are intended to pave the way for Norway's do-mestic production of wood-derived biofuels. The renewable-energy com-pany Statkraft and the Swedish forest company S\u00f6dra are exploring biofuel production at a former cellulose fac-tory in Hurum, while Avinor has pledged roughly US$12 million over the next decade for biofuel projects. A 2013 study commissioned by Avinor and the Norwegian airline industry concluded that Norway could sustain-ably produce up to 230 million liters of biofuel from wood products at competitive prices by 2025. \"There is a need and space for aviation in the future world, \" Larsen says. \"We just have to make sure it is as sustainable as possible. \" India faces an arduous road ahead, but the significance of Modi's undertaking cannot be overstated. \"When God created Norway, he was thinking about aviation.\" 80 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW COUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 81BETTING ON BIOSIMILARS A Polish pharmaceutical company scales up to meet the demand in a burgeoning market BY KARYN HEDE Just as generic versions of small-molecule drugs have helped to reduce health-care costs, biosimilars offer an alternative to the class of medications known as biologics. Unlike small-molecule drugs, which are derived from chemicals, biolog-ics are produced from living cells. Generic-like versions of biologics are called biosimilars because they work like their patented counterparts, but\u2014unlike generics\u2014can have small structural differences. Over the next decade, biosimilar drugs may well provide substantial price and market competition for biologics, which made up a US$170 billion industry in 2013 and ranked among the world's most profitable drugs. Many biologic drugs will soon lose patent protection in Europe and the United States, opening the door to manufacturers poised to bring biosimilar versions to market. Europe has been at the forefront of the biosimilar industry, adopting a regulatory framework in 2005. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved 20 biosimilars, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its first biosimilar product, a version of the white blood cell-boost-ing filgrastim, in March 2015.Looking to capture the biosimilars market in Eastern Europe, Polphar-ma, Poland's largest manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals, has invested in an R&D laboratory and facility capable of manufacturing clinical-grade biosimilar drugs. Located in the Gdansk Science and Technology Park, Polpharma's biologic unit hopes to register four or five biosimilar drugs with the EMA in the next few years, according to Klaus Martin, the company's head of biologics. \"Like generics, biosimilars are very important to rein in health-care spending and allow wider access to drugs, \" he says. Cur-rently, the firm has a proprietary portfolio, but Martin says at least some are monoclonal antibody drugs that will soon be coming off patent. \"I'm quite confident that Polpharma can deliver quite a cost-competitive set-up, \" he says. \"If you look at originator drugs, many of these use technologies that were available 10, 15, 20 years ago. The cell lines they used years ago were nowhere near as productive as modern systems. \" The first biologics manufacturing facilities relied on large, dedicated fermenters and fixed stainless steel pipes that required time-consuming and expensive work stoppages to clean and maintain. In contrast, modern cell-line technology uses smaller-batch, flexible systems with sterile, single-use disposable fermen-tation bags. The single-use bags are incinerated onsite, says Martin, and even help generate electricity at the Gdansk plant, further reducing costs. Production can be scaled up quickly by operating fermenters in parallel. He adds that very few pharmaceutical companies have bothered to re-engi-neer their cell lines to achieve higher productivity with existing biologic drugs, because doing so would entail new rounds of expensive clinical trials to show biosimilarity to their earlier production lines. In addition, lower upfront costs allow Polpharma to produce these medicines at a reduced price, which should offer further financial relief for patients and healthcare providers worldwide. REDEFINING ROMANIA Generating the infrastructure and financing to establish a vital biotech presence BY BACHIR ABI SALLOUM In 1916, Romanian physiologist Nicolae Constantin Paulescu developed a pancreatic extract that was an early version of the life-saving insulin used to treat diabetes. Although he was not among those honored with the 1923 Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin, experts have since contended that Paulescu was robbed. Some say that his accomplishment stayed hidden while World War I ravaged his coun-try. Whatever the reason, it remains clear that the Romanian scientist was not sufficiently recognized for his contributions to the field. And today, as Romania makes significant strides toward building a dynamic biotech industry in the region, its efforts have gone similarly unnoticed by the rest of the world. In a concerted effort between government agencies, academia and private companies, Romania has grown its biotechnology sector with research centers in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Brasov and other cities. But the first dedicated biotechnology cluster in Romania\u2014and southeastern Europe for that matter\u2014is bioROne in Iai, located in the northeastern part of the country. Researchers at bioROne focus on biomedicine, including bioinformat-ics and biopharmaceuticals, genetic testing and gene therapy. In the past five years, scientists there have been granted 100 patents, and the center's cumulative budget during that period was about US$56 million. Truly a collaborative venture, the cluster was launched by a group representing the country's leading universities, research centers, industry members and other key organizations. Among the 12 founding partners are the Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iai, SC Antibiotice SA, which is the largest Romanian-owned pharmaceutical company, and the public agencies Institutul bioROne col-laborates with international advisors, including the U.S.-based nonprofit Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology. Eventually, scientists at bioROne hope to commercialize their laborato-ry discoveries. In order to develop its own pharmaceutical products, how-ever, the cluster will need far more funding. As it stands its entire annual budget would barely pay for a small fraction of the cost of developing a single drug. Alternatively, bioROne is looking to attract clinical trials or start-ups to the region. To do this, the Romanian government is taking steps to improve its infrastructure, for example, by joining forces with the European Union and the Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy Iai to raise about US$11 million for a research facility in northeastern Romania to be used for preclinical and clinical studies. Despite Romania's underappreci- ated status in the biotech field, some metrics do attest to its impact. For example, a search of PubMed revealed more than 500 scientific publications in 2014 based on work carried out in Iai. To move from research to commercial results, however, Romania must ensure that the world sees its discoveries\u2014and continue to build an industry that will generate more of them. REVOLUTION- IZING RUSSIA To embrace its economic future, Russia must let go of its past BY KARYN HEDE Many experts wonder what will emerge from Russia's economic turn away from the West. Is its standing among the so-called BRIC nations\u2014the up-and-coming economic powers of Brazil, Russia, India and China\u2014in jeopardy? In the future, will we be discussing the rise of the BICS nations instead, replacing Russia with South Africa, whose growing momentum can't be ignored? And how will Russia's past, with its complicated at-titudes toward business and capital-ization, affect the country's present ability to cultivate aspiring entrepre-neurs from within? In Lonely Ideas: Can Russia Com- pete? (The MIT Press, 2013), Loren Graham chronicles the brilliance of Russian inventiveness, as well as the nation's continued failure to sustain and build upon its scientific achieve-ments. A leading U.S. scholar on Russian science and technology and a foreign member of the Russian Acad-emy of Sciences, Graham goes on to question whether Russia can reverse its centuries-old pattern of stifling domestic technological progress. \"[Russians] have made the mistake again and again and again of thinking that modernization is the same thing as obtaining technol-ogy, \" says Graham, who is a research Over the next decade, biosimilar drugs may well provide substantial price and market competition for biologics. And how will Russia's past, with its complicated attitudes toward business and capitalization, affect the country's present ability to cultivate aspiring entrepreneurs from within?82 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEW COUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 83scholar in Russian studies at Harvard University. \"They've got to come to the realization that a high-tech coun-try possesses those ingredients in the society that make the development of high technology self-sustaining. It doesn't have to be ordered from above. If you get the right ingredients together, it will take off on its own. \" Graham characterizes Russia's failure to achieve success commensu-rate with its intellectual firepower as, in part, an attitudinal problem that stems from its distain for business as a \"disreputable activity. \" Even today, with the rise of Russia's middle class and its burgeoning business commu-nity, Russian scholars maintain nega-tive attitudes about commercializing their inventions, he says. Graham does concede that there are calls for commercialization of technology among Russia's growing business class and in its schools of management. Still, he finds that the attitudes of many innovators remain mired in a distain for the \"bourgeoisie. \" Nonetheless, Graham sees some hopeful signs for Russia's economic future, such as systemic changes in the way it invests in science and technol-ogy. New institutions like the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (akin to the U.S. National Science Foundation) and such venture capital funds as Max-well Biotech have been established, making it possible for individuals and small groups to seek funding outside of state control and direction. In ad-dition, foreign technology companies have made inroads and forged col-laborations with Russian scientists and nascent entrepreneurs. Y et foreigners with available cash don't feel legally secure investing in Russian science, according to Graham. Reforming Russian laws to provide busi-nesses with greater intellectual property protections, he says, would go a long way toward improving the country's economic prospects. Otherwise, Russia will likely maintain the status quo, or as Graham describes it, its \"consistent record, both brilliant and dismal. \" SEA OF GREEN Seaweed may be the solution for Scotland' s natural-products industry BY BILL CANNON Synonymous with golf and whiskey, Scotland brims with something else that might one day help define this nation: seaweed. At least that's the hope of biotechnology boost-ers Donald Fowler and Jim Brown. Fowler, based in Argyll, is senior development manager for life sciences with the Highlands and Islands (HIE), a government economic and commu-nity development agency for the north and west of Scotland. Brown directs the annual Natural Product Biotechnology conference in Inverness. \"There's a huge resource of kelp forest off the west coast, \" Brown says. \"The ocean currents are very favor-able to us, and there are industrial-scale quantities of seaweed. \" The currents bring a large brown algae species that is of particular interest, Fowler says, called Laminaria hyper - borea \u20148 to 11 million tons of it, with sustainable annual yields of 100,000 to 200,000 tons. This bounty of sea-weed is not only used in its raw form as organic fertilizer and an animal feed supplement, but also provides a gelling agent called alginate, made up of acids from its cell walls, which can be used in food processing. In fact, it was the Scottish chemist E.C.C. Stanford who discovered alginates in the 1880s. Fowler and Brown support increasing seaweed harvests through the development of sustainable and \"extensive farms for biorefining of alginates and other high-value chemi-cals with byproducts for biofuels, \" Fowler says. Brown notes a \"potential for a virtuous cycle\" if these seaweed farms can be located near Scotland's sprawling fish farms\u2014salmon alone is a US$2 billion industry\u2014to \"tie in with environmental remediation. \" That is, to sop up nitrogen from fish excrement. \"There's a real synergy there, \" Fowler says, with \"fish farm and seaweed side by side [and] with other species grazing on the seaweed that have a harvestable value as well\u2014sea urchins, sea cucumbers. \" Researchers at Scottish companies have been investigating seaweed and its microscopic cousin, microalgae, for a variety of uses, Fowler explains, including nutritional supplements, anti-aging creams and other \"cos-meceuticals, \" or pharmaceutical-cosmetics hybrids. In addition, Scottish biotechnologists see other natural-product targets that fit today's going-green philosophy. For example, the Scottish firm CelluComp converts vegetable processing waste from car-rots and beetroot and other naturally derived waste products into pigments, specialty celluloses, coatings and rheology products. Not surprisingly, Fowler points out, deriving products from na-ture fosters collaboration between academia and industry. Research partners include the University of the Highlands and Islands's Scottish Association for Marine Science, the Industrial Biotechnology Innova-tion Centre and large companies like Unilever, Croda, DSM and BASF as well as more specialized ones, such as GlycoMar, which screens marine organisms for useful polysaccharide compounds and supplements. Brown says the research-business crosspollination is beginning to pay off. At his first Natural Product Biotechnology meeting in 2009, 50 people showed up, mostly academ-ics. \"We thought we were doing quite well, \" he says. But when the group met last fall, the gathering had swelled to more than 300 attendees, including 80 businesses\u2014many of them casting an eye toward Scotland's seaweed, its most abundant and undulating of natural resources. FROM CRAB TO LAB Fighting infections the natural way BY BILL CANNON More spider than crus-tacean, the horseshoe crab resembles a ta-rantula wearing an old army helmet. It's a liv- ing fossil, its basic design unchanged in 440 million years. And the Atlan-tic horseshoe crab, Limulus poly - phemus , can survive out of water for weeks, on beaches from Maine to the Yucatan. Moreover, royal bluebloods have nothing on the horseshoe crab. Its blood really is blue, enlisting copper, rather than iron, to transport oxygen. That blue blood\u2014says John Dubczak, general manager of the endotoxin and microbial detection division of Charles River Laboratories, a US$1 billion-plus global contract research organization with head-quarters in Wilmington, Massachu-setts\u2014is remarkable at detecting harmful impurities in pharmaceuti-cals and medical devices. Charles River has built its endo- toxin and microbial detection busi-ness by harnessing the crab's natural defense against infection: at the first sign of a toxin, the blood clots to block further spread. The company's Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test detects this clotting reaction and is \"the most sensitive in the world for bacterial endotoxins, \" says Dubczak, who is based in South Carolina, where he supervises the capture, blood collection and safe return of crabs to the sea. Endotoxins or \"pyrogens\"\u2014from the Greek for \"fire\" because they cause fever\u2014reside in cell wall membranes of E. coli and other so-called gram-negative bacteria that can induce lethal bloodstream infections. These \"dead bug parts, \" as Dubczak calls them, in a concentration of 70 parts per billion, \"will make a person sick. \" Limulus blood clots when it encoun-ters an endotoxin concentration of just 1 part per trillion. \"Y ou've seen an IV bag?\" Dubczak asks. \"The solution in that bag has to be tested for the absence of these pyrogens using our LAL reagent. \" So do the tubes and needles connecting the bag to the patient.Until Charles River pioneered the test in the 1970s, labs tested for pyrogens by exposing rabbits to the substance in question and then checking them for fever. The LAL is much less cumbersome, much more sensitive and is now the standard worldwide. What's more, the horseshoe crab is a renew-able resource. Technicians can remove up to a quarter of the crab's blood without harming the animal, which is held for less than 24 hours. Dubczak meets annually with a state natural resources official, crab suppliers and handlers to discuss best practices for minimizing loss as crabs are shuttled between the ocean and lab and back. In the early 1990s, alarmed by dwindling crab populations, Charles River found itself in an unusual position for industry\u2014lobbying for more regulation. South Carolina now limits times and places where crabs can be collected and bans their use as bait. Consequently, crab populations rebounded. In recent years, Charles River invented a cartridge that requires 20 times less blood than its original assay. That's good for business and horseshoe crabs. That blue blood is remarkable at detecting harmful impurities in pharmaceuti-cals and medical devices.84 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN | WORLDVIEWBY ROBERT HARIRI Living well into our 90s lies just ahead, if we keep fine-tuning the right tools.Although we can't live for- ever, we can aspire to live much longer and health-ier lives. In fact, living well into our 90s lies just ahead, if we keep fine-tuning the right tools. We start by understanding that aging arises from an accumulation of defects in our biology, and this causes joint decay, decreased muscle mass, Alzheimer's and so forth. With digital health\u2014basically, using high-perfor-mance computational tools to study complex biological processes\u2014we can interrogate the cellular and molecu-lar events that occur during human aging, and identify those that can be controlled or modified to slow or arrest those that degrade or degener-ate our bodies over time. To make the most of digital biology, I joined forces with my friends and colleagues\u2014Craig Venter and Peter Diamandis\u2014to form Human Longevity, Inc. (HLI). At HLI, we combine knowledge from many areas of biology\u2014the genome, proteome, biome and more\u2014with advanced approaches to computing and informatics, all to create sophisticated cellular therapies. To build these treatments, we are col-lecting data on genomes and health outcomes from people around the world. All of that information will be combined to build powerful cellular therapies\u2014actually developed from enhanced human cells\u2014that will battle cancer, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, dementia and more. Further, these treatments will keep our bodies and minds performing as if they were younger and for a longer time.Fundamentally, this work depends on making the most of tools that our bodies already possess, and I started thinking about these tools years ago. FROM TRASH TO TREATMENT Early in my medical career, I special-ized in the treatment of head and spinal cord injuries. With one patient, a defect in the tissue that surrounds the brain, the dura mater, needed to be repaired after a serious head injury. I realized, from my ob/gyn rotation, that the amnion\u2014this amazing, clear plastic-like tissue that surrounds an embryo\u2014looked a lot like the tissue around the brain that I needed to replace. That moment spawned other ideas about biological tissues being used in new ways. In particular, I started thinking that the placenta\u2014the leftovers of birth\u2014could be used as a source of stem cells. Instead of just throwing away the placenta after birth, we could make use of it. My personal \"eureka moment\" led me to form Anthrogenesis, which later became Celgene Cellular Therapeu-tics, where we mined the placenta as a source of stem cells that can be turned into treatments. A stem cell carries the remark- able capacity to participate in renovation or repair at any place in the body. Moreover, we can get these cells from many places beyond the placenta, including bone marrow and even fat tissue. Stem cells all \"think\" they are still in a fetus, and that is perhaps the most regenerative environment of all. In fetal surgery, for instance, you can open the uterus early in a pregnancy, perform sur - gery on the fetus, close up and let the baby come to term\u2014and you won't see a scar. Y ou won't see any evidence of the surgery at all. So a fetus can repair and renew itself. What's fuel-ing that ability? Stem cells. These same cells keep us healthy in our youth. Over the years, though, this regenerative \"engine\" runs lean on fuel, the stem cells. As that hap-pens, the defects of age start to accu-mulate. In addition, stem cells orches-trate our response to injury, making them perhaps our best defense against disease. The susceptibility to disease thus increases as we age. REPOSITORY OF REP AIR How can stem cells fix things? It's in their DNA, which forms a repository of synthetic repair. Every stem cell contains information, in its DNA, that codes for the production of molecules that guide the signaling and synthe-sis behind all of the steps that make tissues and organs. In this process, a primordial stem cell undergoes a series of cellular divisions that make it more specialized at every step. We can watch such a change under a microscope, as this primordial cell turns into a heart cell or a neuron\u2014all depending on its surrounding envi-ronmental cues that drive the DNA to create different things. This DNA makes up a sort of biological software. Like lines of digital code, the genes in the DNA can be processed to drive an action, like generating a protein. As a stem cell develops into a specialist like a neuron, though, it loses the ability to be anything else. That neuron, for example, can't turn on the genes that make a heart cell. And this is what happens as our cells age\u2014they lose their versatility. At some point, we lose the ability to rejuvenate. As we gather data on human genes and the outcomes that they cre-ate, healthcare experts can turn that knowledge into treatments for disease and to fight ordinary aging. In short, we must find ways to replenish the regenerative engine, and we do that by replenishing the reservoir of stem cells that provide synthetic versatility. With this knowledge, we can iden- tify defective products\u2014cells or tissues or organs\u2014and then use stem cell-driven synthesis to restore the function of those parts. Doing this, though, depends on a deep understanding of how the biological software, a stem cell's DNA, drives repair in its youth and loses that ability with age. So by better understanding aging and the molecular changes that drive it, we can learn to slow it down or work around it in places. We can find ways to use stem cells\u2014maybe our own, those from someone else or from a placenta\u2014to control certain diseases or to restore functionality as we age. The future of stem cells and the future of cellular medicine will benefit from this analogy with computers and digital processing. Y our software, your biological software, that is, resides in the nucleus. It's not that different than having binary code that resides in the memory access of a computer. This thinking leads us to the concept of re-programming the biological software of stem cells, which is already hap-pening in activities to create induced pluripotent stem cells. These tools provide a platform for controlling fate and function, and they have broad biomedical applications. The most exciting one to me is prolonging and extending the quality of life.
