We recommend that individuals follow their doctor's guidance in regard to stress and anxiety. \u00dc Relax is a drink used to promote relaxation that contains the herb kava, along with other botanical ingredients. The drink is sold by a brand called Calming Co., which claims that their product \"takes just a few minutes to set in for up to 4 hours of pure, uninterrupted bliss.\" But does \u00dc Relax contain research-backed ingredients for promoting relaxation, or are these just marketing claims? Does the brand use any questionable additive ingredients? Is kava safe for daily use? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of \u00dc Relax? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more, as we analyze the ingredients in \u00dc Relax based on medical studies to give our take on whether it's likely to be effective, or if it's a waste of money. We'll discuss if it's unsafe to consume kava regularly, and feature unsponsored customer reviews of this product. Ingredient Analysis The active ingredients in \u00dc Relax are shown above. This formulation does contain some research-backed ingredients for stress relief. Kava was described as an effective treatment for short-term (but not long-term) treatment for anxiety in a 2018 [meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30396607/). Chamomile is a flowering plant that was described as a \"mild tranquilizer and sleep inducer\" in a 2010 [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995283/), and chamomile extract at a higher dose than that in \u00dc Relax was shown to be safe and to reduce moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms in a [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646235/) published in the Phytomedicine journal. Lemon balm extract is clinically shown to reduce anxiety and depression, as we documented in our [NoonBrew reviews](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/noonbrew-review) article on another brand that includes this ingredient. Ashwagandha extract is an adaptogen that was found to have an anti-stress effect in a 2021 [clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8632422/), with trial participants taking ashwagandha extract 83% more likely to achieve control over their stress than participants taking placebo. L-theanine is an amino acid that's well-studied for its effects on anxiety. A [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836118/) published in the Nutrients journal reported that supplementation of l-theanine reduced stress scores in adults. Clearly, there are a number of effective active ingredients in \u00dc Relax, but there are also some inactive ingredients that may be questionable from a health perspective. The inactive ingredients in \u00dc Relax are shown below: Citric acid is a preservative and flavor enhancer shown in a [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097542/) published in the Toxicology Reports journal to cause whole-body inflammation in some individuals. Natural flavors is healthier than artificial flavors, but a 2013 [medical review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3620743/) documented some toxicity concerns with some flavoring additives and their metabolites. Overall, we consider \u00dc Relax likely to support stress relief and relaxation. From an efficacy and potency perspective, this is an impressive formulation. However, beyond the inactive ingredients we have concerns about its safety. In the next section of this article, we'll discuss potential dangers of kava supplementation. Is Kava Dangerous? While kava is an effective natural stress reliever, it may injure the liver. Dietary supplements containing kava have been associated with severe liver injury, according to the FDA. A [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20720265/) published in the Annals of Hepatology documented 14 patients with liver injury suspected to be caused by kava use. The study authors concluded that \"...in a few individuals kava may be hepatotoxic.\" A 2010 medical review described the following: \"Kava hepatotoxicity is a well-defined herb-induced liver injury, caused the use of commercial anxyolytic ethanolic and acetonic kava extracts, and of traditional recreational aqueous kava extracts.\" A segment on the Dr. Phil show has over 40,000 views on YouTube and features doctors discussing whether kava and kratom teas are dangerous: Does \u00dc Relax Cause Side Effects? \u00dc Relax doesn't appear to be clinically tested, which makes it challenging to say for certain whether or not the supplement will cause side effects. However, we can make an educated guess based on its active ingredients. The most common side effect of kava use is a skin rash, according to a [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9855570/) published in the Alternative Medicine Reviews journal. The more serious side potential effects such as liver injury are less common. \u00dc Relax uses a proprietary (prop) blend for its active ingredients, which make it more challenging to assess side effect risk because only the total dose is published rather than the individual dose of each ingredient. A [page](https://www.calmingco.com/pages/kava) on Calming Co's website suggests that kava is effective \"without any side effects,\" which we find to be a dangerous and misleading statement given the clinical studies we've cited in this article. We urge the brand to retract this statement and the FDA to investigate this statement. On an individual basis, it's challenging to assess side effect risk, but we do consider \u00dc Relax more likely to cause side effects than the average anti-anxiety supplement we've reviewed on Illuminate Health given our concerns about kava. Real People Try \u00dc Relax The only unsponsored online review we could find of \u00dc Relax comes from a TikTok user named Sabrina: ] A YouTube creator named Cecilia Blanco shared her experience using kava, including pros and cons: Can Tea Naturally Induce Relaxation? There are several types of tea which are actually clinically shown to help drinkers relax. Green tea was shown in a 2017 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566632/) to significantly reduce stress levels, and has been used to promote mental and physical wellness for centuries.

Reishi mushroom was shown in an [animal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879659/) to have antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects. This is not as strong of a standard of evidence as a human trial, but a 2016 [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008811/) states that this mushroom has been used by traditional cultures to reduce stress for many years.
