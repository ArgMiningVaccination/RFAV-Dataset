The Daily lowanlMary Locke Kent State serv\u00b7ice \u00b7held in VI chapel By S.P. FOWLER Staff Writer With a backdrop of thunder, lightening and rain, about 15 persons met at Danforth Chapel Wednesday night as a memorial to students killed at Kent State and Jackson State universities seven years ago. Students, ministers and townspeople burned .dles and read poetry and newspaper clippings, sharing thoughts about the meaning of war protests and how the students' deaths affected their lives. .- Campus minister Susan Burden remembered that \"seven years ago I was here in this chapel. I helped organize a wake for the four killed at Kent State. There weren't any caskets here, but in many ways we felt the presence of those people. \"We prayed, meditated, and in a sense tried to heal one another because we knew it could just as easily have been one of us. \"We had the same fears, beliefs, confusion, the sam~ sense of Impotence,\" she said. Burden reminded everyone that anti-war protests were also occurring on the Ul campus in the spring of 1970. \"By May 5, 51 persons were arrested. By night, over a thousand had converged on Iowa and Riverside avenues and Burlington Street. By May 8, 221 people were arrested on Ul President Willard Boyd's order. Boyd also canceleq the 89th annual governor's day in the interest of public safety. \"The next day Boyd expressed regret for the arrests, saying that he had acted on incorrect information,\" Burden said. \"On May 12, the student strike began. Boyd offered a special option to those students who wanted to leave school early. Twelve thousand students took options and left. Everybody went home and summer began,\" she said. Jim Jacobsen, Catholic Student Center staff member, told of a nation-wide poll taken shorUy after the killings. \"They asked people who was to blame for the deaths,\" he said. \"Fifty-eight per cent said the students, 11 per cent said the national guard and 31 per cent said they had no opinion.\" Ken Wesseis, A3, said that \"since the end of the war, there's been a re-birth of human love. This to me is proof that what was going on has come to a positive end. It wasn't pointless.\" \"Kent Slate had a big impact on my life,\" Larry Eckholt tolc! the group. \"But today it doesn't seem possible that it all hap\u00ad pened. I'm afraid people have forgotten. It seems the countr1; has this fake sense of 'everything's working out.' \" After about an hour of reminiscing, Burden asked \"that we share a sign of peace by shaking everyone's hands and singing I,e Shall Overcome.''' The people stood and moved slowly around the room singing and shaking hands. \"Deep in my heart, I do believe we shallllve in peace one day.\" Outside, it had stopped raining. Thursday, May 5, 1977, Vol. 109, No. 198 Iowa City, Iowa 52242 10 cents Nixon cotnmitted 'mistakes in his heart WASHINGTON (UPI) - Richard Nixon admitted Wednesday he lied, made \"mistakes of the heart\" and \"let down the country\" in Watergate, but said he commit\u00ad ted no crimes and defiantly concluded: \"If they want me to get down on the floor and grovel, no. Never.\" admits. \"Ilet down the country, I let down our system of government. I have made so many bad judgments. The worst ones, mistakes of the heart, rather Ulan the head.\" The interview was taped in March, and Nixon seemed relaxed, in good spirits and full of confidence Wednesday as he went to his routine daily round of golf in California and told ABC: \"I feel good.\" Nixon said part of his undoing was Ulat he was too soft-hearted and delayed firing his favorite aides, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrllchman. He said the essence of his Watergate downfall was this: \"I, ah, I did some of the big things rather well. I screwed up terribly in what was a little thing and became a big thing, but I will have to admit I wasn't a good butcher.\" The most starWng revelation in the OO-minute interview - Nixon's first since leaving office -Is that he considered resigning on April 30, 1973, the day Haldeman and Ehrlichman quit.l'hat was a full year and a half before Nixon stepped down Aug. 9, 1974. \"I seriously considered whether I shouldn't resign,\" he said, adding that he felt \"responsible even though I did not feel Ulatlhad,ah,engaged in these activities consciously. \"I think the major reasons I stayed in office was my concern about keeping the China initiative, the Soviet initiative, the Vietnam fragile peace agreement and the first breakthrough in the Middle East.\" At the very end of the in\u00b7 terview Nixon tells of his final days in office, and the 1' ... ,,. .. 1 11 he still harbors. \"Yep, I let the people down, and -I have carry that burden with me the rest of my life,\" he said. \"My political life Is over. I will never again have an opportuni\u00b7 ty to serve in any official position.\" Despite relentless questioning See NIXON, pile \"1ft. Ending his self-imposed exile in an emotional interview with David Frost, Nixon disclosed he almost resigned in April 1973 - 17 months before he actually left office -because he felt \"responsible\" for the scandal. Nixon said Watergate will be his lifelong burden, but he denied all the major charges against him in the scandal. He said he did not obstruct justice by participating in the Water\u00b7 gate cover-up, did not authorize hush money to the burglars, never contemplated clemency for the conspirators and was gullty of no impeachable or criminal offense. Nixon also confides that his resigna tlon decision sha ttered him emotionally. He recalls Ulat, at a fareweli meeting with congressional allies on the night of his resignation speech, \"I sort of cracked up; started to cry\" for the first time since the death of Dwight Eisenhower. Business boolDing as VI lDajor Tersely, he said: \"If they want me to get down and grovel on the floor, no. Never. Ah, because I don't believe I should.\" Nixon will be paid $600,000 for submitting to the Frost inter\u00b7 views, plus an estimated 10 to 20 per cent of any profits. While not yielding on the major charges, Nixon admits he did not tell the truth about the scandal, was too protective of his closest aides and failed .to call a halt to some of the cover\u00ad up activities once he learned of them. \"I brought myself down,\" he For one hour Nixon and Frost' engage in a give and take - while the words are sharp, there is no shouting. The final half hour is more relaxed and Nixon makes two long emotional soliloquies. There his eyes are averted, his head tilted slightly and he speaks slowly, with frequent long pauses. At one point, pressed by Frost to acknowledge that criminal actions may be involved, Nixon threw his head back, and the corners of his mouth turned downward. 'Technically I did not commit a crime, an impeachable of\u00b7 fense.\" he said, \"As far as the handling of this matter is concerned, it was so botched up. I made so many bad judgments . The worst ones, mistakes of the heart, rather than the head.\" Are you ready? By K. PATRICK JENSEN News Editor Editor's note; VI students exist in a world of their own. knowing very little about the university except what im\u00b7 mediately affects them. This Is the fourth 0/ a series about problems and issues affecting the VI's 10 colleges. \"Success breeds success\" says Dean B.L. Barnes and the UI College of Business Administration ls e.xperiencing growth pains. Drastic enrollment growths in recent years have literally pushed the college against the wall in some areas of Phillips Hall, the college's building, and there's no sign of stopping, according to Barnes. Business enrollments have climbed 15 per cent, 22 per cent, and 19.6 per cent in each of the last three years, Barnes said. University records show there were 913 undergraduates In the college in 1972. Last year this increased to 1,090 students and last fali 1,135 undergraduates enrolled in the college. Waiting in the wings this year are 531 freslunen pre-business majors -up from 398last year. \"We've taken tremendous growth in the college,\" Barnes observes. \"We don't know how we can handle them two years from now when they come into the college,\" he adds, referring to the pre-business majors. With 1,135 students declaring business majors, another 1,200 students in the College ofl Liberal Arts are pre-business majors working on the college's requirements needed for ad\u00b7 mittance. The college is now one-third over the capacity Phillips Hall was built to accommodate in 1965, according to Barnes. Enrollments in schools of business run counter to economic conditions, Barnes explains. Most of the college's The open road calling lS By JA Y WALLJASPER Staff Writer Okay, vagabonds, fair\u00b7 weather hoboes,\u00b7 collegiate itinerants and those of you gathering material for your quintessential American novels, the warm weather has gloriously arrived and the gusty drama of the open road beckons you. Right? Having already read Kerouac as well as the Datsun Student Travel Guide, you feel confident Ulat this is the summer you'll finally make it to Big Sur or the Big Apple ... or at least to Lake Okoboji. Ah, but gas prices are zooming, and the sputters from your old car have turned into wheezes and groans. Wit! your savings you could buy a bus ticket to Indianola, or ride Amtrak to the outskirts of Ottumwa. By now you realize that if you're I going to get anywhere exciting this sum\u00b7 mer, you're going to have to hitchhike. Hitchhiking has two crucial advantages over other modes of travel for the college student who wants to log experience as well as miles. First of all, it's free, allowing you to travel farther, until your pockets are I empty. Secondly, it provides a sterling opportunity to meet a whole array of characters whose likes are seldom found on college cam~use~. Thumbing does have Its disadvantages, though, primarily because you are dependent upon the kind\u00b7 ness of strangers, and it isn't the best way for everyone to travel. But a spirit of adventure mixed with some common sense and advance preparation can make hitchhiking a very rewarding way to see the ,country. One of the most important things for a hitchhiking college student to remember is to consciously look like a college student. If you look like a collegiate, the drivers assume you are impoverished, and thumbing is justified in their minds because it is your only means of travel. However, if you don't appear collegiate, many people will consider you a bum because you can't afford a car or bus fare, and they'll leave you standing there. Looking clean (as opposed to , Thumbing looking clean-<:ut) is important in enticing drivers to stop for you, and wearing a T\"'Ihirt emblazoned with the name fi a university will greatly enhance your image as a student. Long hair on men may increase the changes of garnering a ride with some folks and decrease it with others, but in any case It See MORE, pace five. The Dally lowaniOom Frll/lCO enrolbnent growth has occurred during the current economic recession. Not only are job possibilities strong in private businesses for business administration students, but students with doctoral degrees find them\u00b7 selves in a \"seller's market\" according to Barnes.\"Exceqent job opportunities in business and government create an extremely high opportunity and reduce the number of students who pursue doctoral programs,\" Barnes said. \"As a result, demand for faculty' exceeds supply and the market reacts by pushing salaries higher.\" Among the effects of enrollment growth has been \"critical space problems\" in the college, heavy faculty teaching loads, and, at times, overuse of graduate assistants in teaching upper level courses. Another effect is a tightening in operational funds. The academic planning and review report prepared for the state Board of Regents last fall shows that expenditures per credit hour in the coliege have dropped from $51.12 in 1971-72 to $43.43 in 1975-76. The use of graduate TAs in upper divison courses has been aspecialconcern to Barnes.\"We have been forced in recent years to use graduate teaching assistants in upper division courses in emergency situations and I don't think that's ad\u00ad visable,\" Barnes said. \"We've had an excessive use of graduate TAs in the upper divisons, but no more than other schools of business faced with the same problem of short supply of professors and ex\u00ad panded enrollments.\" In addition to doubling up or tripling up T As in some office spaces, Barnes said, the college has been unable to supply office space to many RAs doing research projects. \"Last month more than 50 research assistants employed on con\u00b7 I tracts (for outside groups) were working in a former seminar room that was converted to work space for some students,\" Barnes said, noting that another 40 RAs were \"with no work or office space.\" Barnes explains that, among other things, graduate students\u00b7 and a few undergraduate I students last fall studied business practices at 41 small businesses in eastern Iowa under a Small Business Administration program. Students, under faculty guidance, use their theoretical base to study all aspects of the business and suggest im- provement. t In addition, the college f maintains contacts with the business world through the See BUSINESS, pqe Iii. Amin arrests exiles NAIROBI, Kenya (UPl) -Uganda said Wednesday 37 Tan\u00b7 zanian and Ugandan exiles arrested near the border were scouts for an invasion force from Tanzania and will be executed by firing squad. \"Tanzania cannot deny its involvement in a sinister plan of invasion against Uganda as actions speak louder than words,\" a military official said. \"Therefore the final decision is to bring the guerrlllas before a firing squad.\" President IdI Amin Tuesday charged that Tanzania was preparing an invasion and placed his armed forces on the alert. He said 37 Tanzanians and Ugandan exiles acting as the scouts for the attack had been arrested and were undergoing interrogation. Tanzania denied the charges, which Amin has made regularly for the past several years, and suggested the Ugandan leader was laying a smokescreen to obscure a fresh domestic crisis within , Uganda itself. \"A thief always denies whatever wrong thing he does,\" the ! official said Wednesday, adding that this time there was irrefutable proof Tanzania had planned an invasion. The official said he was \"dismayed\" Tanzania had seen fit to deny the Ugandan charges. The military official did not say when or where the captured \"guerrlllas\" would be executed. On Feb. 10,1973, Uganda publicly executed 12 \"guerrillas\" in their home districts so that \"even their parents can watch.\" The\" guerrillas\" initially were spotted by civilians, apparently along the common land border between the two countries and the official said they were arrested by security forces. In announcing the arrest on Tuesday, Amin threatened to take any war into Tanzania itself. \"Uganda will not be the battlefield,\" he said. \"The invaders and ' their supporters will be taught a lesson they will never forget.\" ! jnthenews~----------------------~----------------~------------------~ ra'dio said Wednesday. briefly llrms' WASHINGTON (UPI) -The House Inter\u00ad national Relations Committee Wednesday cut $15 million in mllitary credits for Zaire, sup\u00ad ported a fund to help Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) make a transition to black majority rule and Buthorized ,100 million for the black \"front line\" nations surrounding it.

PARIS (UPI) -The United States agreed Wednesday to allow Vietnam to join the United Nations, but refused to pay Hanoi war reparations . Following two days of talks, the United States and Vietnam also agreed to estabUsh diplomatic relations as soon as possible and Hanoi pledged to \"intensify\" its efforts to locate U.S. ser\u00ad vicemen missing In Vietnam. The question of war reparations has been a major issue advanced by the Vietnamese delegation, which has argued that former President Richard M. Nixon pledged in 1973 to pay up to $3.25 billion for postwar reconstruction. Vietnamese DeI>uty Foreign Minister Phan Hien said that dUring the talks he told U.S. Assistant Secretary of State RiChard Holbrooke, \"The United States is responsible for healing the wounds of war and helping to rebuild Vietnam.\" In Washington, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance' said the United States rejected the Vietnamese demand. \"We made clear that we won't pay war reparations, but we are prepared not to oppose their admission to the United Nations,\" Vance said. The carter administration has said the resumption of fighting in Vietnam, in violation of the Palis peace accords nullified any war reparation agreement between Hanoi and the Nixon administration. Carter, in the past, has left open the possibility~ however, that Hanoi might be eligible for normal aid from the United States. The United States has twice vetoed Vietnam's application to join the United Nations, deman\u00ad ding first the accounting of all American ser\u00ad vicemen missing in Vietnam. Amity on gynecology issue By TOM MAPP Staff Writer In their last meeting of the year, UI Student Health Services Committee members expressed satisfaction with the administration's response to the Student Health gynecology services controversy. comrruttee member Susan Sundberg, Nt As a result of the controversy, Sundberg said student input in matters is better recognized by the UI. She said she also believes that now more matters will be brought before the committee. At the close of. the meeting, Feldick said his only objection to the incident was the \"blast at Dr. Hicks. I'm sure she was upset, as anyone would be, and it hasn't been fair to her work.\" Templeman was critical of the original stol'Y' which appeared in The Daily Iowan Feb. 25\" concerning complaints against Hicks. Committee chairman Dave Templeman, A4, said the conunittee found Harley Feldick, director of Student Health Services, and John Colloton, director of UI Hospitals and assistant to the president for health services, \"cooperative to our conunittee and concerned about Ute qualitv of student health care.\" When asked by a committee member how the issue affected Student Health, Feldick com\u00ad mented that instead of a decrease in visits, there has recently been an increase. Earlier this semester, Patricia Hicks, the Student Health gynecolokist, came under fire for alleged \"condescending \" and \"unresponsive \" behavior to patients who came to her with gynecological problems. At one point in the controversy, Student Sen. Don Doumakes, G, hinted that some patients might file malpractice suits against Hicks, but no such actions have been taken. Other committee proposals discussed at the meeting included a request for outside assistance to evaluate students' reactions to the services offered at Student Health and the hiring of an additional staff person to help handle gynecological staffing needs or to give patients the option of seeing other physicians for gynecological examinations. On April 7, senate defeated a resolution calling for the dismissal of Hicks as a result of the complaints. The committee members also expressed concern about the financial status of Student Health and requested an investigation into op\u00ad tional or mandatory fee allocations to help in\u00ad cre.ase and improve the services provided there. Templeman said action on these proposals will have to wait until next year's committee meets. While the issue was being considered, two senior nursing students, Kathy Wetsch and Rachel Hegland, presented a list of proposals to Feldick and Colloton. Templeman conunented that Feldick and Colloton answered the proposals in a \"positive manner.\" He. cited as an example of their cooperation the dropping of a diaphragm fitting fee until the costs for all forms of birth control could be e~aluated. This measure was one of Wetsch's and Hegland's recommendations. Feldick announced at the meeting that Student He.alth will start an educational program con\u00ad cerned with alcoholism at some time in the near future. \"It will be an attempt to get people to recognize who is in need, of help,\" he said. He cited a survey conducted at a university in California that found that 46 per cent of responding students admitted to being in\u00ad toxicated at least once a month. \"At first the issue put everyone on the defensive, but once things cooled down, people started looking at things rationally,\" said Students offer legal aid By TOM MAPP Staff Writer The UI has numerous ser\u00ad vices and agencies that attempt to help students not only \"survive\" the trauma of college life, but also to enable them to leave Iowa City in one piece. One such organization is the UI Student Legal Services (SLS). SLS, which is staffed entirely by students (except the supervisor, who is a private attorney), will help anyone meeting three basic qualifications : first, she-he must be currently enrolled in the UI; second, she-he must meet Office of Economic Opportunities (OEO) financial guidelines for legal aid ser\u00ad vices; and third, her-his problem must fall within SLS's scope of services. According to SLS assistant director Doug Russell, OEO standards are used to ensure that only truly needy students use the service. Russell said SLS's purpose is to assist students who can't afford at\u00ad torneys' fees. He emphasized that although SLS doesn't charge for its services, students may have to pay court costs and other fees. Russell said SLS handles the following types of cases: -consumer and landlord problems; -small claims; -ereditor-debtor, personal disputes to $1,000; -simple misdemeanors; and -family law -divorce, adoption, name changes and other problems encountered with governmental ad\u00ad ministrative agencIes for welfare, food stamps and unemployment claims. Russell noted SLS doesn't handle taxes, real estate, wills, felonies, business In\u00ad corporations, bankruptcies or contract preparations. SLS abo doesn't accept fee-generating cases for which private at\u00ad torneys usually get a com\u00ad mission. These may Include I malpractice or 'large personal Injury claims, he said. \"Cases Involving real estate, wills or other financlal matters are best served by a priva~ attorney who can handle them on a continuous basis,\" Russell said.

Ervin says Nixon still 'covering Up' MEMPHIS, Tenn. (UPI) -Jt'onner Sen. Sam Ervin, who chaired the Watergate Committee, watched Richard Nixon on television Wednesday night with apparent anger and said, \"He's still covering up.\" Ervin was discovered sitting in the airport lobby awaiting, his Oight back to North Carolina and reluctantly agreed, at the urging \\ of a UPI reporter, to go to the airport bar to watch part of the television interview. He quickly became interested in it and leaned forward, cupping his ear to hear over the noise in the bar. Soon he began showing signs of disgust. \"He's still engaged in a cover-up operation,\" he snorted. M the point where Nixon denied saying at a March 21 meeting that money should be paid to an attorney for Howard Hunt, Ervin turned to the reporter and said, \"He paid blackmail of $75;000 that night. \" The Watergate tapes, Ervin said, had Nixon saying at the meeting \"at least five times\" that Hunt \"should be bought.\" \"The man contradicts his own words on his own tapes,\" Ervin said. Ervin's plane for Charlotte was called before the program ended. As he left, he said, \"I think it's good for the people to see it, because he's still covering up. I'm glad I didn't miss this one, but I don't care about the others.\" Bar patrons; recognizing the senator, flocked to him for autographs. At one point the bannaid moved to switch off the television but patrons stopped her, pointing out the senator. Ervin was changing planes en route from a speaking engage\u00ad ment in Shawnee, Okla., where he said fonner President Ford 'NIlS \"premature\" in pardoning Nixon . ~ fro. pace ODe. from Frost, backed up by scores of Nixon quotes from White House tapes, the former President refused to admit that he participated in the cover-up of the scandal or authorized the payment of hush money to the Watergate burglars. At points Nixon was defiant and referred to Watergate as a \"war\" where he fought \"a partisan special prosecutors staff ... partisan Senate (Watergate) committee staf\u00ad f ... partisan media ... and a partisan Judiciary Committee staff in the fifth colwnn.\" He said some of his friends had suggested there was a \"conspiracy to get you.\" \"There may have been,\" Nixon said. \"I don't know what the CIA had to do.\" \"I was not involved in the break-in engage in, or approve the payment of money or the authorization of clemency, which of course were the essenUal elements of the cover\u00ad up,\" Nixon maintained. But then he softened as Frost asked him to tell what he did do wrong. Having spent more than an hour denying Frost's specific charges of\u00b7 criminal activity, Nixon mellows in last third of the show. He admits he made some mistakes, did not take strong action to halt some things he knew were going on, and \"I said some things that were not true. \"I brought myself down,\" he said. \"I gave 'em a sword. And, they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.\" Frost pressed Nixon again to admit criminal liabilities, and Nixon responded by telling what he thought. would happen if the impeachment inquiry were car\u00ad ried out. \"That was only an indictment and would have to be tried in the Senate,\" he said of the articles of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee. \"I might have won. I might have lost. \"But even if I'd won in the Senate by a vote or two, I would have been crippled ... and in any event, for six months the country couldn't afford having the President in the dock in the United States Senate.\" The last half hour of the show was taped several days after the segments seen in the first hour. Nixon's mood had changed. He was more subdued, less combative, and the session had a more philosophical tone. Frost began the session with a hard question: after John Dean had told him the full story of all the Watergate crimes on March 21, he asked, \"Why didn't you pick up the phone and tell the cops there is no evidence anywhere of a rebuke and nowhere do you say 'this is disgraceful conduct.' \" Nixon said he wanted to take his time answering this question because he feels strongly about it. He began by telling of his strong friendship with Halde\u00ad man and Ehrlichman. He said he dreaded firing them, and waS' particularly sensitive about it because when he was vice president, Dwight Eisenhower had ordered him to fire Sher\u00b7 man Adams for accepting gifts from a government contractor . \"It was one of the most, ah, I would say difficult periods, heart rending, hard to use the adjectives that are adequate, e~riences in my life,\" Nixon said. \"It took me two weeks to work it out (that they had to be fired). Tortuous long sessions.\" The actually firing came at Camp David late in April 1973. \"Haldeman came in first, he's standing as he usually does, not a Germanic Nazi stonn trooper, but just a decent, respected crew-cut guy,\" Nixon recalled. When Ehrlichman came in, he told his No. 2 aide: \"You know, John, when I went to bed last night I hoped, I almost prayed I wouldn't wake up this morning.\" \"I think there were tears in our eyes, both of them,\" Nixon ~tS> 1S>1S> Wedding .

Nixon then said he returned to Washington and prepared to go on television to make major new announcements about Watergate and announce the resignations . His speech writer, Ray Price, wrote his statement. \" 'Ray,' I said, 'if you think J oughta resign,' I said, 'put that in too, because I feel responsi\u00ad ble,' even though I did not feel I had, ah, engaged in these ac\u00ad tivities consciously ,\" Nixon said. In the end he decided not to quit. Nixon said he cried again when he met with a group of supporters in the Oval Office just before going on television to announce his resignation . \"For 25 minutes we all sat around men that I had come to Congress with; Democrats and Republicans, about half and half; wonderful men,\" he said. \"Then suddenly you haven't got much more to say, and half the people around the table were crying. UThat ended it for me,\" he said. U I sort of cracked up, started to cry; pushed my chair back and then I blurted it out and I said, 'I'm sorry. I just hope I haven't let you down.' .. At the ehd of the interview, Nixon seems deflated, and rambles through his apology. U] let down my friends. I let down the country.

Last November, 15 members of the police and sheriff's departments raided the Stephen and Jane Fox home in the hopes of finding a cache of drugs. The police officers involved reported to the press that they had uncovered quantities of marijuana, LSD and heroin. A warrant went out for the arrest of Jane Fox, who was not present at the time of the raid. Jane Fox was, at that time, preparing a defense for a trial in which she was involved, and was staying that evening at the home of a friend in Tipton. In fact, she and Stephen Fox were no longer living together, and she had not lived at the home for some time. The case was finally resolved last Friday, resulting in no conviction for possession of LSD or heroin, which apparently were not even present in the home. Two $1,000 fines were handed down for possession of marijuana, hardly a rare substance in Iowa City. The charges against Jane Fox were dismissed by the Johnson County prosecutor , who concluded she was not and could not have been guilty of the charges. But for Jane Fox there is little satisfaction in this ruling, for apparently she was judged guilty before guilt was proven. Her law practice has collapsed, and she has been forced to take a variety of jobs, none of which were of the'stature befitting a highly educated professional. She has had to go on unemployment. Fox has said that her fonner law colleagues were non-supportive to the extent of averting their eyes when they chanced to meet her; others felt, according to hearsay, that she had no business even filing papers at the courthouse. Inflation not God's will The police officers involved trashed the Fox home thoroughly in the course of their search, damaging walls and furniture. Mter the charges were filed, tfle Social Services department attempted to permanently remove the Foxes' three children from their care. And a loss of personal and professional respect has been accorded both Foxes. Local newspapers and television stations certainly should share the blame, for in their ghoulish hurry to exploit the situation and turn it into \"news,\" their enthusiasm for the unsavory nature of the case was all too evident. The Daily Iowan, then under the editorship of Dianne Coughlin, was certainly among the parties guilty of this. The media should review the practice of covering cases with the kind of sen\u00ad sationalism that was displayed in this sad case. There has not been so much as an apology forthcoming from anyone, especially the police, although it would hardly ameliorate the harm already caused. If, as Jane Fox claims, they were singled out for this treatment because of their weli-known efforts on behalf of prison reform and her han\u00ad dling of unpopular legal cases, there is a great deal more injustice in the situation. Although the current police chief was not with the depart\u00ad ment when this occurred, an apology from the department, or since it is under the jurisdiction of the City Council, a resolution from this body -would be appropriate . To let this obviously unjust situation go without public apology is a travesty of justice and an indication of the in\u00ad competency with which this case was handled. Despite the efforts of police and local media, Jane Fox is innocent, and that is a fact that should be publicly acknowledged ., MARLEE NORTON The simple facts elude Carter By NrCHOLAS VON HOFFMAN WASHINGTON (KFS) -Our spearless leader has brought forth an anti-inflation program which is as feckless as it is in\u00ad tellectually trashy. Neither Carter nor Charles Schultze, the professor trying to nold down the job of chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has yet been able to articulate a sensible, even if erroneous, explanation of inflation. Has any highly placed person in the Carter Administration gotten beyond nicholas von hoffman thinking that inflation is an unpredictable act of God against which there is no 'defense? Probably not. People who have any useful understanding of the problem do not a ttribute the rise in the level of prices to such inconsequential phenomena as bottlenecks in production or shortages in productive capacity, as the principals in the administration do. More irritating is the President's in\u00ad sistence that unbalanced federal budgets cause inflations. There is no historical evidence to support this long-lived, hard\u00ad dying fallacy. Herbert Hoover ran three straight astronomically (for those days) high deficits, and what did prices do in 1930, '31 and '32? They continued to go down in the teeth of the deficit. The results were the same when Franklin Roosevelt came into office and continued deficit spending. The level of prices refused to rise. Unlike now, at that time people were ga thering in their churches praying for inflation -or reflation as they called it then. The more thoughtful and un\u00ad derstanding statemen of the era, men who advocated an inflationary policy, also knew that simply enlarging the deficits wouldn't accomplish the goal. They knew there is only one way to cause an infJation and that is to print more money. The failure to grasp this central, simple fact about monetary economics prolonged the Great Depression; the failure to grasp it now may prolong the Great Inflation. Luckily for us the Federal Reserve Board, which holds the power to print money, has been easing up on itS press runs the last couple of years so the rate of inflationary increase has been dropping. However, if the President doesn't have the mechanics of this convincingly explained to him, the next economic problem that comes along will see him pressuring the Federal Reserve Board to hype greenback production. Evidently, President Carter has surrounded himself with old-fashioned, liberal economists, who are as bankrupt In mlnd as we y{ill be In purse If he follows their advice. They're pushing measures like the deregulation of such industries as lirlines, a good idea for creating free market competition perhaps, but not one that will have any effect on inflation. No more than anti-trust activities will. Urgent reasons exist to have a successful anti\u00ad trust program, beginning with oil and energy, but inflation isn't one of them, although the administration thinks it is. A monopoly has the power to push up the prices it charges out of sight, not, however, power to push up aU prices, to push up the price level. That can only be done by the. government through increasing the amount of money it puts in circulation. Not all our elected officials are as economically uninformed as the President. Some of them know that in\u00ad flation is the gimmick whereby you can promise competing groups whatever it is that they are demanding without raising the taxes. For years Milton Friedman has been saying that inflation is the way that gutless legislators avoid having to choose between voting new taxes or telling some groups there's no money for them. Under our income tax system, your taxes go up when your nominal income goes up, although your real purchasing power remains the same. Occasionally a senator will admit that's the game which is being played. Russell Long, D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance Conunittee, did so not long ago when he said: \"It is difficult -goodness knows, we have learned in writing this tax bill how difficult it is -to get senators to vote for tax increases. I have proposed all sorts of tax increases and voted for tax increases that we cannot persuade a majority of senators to vote for. Even when we call it reform we cannot get them to vote for it... Many times when we ask people to vote for a tax increase, they will not vote for it for very understandable reasons. Inflation is one thing that does tend, somewhat automatically, to help bring the budgets into balance.\" (As quoted in an excellent article by Michael Nelson and Donald Sweeney -\"The Secret Way Liberals Raise Taxes,\" The Washington Monthly, April 1977.) If Russell Long can see how we can have a balanced budget and a raging inflation at the same time, it's not too complicated an idea for an ex-atomic engineer to wrap his brains around.

Cosmos death its responsibility To the Editor: Daily Iowan staff writer Theresa Churchill wrote a touching elegy to the now-defunct Cosmos in Tuesday's D 1 (May 3). Cosmos, for those who may have forgotten it, was an Essene Aquarian Church and non-profit health food restaurant that prohibited smoking. It opened Oct. 1,1976, and closed four months later. The four Iowa Citians who initially organized Cosmos included John Wiliams and Lynn Willard. Seven months ago (Sept.H, 1976), in a Dl feature story about Cosmos, Willard had been optimistic about the establishment 's chances for success. \"The audience is here,\" he told the Dr reporter. In Chur\u00ad chill's article on the editorial page Tuesday, Williams revealed a different view of the populace. Cosmos had been \"too esoteric\" for Iowa City, Willard had opined. Wi!liams believes that a lack of publicity killea Cosmos, according to Churchill. But actually, Cosmos had placed a number of display advertisements in the DI; eight ads appeared in October alone,. by my quick count. Cosmos also conducted fund drives (which failed, according to Chur\u00ad chill). and additionally, the aforemen\u00ad tioned DI feature story about Cosmos that was printed last September contained 26 inches of pre-opening hype ... written, oddly enough, by Theresa Churchill. Churchill posited the theory that Cosmos failed \"partially because people didn't know it was there.\" Perhaps people did know it was there, but didn't care. You can open an establishment and invite people in, but you really shouldn't castigate folks for lacking the good taste and insight to patronize the place once it has opened. It's too bad that Cosmos served up sour grapes along with the fruit juice. Tim Sacco, A4 Arab hostility prevents peace To the Editor: I am replying to Maher El-Yousef's article from April 28, titled \"Israel: harmless Jamb turned wolf.\" I see this article as a distortion of the situation in the Middle East before the Six-Day War in 1967. In 1966, the Arabs were making preparations for another round of war. Terrorist gangs were working against Israel from both 'the Gaza Strip and Jor\u00ad dan. They included a new organization, founded in 1965, known as the El Fatah, which under Yaslr Arafat's leadership, became the most powerful and well\u00ad publicized element in the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israeli set\u00ad tlements below the Golan Heights were attacked almost every day by the Syrians. On May 16, 1967, Gamel Nasser demanded that the UN Emergency Force, stationed at both Shann el-Sheikh and in the Gaza Strip since 1957, get out im\u00ad mediately . \u00b7UN Secretary-General U Thant, gave In at once, thus leaving the EgypUans In full control of their border with Israel. According to Golda Melr's autobiography, by June 1,1967 there were 100,000 Egyptian soldiers and more than 900 Egyptian tanks In the Sinai, six Syrian brigades and close to 300 Syrian tanks mobilizing on the border. Nasser had every reason to believe that he was to destroy Israel -great military I mE DAILY IO\"AS Thursday, May 5, 19n, VOl. 109, No. 198 \u00a91971 Studeot Publicaaont, Inc. letters strength, weapons pouring in from Russia, and indifference from the West. And with these facts, I hope one can understand that Israel was forced into a war, made to fight a war for her very existence. Israel has always felt the urgency for peace and living together harmoniously with her Arab neighbors. Sally Goldstein 414 S. Dubuque st.

I'm sure that it would be a worthwhile course for someone interested in it. However, it doesn't interest me in the slightest. Of course, I have a stand on the South African issue (coincidentally Similar to yours), but I choose not to use a rubber mallet as a screwdriver. I feel that you are wrong in goading the Ul into international political affairs. I am proud to see an in\u00ad stitution left which is not used as a political tool. I applaud Dr. Edward Jennings' stan<l, that the Ul is a non-political in\u00ad stitution. If you want political institutions , look for one in Moscow or Johannesburg. If our university was pOlitically motivated we would be destroying our people's right to rule as they please, and instead we would all be proselytized into the idea that our present ideology is the only way. Gratefully , the Ul has the unique purpose of providing a liberal education in our desired fields of interest.

What the university said about \"mere\" divestlturltis accurate. For if they sell, someone must simultaneously buy. . Regarding your point about \"knowledge exists only insofar as It is used by people - and no person is non-politlcal,\" with all of that bias, do you think It Is the UI's job to peace because \"Israel can't function in an atmosphere where there is no war.\" The allegations by El-Yousef are a distortion of history -taken out of contelt -in an attempt to mislead readers. At the time of Israel's declaration of independence , it was a confederation ci Arab states that made war not only against Israel but also against the United Natio~ partition plan that recognized the Jewilh as well as the Palestinian state. In the 1918' war tha t followed Transjordan took the opportunity to absorb the West Bank of the Jordan River, which had been reserved foc the Palestinian state and also annexed Old Jerusalem . Egypt, in the same war, captured Gaza Strip, which had also been reserved for the Palestinian state. Thus, while Israel has lived under a state of war by its neighbors during its statehood so far, it is because war was forced upon the state from its inception. The continued hostility has strengthened Israel's resolve never to stop seeking peace nor to stop defending Itself against Its Arab neigh\u00ad bors. El-Yousef writes \"the Arabs are pushing for peace and they mean it.\" Perhaps I/IefI Mr. El-Yousef can explain why, fit example, President Nasser of Egypt sail, \"We want a decisive battle to annihilate that germ, IsraeL\" Many other exampleS could be cited. If the Arab governments can be per' suaded to cease hostilities and speak to their populations of the virtues of peacej ~ Palestinian terrorists can be brought to abandon their ruthless destruction of IIfi and property, then a peace nurtured bY compassion and reason can be achieved.

C4IIIMM from Pile 0 , Isn't the albatross around a hitcltiker's neck it was several years ago. A, sign bearing your destination usually makes it easier to get a ride. If you have a sign, the drivers surmise you are a serious traveler intent upon getting somewhere rather than just a shiftless hobo. Even U you do feel akin to a hobo,. make a sign anyway, because many times drivers who wouldn't ordinarily stop wOl stop if they are headed the same place you are. If your path leads to a college town, it helps to write the school's name on the sign, to further your coUegiate buage. After you've done everything pllSible to look more attractive as a potential passenger, be sure to stand in a spot where cars can easily pull off the road. Keep yourself visible fat' in advance, so the driver can anticipate a stop and have time to size you up. See to it that there is plenty of room for them to pull over, and try to avoid standi~g right next to a place where traffic merges. Frequently a person deliberates a bit before stopping, so look behind every so often in case SOOIeOne has stopped for\"YOll down the highway. You'll find it much easier to flag down a car when you are alone and have a minimum of luggage. However, the com\u00ad panionship of a partner may more than compensa te for the longer waits beside the high\u00ad way, A male hitchhiker often discovers that rides come easier when he is accompanied by a woman, because couples are generally considered \"safe,\" and women attract , rides more quickly. There'is a greater risk for female thumbers, especially when they are alone, and women should consider this before embarking on a journey. It might be a good idea for women hitchhikers to wear masculine clothing, and they definitely shouldn't dress \"sexy\" to entice nnale drivers. Women also> should be wary after nightfall. For both sexes, it's advisable to graciously but firmly decline rides with suspiciouS looking people. This can be done easily by telling them you want a ride further on than where they are going. Despite romantic myths and intuitive deductions, vans and Volkswagen buses are no more likely to stop' for you than any other vehicle. Don't rule out any car or truck: Drivers of some luxury cars are traveling salesmen who have been on the road all day and are eager for someone to ta1k to. If generalizations must be made, young people and solo drivers stop the most frequently, while elderly couples, women, . families and wealthy people pick up hitchhikers less often. Weekends and the sununer are the best times to embark upon an expedition by thumb: There is more traffic and more of the kind of traffic that picks up hitchhikers. During the week and the school year, the proportion of retired people and others not inclined to pick up thumbers increases. Mornings are the best times to get rides, especially long ones, and your chances will dec~ease con\u00ad siderably after dark. After deciding in which direction to head and what places to visit, you must determine what road to take. The United States offers two choices: The interstate high\u00ad ways and the backroads . The backroads afford nicer scenery and give a more realistic im\u00ad pression of a geographic locale than the interstates, which offer an endless string of franchise food outlets and a monotonous panorama. But the interstate is usually faster and features long distance rides as compared to the local traffic and short rides of the two-lane highways . Interstates also feature scrutinization by the state police and restrictive hit\u00ad chhiking laws. Although hitchhiking is perfectly legal in all but a handful of states (Arkansas, Connectfcut, Delaware, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota and Wyoming), many states do prohibit pedestrians from venturing onto the shoulder of interstate highways. The Iowa Highway Patrol -in the spirit of enlightenment - allows hltchhikers to solicit rides' from the side of the in\u00ad terstate, but many of Iowa's neighbors confine thumbers to entrance ramps. This, of course, does not mean that people avoid hitchhiking on the interstates in other states. It is probably as widespread in restrictive states as in lenient states like Iowa, and the majority of hitchhikers have never been busted or fined. The state police may just ignore you or perhaps make you move up the ramp or give you a warning ticket. However, in a few cases, $1 0 to $25 fines have been levied for hitchhiking on the shoulder of an interstate. In urban areas and busy in\u00ad terchanges, rides are found easily on the ramps, but at isolated rural exits it may take a while to get a ride if you stick to the ramp. Positioning yourself on the ramp, but very near the interstate, may be a little safer, although it is still technically illegal.. Truck stops, roadside restaurants and rest areas' are good places to find rides along an interstate, if you don't want to risk standing on the highway shoulder. Off the interstates, there are generally no hassles with the police, even in some of the Dannon Yogurt.

UI Center for Labor and Management, Relations With industry have not been so smooth throughout the college's history, Barnes points out. Business courses were in\u00b7 troduced to the UI Department of Social Sciences' CUrriculum in the 1890s, and a department of Business Administration was created soon after the turn of the century. The department became the School of Com\u00b7 merce in 1914 and a 'college in 1921. The name was changed to Business Administration in 1959. The college has four academic departments - Accounting, Business Administra tion, Economics, and Business Education, which exists in conjunction with the College of Education. Degrees granted include: the Bachelor of Business Administration; the Master of Business Administration; the Master of Arts in Accounting; Business Administration and Economics; and Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration and Economics. Last fall, 352 students were seeking advanced degrees in the college. Students can also seek interdisciplinary degrees with the colleges of law, liberal arts or education. During their first 70 years, very little was done in colleges of business in the way of theory development, according to Barnes. \"For the first 70 years, schools of business were primarily an attempt to reflect in a curriculum what was being done in business at that time.\" During World War II, people in government and business found they \"weren't equipped to handle the mass of data that had to be handled in decision making.\" Consequently, during the 1950s colleges began to develop a body of theory aod began to emphasize the use of quantitativ e methods in decision making. \"There's no question but we were influenced a great deal,by our attempt to gain academic respectability,\" Barnes explains. \"Scholarly research became an .integral part of facuity requirements.\" By the 19605, \"we let the pendulum swing too far. We became too theoretical to the extent we started losing contact with our Clientele, namely, business and financial in\u00ad stitutions. \" The Of's Serialized Novel When he became dean in 1963, Barnes said, among his priorities was to increase relations with industry. a broad liberal arts foundation, an economics foundation, a quantitative foundation and a behavioral foundation.\" Not all schools of business \"We spoke to 50 marketing place as much emphasis on the managers in tenns of what we liberal arts foundation. \"We are could dQ in the college.

Carter spoke to members of the House's new committee on energy, in a rare, informal sessilln at the White House. Committee members had invited him to push for his proposal on Capitol Hill, but Carter asked them to the White House instead. It is unusual for a president to address a congressional committee either in Congress or at the White House. Carter said he has found \"almost unanimous approbation\" among European nations for his energy proposals, but acknowledged parts of the plan are unpopular at home. '\" am perfectly willing for you to put on my shoulders as much of the blame as you wish,\" he said. Carter said his plan is \"the most important message matter Congress will receive in many years, perhaps in our lifetime.\" One of the most controversial points in the energy package is Carter's proposal to hike gasoline taxes a nickel a year if consumption keeps going up. While many members of Congress are predicting defeat for the tax plan, Rep. Richard Bolling, D-Mo., a member of the energy committee, told a reporter Wednesday he thinks Congress will approve it. \"I think we can get the gas tax increase through,\" he said. When the energy committee returned to session on Capitol HUI, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance testified on the \"pro\u00ad found\" international aspects of the energy crisis. Brown warns of energy 'disaster' WASHINGTON (UP]) -Defense Secretary Harold Brown, testifying for President Carter's energy program Wed\u00ad nesday, raised the specter of a war-locked America cut off from essential oil supplies by the Soviet Union. Brown told the ad hoc House Committee on Energy that unless measures are taken to deal with the energy crisis, \"ultimately, the only alternative is disaster.\" He said there could be serious intelTuption of U.S. oil supplies by hostile forces during a war, and outlined an . imaginary scenario involving the Kremlin. H]n the event of some future confrontation, the Soviet Union might be able to restrict access of the western world to its essential oil supplies to a degree of severity and duration greater than any embargo by the oil producers,\" he said. \"The U .S.S.R. might attempt to deny access to the oil of the Persian Gulf by direct attack on the facilities of the major oil loading ports which lie near to Soviet territory,\" he said. If Moscow also interfered with \"high seas tanker move\u00ad ment of oil from qther exporting nations,\" Brown said, the move could \"vastly exacerbate the oil s.upply situation for the U.S. and its allies.\" Brown said the military, political and economic risks of oil interruption \"are very real\" and the United States must try toprotectitself. One priority, he said, should be development of 8 strategic petroleum reserve. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance also testified before the committee, issuing the same warning on the international implications of the energy crisis -but in less graphic terms. \"The facts of the energy crisis are stark and the im\u00ad plications profound,\" Vance said.

Cartfr embarks on get-acquainted tour WASHINGTON (UPI) - President Carter embarks today on his first overseas mission as chief executive, bound for a summit conference of industrial powers on economic problems, energy policy, trade and relations with underdeveloped nations. But Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who accompanies Carter on the May ~10 visit to London and Geneva, said the London swrunit will also give the President a chance to establish better personal relations with leaders of Britain, France, West Ger\u00ad many, Italy, canada and Japan. \"One of the main benefits we hope comes out of the summit will be the opportunity for the heads of state to establish a close personal working relationship between each other, \" Vance told reporters at a news conference on the May 7- 8 London summit. Press Secretary Jody Powell said Carter is not \"anticipating major announcements or agreements\" to result from his summit meetings. The London summit holds the prospect of some conflict among the participants. Thorniest issue is likely to be the U.S.-West German dispute over export of nuclear technology, with Carter at\u00ad tempting to restrict the worldwide flow of potential weapons-grade nuclear materials and West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt committed to an ambitious program of nuclear research and export. Jury convicts man of crippling stepson HOUSTON (UP]) -A state court jury Wednesday, con\u00ad vinced \"it wasn't a spanking, it was a beating,\" convicted a construction worker of crip\u00ad pling his stepson and burning the words \"I cry\" into his back with a cigarette. The eight-woman, four-man jury deliberated Ph hours before returning the verdict against Lozier Pickering, 25. Pickering showed no emotion. \"Only when he lost conscious\u00ad ness did they take the boy to the hospital,\" prosecutor Hogan Stripling said. \"A surgeon didn't even know what he was looking at because it was a mass of rotten flesh, days old.\" Pickering's defense attorneys presented no witnesses and rested their case immediately after the state. Pickering ad\u00ad mitted to police only the spanking. Attorney J.B. Davis argued the prosecution had failed to prove the stepfather guilty. \"I could see by the tears in your eyes that you were deeply moved by the condition of this f Father slays children BRIARCUFF MANOR; N.Y. (UP]) -An unemployed construction worker stabbed his four children to death in their home this week and then killed himself with a shotgun, authori\u00ad ties reported Wednesday. The five bodies were discov\u00ad ered in various rooms of the three-bedroom, red clapboard house Wednesday morning by the man's brother and a friend. A spokesman for the West\u00ad chester county district attorney said the father, James Girardi, 38, and his children -Cindy, 16, Thomas, 15, Bonnie, 13, and Albert, 10 -had been dead for several days. child,\" Davis said, \"It was a hOlTible thing. I don't think anybody feels worse about it than Mr. PiceTing. But there's no proof Pickering caused it.\" The closing arguments ended a dramatic Ph day trial that included wheeling of the crip\u00ad pled victim into the courtroom in a crib. Pickering, many of the jurors, and . spectators were moved to tears by the ap\u00ad pearance of the blond-haired boy lying unresponsive in the fetal position. A witness earlier testified the boy was bright, though a loner, before his in\u00ad juries. Dr. Wallace Fagan, who operated on the child when he was hospitalized by !lis parents Oct. ]3, eight days after the spanking, testified Daniel suf\u00ad fered a ruptured colon due to insertion of some object in his anus. An ensuing gangrenous infec\u00ad tion led to permanent brain damage. Fagan said the infection was so advanced by the time he opened the child's abdomen that he was unable to recognize internal organs. He also found unusual marks on the child's back.

Sherlock Holmes meets Freud frotft ,I.e\" 1177 Islanders not giving up UNIONDALE, N.Y. (UPI) - There will be a hockey game at the Nassau Coliseum Thursday night-much 'to the surprise of the Montreal Canadiens and most of the National Hockey League \"experts.\" The New York Islanders defea ted the Canadlens 4-3 Tuesday night at the Montreal Forum, to cut the Canadiens' lead to 3-2 in the best-of-seven semifinal round. That was not supposed to happen. Montreal was supposed to wrap up the series at home and enter the finals against the Boston Bruins on Thursday. After all, the Canadiens had not been beaten at home In 38- straight games and the Islan\u00ad ders had not won in the Forum since Oct. 14, 1975. And with the Islanders losing convincingly to the Canadiens Saturday night at the Coliseum, there was no reason to believe that New York stood much of a' chance of withstanding elimination on Montreal ice. But the Islanders believed. With Glenn \"Chico\" Resch making his first start of the playoffs, the Islanders fought off 2-1 and 3-2 deficits to send the game into overtime. Then, at 3: 58 of the overtime period, Billy Harris knocked in a rebound of a Dave Lewis shot\u00ad sending the series back to New, York for the sixth game. \"This team has a bunch of hard workers,\" said Islander Coach AI Arbour. \"They work for everyUJing. Everybody wrote us off before the game. All the media people had the Bruins and Canadiens meeting here in the finals Thursday. But my team isn't ready yet to play golf. We')] wait for the end of the month for that.\" Montreal Coach Scotty Bowman was not at all pleased with the way his club played. \"We have to score goals to win,\" he said. \"We didn't play ou type of game Tuesday night. We were not sharp around the net. I guess it means that we'll have to play our type of game in New York.\" Montreal hasn't been beaten twice in a row since the Buffalo Sabres eliminated them from the 1974-75 Stanley Cup semifi\u00ad nals. But they are up against a team which seems to thrive under pressure, a team which, two seasons ago, carne on to defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins in a quarter.final round after being down 3-0 in the series. And they are led once again by the fiery Resch. Resch had not won a game since he defeated St. Louis on March 26 of the regular season. He became the forgotten man of th\\! playoffs, with Billy Smith perfonning superbly in goal against Chicago and Buffalo. But when Smith surrendered four goals to the Canadiens in the first two periods of the fourth game, Arbour replaced him with Resch in the third. The move was not made to disparage Smith, but to give Resch much-needed work in preparation for Tuesday night's game. Arbour hoped the change in the nets would give his team an inspirational boost. And Resch was inspirational. After a shaky start, he settled down to ward off Montreal's attack. His biggest save of the game came when he stopped Bob Gainey on a breakaway in the third period, with Montreal ahead 3-2. The Islanders went on to tie the game a half minute later. I~All the people except those in this organization said we'd be out of it after Tuesday night,\" said Resch. \"But we have faith in ourselves and we're a determined bunch of guys.\" Six'ers wary of Rockets PHILADELPHIA (UPI) - Judging from their exhausting seven-game series with the Boston Celtics, the Philadelphia 76ers know they can't take anything for granted in the NBA playoffs. . Fresh off their elimination of the defending champion Celtics, the 76ers return to the court Thursday night against the Houston Rockets in the opening game of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals series. As they had done with Boston, the 76ers defeated the Rockets three times in four games during the regular season. But Philadelphia has learned in a hurry about the un\u00ad predictability of the playoffs. \"This is no time for a let\u00ad down,\" Philadelphia Coach Gene Shue said. \"We may have beaten Houston three times during the regular season, but they're a different club now.\" J II I d f D b The Rockets eliminated the JO ey re axe or er y Washington Bullets Sunday with a 108-103 victory in the LOUISVILLE, Ky. (UPI) - Someone not familiar with LeRoy Jolley might have noticed how relaxed the veteran trainer appeared at Churchill Downs Wednesday and thought he must have the Kentucky Derby favorite. But with Jolley, who is more highstrung than most of the thoroughbreds he trains, the opposite was true. He was smiling and affable because this year he does not have the Derby favorite, although Gerald Robins' For The Moment is one of the more highly regarded colts in the race. Two years ago J olley came to Kentucky with favored Foolish Pleasure, whose training pro\u00ad gram had been disrupted by cuts on the bottom of his hooves. It was not an easy week of final preparations for Jolley, but Foolish Pleasure made it worthwhile by winning the Derby. . Last year, however, was sheer hell for Jolley as Honest Pleasure was an odds-on favorite only to get beaten by Bold Forbes. \"1 think it's a lot more fun this year,\" Jolley said. \"It's always best to have the best horse, but it's more nervewracking.\" For The Moment, who won the Blue Grass Stakes in the mud at Keeneland last Thurs\u00ad day, is a full brother to Honest Pleasure, sired by What A Pleasure and out of Tularia. Robins bought 50 per cent interest in For The Moment last year from Tim Sams' Waldemar Farms, which bred the colt. Then Robins sold a quarter of his interest to Peter Fuller, whose Dancer's Image was disqualified after winning the 1968 Kentucky Derby because evidence of butazoli- . dine was found in the horse's blood system. Angel Cordero, who rode Bold Forbes last year, will be going for his third Kentucky Derby victory aboard For The Moment. For The Moment is expected sixth game of their series. to join Seattle Slew on or near If anything, the 76ers consider the early lead in the $125,000- the Rockets a tougher club than added, 1 Y4-mile Kentucky the Celtics because of the Derby emergence of Moses Malone as Ask~ to evaluate Seattle' one of the league's leading Slew, Jolley said, \"He's an rebounders, ~eir strong front outstandingly good horse, far court, and thelf depth . .above nonnal.
