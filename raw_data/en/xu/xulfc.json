Simultaneous versus Sequential Administration of mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines and Quadrivalent Inactivated (IIV4) in Adults , Adolescents and Children: A Randomized Observer Blinded Study Phase: Phase IV Population: 450 persons 5 years of age for whom both COVID -19 and influenza vaccines are indicated and for whom COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. Clinical Sites: Three: Duke University Hosp ital (Contributing ) Study months total 12 months to recruit /enroll , 6 months during each of two influenza seasons 5 months to perform analysis and laboratory assays after the end of follow -up period Participa nt Duration and Number of Participants : 120 days for 450 total participant s at 3 sites Description of Study Procedures: This study is a prospec tive, randomized clinical trial. During this study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV4) and mRNA COVID -19 vaccine either simultaneously or sequentially, 14 days apart. For participants receiving their primary dose series, a second dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be administered either 3 to 8 weeks or 4 to 8 weeks following the first dose, depending upon the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine provided. Participants receiving a booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will receive a single COVID -19 dose within the study per current CDC guidelines. Solicited symptoms of reactogenicity will be assessed on vaccination day and daily during the 7 days following each Vaccination Visit using either electronic or paper symptoms diaries, depending on study participant p reference. Quality of life data will be collected using elect ronic or paper diaries on day of Vaccination Visit 1 and daily during the 7 days following the visit. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be collected throughout the duration of the study. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 6 Serum samples from participants will be collected for determination of COVID -19 serostatus at baseline. Serum samples will be taken throughout the study to determine IIV4 immunogenicity and for potential future studies .

Estimated Time to Complete Enrollment: Approximately 6 months for enrollment for the 2021 -2022 influenza season and 6 months for enrollment during the 2022- 2023 influenza season Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 10 1 BACK GROUND 1.1 Background COVID -19 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is caused by a coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS- CoV-2). COVID -19 was first noted in late 2019 among clusters of pneumonia cases occurring in Wuhan China. The virus spread globally, in a rapid manner, with the first case among a US resident reported in January 20201. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID- 19 a pandemic2. During the course of 2020 and 2021, the pandemic occurred in multiple distinct waves in the US, with the most recent wave starting in late 2021 and persisting into early 2022. As of April 3rd, 2022 , over 79 million COVID- 19 cases and over 950,000 deaths have been reported in the United States3, making this the worst pandemic to occur in this country since the 1918 Spanish flu. With the emergence of numerous viral variants including the B1.1.529 Omicron variant and B.1.617.2 Delta variant in addition to other variants being monitored , the current trajectory of the pandemic remains uncertain 4. Typical symptoms of COVID -19 include fever, chills, c ough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fatigue, myalgia, body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Complications of COVID -19 are varied and include pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver, kidney and/or cardiac injury, secondary infections, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, blood clots, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults , rhabdomyol ysis and neurologic symptoms. Among known risk factors for severe illness are advanced age, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, obesity, serious hear t conditions (heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies) , immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, sickle cell disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking and pregnancy 5. Influenza Epidemic influenza is a highly infectious disease that occurs annually throughout the temperate regions in both hemispheres in their respective winter months 6. Influenza infection occurs in all age groups and is a major public health threat, as it has the ability to spread rapidly through populations and affect a large number of people. While infection rates are generally highest among school age children, the highest rates of serious morbidity and mortality occur among individuals over 65 years of age and in children less than 1 year of age 7. Underlying m edical conditions such as chronic cardiac, pulmonary, kidney and metabolic disorders, and various types of immunosuppression increase the likelihood of potential complications 8. Uncomplicated influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of constitutional symptoms including: fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis. Influenza virus infection can also lead to more serious illness such as primary viral pneumonia and exacerbation of underlying medical conditions. Common complications include bacterial pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media. The estimated annual number of influenza- associated hospitalizations in the United States is 226,000 and the estimated annual number of deaths is Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 11 34,470 9,10. Hospitalizations due to influenza are typically more prevalent in seasons during which A( H3N2 ) subtype predominates. COVID -19 and Influenza In the spring of 2020 COVID -19 emerged late in the course of the 2019 -2020 seasonal influenza epidemic, with co- infection being reported in some individuals11. Of potential concern, was the possibility of a simultaneous surge in both COVID -19 cases and influenza cases during the 2020- 2021 season. However, i nfluenza activity in the United States during the 2020- 2021 season remained relatively low and to date has remained relatively low during the 2021- 22 season. I f both COVID -19 and influenza infections peaked simultaneously during subsequent seasons, there could be a significant future impact on utilization of health care resources potentially overburdening the health care system. COVID -19 Vaccines The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine (BNT162b2) (marketed as Com irnaty) received FDA- licens ure for individuals 16 years and older on August 23rd, 2021 for primary dose series . The Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (marketed as Spikevax) received FDA approval on January 31st, 2022 for individuals 18 years and older for primary dose series . Numerous other COVID -19 vaccines are currently in different phases of preclinical and clinical development . Six vaccines have recently completed or are currently undergoing late stage Phase 3 clinical testing in the United States including the two mRNA vaccines, two viral vectored vaccines , and two adjuvanted recombinant protein- based vaccines 12. Prior to approval, the Moderna mRNA vaccine (mRNA -1273) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for persons 18 years of age and older13, and t he Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccine received an initial EUA in December 2020 for persons 16 years of age and older and expanded its EUA to include individuals 12 - 15 years of age on May 10, 2021 and individuals 5 - 11 years of age on October 29, 202114. Both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are based on the SARS -CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) antigen encoded by RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Among study participants without evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer/BioNT ech vaccine (BNT162b2) was 95.0% (95% CI 90.3%, 97.6%) effective at preventing confirmed COVID- 19 occur ring at least 7 days after the second dose of vaccine 15. The Moderna vaccine (mRNA -1273) demonstrated a vaccine efficacy of 94.1% (95% CI 89.3%, 96.8%) for the prevention of symptomatic SARS -COV -2 infection with onset at least 14 days after the second injection , with 11 COVID -19 cases in the vaccine group and 185 COVID- 19 cases in the placebo group 16. The Janssen adenovirus 26 vectored COVID -19 vaccine (Ad26 COV2.S) received EUA from the FDA on February 27, 2021 but due to being a viral vector vaccine it will not be further addressed by this study evaluating the simultaneous administration of influenza and mRNA COVID -19 vaccines . BNT162b2 is currently authorized under the FDA EUA for persons 5 - 15 years of age and approved for persons 16 years of age and older , while the mRNA -1273 is approved for persons 18 years of age and older. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended use of these vaccines, according to the specifications in the EUAs ; CDC has also published interim clinical considerations for use of COVID -19 vaccines17,18. Both vaccines are administered intramuscularly with the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine (30 \u00b5g, 0.3mL each for persons Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 12 12 years of age and 10 \u00b5g, 0.2mL each for persons 5- 11 years of age) being administered 21 days apart and the Moderna vaccine (100 \u00b5g, 0.5mL each) being administered 28 days apart as a primary series in particular , for populations that include moderately or severely immunocompromised, adults over 65 years of age and those who need rapid protection against COVID -19. Doses should not be administered earlier than recommended but if given within a 4- day period prior to the scheduled time may be considered valid. The second dose can be administered between 3 and 8 weeks after the first dose for the Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine and between 4 and 8 weeks after the first dose for the Moderna vaccine. The vaccines are not considered to be interchangeable, however under extenuating circumstances such as when the brand of the first dose of vaccine is unknown, any mRNA COVID -19 vaccine may be administered 28 days following the first dose17. On August 12, 2021, the FDA amended the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID -19 vaccine EUAs to include the use of a third dose of vaccine in specific immunocompromised populations for persons 12 years of age and older and persons 18 years of age or older for the respective vaccines.19 Additionally , the CDC also recommend ed that moderate or severely immune compromised populations receive an additional third dose of the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines to enhance the immune response20. Subsequent to these actions , the U.S. government has expanded authorizations and recommendations for a third dose of COVID -19 vaccine as infections r ose from the coronavirus Delta variant and then the Omicron variant , citing data indicating diminishing protection from the vaccines over time . The FDA initially authorized a booster dose for both Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines for all persons 18 years of age and older on November 19, 2021. Subsequent to this action, the EUA was extended for the Pfizer -BioNTech mRNA COVID -19 vaccine to include 16- 17 year olds on December 9, 2021 and 12 -15 year olds on January 3, 2022 . The CDC has made comparable recommendations to follow the EUAs21-24. Both the EUA and recommendations for the interval between the primary series and booster dose have also been shorted to 5 months. On March 29, 2022 FDA authorized a second booster dose for persons aged 50 and older and certain immunocompromised indi viduals ; CDC updated guidance for second booster doses , with a 4 -month interval between a first and second booster dose13,17. Local and systemic side effects occurring within the week after vaccination as reported from the BNT162b2 Phase2/3 reactogenicity subset are noted in Table 1. In general, both local and systemic side effects were reported more frequently in those who were younger and following the second dose of vaccine. Table 1. BNT162b2 Reactogenicity (Phase 2/3 ) 25 Dose 1 Dose 2 16-55 years >55 years years 21.9% 18.9% Overall, the frequency of any severe systemic event after Dose 1 was 0.9% or less . After Dose 2, severe systemic events had frequencies of <2% with the exception after Dose 2 of fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2.0%). Severe fever (>38.9\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C) was reported in the BNT162b2 group after Dose 1 for 0.2% and after Dose 2 for 0.8% 15. A higher frequency of unsolicited, non- serious adverse events was reported in the vaccine group compared to placebo group and was primarily attributed to local reactions and systemic adverse events in subjects not in the reactogenicity subset and are consistent with solicited reactions/events reported by reactogenicity subset participants during the first 7 days following vaccination. In the all -enrolled population of (total N=43,448), the proportions of participants who reported at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) during the time period from Dose 1 to the data cutoff date (November 14, 2020) were 0.6% in the BNT162b2 vaccine group and 0.5% in the placebo group. Three SAEs reported in the BNT162 group were considered by the investigator as related to vaccine or vaccine administration: shoulder injury, ventricular arrhythmia, and lymphadenopathy. Local and systemic side effects as reported from the mRNA -1273 Phase 3 reactogenicity subset are noted in Table 2. Similar to the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine, i n general, both local and systemic side effects were reported more frequently in those who were younger and following the second dose of vaccine. Table 2 . mRNA -1273 Reactogenicity (Phase 3) 16 Dose 1 Dose 2 18-<64 years 65 years 18-<64 years 65 years 2022 14 Table 2 . mRNA -1273 Reactogenicity (Phase 3) 16 Dose 1 Dose 2 18-<64 years 65 years 18-<64 years 65 years 48.6% 30.9% Overall, the frequency of any Grade 3 systemic event after Dose 1 ranged from 2.0 to 2.9% depending upon age. After Dose 2, Grade 3 systemic events were reported by 15.7% in the younger group and 2.0% in the older group26 . The proportion of participants who reported severe unsolicited AEs was 1.4% following any vaccine dose (275 participants) and 1.3% following any placebo dose (225 participants). T he most frequently reported severe AEs that occurred in greater numbers of vaccine than placebo recipients were headache, myalgia, arthralgia, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. The frequency of non- fatal serious adverse events was low and without meaningful imbalances between study arms (1% in the mRNA -1273 group and 1% in the placebo group). A more detailed comparison of selected systemic reactogenicity events and their grading following Dose 1 of mRNA -1273 and BNT162b2 is included below (Table 3) : Table 3.

As with adults, systemic events were reported more often after BNT162b2 dose 2 than after dose 1. The vaccine produced a greater immune response in adolescents than adults and was highly effective27. A study assessing two 10 \u00b5 g doses of BNT162b2 in children 5 to 11 years of age each administered 3 weeks apart, showed the vaccine to be safe, immunogenic and efficacious in this age group as well. Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were generally mild to moderate and lasted 1 to 2 days . In general, systemic events were reported more commonly after the second dose than the first dose. Fever occurred in 8.3% of recipients after the first and second dose. 28 Hypersensitivity Reactions and mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines In the Pfizer mRNA phase III trial, more participants reporting hypersensitivity -related adverse events in the vaccine group (137 [0.63%]) compared with the placebo group (111 [0.51%]). There were no anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions reported (FDA EUA) . In the Moderna mRNA COVID vaccine phase III trial, more participants reported hypersensitivity -related adverse events in the vaccine group 1.5% of vaccine recipients (258 events in 233 participants) compared with the placebo group 1.1% of placebo recipients ( 185 events in 166 participants). There were no anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with close temporal relation to the vaccine. There was one anaphylactic reaction occurring 63 days after the second dose of the vaccine that did not meet the Brighton Collab oration Anaphylaxis Case and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 16 There have been numerous reports of anaphylactic reactions after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine after the start of vaccination campaigns (MMWR January 22, 2021, Vol. 70; MMWR January 15, 2021, Vol. 70). The update on anaphylaxis reports to VAERS following mRNA COVID Vaccines through January 18, 2021 (January ACIP meeting), showed following results: Table 4. Anaphylaxis reports to VAERS following COVID -19 vaccines . Table 4.

Both mRNA vaccines include a warning that a naphylaxis may occur after mRNA vaccines and that appropriate medical treatment for management must be immediately availabl e30,31. Myocarditis and Pericarditis and mRNA COVID- 19 April 2021, increased cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the United States after mRNA COVID -19 vaccination (Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna), particularly in adolescents and young adul ts after the second dose 32. In June 2021, the FDA updated the EUAs for both mRNA COVID -19 vaccines to describe the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines30,31. While absolute risk remains small, evidence suggests the risk might be reduced by extending the interval between the first and second dose. Studies in adolescents (ages 12- 17 years) and adults have shown the small risk of myocarditis associated with mRNA COVID -19 vaccines might be reduced and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness may be increased with an interval up to 8 weeks following the initial dose. There are currently no data available for children ages 11 years and younger. A 3- or 4-week interval continues to be the recommended interval for people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, adults ages 65 years and older, and others who need rapid protection due to increased concern about community transmission or risk of severe disease33. Booster Doses Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 17 The safety of a booster dose (dose 3) of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine was assessed in about 300 adults aged 18 -55 years. The reactogenicity and safety profile observed after the booster dose was generally similar to that observed after Dose 2 of the initial two- dose vaccination series. Lymphadenopathy was more frequent after dose 3 (5.2%), compared with 0.4% in persons aged 16 years after dose 1 or 2. Most cases had axillary lymphadenopathy that resolved within 5 days after onset .13,34 The safety of a booster (dose 3) of the Moderna COVID - 19 vaccine at half the dose (50ug) was assessed in 168 persons over 18 years of age. The reactogenicity and safety profile observed after the booster dose was generally similar to that observed after Dose 2 of the initial two- dose vaccination series35. FDA identified no new safety concerns following second booster dose of Pfizer COVID -19 vac cine administered to older adults13,36. Influenza and Influenza Vaccine Inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIVs) have been available in the United States for over 50 years and influenza vaccination remain s the most effective strategy for reducing the burden of disease caused by influenza. In the United States, vaccination of all persons aged 6 months and older is recommended on an annual basis37. In the 2021- 22 influenza season all influenza vaccine formulations are quadrivalent (IIV4) and contain hemagglutinin (HA) from four prototypic influenza types/subtypes that commonly circulate including: influenza A (H1N1pdm09), influenza A (H3N2), and 2 different influenza B lineages (B Yamagata and B Victoria) 37. For adults 65 years of age and older, who may not develop as robust an immune response as younger individuals, both high dose and adjuvanted formulations of IIV4 have been developed. High dose and adjuvanted formulations have been shown to be more immunogenic when compared to standard dose formulations in older adults8. High-dose influenza vaccine has also been shown to be more effective than standard dose influenza vaccine in a randomized clinical trial. Side effects after an inactivated influenza vaccine may include soreness, redness and swelling at the injection site, f ever, muscle aches, and headache. There also may be a very small increased risk of Guillain - Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) or anaphylaxis after an inactivated influenza vaccine 38. 1.2 Summary and Rationale In clinical practice, the FDA approved the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 vaccines and grant ed an Emergency Use Authorization for Janssen COVID -19 vaccine in February 2021 . Hence, vaccines for both COVID -19 and influenza prevention have the potential for being administered at the same time seasonal influenza vaccine is available. In the pre -licensure efficacy studies , neither the Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines were evaluated for either safety or immunogenicity when co- administered with a non -COVID -19 vaccine. The Phase 3 trial of the AstraZeneca chimpanzee adenovirus -vectored COVID -19 vaccine did not prohibit influenza vaccination but simultaneous administration wa s not systematically evaluated. Initial guidance from the CDC stated that COVID -19 vaccines should be given alone with at least 14 days either before or after receipt of any other vaccines, including an influenza vaccine, because of limited information on the safety and effectiveness of co- administration . Current guidance now states that COVID -19 vaccines can be administered on the same day as other Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 18 vaccines but mentions that it is unknown if simultaneous administration will affect reactogenicity17,37,39. A single study has assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a 3rd dose of Moderna's mRNA COVID -19 vaccine and High -Dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine when administered simultaneously to adults 65 years and older. No safety concerns or immune interference were observed.40 Due to the potential for severe infl uenza complications and resulting morbidity and mortality, it remains particularly important that influenza vaccine is encouraged for all persons 6 months of age and older without any contraindications. Likewise, as the pandemic continues and COVID - 19 vac cines become available it is critically important that their use be encouraged in those populations for whom there is an authorization and an ACIP recommendation. To date, we are unaware of any studies evaluating the safety and immune responses following concomitant administration of both mRNA COVID -19 and influenza vaccines in a more general population. Hence, we aim to study the safety of simultaneous versus sequential administration of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine and IIV4. Participants receiving mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines as either standard of care or a study procedure will be randomized to receive either IIV 4 or placebo within 8 hours of their initial dose of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine. Those receiving IIV4 will receive placebo 14 days later and those receiving placebo will receive IIV4 14 days later. We have elected to evaluate the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines for evaluations for t hree reasons: 1) there is greater accumulated experience with using mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in the population; 2) the different reactogenicity profiles for the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines as compared to the Janssen adeno viral vector COVID -19 vaccine decreases the ability of a singl e small study to address the question of co- administration safety 13 and 3) the preferential recommendation for the use of mRNA COVID -19 vaccines over the Janssen vaccine for both primary and booster vaccination due to concerns related to thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome following Janssen COVID -19 vaccine 41. In addition, we hope to assess the effects of pre-existing COVID -19 antibody before vaccination on the occurrence of vaccine side effects and to assess the effects of COVID -19 vaccine administration on IIV 4 immunogenicity. The current protocol allow s for inclusion of persons receiving a booster dose of mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine. Administration of booster dose mRNA COVID -19 vaccin es to participants who are enrolled in this protocol, will adhere to current FDA prescribing recommendations for licensed or EUA mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines and to ACIP recommendations for their use as the approvals and recommendations are made. Inclusion of persons receiving a booster dose of COVID -19 vaccine will allow for enhanced recruitment during the influenza vaccination season in which it is expected that most adults and many children receiving an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine in this study will be receiving a booster dose rather than an initial vaccine two-dose series . 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOME MEASURE S OBJECTIVE OUTCOME Primary 1.

Participants will be enrolled in the 2021- 2022 and 2022- 2023 influenza seasons. Individuals will be enrolled who have not received their influenza vaccine during the influenza season during which they are recruited and are either receiving a booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine ( for ages booster is authorized and recommended ) or are receiving a primary two -dose mRNA COVID -19 vaccine series ( 5 years of age or older) . Future mRNA COVID vaccines may include SARS- CoV-2 viral variants which may be included in this study if authorized or approved by the FDA and recommended by the CDC. H ealth, demographic and health- related quality of life (HRQOL) data will be collected from study participants 12 years of age or older at baseline. All participants receiving an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine on Day 1 (Visit 1) will be randomized to receive quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4 ) or placebo. Persons aged <65 years will receive standard dose IIV 4 (SD-IIV4) or saline placebo injection. To qualify for the study, c hildren < 9 years of age must only need to receive a single dose of Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 23 IIV4 per ACIP recommendations for the 2022- 2023 season. Persons aged 65 years will receive high- dose IIV4 (HD -IIV4) or saline placebo injection. Participants will receive the vaccines in an observer -blinded manner on the same day as they receive mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. Fourteen days later (Visit 2) those who received IIV 4 at Visit 1 will receive placebo and those who received placebo on at Visit 1 will receive IIV 4 (SD-IIV4 or HD -IIV4, depending upon age). Participants will then receive a second mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (Visit 3) , if applicable, and according to the recommended schedul e for vaccination for the respective mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine product used. With Day 1 serving as the initial day of vaccination, participants will be followed through D ay 7 (total 7 days) for solicited symptoms of reactogenicity as described in Section 5.4. HRQOL data will be collected during this time period for persons aged 12 years . Solicited reactogenicity events will also be monitored through Day 7 (total 7 days) following Visit 2 (all participants) and Visit 3 (only those participants receiving primary 2- dose COVID -19 vaccine series) . Participants will also be followed for 7 days after each vaccination visit for unsolicited adverse events, through Day 120 for serious adverse events (SAEs) and through Day 120 for adverse events of special interest (AESI ), as described in Section 5.4. 3.2 Laboratory Studies Influenza Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay mRNA COVID -19 vaccine na\u00efve participants will have blood draws on Day 1 (before vaccination) and Day 21 (2021- 2022 season) or Day 29 (2022- 2023 season) (Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine) or Day 29 (Moderna ( HAI) antibody titers . Those receiving a booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will have blood draws on Day 1 (before vaccination) and Day 29. HAI antibody titers will be compared between groups receiving COVID -19 and IIV4 simultaneously or sequentially for each of the four influenza vaccine strains contained in the respective vaccines for that season . Participants will not receive individual HAI antibody titer results ; these are not routinely used in clinical practice. 3.2.2 SARS -CoV-2 Antibody Assay Participants will have blood draws on day 1 (before vaccination) as noted in 3.2.1 Serum will be assayed for the presence of SARS antibody using the AdviseDx SARS- CoV-2 assay . The assay s are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS- CoV-2 indicating recent or prior infection. Serologic testing will be completed in periodic batches throughout the course of the study and will therefore not be available in real -time or for use in clinical decision- making. The current test s described above are allowed under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization during the COVID -19 pandemic. Duke will share participant results with each study site as permitted by FDA and CDC. Study sites may share results with participant as permitted by FDA, CDC, and local site regulations. In addition, pending funding, we are proposing to conduct quantitative SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers in a pseudovirus assay to assess antibody levels. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 24 3.2.3 Future studies In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there may be other tests or assays that have yet to be identified that may be important for interpreting our study findings or of relevance to vaccine outcomes . Additional laboratory assays may test for antibodies against other bacteria or viruses, markers of inflammation, or used in research on the health of the participants . Specimens banked for use in other studies will be linked to information (including identifying information) that participants provided to the study. Subjects /subject's legal ly authorized representative (LAR) must agree to potential future use of samples in order to be in the study. Because it is unknown if future testing will be of any utility, results of future testing will not be provided. 4 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL 4.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in this interventional study . 1.

Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 26 4.3 Temporary Delay Criteria (Visit 1, 2 and 3 (for primary COVID -19 vaccine series) ) 1. History of febrile illness (> 100.0\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) within the past 72 hours prior to vaccine administration 4.4 Recruitment Potential participants 5 years o f age will be recruited from several sourc es at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) , Johns Hopkins University (JHU ), and Cincinnati using varying techniques. Study investigators will enroll at least 450 persons over two influenza seasons (2021- 2022 and 2022 -2023) . Approximately 160 will be enrolled at Duke, 160 will be enrolled at Johns Hopkins, and 130 at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The general techniques for how subjects will be recruited include the following: Study staff, including PIs and clinical research coordinators will approach patients /patient's LAR(s) seen during clinic visits about the study ; notify other health care professionals in their health system about the study via letters and flyers for potential referrals; notify potential subjects / subject's LAR(s) about the study via study registries and recruitment service programs. More specific mechanisms to DUMC , JHU, and Cincinnati are described below. In addition, research staff will work with local COVID -19 vaccination clinics to recruit study participants. At DUMC, we will plan to enroll persons for whom the COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. Duke will plan to work with Duke Employee Health and Well ness (OEHW) to identify employees that have not yet been vaccinated or may require a COVID -19 vaccine booster dose . Duke will then use that list of healthcare workers in an effort to assist with recruitment. In addition, Duke will partner with local COVID -19 vaccination clinics and other Duke clinics for potential participant referrals. For the proposed study, we will not enroll long -term care facility residents. These sources are likely to be sufficient, but if not , we will utilize oth er past successful strategies such as a letter campaign to households of older adults and advertising in senior citizen newspapers and general local newspapers. At JHU, we will also enroll people for whom the COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the ACIP. For community outreach, we partner with local broadcast, cable television, and OTT (over -the-top) providers to run 15 and 30 second commercials that are IRB -approved under our general screening protocol. In addition, the Center for Immunization Research (CIR) has its own website (https://centerforimmunizationresearch.org/) which includes a \"Join A Study\" page dedicated to recruitment for upcoming studies. The CIR has also partnered with local community organizations to increase awareness of and community involvement in clinical trials of coronavirus vaccines. This includes community organizations in the African American community as well as the LatinX community. We have Spanish -speaking staff who can enroll and consent subjects in Spanish. The CIR maintains a recruitment tracking system that securely stores contact information for previous study participants and others who have previously contacted the Center. CIR staff may contact those people who have expressed permission to be contacted for future studies as an additional recruitment method. In addition to our dedicated recruitment phone line, people can contact us directly via our CIR Facebook, Twitter, and website to learn about our studies. In order to recruit health care workers and other frontline workers, specifically targeted advertisements will be used in health care se ttings to recruit those workers . For the 2021 -2022 Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 27 season, in order to recruit healthcare workers , we may partner with Occupational health so that workers are informed of the study at the time of the annual influenza vaccination. At Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) , we will also enroll persons for whom the COVID -19 vaccine is rec ommended by the ACIP. We have been very successful in recruiting adults through email advertisements to our employee population . We have over 16,000 employees, and we have recruited successfully from this population and their friends and family members for many trials. We will also reach out to the public vaccination clinic at CCHMC, which is now vaccinating individuals ages 5 and over with COVID -19 vaccine. We may recruit pediatric participants with direct outreach to patients scheduled to receive a CO VID-19 vaccine at our Pediatric Primary Care Clinic. In regard to older adults, we will continue to collaborate with our local retirement communities to recruit and enroll older adults. We will not enroll long -term care facility residents for this study. We have successfully enrolled older adults for previous vaccine trials from our collaborating retirement community, Maple Knoll Village. We believe that these resources will be sufficient, but if not, we will utilize other past successful strategies like ou r vaccine trial participant database and advertisements in local medical offices, hospitals, and retirement communities. At all sites, existing patients or their parent(s)/LAR(s) may be approached by phone call . The study will be reviewed with the patient or their parent(s)/LAR(s) , and if the patient is interested, then initial eligibility screening will take place on the phone following an IRB -approved script. A waiver of documentation of consent will be approved from the reviewing IRB in order to carry out these screening activities. 4.5 Reasons for and Handling of Withdrawals The following may be reason for study withdrawal: As deemed necessary by the principal investigator (PI) . Subject or parent(s)/LAR(s) withdrawal of consent. Loss to follow -up. Subject unable to return for study appointments Termination of the study by the sponsor Subjects or their parent(s)/LAR(s) may withdraw their consent for study participation at any time and for any reason, without penalty. Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to randomization will be replaced. Subjects who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced. Data collected before withdrawal will still be used for analysis. 4.6 Termination of Study This study may be terminated for safety concerns of the principal investigator s from the Lead or Contributing sites, CDC, or participating Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs ). 5 STUDY SCHEDULE, PROCEDURES , & EVALUATIONS 5.1 Schedule of events and data collection Persons meeting the proposed eligibility criteria ( Section 4) will be recruited.

Those receiving IIV4 at visit 1 will receive saline placebo at Visit 2 and those receiving saline placebo at Visit 1 will receive IIV4 at Visit 2. Randomization will be stratified by age ( 5 to < 12 years of age, 12 to < 18 years of age, 18 to <65 years of age, and 65 years of age) and receipt of either a primary two -dose series or any booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine (for ages booster is authorized and recommended ) using a permuted block randomization scheme stratified by Lead and Contributing Site s. The project statistician will generate permuted block randomization schemes which will be uploaded to REDCap. The randomization schedule will not be available to the study staff, so the next randomization allocation will not be k nown before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of study eligibility criteria during Visit 1, participant randomization will be through REDCap with treatment allocation recorded on the unbl inded vaccinator CRF. In the event that REDCap is unavailable, manual randomization will occur through the use of envelopes. The project statistic ian will prepare 10 envelopes per age group and vaccine series per site (total of 60 per site) that will use the same randomization strategy as the primary scheme embedded in REDCap. When an unblinded team member is informed of the age group, he/she will pull the next envelope in order. In order to capture the allocation per subject, a separate form in REDCap will be used by the unblinded personnel to add the assignment. A log will need to be kept at the site capturing these instances. 5.3 Data Collection 5.3.1 Study Product Supply, Storage, and Administration In order to ensure adherence to study randomization assignment, age- appropriate, licensed IIV4 or saline placebo will be administered as a study procedure. EUA or approved mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine will be administered either per standard of care or as a study procedure depending Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 42 on the study site and location. Licensed SD-IIV4 and HD -IIV4 vaccine (prefilled syringes) will be purchased for study administration and maintained at the study sites and stored at 2\u00b0 C to 8\u00b0C in a research- specific medication refrigerator. Licensed or EUA COVID -19 vaccine will be stored per manufact urer specifications. While research staff maintain daily temperature logs for the medication storage, it is also monitored 24/7 with alarm activation if out of range. Research staff are notified of any alarm activations and have an on- call system in place to report to the research center for further investigation. Any potentially compromised vaccine will be quarantined for further disposition based on site -specific SOPs and investigator assessment. A licensed unadjuvanted standard dose egg- based IIV4 will be the designated study product for influenza vaccination of persons less than 65 years of age43. Study sites will work to coordinate the brand of IIV4 administered. A single administration of IIV4 comprises intramuscular delivery of 0.5mL total volume of the vacci ne for persons 5 through 64 years of age. Fluzone High- Dose (Sanofi) will be the designated study products for influenza vaccination of persons 65 years of age and older . A single administration of HD -IIV4 comprises intramuscular delivery of 0.7mL total volume of the vaccine for adults 65 years of age and older. Sterile normal saline supplied by each site' s respective pharmacy will be used as placebo. A single administration of placebo comprises intramuscular deliver of 0.5 mL total volume of normal sal ine for persons 5 through 64 years of age and 0.7 mL total volume for those 65 years of age and older. mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be administered per FDA and ACIP recommendations for administration. The primary two- doses mRNA COVID -19 vaccine series will be administered in two doses, approximately 21 to 56 days or 28 to 56 days apart depending upon the FDA or CDC recommendations . The booster dose of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine will be administered according to FDA authorization or EUA and ACIP recommendation. Vaccine lot numbers, dose, and site of vaccine administration will be recorded by research staff. After administration, used study syringes will be disposed of according to standard operating procedure. Emergency management supplies including epinephrine (1:1000) and trained staff will be available for initial treatment of an allergic reaction, if needed. 5.3.2 Blinding SD-IIV4, HD -IIV4, and/or placebo will be administered to blinded participants in the opposite deltoid muscle , to which the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine was administered at Visit 1 . SD-IIV4 or HD-IIV4 will be administered by unblinded licensed staff. In order to keep the participant blinded, the vaccine administrator will keep the prefilled syringes out of view of the participant at all times and will instruct the participant to turn their head in the opposite direction of the arm in which the vaccine is being administered. Similar instructions will be given to any persons accompanying the patient in the room. After administration, used study syringes will be disposed of according to site- specific SOPs. A licensed provider (MD, DO, NP, PA, RN, LPN ), who will be trained on treating adverse reactions, will be immediately available at the time of vaccine administration along with emergency management supplies available for initial treatment of an allergic reaction if needed. Additionally, clinical members of the blinded data collection team will be present to assist study subjects. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 43 5.4 Reactogenicity and Safety Assessment Participants will be assessed for any immediate reactogenicity in a period at least 3 0 minutes after vaccine administration while at the study site. They will be assessed for the following potential systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis related symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, cough, stridor, urticarial, flushing, nasal congestion, dizziness, syncope, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, nausea/vomiting , diarrhea). They will be assessed for any potential injection site reactions including pain, tenderness, erythema or induration. Frequency and occurrence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity will be assessed daily through post -vaccination Day 7 following Visits 1, 2 and 3 (if primary two -dose COVID -19 vaccine series) using a standard memory aid. Participants/participant's LAR(s) will submit this information electronically on a daily basis. For participants unable to submit electronically , paper memory aid completion and collection will be acceptable but not preferred. Injection site and systemic solicited events will be graded as noted in Tables 8 and 9 44. Participants/participant's LAR(s) will be further queried upon presence of symptoms. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) will be assessed during the first 7 days following each vaccination visit and concomitant medications will be assessed from 30 days prior to Visit 1 through the study period. S erious AEs (SAEs) and new onset of adverse events special interest (AESI) will be assessed through the entire period of a subject's participation (see below). Unsolicited AEs and SAEs will also be graded as to whether they are noticeable but do not interfere with activity (Grade 1), interfere with some activity but did not need a medical visit or absenteeism (Grade 2), or prevent daily activity and/or resulted in medical visit and/or absenteeism (grade 3) or require an emergency room visit or hospitalization (Grade 4). At the time of study enrollment, participants/participant's LAR(s) will be given a thermometer and instructed on using the symptom diary to document oral temperatures and post -injection symp toms. Beginning on the evening of Study Visits 1, 2 and 3 (if primary two -dose COVID -19 vaccine series) (Day 1) following vaccination, participants/participant's LAR(s) will record their or their child's oral temperature using the study -supplied thermometer, the occurrence of solicited AEs, for the next 7 days (Day 1 - 7). Temperature will be recorded at roughly the same time each day. If a temperature 100.0\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) is recorded, a second measurement will be taken. If more than one temperature is taken on the same day, the highest temperature should be recorded. Fever will be defined as a measured temperature 100.4\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C). Participants /participant's LAR(s) will be queried during Visits 2, 3, and 4 on any solicited adverse events following vaccination. Injection site reactogenicity will be assessed separately for COVID -19 vaccine and IIV4 or placebo as described in Table 8. Table 8.

Are you or your child having any medical or clinical problems? If so, please tell me about them.\" Participants/participant's LAR(s) who report severe solicited or unsolicited adverse events or express any concern about symptoms/unsolicited events will be encouraged to follow up with their or their child's primary care provider. Study staff will assist with coordination of referral appointments as necessary. Medical records will be obtained and reviewed for the occurrence of any adverse events, serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest throughout the study period. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) will be collected and reported for the 7 days following each vaccine visit. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest ( AESI ) will be collected and reported during the entire study period [i.e. from enrollment through 120 days following enrollment]. Unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and AESIs will be graded as follows. Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Noticeable but does not interfere with activity or measurement Interferes with activity but did not need a medical visit or absenteeism [i.e. missing work or school] Significant; prevents daily activity and/or resulted in medical visit and/or absenteeism [i.e. missing work or sch ool] Requires an ER visit or hospitalization Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 46 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions: Results in death during the period of protocol -defined surve illance Is life -threatening (defined as im mediate risk of death at the time of the event) Requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolonged hospitalization during the per iod of protocol -defined surveillance Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect Results in a persi stent or signif icant disability/in capacity Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse. An adverse event of special interest ( AESI ) includes the following: COVID -19 illness Multisystem inflammatory syndrome Guillain -Barre syndrome Allergic type reactions (including anaphylaxis, hives, or facial and limb swelling occurring within 7 days of a vaccination visit) Myocarditis or pericarditis 5.4.1 Causality (relatedness) Assessment Study site investigators will assess relatedness to vaccine or study procedures (related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related) for unsolicited AEs, S AEs and AEs of special interest. Relatedness determinations of these events will inform IRB reporting and safety monitoring (Section 5.4.3 ). Solicited symptoms in Tables 8 and 9 will all be considered to be related to vaccine and causality assessment will not be done for these events. The study investigators will use their clinical judgement to make causality assessments and may consult the Expert Safety Panel or CISA Project for assistance with causality determinations. The final causality assessment decision is the responsibility of the site PI where the subject was enrolled. 5.4.2 Reporting of Adverse Events COVID -19 vaccine adm inistration will follow site -specific vaccine campaign administration guidelines in accordance with current recommendations from the US Food and Drug Administration and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). There are no previously publis hed COVID -19 trials evaluating the concomitant administration of influenza vaccine; however, we do not foresee having a significant issue with serious adverse events (SAEs). SAEs and unanticipated problems will be reported to the CDC and all participating IRBs according to institutional requirements. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 47 Adverse events that occur in a recipient following COVID -19 vaccination should be reported to CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Vaccination providers are required by the Food and Drug Administration to report the following that occur after COVID- 19 vaccination under Emergency Use Authorization: Vaccine administration errors Serious adverse events Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospitalization or death Reporting is encouraged for any other clinically significant adverse event even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report to VAERS is available at https://va ers.hhs.gov external icon or by calling 1- 800-822-7967. 5.4.3 Safety Monitoring Plan As a lead site, Duke will coordinate an interim safety review. This review will be performed by a panel of vaccine safety experts. Duke will provide one subject matter expert to serve on the safety panel. CDC will appoint two subject matter experts from other CISA sites that are not participating in this study. The safety expert s will review SAEs and AESI and create an interim report. This review will occur once approximately 100 subjects are enrolled or at the end of the influenza season, whichever occurs first. As the L ead Site, Duke will prepare narratives of the SAEs and AESI for the safety panel. This plan is designed to monitor safety while minimizing introduction of bias into the study and minimizing burden to study investigators . 5.5 Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) 5.5.1 Generic Measures of HRQOL HRQOL assessments will be performed for persons aged 12 years at baseline and daily for 7 days following receipt of either COVID -19 vaccine plus placebo or following COVID -19 vaccine plus influenza vaccine. Assessments will include the EQ -5D-5L and the EQ -VAS. EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D is a standardized, generic measure of health status that provides information on HRQOL and activities of daily living: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression ( http:// www.euroqol.org/) 45. In addition, the contains the EQ Visual Analogue Sc ale (EQ -VAS) which measures the respondent's self -rated health. The EQ -5D-5L is the new version of the EQ -5D that increases the levels of severity from three to five to significantly increase reliability and sensitivity while maintaining feasibility and r educing ceiling effects ( Appendix A ) 46,47. The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression. For each of these dimensions, there are 5 response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5- digit number describing the respondent's health state from 11111 as best health and 55555 as worst health These numbers are converted to a Utility Index that ranges from -0.109 (worst health) to 1.000 (best health) for US specific values. The minimum clinically important difference ranges from 0.05 to 0.1 depending on health conditions Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 48 being studied. The EQ-5D-5L will be used for participants 12 years of age and older . HRQOL will not b e collected for participants 5-11 years of age. EQ-VAS The EQ -VAS records the respondent's self -rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' (100) and 'the worst health you can imagine' (0). The respondent marks an 'X' on the scale number to indicate how their health is 'today.' The minimum clinically important difference on the VAS is 8. The EQ -5D-5L and EQ-VAS have several advantages for use in this study. The measure is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments and provide a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. It has been validated in US and international populations and in adolescents and adults of all ages45,48,49. The measure is useful for monitoring the health status of patient groups at different moments in time and assessing the seriousness of conditions at different moments in time. The measure is designed for self - completion by respondents. It is simple, straightforward, take only a few minutes to complete and can easily be completed by adolescents and older adults. The instrument was designed to reduce respondent burden while achieving standards of precision for purposes of group comparisons involving multiple health dimensions. It has been widely used throughout the world in many different studies, including randomized controlled clinical trials, vaccine studies, and HRQOL studies . HRQOL will not be collected for participants aged 5 -11 years of age. 5.6 Bios pecimens Collection & Handling 5.6.1 Serum Blood specimens will be collected during study visits as described in Tables 5 and 6. All blood samples ( 5 or 1 0 mL, depending upon age of the participant ) will be collected into serum separator tubes and processed as follows: Allow blood to clot at room temperature for at least 30 minutes while standing upright in a rack. Centrifuge tube within 8 hours of collection at 1100 to 1300 RCF(g) for 10 minutes. Gently remove the vacutainer stopper avoiding serum contamination with red blood cells. Using a single -use pipette, transfer 1.0 mL aliquots of serum (top layer) into 1.0mL or 1.8 mL cryovials, up to 5 cryovials are expected for those 12 years of age and older and up to 2 cryovials are expected for those 5 -11 years of age . If less than 1 mL of processed serum is collected, it is a protocol deviation All cryovial aliquots will be barcode labelled and contain a unique identifier via REDCap . Numbers should be placed lengthwise on the tube. Freeze the cryovials at - 80\u00b0C in the temperature- monitored research center freezer for future shipment. Serum aliquots will be stored in the Duke Human Vaccine Institute Accessioning Lab, the Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research laboratory , and at CCHMC Schubert Research Clinic Laboratory until planned HAI analyses at which point the samples stored at JHU and Cincinnati will be shipped to Duke for planned laboratory analysis Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 49 6 LABORATORY A NALYSES 6.1 Baseline SARS -CoV-2 antibody Serum samples obtained at the Visit 1 (prior to vaccination) will be assayed for the presence of pre-existing SARS -CoV-2 antibody using the AdviseDx SARS -CoV-2 IgG microparticle immunoassay intended the qualitative and semi -quantitative detection of IgG spike antibodies to SARS -CoV-2 qualitative detection of nucleocapsid IgG antibodies to SARS -CoV-2 in human serum. All results will be interpreted as either positive or negative. A positive result on any assa y will be interpreted as a positive antibody test result. The assays are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS -CoV-2 indicating recent or prior infection. Both assays are currently only for use under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization. SARS- CoV-2 antibody assays will be performed in the Immunology Virology Quality Assessment Center (IVQAC) at the DHVI. The IVQAC is a GCLP laboratory which is also accredited by CAP, CLIA and ISO -17043. 6.2 Influenza H emagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Assay Influenza Hemagglutination (HAI) Assays will be performed on sera collected , contingent on additional funding. Briefly, r eference wild- type, reassortant, or vaccine virus strains representative of the spec ific viral antigens included in the 2021 -22 influenza vaccine will be used to evaluate the relative levels of all four influenza strain- speci fic antibodies in participant serum samples collected pre- and 21 or 28 days post -vaccination from all study partic ipants. To accomplish these activities , all pa rticipant samples will be interrogated for influenza antibodies against the strains of interest using the influenza hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HI). This assay is considered the \"gold- standard\" measure by which to evaluate seroconversion/seroprotection in response to seasonal influenza vaccination. This assay will be performed in accordance with the Duke Regional Biocontainment Laboratory Virology Unit's fully optimized and approved SOP (RVUSOP004 Influe nza HI of Serum Samples). Briefly, te st samples will be assayed by H AI as duplicate 2- fold dilution series starting at 1:10. Serum dilutions are then incubated with a concentration of virus verified to possess a known potential for red blood cell (RBC) a gglutination. The presence of virus -specific antibodies is visualized via incubation of the virus -serum mixture with a RBC solution; the endpoint titer for a given dilution series is then expressed as the reciprocal of the final dilution in which complete HAI is observed. By convention, seronegative samples are defined as having an endpoint H AI titer < 40 and seropositive samples as having an endpoint titer of 1:40; and seroconversion as a 4 -fold change in endpoint titer relative to pre- immunization baseline or a change from <10 to 1:40 50. 6.3 Future Studies In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there may be other tests or assays that have yet to be identified that may be important for interpreting our study findings or of relevance to co-administration of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines and IIV 4 simultaneously . Additional laboratory assays may test for antibodies against other bacteria or viruses, markers of inflammation, or used in research assessing vaccine co- admin istration or health outcomes . Specimens banked for use in other studies will be linked to information (including identifying Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 50 information) that participants provided to the study. Because it is unknown if future testing will be of any utility, results of future testing will not be provided. 7 STATISTICAL C ONSIDERATIONS In collaboration with Johns Hopkins University and Cincinnati Children's Hospital sites, the research team at Duke will oversee the statistical analysis. D ata will reside on a secure Duke server maintained by Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS) . For the study, a database will be developed and a data set for the study without personal identifiers will be made available to the CDC upon request. Duke statisticians will develop a comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan. The summary points of the analysis plan are presented below. 7.1 Analysis Plan Should an interim safety analysis be required, the alpha level will be adjusted to assure the overall type I error is maintained at the one-sided alpha 0.02 5 level for the primary outcome of non-inferiority. 7.1.1 Sample Size Safety: Four reactogenicity events were included in the primary statistical endpoint : fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia of moderate or greater severity . These were considered clinically meaningful and were solicited in both mRNA COVID -19 vaccine trials. Headache and fatigue were also solicited reactogencity in both trials, but each occurred at the moderate -severe grade in >10% of participants after dose 1 placebo (in the Pfizer - Pfizer -BioNTech trial) and were thought to be less specific13. Based on data from prelicensure studies10,51,52, we assume that 15% of participants will have at least one reaction of moderate severity or greater to include fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia reactogenicity event in the S equential group. We have selected a clinically meaningful noninferiority margin of 10%. We plan to recruit a total of 450 participants and assume a 5% drop out rate, leaving N=428 or N=214 per study group. Statistical calculations show that with a one -side alpha level of 0 .025, and 214 subjects in each group across all study sites , there is 82.6% power to be able to demonstrate that the proportion of participants with at least one severe solicited local or systemic reactogenicity event in the Simultaneous group is noninferior to the S equential group . Enrollment in this study shall occur during two influenza season (2021 -22, 2022- 23). 7.1.2 Analysis Populations Full Analysis Population 1: This population is defined as all subjects who are randomized, vaccinated, and provide at least one day of complete data on the symptom diary . Full Analysis Population 2 : This population is defined as all subjects who are randomized and vaccinated. Immunogenicity Population: This population defined as subjects who received vaccine, provide baseline and Visit 3 and Visit 4 blood draws of acceptable volume and quality within the protocol -defined time frame with no protocol violations affecting immunogenicity . Protocol violations Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 51 affecting the immunogenicity analyses will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . The Full Analysis Population 1 is the primary population for analysis unless otherwise stated. 7.1.3 Primary Objective 1 To compare the proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arth ralgia in the group receiving IIV4 simultaneously with mRNA COVID -19 vaccine at Vaccination Visit 1 (Simultaneous group) with the group receiving IIV4 alone two weeks later at Vaccination Visit 2 (Sequential group) following both Vaccination Visit 1 and 2 o Hypothesis: The proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, myalgia or arthralgia will be noninferior (not higher) in the Simultaneous group versus the Sequential group. This objective will be assessed for visits 1 and 2 using a one- sided noninferiority test with the alpha level set at 0.025 and noninferior ity margin of 10%. The null hypothesis is the Simultaneous group is inferior (i.e., Simultaneous group will have a higher proportion) to the Sequential group in regards to the proportion of participants with at least one moderate or severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia event after visits 1 and 2 . Ho: Simultaneous group - Sequential group 0.10 (10 %) The alternative hypothesis is the Simultaneous group is noninferior to the Sequential group in regards to the proportion of participants with at least one moderate or severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia event after visits 1 and 2 . Ha: Simultaneous group - Sequential group < 0.10 (10%) The upper bound of a site -stratified Newcombe binomial confidence interval (Yan and Su 2010) with Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting of the difference will be used to make the se assessment s with no adjustment to the alpha level for multiple comparisons. 7.1.4 Secondary Objective 1 To compare the proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia in the Simultaneous versus the Sequential Group following the first vaccination visit 7.1.5 Secondary Objective 2 To compare the proportion of participants with moderate or more severe fever, chills, myalgia, or arthralgia in the Simultaneous versus Sequential Group following the second vaccination visit Secondary objectives 1 and 2 will be evaluated using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic in a s tratified analysis by site at the alpha 0.05 level. N o adjustments will be made to the alpha level for these evaluations. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 52 7.1.6 Secondary Objective 3 To describe the proportions of participant s in the Simultaneous and Sequential vaccination groups with solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events according to severity grade after the first and second vaccination visit and third vaccination visit for those receiving two doses of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine Tables (one for each visit 1, 2, and 3) will be produced that summarize each solicited local and systemic reactogenicity event by classification (none, mild, moderate, and severe), as well as by moderate or severe for each study group. These tables will have the number and percentage for each classification by study group and the confidence interval of the difference between the study groups. ( Note: assessments for solicited local reactogenicity will not be assessed following Visit 2 for the simultaneous group ) 7.1.7 Secondary Objective 4 To describe the proportions of participants in the Simultaneous and Sequential vaccination groups experiencing at least one serious adverse event and a description of these events A table will be produced that summarize participant s experiencing at least one serious adverse event during the study period by group. This table will have the number and percentage for each outcome by study group and the confidence interval of the difference between the study groups. Listings with the clinical narratives will also be provided. The primary analysis population will be the Full Analysis Population 2. 7.1.8 Exploratory Objectives The analysis for the exploratory objectives will be detailed in the comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan . The Immunogenicity Population will be the primary analysis population for exploratory HAI objectives. 7.2 Data Management The novel Vanderbilt -designed resource developed specifically for online collection of research information, the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap ) platform (https://projectredcap.org/ ), will be used to design study forms, including the reaction forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. REDCap pro vides: 1) a streamlined process for rapidly building a database; 2) an intuitive interface for collecting data, with data validation and audit trail; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; 4) branching logic, file uploading, and calculated fields; and 5) a quick and easy protocol set -up. This system will be used by Duke for data management. All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and requirements to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. All study -related documents containing protected health information, e.g. enrollment logs, case report forms, diaries completed by study participants, will be maintained in secure research offices at Duke , John Hopkins CIR, and Cincinnati Children's Hospital , which are accessible to research staff only. Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 53 The study team will utilize a secure, encrypted, file transfer method for sharing study documents and data with the CDC. No personal identifiers will be included in any shared documents or datasets. 7.2.1 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) REDCap ( http://project- redcap.org/ ), assists with the collection and management of data for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs and rapidly develop secure, web-based applications for collection, management and sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study metadata table referenced by presentation- level operational modules. Based on this abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. The concept of metadata- driven application development is well established, and the critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata in an efficient manner. Both products include secure institutional data hosting and include full audit -trails in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of 647 active institutions. The REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects with over 89,000 users spanning numerous research focus areas across the consortium. The current project will use this soft ware application for the design of electronic forms to collect information from study participants, to link the baseline data, sample collection date, and laboratory results in an automated database family, to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, and to design an analytical dataset for the analysis of the project data. Data will be entered into the REDCap database by members of the study team from Duke , Johns Hopkins CIR , and Cincinnati Children's Hospital using the paper case report forms utilized to record data collected as part of study procedures. Study investigators will be responsible for assuring that all paper records are securely stored according to the requirements of their IRBs. The study invest igators will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the data entered from the paper forms into REDCap. A ssigned identifiers will be used in REDCap. In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -in filters and checks for consistency of the data including range and limit checks, branching logic and pull down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -specified list will be implemented and performed automatically to minimize data entry error. The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a regular basis. The data and related analytical datasets will also be stored at the lead and contributing sites with secured password- protected computers. 7.3 Role of the CDC Investigators in the Project This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University, Johns Hopkins University and Cincinnati Children's Hospital as Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract . CDC staff will collaborate with all sites to develop the protocol, conduct the study, ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services (CDC) public health priorities, and analyze Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 54 the data and disseminate the results. CDC may receive access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information. 8 HUMAN SUBJECTS 8.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design Duke , Johns Hopkins University , and Cincinnati Children's Hospital investigators will be responsible for submitting the protocol , informed consent , diaries , recruitment letters , flyers, and any written or verbally conveyed materials specific to this project to their institutional review boards. CDC staff will be responsible for submitting materials to the CDC Human Subjects Review for determination to rely on Duke IRB . To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent and HIPAA authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of potential subjects while recording identifiable private health information (PHI) prior to obtaining the subject's consent. This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical record systems in the clinics in order to determine eligibility for study enrollment where available. We will review only the minimum amount of information necessary to determine eligibility, i.e. dat e of birth , medical and surgical history, and recent laboratory test results. The PHI collected prior to consent will be used to recruit and screen only. Use of PHI in this manner involves no more than minimal risk to subjects and no information will leave the study sites . Requests for continuing review, when required, will be submitted at each engaged institution in accordance with institutional procedures. P rotocol deviations or concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to the overseeing IRB or CDC in accordance with institutional requirements . 8.2 Sources of Material Medical history and immunization history will be obtained from the medical record when available and from patient report. Demographic information will be obtained from the medical record and patient report. Subjects will record solicited adverse reactogenicity events and any medical intervention sought on study days 1-7 following each vaccination visit on the symptom diary . Diary information will either be reported electronically or on paper which will be given to the study team during a study visit . Diary information reported electronically will be preferred but paper reporting will be allowed. The research staff will assess oral temperature. 8.3 Potential Risks and Benefits mRNA COVID -19 vaccines Two COVID -19 vaccine received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA in December 2020. BNT162b2 received FDA approval for individuals 16 years of age and mRNA -1273 received authorization for those 18 years of age. The Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID -19 vaccine received additional EUA for adolescents 12 to 15 years in May 2021 and children 5 to 11 years in October 2021. These vaccines have been recommended at these ages by the ACIP. Participants will be provided with the respective fact sheets for the mRNA COVID -19 vaccine they receive including the BNT162b2 -1273 https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 55 Side effects that have been reported with mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines include both injections site reactions as well as general side effects. Injection site reactions include: pain, tenderness and swelling of the lymph nodes in the same arm of the injection, swelling (hardness), and redness at the injection site. General side effects include: fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, fever and feeling unwell. There is a remote chance that an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction, usually occurring within a few minutes to hour s after getting a do se of vaccine. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: difficulty breathing, facial and throat swelling, tachycardia, total body rash, dizziness and weakness. There have been rare reports of cases of inflammation of the heart \u2014called myocarditis and pericarditis \u2014happening after mRNA COVID -19 vaccination 30-32. The events have mainly occurred in adolescents and young adults and more often after the second dose of vaccine. Available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms, but information is not yet available about potential long- term sequelae 30,31. These may not be all the possible side effects of the mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Serious and unexpected side effects may also occur. mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines are still being studied in clinical trials. Available data support the safety of dose 3 mRNA COVID -19 vaccine in immunocompromised individuals13. Available data support the safety of booster doses of mRNA COVID -19 vaccine13. SD-IIV4 and HD -4 SD-IIV4 and HD-IIV4 are FDA -licensed vaccines approved for use in persons 6 months of age and those 65 years old, respectively. Both vaccines are standard clinical practice and recommended by the CDC. Participants will be provided with the CDC Vaccine Information Stateme nt (VIS) for IIV 4 (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/flu.pdf ). IIV4 risks include m inor problems such as soreness, redness, swelling, or pain where the shot was given, hoarseness, sore, red or itchy eyes, cough, fever, aches, headache, itching, fatigue, all of which usually occur within 1- 2 days of vaccination and are self -limiting. More serious probl ems including a small increased risk of Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome estimated at 1 or 2 additional cases per million people vaccinated can occur. This is much lower than the risk of severe complications from influenza infection, which can be prevented by IIV 4 53. In addition, any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, which is estimated at ~ 1 in one million doses of IIV 4 administered 54. General Vaccine Risks Some people get severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. This happens very rarely. Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines . Sitting or lying down when space is available for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall, as recommended in the ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization 8. Subjects should inform their doctor if they feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. As with any licensed or authorized vaccine, protection may not occur in 100% of vaccinated persons for either COVID -19 or influenza vaccines . Blood Drawing Risks of blood drawing include pain, swelling, bleeding, or bruising at the site where the blood sample is collected. Subjects may also experience dizziness or fainting. There is a small risk of Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 56 infection around the vein where the blood was collected. Each study subject will be asked to have up to 4 blood samplings with the total volume not to exceed 60mL over an approximately 4 month period of time. Delay of Influenza Protection There is a potential risk of a short delay in influenza protection by delaying the receipt of influenza vaccine 2 weeks . Confidentiality An additional risk of study participation is the potential for loss of confidentiality. 8.4 Adequacy of Protection Against Risks 8.4.1 Protections against Risk To decrease the possibility of infection at the site of blood drawing, the area on the arm above the vein where blood will be taken will be prepped with 70% isopropyl alcohol antiseptic prior to venipuncture. Subjects /subject's LAR(s) will be counseled on possible side effects following vaccination and followed closely in the immediate post -vaccination period and during the following week for assessment of moderate to severe local or systemic reactogenicity. In the immediate post - vaccination period, all subjects will be monitored in a s itting or lying position for 30 minutes following vaccinations to help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Subjects with a prior history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine or COVID -19 vaccine, or to a vaccine component, including egg protein, will be excluded from study enrollment. Epinephrine and equipment for managing an airway will be available for immediate use if needed to treat a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Subjects will be evaluated and cared for as described in the Unscheduled Visit section above Data Safety monitoring, as described above ( Section 5.4.3 ), shall also be done. The study team will provide documentation to the partici pant and primary care provider regarding receipt of COVID -19 vaccine and influenza vaccine. Documentation of COVID- 19 vaccine receipt will be provided on the date received. Documentation of influenza vaccine receipt will be provided at Visit 2 when it can be assured that all participants will have received an influenza vaccine. Participants will be counseled that if they are concerned that they have an influenza- like illness (characterized by fever and irritability, cough, sore throat, or vomiting) or symptoms of COVID - 19 which may overlap with influenza, they should seek care for with their health care provider. If the provider suspects or determines that the participant has influenza, there are medications to treat influenza illness and the provider may opt to treat the participant with one of these medications. If a participant's care requires the identity of the date of receipt of influenza vaccine, blinding will be broken for that patient. At the end of the study, the participants/parti cipant's LAR(s) and providers will receive documentation about the timing of influenza vaccination for each participant. If influenza activity become widespread, study enrollment may be paused. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides treatment and management recommendations for COVID -19 patients https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ . Simultaneous mRNA COVID -19 and IIV4 Vaccination Study Version 4.0 May 09, 2022 57 Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. Com puterized participant information will be kept in password- protected files on secured servers. Paper case report forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study personnel. Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifi able participant i nformation. The CDC provides a Certificate of Confidentiality to protect the privacy of research participants . This certificate limits the disclosure of subject identifiable information . The investigators cannot disclose identifiable inf ormation except for if required by law, if participant consented to disclosure or if the information is used for other scientific research. Information may be disclosed to the CDC or the FDA. 8.4.2 ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements The project is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05028361 ). 8.5 Human Subjects In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator and study team will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, Good Clinical Practices, and ethical principles. The written informed consent form must be signed and dated by the study participant prior to initiation of any study activities. 8.5.1 Vulnerable Subjects Research Children are a vulnerable research population and require additional protections when they are potential research subjects. Children will receive approved or authorized vaccines consistent with ACIP recommendations. All children will receive an influenza vaccine at one time point and will receive a placebo at one time point. Thus, all children enrolled in the study will be immunized against seasonal influenza. Because this study is minimal risk with the potential for benefit , the permission of only one parent/LAR will be obtained. Assent from participants 5 through 17 years of age will be obtained in a manner consi stent with local IRB regulations . For participants turning 18 years of age during the course of the study, parent al consent will be obtained at enrollment and written in formed consent will be obtained from the participant after their 18 th birthday .
