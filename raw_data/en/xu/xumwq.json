First of all, you may be wondering why you should do it. There are many studies in [integrative medicine ](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/what-we-do/infertility-treatments/integrative-medicine/) that illustrate the health benefits of meditation. Better sleep at night, waking up feeling refreshed, feeling more positive in the morning, less stress and anxiety, reduction in pain, and healing faster are just a few reasons why. Lynne Goldberg (a personal meditation coach and founder of Omg I can Meditate) states; \"there is nothing you can do that can have such a positive effect on your life with so little time and effort.\" Embarking on fertility treatments can be very stressful. Managing your schedule, appointments, treatments, financial concerns, and the fact that you have to deal with a fertility issue at all are all significantly stressful. [We are here to help](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/who-we-help/)! When we feel stressed our body releases the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline. When we meditate we release feel good hormones like serotonin and oxytocin, which slows your heart rate and normalizes blood pressure. The positive effects are endless. To begin, find a good guided meditation. There are many on line. Start out light with ten minutes daily. You can meditate any time. Many people like to start their day with a short meditation. To begin it's important to have a place where you won't be disturbed. You should sit with your feet flat on the floor. If you lie down you may fall asleep and you want to remain alert, but relaxed. Breath is the most important. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for a few breaths. This breathing signals relaxation and your body will release the relaxation hormones. Then, just concentrate on breathing normally. Do a short scan of the body starting with your toes and moving up the body noticing any tense points. Imagine sending your breath to those tense points. After doing the scan, try to sit quietly concentrating on your breath. You can notice the environment around you, but try to reduce thinking. If thoughts come into your mind just place them in an imaginary bubble and go back to your breathing. There are many guided meditations on line. Many of them are free! Check them out and see if they resonate with you. You may also buy meditation CDs. You do not have to use a guided meditation. You can just sit quietly and silently. There is also group meditation. Check your community calendar or form your own group! There are other forms of meditation as well. If you can do something and concentrate on one thing at a time; this can be considered a form of meditation. Coloring is an activity that has become popular and falls into this category.
