Of all places?", "sitename": "SELF", "date": "2018-07-03", "cleaned_text": "Dealing with [eczema](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/eczema) on any part of your body is extremely frustrating, but eyelid eczema can be a special form of torture. The area around your eyes is very delicate, so when that part of your face becomes inflamed, [dry](https://www.self.com/story/dry-eyelids-eczema-tips), and incredibly itchy, you not only see it but also really feel it. While you probably don't think about your eyelids until they start to act up, they have the critical job of distributing protective tears across your eyeballs, which helps them stay hydrated with each blink. This process is second nature, so suddenly becoming aware of it due to irritation or a [painful rash](https://www.self.com/story/decode-rash-questions) around your eyes can be a bit maddening. There are lots of reasons why you might suddenly develop eczema, but you also probably wouldn't think it could bloom on your freaking eyelids. Unfortunately, no part of your body is immune to this finicky issue. Not sure what's going on? Here's everything you need to know about the skin condition, including the symptoms to watch for and the best eyelid eczema treatments to help you find which is the umbrella term people are usually referring to when they say eczema, is a chronic condition that happens due to a problem with your skin's protective barrier, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/symptoms-causes/syc-20353273). If you have atopic dermatitis, your top layer of skin doesn't retain adequate moisture or protect you as well as it should against things like irritants and allergens. Eyelid eczema often pops up in people who already deal with eczema on another part of their body (lucky you). Other [types of eczema](https://www.self.com/story/types-of-eczema) that tend to impact the eyelids include: - Contact dermatitis: This form of eczema happens when the skin reacts to an irritant or an allergen that comes near your eyes, from skin products to detergents to makeup, [Gary Goldenberg](https://goldenbergdermatology.com/), M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital](https://icahn.mssm.edu/), tells SELF. It's possible to develop this reaction to a specific trigger suddenly, even if it didn't necessarily cause issues for you in the past, per the [U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000869.htm). It doesn't even need to be put directly onto your eyelids\u2014simply touching an irritant or allergen with your hands and then touching the skin near your eyelids can spur symptoms as well. - Seborrheic dermatitis: This is a type of eczema that often affects the scalp, but can make its way to your [eyebrows](https://www.self.com/story/eyebrow-dandruff-how-to-treat-it)and eyelids, causing scaly patches, inflamed skin, and flaking. Experts aren't sure what causes seborrheic dermatitis, but believe it may be linked to an overgrowth of the yeast Malassezia on oily parts of the skin or it may be a result of a wonky immune system reaction, according to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710). What do eyelid eczema symptoms look and feel People with eczema generally experience [symptoms](https://www.self.com/story/eczema-symptoms-to-know) like [very dry](https://www.self.com/story/dry-skin-eczema) and itchy skin; red, brown, or gray skin patches; raised, weeping bumps; and thick, cracked, or scaly skin. They may also have raw, sensitive, swollen skin due to scratching-induced irritation. For eyelid eczema specifically, you may experience inflamed or reddened skin on and around your eyelid, or cracked, discolored skin in the general area, board-certified dermatologist [Ife J. Rodney](https://eternaldermatology.com/), M.D., founding director of and of dermatology at [Howard and [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), tells SELF. The affected [area can also sting and burn](https://www.self.com/story/eyes-burning-causes). What causes eyelid eczema? If you have any form of eczema, your skin can seem totally fine sometimes, and then during a flare remind you just how annoying this health condition can be at full force. Triggers like sweat, [stress](https://www.self.com/story/how-stress-impacts-skin), harsh soaps and detergents, dust, eye drops or solutions, and pollen can all cause flares. Dr. Rodney says she's even seen several patients who have developed contact dermatitis on their eyelids from an ingredient in their nail polish. \"We usually see an improvement when we ask the patient to discontinue using nail polish or having manicures,\" she says. \"The skin around the eyes is particularly thin and sensitive, making it more prone to irritation.\" There's also a genetic component to eczema (on your eyelids or anyplace else), according to the [American Academy of Dermatology](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/atopic-dermatitis/causes) (AAD). \"If someone in your family has the condition, you are more likely to have it,\" Dr. Rodney points out. A family or personal history of [food allergies](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/food-allergies), asthma, or hay fever can also raise your risk. With that said, it's possible for eczema to rear its head for no apparent reason as well. What's the best (and safest) eyelid eczema treatment? If you do have eczema on your eyelids, you'll want to do your best to avoid your triggers. This can range from pretty easy to completely ludicrous, depending on what specifically incites your eczema. If you can't steer clear of your triggers, or if doing so isn't enough to calm your eyelid eczema, you may need some extra help from a pro. \"This is one of the hardest forms of eczema to treat with medication because of the sensitive area we are treating,\" Dr. Rodney says. \"We have to make sure your eye\u2014meaning your eyeball\u2014is safe, as some prescriptions can lead to complications like glaucoma.\" To treat any form of eczema, experts will often recommend topical corticosteroids to battle inflammation, the Mayo Clinic says, but these can be too strong on your delicate eyelid skin. If your doctor decides a corticosteroid cream is the best treatment for your case of eczema, they'll likely only prescribe it for a short period of time because it can cause thinning of your eyelids and the skin around your eyes, [Cynthia Bailey](https://drbaileyskincare.com/), M.D., a diplomate of the [American Board of Dermatology](https://www.abderm.org/) and president and CEO of Advanced Skin Care and Dermatology Inc., tells SELF. \"This treatment needs to be supervised by a physician,\" Dr. Bailey says. There are also nonsteroidal creams, such as [pimecrolimus](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a603027.html) (Elidel) and [tacrolimus](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601117.html) (Protopic), that work by tamping down on your overactive immune system or suppressing inflammation. Doctors are often more comfortable using those for people who need long-term help treating their eyelid eczema, [Jonathan I. Silverberg](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dermatology/faculty/profile.html?xid=28517), M.D., at [Northwestern Memorial Hospital](https://www.nm.org/locations/northwestern-memorial-hospital), tells SELF, since they're not known to thin out your eyelid skin. Beyond that, experts often recommend that you go all in on [moisturizing when you have eyelid eczema](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-eczema-products). Dr. Silverberg says you just want to make sure that you use the gentlest options so you don't irritate your eyelid skin further. Look for products labeled \" [sensitive](https://www.self.com/story/sensitive-skin-facts-dermatologists),\" \"fragrance-free,\" and any other terms indicating the product is simple and solely meant to moisturize, not slough off your skin or make your face smell like a Hawaiian waterfall. It's also smart to look for eye creams specifically since they're formulated with that area in mind. Dr. Rodney also suggests placing a thin layer of petroleum jelly (yep, good ol' Vaseline) around and on your eyelids twice a day \"to reinforce the protective skin barrier, hydrate the dry skin, and reduce itching.\" Step away from the essential oils\u2014they are not something you want to put on your delicate eyelid skin, Dr. Rodney says. In fact, essential oils, like [tea tree oil](https://www.self.com/story/tea-tree-oil-skin) or lavender oil, and other products that are marketed as natural can actually spur eyelid eczema if they contain something your skin reacts to. Unfortunately, going the natural route, even with often harmless [remedies like coconut oil](https://www.self.com/story/coconut-oil-eczema), may do more harm than good around your eyes because it can be tough to pinpoint what's angering your skin in the first place. If you've tried cutting out suspicious products, switching to gentler creams, or applying prescription medications with the help of your dermatologist but still have flare-ups, your doctor may recommend doing a patch test to really get to the root of your problem, especially if they suspect the issue is irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. More than 15,000 substances can make your skin freak out, according to the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/patch-testing-rash), which makes it a bit tough to narrow down your culprit. That's where a patch test becomes helpful: Unlike a skin prick allergy test, which can show a pretty immediate reaction to a substance in the skin, a skin patch test stays on an area of your skin for two days, which allows delayed reactions to develop. The process is pretty intense\u2014you'll have to deal with dozens of patches (most likely on your back) for 48 hours. They can become itchy and sore and you can't remove them, so it can be uncomfortable. Plus, you can't get the area wet, which makes showering a bit difficult. But the results will hopefully be worth it. Once your dermatologist identifies which particular substances are triggering your eczema, you can finally cut them out of your routine completely and create an individualized [eczema treatment](https://www.self.com/story/eczema-treatment-tips) plan that will allow your skin to heal. What are the possible complications of eyelid eczema? The more severe your eyelid eczema, the more likely it is that you might experience other eye problems, the [AAD](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/adult/eye-problems) says. The organization specifically highlights three eye conditions that people with eyelid eczema should have on their radar: pink eye, keratitis, and keratoconus. Pink eye, also called conjunctivitis, happens when your conjunctiva (the thin, clear tissue lining your eyelids and the whites of your eyes) becomes inflamed. Pink eye can cause [bloodshot eyes](https://www.self.com/story/red-eyes-causes), itching, tearing, a gritty feeling, and crustiness, the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355) says. [Keratitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374110) is an inflammation of your cornea (the clear, protective outer layer of your eye) that may cause [eye pain](https://www.self.com/story/when-to-see-doctor-eye-pain), [sensitivity to light](https://www.self.com/story/sensitivity-to-light-causes), redness, a feeling that something is in your eye, excessive tearing or other discharge, and blurry vision, among other symptoms. Finally, [keratoconus](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratoconus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351352) is when your cornea changes from its usual round shape into a bulging cone shape instead, creating blurry or otherwise distorted vision, sensitivity to light and glare, a need to change your eyewear prescription too frequently, and cloudy vision13. It's hard to say exactly why people with eyelid eczema are at a higher risk for these eye conditions. One potential reason: People with eczema may be more susceptible to the kind of pink eye that's linked with [allergies](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/allergies) (allergic conjunctivitis) due to something known as the \"atopic march.\" The atopic march is a progression of allergic diseases a person can have throughout their life, starting with eczema as a child and eventually dealing with issues like food allergies, hay fever, and [asthma](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/asthma), per the [American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology](https://www.aaaai.org/Tools-for-the-Public/Allergy,-Asthma-Immunology-Glossary/Atopic-March-Defined). \"The concept of the atopic march is that having an impaired skin barrier in eczema allows allergens to cross the skin, prime the immune system, and set off systemic allergies, including allergic conjunctivitis,\" Dr. Silverberg says. These issues could also be tied to using those too-harsh medications that thin out your skin, Dr. Silverberg says. Scratching and rubbing that extra-thin skin can create tiny tears or irritate your eyes, making you more vulnerable to infection and inflammation that may present as pink eye or keratitis. That rubbing can also change the shape of your cornea, leading to keratoconus, the AAD says. It's in no way guaranteed that you'll wind up with a bunch of interconnected eye issues just because you have eyelid [eczema](https://www.self.com/story/dyshidrotic-eczema), but making sure you treat it\u2014and your delicate lids\u2014properly can lower your risk. If you're not sure where to start, talk to your doctor for help so that together you can put a lid on "}
