Thus, the development of an effective vaccine for preventing and rapidly controlling avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is needed. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a synthetic DNA vaccine against H7 HA antigens in mice. Materials and Methods: The synthetic consensus H7 HA DNA vaccine (25 or 50 \u00b5g) was administered to BALB/c mice at 0, 14, and 28 days by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. Humoral and cellular immune responses were analyzed in rate against H7N9 reassortant influenza virus after both second and third immunizations. The geometric mean titer by the hemagglutination inhibition test increased with an increasing number of immunizations. However, there was no significant difference in geometric titer between the two groups in - jected with 25 and 50 \u00b5g of H7 HA DNA vaccine after two (79.98 vs. 107.65, P = 0.39) and three (159.96 vs. 215.28, P = 0.18) doses. In addition, the ELISpot assay revealed that administration of H7 HA DNA vaccine induced potent interferon-gamma pro - duction from mouse splenocytes. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of synthetic consensus H7 HA DNA vaccine in mice. This work demonstrates the potential of the H7 HA DNA vaccine as an efficient tool for the rapid control of emerging in - fluenza A (H7N9) virus. Key Words: Influenza A(H7N9) virus; Article Choi et al. Immunogenicity of H7 HA DNA vaccine www.icjournal.org 118 Introduction Influenza virus is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae and consists of eight genetic segments [1]. Antigenic variation is a unique characteristic of influenza virus. Antigenic drift generates seasonal influenza and antigenic shift results in the generation of pandemic influenza. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics every year. In contrast to annual epidemics, worldwide pandemics of influenza occur infrequently in association with the unpredictable emergence of novel influenza A virus through antigenic shift [2]. In March 2013, the novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was detected in patients with rapidly progress - ing respiratory diseases in Shanghai and Anhui Province, Chi - na [3]. Influenza A (H7N9) virus is thought to emerge by the reassortment of gene segments from at least four different in - fluenza A viruses: H7 from duck, N9 from wild birds or chick - ens, and six internal gene segments from H9N2 influenza vi - ruses of brambling birds and chickens [4-6]. Multiple studies suggested that the origin of novel H7N9 virus in humans can be traced to live-poultry markets, where most H7N9-infected patients had direct contact [4, 7]. As of December 3, 2014, 458 confirmed human cases and 177 deaths had been reported, with a mortality rate of 38.6%. Because of the increasing num - bers of H7N9 infections in humans, rapid development of an efficient H7N9 vaccine is necessary. Different approaches have been applied by several manufacturers to develop influ - enza A (H7N9) virus vaccines [8, 9]. Here, we evaluated the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of H7 HA DNA vaccine in a mouse model. Materials and Methods 1. Ethics This study was approved by Korea University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (KUIACUC-2014-69). 2. Immunization of mice Vector control and the synthetic H7 HA DNA vaccine were obtained from GeneOne Life Science, Inc. (Seoul, Korea) [10]. Female 6-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Orient Bio, Inc. (Seongnam, Gyeonggi province, Korea). Mice were divided into a na\u00efve (n = 7), vector control (n = 9) or DNA vac - cine group (n = 21 for 25 or 50 g, respectively) for a total of three vaccinations and immunized as described previously [10]. Briefly, mice were immunized with the vector control (50 g) or H7 HA DNA vaccine (25 or 50 g) by intramuscular in - jection followed by electroporation using a CELLECTRA\u00ae adaptive constant current electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., Blue Bell, PA, USA). Two 0.1-A constant current square-wave pulses were delivered through a triangu - lar 3-electrode array consisting of 26-gauge solid stainless steel electrodes. Each pulse was 52 ms in length, with a 1-s de - lay between pulses. Mice were immunized at one to three doses, two weeks apart. Na\u00efve mice without immunizations were used as a negative control. Blood and spleen samples were collected two weeks after the last immunization (Fig. 1). 3. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and analysis Sera samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) (1:3 ratio) at 37\u00b0C for 18-20 h and then heated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate the recep - tor-destroying enzyme. Sera were diluted with phosphate-buff - bring the final dilution to 1:10. Two-fold di - lution was microplates. Four hemagglutinin units of H7N9 reassortant influenza virus (HA and NA from A/Anhui/01/2013; other 6 segments from A/ Puerto Rico/8/1934) were added to each well and the se - rum-virus mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. Following incubation, 50 L of 1% horse red blood cells (10% red blood cell diluted with saline solution 1:9, Innovative Research, Inc., Novi, MI, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h 30 min at room temperature. Anti-HA antibody titers below the detection limit (<1:10) were assigned a value of 1:5. Using HI data, we calculated the seroconversion rate and seropro - tection rate. Seroconversion corresponds to a negative pre-vaccination serum conversion to an HI titer >1:40 or sig - nificant increase in HI antibody titer. Seroprotection was de - fined as the proportion of vaccinated individuals achieving an HI titer of >1:40. Figure 1. Schema of the study design. imm, immunization. scribed previously [10]. Briefly, mice splenocytes were isolat - ed spleens using a 70-mm nylon cell strainer (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated in media containing 10 ng/mL interleukin-2 for 48 h. Cells were plated in 96-well multiscreen filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) coated with purified rat anti-mouse IFN- capture anti - body (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) in triplicate at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well and stimulated by H7 HA peptides (GeneOne Life Science, Inc., Seoul, Korea) for 16 h. Biotin rat anti-mouse IFN- (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used as the detection antibody. Color development was performed ac - cording to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISPOT Blue Color Module, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The number of spots on the plates was counted using an automat - ed ELISPOT reader system (CTL Analyzer, Cellular Technolo - gy, Cleveland, OH, USA). 5. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test and Student's t test was ap - plied to compare continuous variables. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results 1. H7 HA DNA vaccine induced antibody production against H7N9 reassortant influenza virus in mice Mice were immunized with vector control (50 g) or H7 HA DNA vaccine (25 or 50 g). After the first immunization with H7 HA DNA vaccine, the HI titers of all immunized mice were <40 (Fig. 2A and B). However, HI titers were greater than 40 af - ter the second and third immunizations. Both the seroprotec - tion and seroconversion rates were 100% in mice immunized with 25 or 50 g DNA vaccine two and three times. After sec - ondary immunization with H7 HA vaccine, the mean of geo - metric mean titer (GMT) was 79.98 (25 g H7 HA) and 107.65 (50 g H7 HA) (Fig. 2C and D). The GMTs after three doses of H7 HA vaccine were 159.96 in the 25 g group and 215.28 in the 50 g group ( P = 0.18). 2. H7 HA DNA vaccine induced IFN- production in mouse splenocytes stimulated with H7 HA peptides Mice immunized with H7 HA DNA vaccine showed a signif -icant increase in IFN- production by splenocytes in response to stimulation with H7 HA peptides compared to the na\u00efve and vector-immunized groups (Fig. 3). Two immunizations with H7 HA DNA vaccine induced significant increases in spot-forming units (SFUs) in both the 25 g (234 \u00b1 66 SFU/106 splenocytes) and 50 g (255 \u00b1 91 SFU/106 splenocytes) vacci - nation groups; this enhancement was proportional to the in - creased number of immunization doses. In mice with three immunizations, 50 g H7 HA DNA vaccination (357 \u00b1 39 SFU/106 splenocytes) enhanced IFN- production compared to 25 g vaccination (275 \u00b1 30 SFU/106 splenocytes, P = 0.0021, 50 g vs. 25 g vaccinations). Discussion DNA vaccination is considered a novel next-generation vac - cine, which is achieved by the application of genetically engi - neered DNA to induce immunogenicity. DNA vaccines offer a variety of advantages, including the induction of broad cellu - lar and humoral immune responses and rapid large-scale pro - duction [11, 12]. However, they also have some limitations, such as low efficiency in immunogenicity in large animals and humans [13]. To overcome the limitations of DNA vaccine, re - searchers have developed new delivery systems, including electroporation [14]. For example, the efficacy of hepatitis B surface antigen and human immunodeficiency virus gag DNA vaccine was shown to be greatly enhanced by an electropora - tion delivery method in vivo [15]. Moreover, when challenged with H1N1 influenza virus, mice immunized with DNA vac - cine via electroporation recovered faster than mice immu - nized without electroporation [16]. Several reports have described DNA vaccines against veteri - nary and human influenza developed through animal testing and clinical trials. Immunization with the H5 HA DNA vaccine in chickens led to enhanced antibody responses and protec - tion against avian influenza virus challenge [17]. Moreover, mice immunized with chitosan nanoparticles containing a swine influenza DNA vaccine showed humoral and cellular immunity [18], and influenza A DNA vaccine delivered via electroporation provided full protection against H1N1 chal - lenge in a mouse model [16]. Our data demonstrate that the DNA vaccine against influenza virus induces humoral and cellular immune responses in mouse models. In a previous study, a synthetic DNA vaccine elicited protec - tive immunity against H7N9 influenza viruses in mouse mod - els [10]. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of Choi EJ, et al. Immunogenicity of H7 HA DNA vaccine www.icjournal.org 120 this DNA vaccine against influenza A (H7N9) virus in detail, including two different doses of DNA vaccine and three re - peated numbers of immunizations. Consistent with the previ - ous report, DNA vaccination followed by electroporation effi - ciently induced antibody production and the IFN- response against the immunogen. However, when 25 g DNA vaccine was injected, the induction of cellular immune responses in our study was lower than that in the previous study [10]. This difference may be related to differences in mouse strains, in - tervals between immunizations, and time of sacrifice of mice after immunization. Overall, our results confirmed and sup - ported the efficacy of the H7 HA DNA vaccine in inducing im - munogenicity against H7 HA peptides in mice.Since human infections of influenza A (H7N9) virus were reported in March 2013, new cases of human infection have occurred. Various vaccines targeting influenza A (H7N9) virus have been developed in many countries. A phase 1 study showed that a recombinant virus-like particle influenza A (H7N9) vaccine administered with an adjuvant enhanced the antibody response [8]. A cell culture-derived MF59-adjuvant - ed pandemic A (H7N9) vaccine was shown to be immuno - genic and safe in adults [9]. In addition to the development of these vaccines, our study suggests that the H7 HA DNA vac - cine is also an effective tool for rapidly controlling emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potential. In this study, we found that the H7 HA DNA vaccine confers Figure 2. Induction of HA-specific humoral immune responses in mice immunized with H7 HA DNA vaccine.

In the absence of an available vaccine against H7N9, our results suggest the potential for dealing with rapid muta - tions in influenza viruses including H7N9, although further studies are required, including clinical trials in humans.
