Pollution related effects on immune function and stress in a free-living population of 405 /C1/412. We investigated whether exposure to heavy metal pollution affected the immune function of individuals in a free living population of a small insectivorous passerine bird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca humoral immune responses in two study areas: a polluted area in the vicinity of a copper smelter and a control area far from the smelter. Plasma corticosterone level and blood heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) were used as more general physiological measures of stress. The immuneresponse of F. hypoleuca was not suppressed by pollution stress. In contrast, we found that F. hypoleuca males showed stronger humoral immune responses to a novel antigen (tetanus toxoid) in the polluted environment than in the unpolluted one. After theimmunization of males, numbers of lymphocytes rose significantly more in the polluted area, leading to a smaller H/L ratio than in males from the control area. Females showed no pollution related effects on their immune responses. Corticosterone levels of males and nestlings were not related to pollution levels. Nestlings showed somewhat higher H/L ratios and lower fledging success in the polluted area, both factorsindicating increased stress levels in a polluted area. Our results suggest that humoral immune response of male F. hypoleuca may be enhanced under moderate levels of heavy metal pollution. Enhanced immune function may, however, also be costly forbirds and the higher humoral immune responses in polluted areas may thus have negative effects on the birds' breeding performance and survival.

Various chemicals can affect the functional activities of the vertebrate immune system (Wong et al. 1992, Trust et al. 1994, Krzystyniak et al. 1995). Manyenvironmental contaminants, like heavy metals andorganochlorine insecticides are known to change im-mune functions (Melancon 2003). For example, someheavy metals may have detrimental effects on theimmune system at doses where other toxicologicalchanges are not evident (Wong et al. 1992, Liu et al.1999). Moreover, chemically induced immunosuppres-sion may increase the susceptibility of an individual toviral, bacterial and parasitic infections (e.g. Morahanet al. 1984). Environmental pollution could thus have harmful effects on animals even at relatively low doses in the target population (e.g. Smits et al. 1999). Information on pollution induced changes in immune functions mainly derives from laboratory studies,whereas relatively little is known about its significancein free-living animal populations. In addition to possibletoxic effects, wild bird populations are susceptible tovarious indirect effects of pollution, such as reducedquality or quantity of food, or habitat changes (Eeva et al. 1997). The complex combination of direct and indirect effects of air pollution can only be measured in # JOURNAL OF A VIAN BIOLOGYJOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY 36: 405 /C1/412, 2005 JOURNAL OF A VIAN BIOLOGY 36:5 (2005) 405free-living populations. Therefore, we compared the immune function between two populations of a smallinsectivorous passerine bird, the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca : one population inhabiting an area polluted with heavy metals (near a copper smelter) and anotherpopulation living in an unpolluted area. To evaluate the effects of pollution on humoral immune responses of F. hypoleuca males and females, we measured their primary antibody response to animmunization with human diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (Ilmonen et al. 2000). To control for the possible effects of immunization procedure itself on stress and breedingperformance, an additional group of females was given saline. We also recorded birds' stress hormone (corticos- terone) levels and leucocyte profiles to estimate theirphysiological stress. Various stress situations (e.g. fooddeprivation and environmental pollutants) are known to elevate plasma glucocorticoid levels (Assenmacher 1973, Brown 1993, Kishikawa et al. 1997). Because corticos-terone levels may show short-term variation due to acute stressors, we used heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio as an indicator of longer-term physiological stress. Highvalues of H/L ratio are found to indicate stress in birds (Gross and Siegel 1983, Maxwell 1993, Ho rak et al. 2002). Methods Study area and experimental design The study was conducted in the surroundings of thetown Harjavalta (61 820?N, 22810?E), SW Finland in 1998 and 1999. The main source of local air pollutants is a factory complex producing copper, nickel and fertilizers in the centre of the town. Sulphuric oxides and heavymetals (especially Cu, Zn, Ni, Pb and As) are common pollutants in the area (Kubin 1990, Jussila and Jorma- lainen 1991). Thirteen study sites, each with 40 /C1 /50 nest- boxes, were established along the air pollution gradientin three main directions (SW , SE and NW) away from the copper smelter complex. Special attention was paid in selecting study plots so that they would represent asimilar forest type, i.e. relatively barren pine dominated forests typical of the study area. Elevated heavy metal concentrations occur in soil, vegetation, insects andbirds in the polluted area due to current and historical deposition, and metal contents decrease exponentially with increasing distance from the smelter (e.g. Jussilaand Jormalainen 1991, Koricheva and Haukioja 1995, Eeva and Lehikoinen 1996, Derome and Nieminen 1998). For example, increased concentrations of Pbhave been measured in faeces and bone tissue ofF. hypoleuca nestlings (Eeva and Lehikoinen 1996, 2000). F. hypoleuca breeding in the vicinity ( B /2 km) of the smelter exhibit low breeding success (Eeva et al.1997), and they have reduced survival rates (Eeva andLehikoinen 1998) compared to birds breeding in the non-polluted area. The five sites within 2 km of thecopper smelter were thus considered polluted (hereafter 'polluted area'), and eight sites more than 2 km from the smelter were considered to be unpolluted (hereafter'control area'). The experimental nests were chosen so that treatments (pollution vs. control) were randomly assigned to parents with the same laying date and clutch-size. To ensure thatthe quality of birds and situation at the start of the experiments would be as similar as possible in all groups, we selected nests (n /C30 /68 in 1998, n /C30/35 in 1999) with similar clutch-sizes (5 /C1/7 in 1998 and 6 /C1/7 in 1999) for our experiment. Nests were then visited to determine the hatching date, and number of hatched and fledgedyoung. Because it was not always possible to measureall parameters in every nest and some nests were depredated during the experiment (7 in 1998, 1 in 1999) sample sizes vary among the experimental groupsand analyses. At the ages of 7 /C1 /8 days (in 1998) and 11/C1/12 days (in 1999), the nestlings were weighed to the nearest 0.1 g with a spring balance. Immunization, saline treatment and blood sampling We performed three separate experiments: 1. femaleimmunization, 2. male immunization, and 3. femalesaline injection. Females (1998, n /C30 /15pollution/C27/15control ) were captured and immunized 5 days before the hatching day and males (1999, n /C30/17pollution/C27/18control ) were immunized when their chicks were 2 days old. Thebirds were immunized by intramuscular injection of 100:l of diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (Finnish National Public Health Institute; diphtheria 38 Lf and tetanus10 Lf, mixed with the adjuvant aluminiumphosphate 1.0 mg/ml) in the pectoral muscle. To control for the possible effects of immunization procedure itself weinjected females (1998, n /C30 /15pollution/C27/15control ) with similar laying dates as in immunized birds with 100:l of saline. Blood samples were taken prior to injection (120/C1/150ml in heparinized capillary tubes by brachial venipuncture). Females were sampled again 12 /C1/13 days after the injection (when chicks were ca. 7 days old) andmales 9 /C1 /10 days after the injection (when chicks were ca. 11 days old), for measuring the activation of their humoral immune system. Blood was transferred intoEppendorf tubes containing 3 ml heparin. Tubes were immediately stored in an ice-box and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 8 min within 3 hours of sampling. The plasma ofmales was further divided into separate samples forantibody and corticosterone analyses. Blood from females was not analysed for corticosterone. Males were sampled 10.2 9 /0.97 minutes after capture and sampling time did not differ among the experimental 406 JOURNAL OF A VIAN BIOLOGY 36:5 (2005)groups (ANOV A, F 1,24/C30/0.35, P /C30/0.56). Plasma was extracted and stored at /C28/208C until used for ELISA- analysis (females) or at /C28/1958C until used for ELISA and corticosterone analysis (males). For both sexes, a drop of blood was further used to make smear samplesfor leukocyte profiles. When nestlings were 11 /C1 /12 days old (in 1999) we chose randomly two nestlings from each experimental nest (n /C30/34). Blood samples (80 /C1/100ml by brachial venipuncture) were taken from two nestlings for assess- ment of leukocyte profiles and circulating corticosterone levels. The first handled nestling was bled on average3.69 /0.28 min and the second nestling 6.0 9/0.38 min after removal from the nest. Blood sampling times did not differ among the experimental groups (ANOV A;F 1,33/C30/3.2, P/C30/0.09 and F 1,33/C30/1.69, P /C30/0.20, respec- A drop of blood was used to make smear samples for leukocyte profiles. ELISA assay We measured humoral immune response as the antigen- specific antibody levels in plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) previously developed for red-winged blackbirds (for details of methods, see Hasselquist et al. 1999, 2001, Ilmonenet al. 2000). This assay has proved to work well also forall other passerines in which it has been tried (e.g. blue tits ELISA method provides a sensitive measure of the amount of passerineantibodies (in millioptical densities [mOD]/min) that specifically bind to a certain antigen (here diphtheria or tetanus toxoid). The interassay variation was 10.7%.As a measure of antibody responses to tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid we used the difference between pre- and post-immunization antibody titres. The meanpre-immunization titres in the were air-dried, fixed in absolute metha- nol and stained with azure-eosin. The proportion ofdifferent types of leukocytes was assessed by examining atotal of 100 leukocytes under /C29 /1000 magnification. Total white blood cell counts (WBC) were estimated by counting the number of leukocytes per approximately10 000 erythrocytes (see Ots et al. 1998 for the details ofthe method). Differential leucocyte counts for hetero- phils and lymphocytes obtained by multiplyingtheir proportions with WBC. Heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) was used as a measure of longer-term physiological stress (i.e. lasting from several days toweeks) levels of males and nestlings. Ho rak et al. (2002) found a significant individual consistency in H/L ratio within 4-month period. Leukocyte counts obtained by using the same method are also found to be highlyrepeatable (Ots et al. 1998). The investigator examining blood samples was unaware of the phenotypic values and treatments of the birds. Measurement of corticosterone levels The male and nestling plasma levels of corticosterone were measured using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Biotrak rat corticosterone [125I], Amersham, England). Since corticosterone levels tended to increase with increasing handling time (see also Silverin and Wingfield 1998) all values were corrected to correspond to thevalue of an average handling time (males: n /C30 min; nestlings: n /C30/68,\u00afx/C30/4.19/0.28 adding residuals from linear regression to the predictedvalues for average handling times. Statistics Differences in humoral immune responses, H/L ratiosand corticosterone levels between study areas werecompared with one-way ANOV As. Because nestlings were slightly heavier in a polluted area in 1999, we controlled for the effect of body mass on H/L ratio byusing mean body mass as covariate. Fledging success (a probability of a hatchling to fledge) was analysed by using generalized linear models (GENMOD procedureof SAS, type 3 analysis with binomial probabilitydistribution and logit link function). As a binomial response variable we used the proportion: fledglings/ hatchlings. The area (polluted vs. unpolluted) was usedas the explanatory variable. Depredated and destroyed nests were omitted from the analyses of fledging success. Normality of residuals was tested for each parametrictest with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (UNIV ARIATE procedure in SAS). Results Female humoral immune responsiveness was not sig- nificantly affected by pollution stress (Table 1). Instead,the mean male humoral immune responsiveness against tetanus toxoid was 3.5 times higher in the polluted than in the control area (Fig. 1), whereas the difference wasnot significant for diphtheria (Table 1). Note, however, JOURNAL OF A VIAN BIOLOGY 36:5 (2005) 407that the means were higher in the polluted area for all measures of humoral immune responses but since variation was relatively high in our samples the power of these analyses is low. Immunized females showed a clear increase in their diphtheria and tetanus antibodylevels, whereas among the saline-injected control females antibody levels remained at low, close to initial levels (ANOV A, treatment vs. control; tetanus: F The number of nestlings at the time of blood sampling did not correlate with antibody levels either in males (tetanus: n P /C30/0.74; ratios of nestlings were higher in the polluted area than in the unpolluted area (Table 2). In both areas their H/L ratio was significantly and negatively related to the mean body mass (Table 2). No difference was found in female H/L ratios between polluted and unpolluted areas whereas immunized males showed smaller H/Lratio in the polluted area (Table 2). In both sexes, H/L ratios increased significantly after the immunization(female: F 1,47/C30/6.87, P /C30/0.012; male: F (female: F1,50/C30/1.02, P /C30/0.32). The increase in H/L ratio of males in the polluted area was smaller than that of males in the control area (area /C29/time interaction: F 1,37/C30/6.45, P/C30/0.016), because the increase in heterophil count was similar in both groups (F 1,19/C30/0.13, P /C30/0.72) but lymphocyte numbers increased more in birds from polluted than from control area (F 1,19/C30/6.26, P/C30/0.022). No significant pollution related temporal change was observed in females (area /C29/time interaction: F1,47/C30/3.07, P /C30/0.087). Neither males nor nestlings showed any differences in their corticosterone levels between the two areas(Table 2). The two measures of stress, corticosterone level and H/L ratio, were not P /C30/0.77). Five days before hatch, females were, on average, 0.7 g heavier in the polluted than in control area, but there were no significant differences between areas in female body mass during the nestling period (Table 3). At theage of 11 days, nestlings were 0.7 g heavier in the polluted area in 1999, but not in 1998 (Table 3). Furthermore, nestlings were 0.5 g heavier in saline-treated nests than in those nests where females were immunized with diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (ANCOV A, laying date as covariate: treatment F 1,44/C30/4.62, P/C30/0.037). There were no differences in male body mass between the polluted and control area (Table 3). In both years, fledging success (a probability of a hatchling to fledge) in untreated nests was lower in the polluted than in unpolluted area (Table 4). This was alsothe case for the saline and immunization treatments, although in 1999 the difference was only marginally significant (Table 4). There was a strong negativeassociation between H/L ratio of nestlings and fledging success (n /C30 /24,x2/C30/10.5, P /C30/0.001), i.e. nestlings in the unsuccessful nests had higher H/L ratios than thosein successful nests. In contrast, no association was found between mean corticosterone levels of nestlingsTable 1.

Discussion Our data suggest that humoral immune response of F. hypoleuca was not suppressed by pollution stress in our study area. In contrast, F. hypoleuca males showed stronger humoral immune responses to a novel antigenin the polluted environment when compared to the unpolluted one. Moreover, this was also reflected in a greater increase in male lymphocyte numbers (andsmaller H/L ratio) after immunization in the polluted area, which is in agreement with general immunological principles, as many specific immune responses areprimarily based on lymphocyte activation and prolifera-tion. Because of the relationship between immuneresponse and lymphocyte numbers in the immunized males, it is difficult to estimate how the H/L ratio reflects stress after immunization. There were no significant differences in stress hor- mone (corticosterone) levels of F. hypoleuca males or nestlings between polluted and unpolluted sites. Simi- larly, another study in the same area showed that corticosterone levels of great tit Parus major females and nestlings were not increased in the polluted environ-ment (Eeva et al. 2003). In agreement with our results,Wayland et al. (2003) found no relationship betweencorticosterone levels and Hg or Cd levels in commoneider Somateria mollissima females, even though their body mass was affected. It is possible that long-termstress results in the adjustment of the corticosteroneproduction pathway such that any possible initialdifferences disappear. Thus, either corticosterone cannot be used to assess stress caused by long-term metalTable 2.

JOURNAL OF A VIAN BIOLOGY 36:5 (2005) 409exposure or the exposure has been too low to cause hormonal stress responses. On the contrary, the H/Lratio, a more general measure of physiological stress wassignificantly higher in nestlings from the polluted area.In agreement with earlier studies (Gross and Siegel 1983,Maxwell 1993, Ho rak et al. 1998, Moreno et al. 2002) H/L ratio was increased in lighter nestlings and in broods with low fledging success. An earlier study in the same study area showed lowered invertebrate foodavailability at polluted sites (Eeva et al. 1997) and it ispossible that differences in H/L ratio are caused bydifferences in food abundance or food quality. Alterna-tively, activated detoxication of nonessential metalsmight lead to increased stress response. Blanco et al.(2004) found H/L ratio increased in Cd-exposedblack Milvus migrans nestlings. They suggested that participation of metallothioneins in detoxification and metal regulation may have indirectly enhanced the stress response to contaminants. In our study area the activityof one of the detoxication enzymes, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) has been found to be increased inF. hypoleuca nestlings (Eeva et al. 2000). Why did F. hypoleuca males living in a polluted area show a stronger humoral immune response, althoughheavy metals are generally considered to be immuno- suppressive (Wong et al. 1992, Bernier and Brousseau 1995)? It is known that immune responsiveness can betraded off against brood-rearing effort (e.g. Deerenberget al. 1997, Cichon et al. 2001, Ardia et al. 2003, Lozanoand Lank 2003, Pap and Ma \u00b4rkus 2003, Soler et al. 2003). One possibility is that males in the polluted area put lesseffort in brood-rearing than their counterparts in theunpolluted area, thus allowing them to invest more inimmune defence. However, this hypothesis is not sup-ported by our data because brood size did not correlate with male antibody levels and in 1999 nestlings actually were slightly heavier in the polluted area. Furthermore,male feeding rates seem not to differ between the studyareas (T. Eeva unpubl. data from years 2000 and 2002).Alternatively, moderate heavy metal exposure may haveincreased antibody levels in males. In Pb-treated mice,low doses enhanced the immune response, medium dosesdid not have any effect and high doses resulted inimmunosuppression (Lawrence 1981). Also in Japanese quail Coturnix coturnix Pb was observed to suppress antibody-mediated immunity only at dosages that alsocaused clinical Pb poisoning (Grasman and Scanlon1995). Since Pb is one of the main pollutants in the study area, Pb concentrations were measured in 1996 from the femurs of F. hypoleuca nestlings (Eeva et al. 2000). The average Pb concentrations were 7.3 mg/g, d.w. (moderate) and 0.6:g/g, d.w. (low) in nestlings from the polluted andunpolluted areas, respectively. Enhanced immune re-sponse of F. hypoleuca males might thus be explained by moderate levels of exposure in our study. This explana- tion is also supported by the observation that males breeding very close ( B /1 km) to the smelter, and being most exposed to heavy metals, did not seem to showhigher responses than those breeding slightly farther(1/C1 /2 km) away (Fig. 1). Female responses to a novel antigen did not differ significantly between the polluted and the unpolluted area, although the means were generally higher in thepolluted area. Since the variation in our data was highmaking the power of tests low we cannot finally rule outthe possibility of pollution related effects also in females.On the other hand, gender differences in immunotoxicityof heavy metals and PCBs have been found in some studies. After early exposure to lead, male chickens produced more antibodies while such exposure did notmarkedly alter female antibody levels (Bunn et al. 2000).PCB-exposed female American kestrels Falco spar verius showed increased antibody response while exposedmales showed decreased production (Smits andBortolotti 2001). It should also be recalled that our data sets for females and males were collected in different years. So, it is possible that different conditions(e.g. in weather or food availability) during breeding intwo years would produce different natural stress levelsand different outcomes in responses. Clearly, the immunization itself (i.e. the effect of antigens, adjuvant or both) was stressful for females,since their H/L ratio increased by about 47% after thetreatment whereas no change was observed in saline-treated birds. Furthermore, nestlings in saline-treatednests were heavier than those in nests where females wereTable 4.

This is in agreement with previous studies onF. hypoleuca (Ilmonen et al. 2000) and blue tits (Raberg et al. 2000), where females injected with diphtheria-tetanus vaccine decreased their feeding rates and had nestlings of lower body mass than controlfemales injected with saline. Our study shows that F. hypoleuca males living in a polluted area have activated, rather than suppressed, humoral immune response. High immune responsivenessmay, however, be costly for birds in the long run. Keeping up enhanced immune response may cause trade-offs in some other life-history traits (Lochmillerand Deerenberg 2000, Ilmonen 2001). It is possible that the higher humoral immune response in some males in the polluted areas reflects a hyper-activated immunesystem (Ra berg et al. 1998), which, in turn, may affect negatively on birds' breeding performance (Ilmonen et al. 2000) or survival (Hanssen et al. 2004). Further- more, activated immune responsiveness may potentiallyincrease the susceptibility of birds to other environmen- tal stressors. The relationships between heavy metal detoxification and immune response clearly call forfurther their assistance.
