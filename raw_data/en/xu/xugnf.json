[Should people with cancer get the coronavirus vaccine?] Public health experts and cancer specialists have agreed that people living with cancer should receive the vaccine. The covid vaccines that are available can be given to people who are having cancer treatment. Covid vaccines are not live vaccines, they cannot harm you when your immunity is reduced. Vaccines save lives and reduce the need for hospital stays from covid. Vaccines can be given before, during or after cancer treatment. If you are due to start cancer treatment or have cancer surgery your medical team may recommend that you have vaccinations before treatment begins. Having vaccinations before treatment gives a better chance of protection.
