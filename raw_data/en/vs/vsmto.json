Chiropractic care is: Patient-centered, Non-invasive, and Hands-on Chiropractic care is focused on your spine, muscles, joints, and nervous system and uses the best available evidence and clinical expertise to diagnose issues that affect your body's movement. Chiropractors treat them without medication or surgery and prevent them from returning. Chiropractic care can also promote health and improve your quality of life, as well as alleviate pain. Who is a Chiropractor? Doctors of chiropractic, called 'chiropractors' are the spine, muscle, joint and nervous system, experts. Every chiropractor receives at least six to seven years of post-secondary academic and clinical education. They are trained in how to evaluate, diagnose, recommend, and deliver a treatment plan that manages issues within these systems, according to your preferences. A chiropractor's education also includes courses in radiology, pain management, prescribed exercise, and rehabilitation. Each chiropractor is uniquely qualified to evaluate your condition and identify what's causing your pain. Based on the best available evidence, combined with their clinical expertise, your chiropractor will then work with you to determine the best treatment to relieve your pain. They will also help prevent it from returning and restore your mobility. And in Ontario, you can visit a chiropractor without a referral from a doctor or other health care professional.

You may want to visit a chiropractor at various times throughout your life. A chiropractor can alleviate long-term or sporadic pain, promote health and help you live your best life. Whether we're at home, work or out and about, daily living puts strain on our bodies. As a result, you may suffer from persistent headaches, migraines, back, neck or joint pain.

Taking pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications may temporarily alleviate your symptoms but may not address the underlying cause. They may also create new health challenges. Consider visiting a chiropractor instead. Using primarily their hands, your chiropractor will treat these issues without medication or surgery and help prevent them from returning.
