New Orleans, La. - Nearly 99 percent of Ochsner Health employees in Louisiana and Mississippi have come into compliance with the hospital system's vaccination policy. Ochsner joins many of the nation's leading institutions in taking this important step to protect patients, healthcare workers and our community. \"At Ochsner Health, we remain committed to prioritizing safety and minimizing risk for our co-workers, families and loved ones, and our actions during the COVID-19 pandemic reflect this promise. That's why we are proud to announce that nearly 99 percent of Ochsner employees have come into compliance with our vaccination policy - an action that speaks to our team's dedication and care to those we serve every day. We are truly grateful to our healthcare heroes and community members who continue to fight COVID-19,\" said Warner Thomas, President and CEO, Ochsner Health. Today, nearly 30,000 employees have completed their COVID-19 vaccine series or have an approved medical or religious exemption. Team members with approved exemptions will undergo weekly COVID-19 testing and wear KN95 masks for added protection. As is the case with other health systems around the country, a small number of Ochsner employees who chose not to get vaccinated or request a medical or religious exemption - approximately 280 employees out of nearly 30,000 - will leave the organization. Of those leaving the organization, approximately 180 are PRN employees, working on an as-needed basis. Ochsner appreciates their dedication to their communities and service to the organization. Former employees in good standing will be eligible for rehire once they become compliant with this policy. While the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-issues-emergency-regulation-requiring-covid-19-vaccination-health-care) requiring COVID-19 vaccination for healthcare workers has recently been challenged, as a private employer, Ochsner Health retains the right to enact policies that protect patients and staff. Our COVID-19 vaccination policy is in line with similar policies enacted by leading health systems and employers across the country. Ochsner Health supports continued efforts to provide accurate information about the vaccine and COVID-19 for its employees and the community at-large.

The current compliance rate with Ochsner's COVID-19 vaccine policy does not include employees in Shreveport and Monroe due to pending litigation. The Louisiana Supreme Court is set to hear the matter on December 7. ### About Ochsner Health Ochsner Health is a system that delivers health to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi and the Gulf South with a mission to Serve, Heal, Lead, Educate and Innovate.
