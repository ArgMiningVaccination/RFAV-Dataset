As a result, man-made synthetic compounds with known toxicity and known carcinogenicity are flooding into our environment and are being stored in our bodies at an alarming rate! This toxic accumulation has unknown and potentially disastrous effects on the human body since these chemicals are known to be unsafe, and because toxic chemicals also have synergistic toxic effects which means the toxins combine with each other in the body to produce greatly multiplied and unknown toxic effects far greater in force than would be expected by merely the sum of the individual chemicals themselves. The chemical pollutants of greatest concerns to human health are the toxic heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium, aluminum, arsenic, etc), industrial organic solvents, and industrial bio-toxins (pesticides). The primary mechanism by which these chemicals lead to toxicity is through neurotoxicity, immune system toxicity, and through hormone mimicking, although virtually every system of the body can be affected. Numerous studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, the NIH and the EPA since 1976 consistently show that large amounts of dangerous chemicals are stored in the bodies of nearly every individual that has ever been studied! We are medical practitioners who are very concerned about the effects that toxic environmental exposure may have on the body. As such, at Hawaii Whole Person Healing, we have developed a series of Medically Supervised Detoxification Programs in order to assist the body's detoxification. These programs increase your body's own innate ability to remove harmful toxic impurities using state of the art nutritional, diet, lifestyle and Integrative Medicine approaches, specifically designed to enhance all Phases of detoxification. We start with a modified Comprehensive Assessment to understand your unique biochemical makeup and to identify strengths and weaknesses in your biochemical detoxification system. For our detoxification protocol, the initial assessment includes a screening for heavy metal and toxin exposure, and appropriate testing to determine the amount of toxins stored in the body. Our Detoxification protocols are medically supervised, non invasive, all natural, and scientifically proven to rid the body of toxic impurities. It is appropriate for those needing expert advice in detoxification, or for those whose \"cleansing\" efforts have been complicated by persistent symptoms or chronic disease. By removing the toxic effects of these substances, we allow the body to regain its own innate ability to heal. Medical detoxification has an immense potential to assist patients in the recovery from a diverse range of symptoms and diagnoses, especially stubborn and persistent complaints that have not responded well to other methods. Chronic Fatigue Multiple Chemical Sensitive Disorder Fibromyalgia Rheumatoid Disorders Immune System Disorders Metabolic Syndrome Diabetes Hypertension Allergic Disorders Vascular Disease Stroke Coronary Artery Disease (Heart Attack) Peripheral Vascular Disease Asthma Hormone Disorders Chronic Infections Candida albicans infections Chronic viral infections Chronic bacterial infections Chronic parasite infections This partial list of diagnoses is by no means an exhaustive categorization of all the benefits of detoxification therapy! If you feel drawn to medical detoxification therapy as a modality that may work for you, please familiarize yourself with our medically supervised detoxification programs and schedule an appointment for a physician consultation.
