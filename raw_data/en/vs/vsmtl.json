Artigo [vaccination]of registration [track]each [vaccine]from [production]to [vaccination], as well as the vaccinators. It is easy to cause the lack and omission of registration information, and is not conducive to analyze the data of large-scale [vaccine]and [vaccination]. Therefore, this using SpringBoot and Mybatis-Plus framework. It designs and realizes the whole-process management system of novel [coronavirus] management, to [vaccination]and and then to the forum management of vaccinators. The system aims to achieve \"whole-process, traceable\" management [goal]of [vaccines]. The system is feasible and practical, which can alleviate the problem of manual recording and collation of [medical staff]in [vaccine]management, and [vaccination]platform for [medical staff]and vaccinators. In addition, the system can collect the data on the whole process of [vaccines]and provide strong data support for scientific [research] [work].
