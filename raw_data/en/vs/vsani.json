New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office issued cease and desist letters to seven companies it says are making such bogus claims. \"Botanical-based products, non-registered EPA repellents are really, probably the most popular, and they have been shown to have little or no effect on mosquitoes,\" Schneiderman said. \"But that has not stopped some scammers from taking advantage of the understandable public concern, in some cases a little panic about this.\" The bogus products include ultrasonic devices that supposedly repel mosquitoes by emitting a high frequency buzz. The attorney general's office says \"numerous scientific studies have found that ultrasonic devices do not repel mosquitoes, and may even attract mosquitoes.\" Other ineffective products include wrist bands, bracelets, patches and stickers with botanical ingredients like cedar, soy and lemongrass touted as repellents. The products contain none of the active ingredients recommended by the government, Schneiderman said. The mosquito species that carries Zika is not found in New York, but a closely related species is in the city. The city Health Department says the possibility of a mosquito transmitting the virus here is \"remote,\" but it taking no chances. stepping up its mosquito control programs. As part of that effort, the department will spray parts of Staten Island and the Bronx on Thursday night to reduce the mosquito population. "}
