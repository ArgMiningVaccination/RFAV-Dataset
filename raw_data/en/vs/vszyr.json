At itsannual representative meeting in London on 27 June delegateswelcomed the conclusion of the 3-4 March BMA consensusconference 1,2to reject moves to change the law on physician assisted suicide, but rejected calls for this to be 'the settled opinion of theBMA for the forseeable future'. Michael Wilks, BMA ethics committeechairman, said that in order to 'lead the debate' the association shouldnot be 'tied to any one position'. The BMA's failure to give a clearsignal is further evidence that growing numbers of its members, notleast leading members of its ethical committee, are unsure whether itis wrong for doctors to help patients kill themselves. Medical technology and palliative care have now advanced to a level where most people in this country are able to die comfortably. However, on rare occasions, patients' fears about distressing symptoms and loss of dignity or control over death can prompt them torequest help in committing suicide. These fears may be potentiated bydepression or a false sense of worthlessness and are often heightenedby anxiety about overzealous and inappropriate medical intervention. As well as treating physical and psychosocial symptoms, doctors have a duty not to administer intrusive medical treatment when the burdenof that treatment outweighs its therapeutic benefit. Neither should theygive treatment forcibly to competent patients who refuse it, even if thattreatment is life-saving. However, while upholding respect for patient autonomy, doctors must never intentionally give their patients advice or the means to commitsuicide, either directly or indirectly. Any law allowing physician assistedsuicide would threaten the trust necessary for the doctor-patientrelationship to function, place pressure on patients (whether real orimagined) to request early death, and introduce a slippery slope tovoluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Such legislation would also beimpossible to police, might well undermine the development ofpalliative care services and could lead to patients being pressured torequest suicide for economic reasons by family, carers or society at large. Human beings are made in the image of God, 3and belong to God.4 Only God has the right to take life - and the taking of innocent humanlife (even if the life is 'one's own') is always wrong regardless of thewishes, circumstances or motivations of those involved. 5In the same spirit the Hippocratic Oath enjoins that doctors 'give no deadly medicine toanyone if asked, nor suggest such counsel'. Despite the many changes inmedicine these time-honoured values must be reaffirmed by theprofession. Accordingly, whilst as doctors we have a responsibility to provide appropriate treatment, palliation and support to patients who aresuffering from distressing symptoms (whether in the context ofterminal illness or not) - we must continue to resist any change in thelaw to allow physician assisted suicide.

The BMA guidance, issued on23 June 1999, condones the withdrawal of artificial nutrition orhydration from patients who have suffered a 'serious stroke orhave severe dementia', providing a 'senior clinician' agrees. In aparliamentary debate on the Adults with Incapacity Bill, Mr Graycommented, 'To withdraw hydration and nutrition from a non-PVSpatient with the purpose of hastening death would leave amedical practitioner open to criminal prosecution. Let us be clearabout that.'1 Despite this, the BMA, at its annual representativemeeting on 27 June, has rejected a motion calling on the BMACouncil 'to reconsider those parts of the guidance document...which are incompatible with Scottish Law'. The BMA, rather thanreviewing its recommendations, seemingly prefers to have thecourts decide whether doctors, in any particular instance, havegone too far. The General Medical Council has not yet given itsopinion on the guidance. Peter Saunders 1 Scottish Parliament Justice and Home Affairs Committee, 1 March 2000 Surrogacy fiasco A lesbian couple from Hollywood have adopted twin girls in a transatlantic surrogacy fiasco involving six other adults. An Italianbusinessman and his Portuguese wife living in France hadcommissioned a British surrogate, Claire Austin, to have embryos,produced from the eggs and sperm of two strangers, implantedby a Greek doctor in Athens. On discovering that the twins weregirls the couple cancelled their order and demanded an abortion.The surrogate located the adopting parents through a gay andlesbian agency. Meanwhile Britain's first gay couple to father surrogate children are planning to have another baby. Tony Barlow and BarrieDrewitt, who spent \u00a3200,000 paying a Californian surrogate tocarry their twins, have just spent a week with another Americanwoman who has agreed to carry their next child. 1These extreme cases are a poignant reminder that God had good reasons forinstituting marriage as a life-long, heterosexual, monogamousrelationship; 2thereby providing a stable base for imparting wisdom to the next generation.3 Peter Saunders 1 Evening Standard , 8 & 31 May 2000 2 Genesis 2:243 Deuteronomy 5:6-9 TRIPLE HELIX 34 TRIPLE HELIX Editorials Educating African Doctors: Showing how it can be done It is shameful that about 45% of the people of sub-SaharanAfrica live on less than onedollar a day, a proportion thathas scarcely changed in the lasteleven years, the very periodwhen the structural adjustmentprogrammes of the World Bankand the IMF should have beenhaving some effect. The loss of skilled people from Africa continues, whether in the overseas diaspora or into more lucrative private employmentat home, so that training institutions find it hard to recruit staff andeven harder to retain them. The difficulties seem insuperable and,even worse, they are now compounded by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Is this fair? Should it be allowed to pass unchallenged? Can not something be done? If the morale of countless health care workersin sub-Saharan Africa is to be strengthened, if their vision is to beenlarged, and if their hope is to be sustained, they must be giventhe opportunity to have continuing training and a chance to developtheir skills. Then, they will be able to approach their work, not withdespair and bewilderment, but with growing confidence,resourcefulness and effectiveness. Eleven years ago a group of friends decided that we could indeed make a difference, however small: we therefore established theTropical Health and Education Trust (THET); to relieve thisdisadvantage where we could, and to strengthen training for healthcare. Our policy is to work with those who are responsible fortraining health workers, for example the Dean or the Director ofNursing, and then to plan programmes, which are specificallydesigned to strengthen local training and meet local needs, over atleast three and preferably five years. We do not prescribe what should be done: rather, we respond to needs and requests. One of the best methods has been to link anoverseas hospital or training school with a counterpart in the UnitedKingdom, and such links cover a wide range of subjects and staff.Other examples of our work include: continuing education for ruralmedical officers and support for psychiatric clinical officers inUganda, students' field work and training of ophthalmic fieldworkers in Ethiopia, training of medical officers for life savingsurgery in Ghana, a students' prize for the best project report inseven countries, and support of a course for orthopaedic clinicalofficers in Malawi. Many of these activities depend on the time and skills of short term visitors from the United Kingdom, who are often prepared touse their leave or give up holiday to share their skills and dosomething practical for those whose responsibilities are so great andyet whose opportunities are so slender. We have seen morale raised,skills strengthened and hope kindled. We're working to see more.

Every doctor in the UK is about to face unprecedented qualitycontrol under the processes in thetitle. What's going on? And howshould Christians respond?Clinical governance is aboutquality in institutions wasrecently defined 1as 'a framework through which NHS organisationsare accountable for the quality oftheir services and theenvironment in which clinical care is given' 1. Similar systems will apply to the private sector and other non-NHS institutions. Each individual doctor will have to maintain a folder, describing what they do and containing such evidence of performance aseducational activity, audit, and the views of their patients. As part ofan annual appraisal, another registered doctor will review this folder,identify problems, and make constructive remedial suggestions.Every five years there will be a more formal process of revalidation,based on these appraisals. Most will sail through but the tinyminority who are not automatically revalidated, or who refuse totake part, will be referred into the General Medical Council's fitnessto practise procedures. No revalidation - no registration. Noregistration - no work as a doctor. It sounds draconian, but the need for such an emphasis on quality was being identified long before high profile cases in the mid-1990s.Many are understandably sceptical and have concluded theseprocesses are not the whole answer to deficiencies in the NHS: 'It is allvery well to proclaim the merits of revalidation and of clinicalgovernance, but most practising clinicians have little confidence thateither of these projects, as yet unfunded and somewhat ill defined,will improve the lot of the patient, or indeed maintain confidence inthe profession'. 2For example, more resources and more improvements all round in attitudes might help. But the reality is, these changes willbe here a year from now. So how should we respond? Christians will play their full part because of respect for authority: 'Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for thereis no authority except that which God has established'. 3As with every aspect of their work, Christians should give this their best shot:'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for theLord, not for men'. 4Christians of all people should support accountability: 'man is destined to die once, and after that to facejudgment' 5and should care about the quality revealed at that ultimate audit: 'work will be shown for what it is, because the Daywill bring it to light'. 6 Let's pray about the quality of our medicine, practise as best we can, play a full part in the continuing consultations before the abovebecomes enacted in law - and let's start preparing those folders!

BMJ2000; 320:1483 (27 May) 3 Romans studentsFar from 'Philadelphia'Homosexuality TRIPLE HELIX 5In perhaps the most moving scene in the film Philadelphia , T om Hanks as Andrew Becket, a lawyer wrongfully dismissedfrom his job because he has AIDS, is in his flat discussing his case with his defencecounsel, Joe. An opera is quietly playing in thebackground. Becket, suddenly caught up bythe music, starts talking about it to Joe. It's Maria Callas singing Maddalena's aria from Giordano's Andrea Chenier in which she describes how, during the French Revolution,her mother set fire to their home in order toprevent it falling into the hands of therevolutionaries. Becket, fighting the terminalstage of Kaposi's sarcoma and in obvious pain,translates Callas' words as he circles the room,clutching his drip stand: 'The place that cradled me is burning . Do you hear the heartache in her voice? Do you feel it, Joe? I bring sorrow to those who love me.' Who could not but feel compassion for him and be moved by the bitterirony in the words he quotes? The entire film evokes our sympathy and paints a very positive picture of homosexuallife. Becket is portrayed as a kind, sensitive andhighly successful man in a loving supportiverelationship with his partner. His family adoreshim and unconditionally affirms his lifestyle.His gay friends clearly enjoy life to the full andcertainly know how to throw a great party. In contrast to this idyllic tolerance, anyone who attempts to raise awareness of the medicaldangers of gay sex is by definition in today'ssociety, a homophobic bigot. Doctors are notimmune to the stigma associated with suchstereotyping and additional tensions may resultfrom their drawing attention to the dangers ofgay life. Homosexuals do often face both prejudice and hatred in our culture and articleslike this are sometimes misused to fuel suchintolerance. That is not its intent however.Health care workers also face misunderstandingby the gay and lesbian patients for whom theycare. Yet highlighting the risks of gay sex doesnot mean doctors do not feel compassion fortheir gay patients, whom they should serve tothe highest professional standards. TheChristian doctor should always remember thatChrist died for gay and straight alike and bothdepend absolutely on his mercy andforgiveness. This said however, as teenagers and even younger children are no longer to be protectedunder the law from material promotinghomosexuality, there is a greater need thanever to heighten awareness of its risks. Arounda quarter of all 14-year-old boys are ambivalentabout their sexual orientation. Most of themwill not be homosexual as adults and they needto know about the dangers of engaging in analsexual activity. 1 Gay advocates often object that it is promiscuity and specific sexual behaviours , whether homosexual or heterosexual, thatpresent the risks. Some would even take theview that homosexual sex is actually safer sincethere is no chance of an unplanned pregnancy,but one cannot be complacent even here. Onereview cautions, 'Because lesbians oftenengage in sex with men, pregnancy preventionand diagnosis should not be overlooked'. 2 However, though the adverse consequences of heterosexual sex do of course lead to animmense medical and social burden, sexIn the light of 'Section 28', Trevor Stammers looks at the medical risks involved in gay sex Section 28 Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 ' (1) A local authority shall not - (a) intentionallypromotehomosexuality orpublish material withthe intention ofpromotinghomosexuality (b) promote the anymaintained school ofthe acceptability ofhomo-sexuality as apretended familyrelationship. (2) Nothing in subsection (1) above shall be takento prohibit the doing ofanything for the purposeof treating or preventingthe spread of TRIPLE HELIX Homosexuality between men involves particularly high specific risks. Furthermore, sexual orientationand sexual behaviours are intimately related. Itis not likely that men engaging in straight sexor lesbians in gay sex will have ano-receptiveintercourse for example. Finally, thoughpromiscuity is all too prevalent in heterosexualrelationships, the British survey on sexualattitudes and lifestyles (The Wellings Survey)nevertheless indicates that promiscuity ishigher in gay relationships. In an interviewwith The Independent , the researchers comment: 'The proportion of homosexual men reportingten or more partners within the past five yearswas 9.1% against 5.2% of heterosexual men. Ifwe eliminate those who have not had partnersfor the past five years, the contrast is evenmore marked: 23.8% of homosexual menagainst 5.3% of must be emphasised, is based on smallnumbers.' 3 The most unequivocal indicator of the higher risk posed by sex between men is thefact that those who have engaged in it, evenonly once, are not ever allowed to donate bloodin the UK. The National Blood Service advicestates, 'You must not give blood if you are aman...who has everhad sex with another man'. 4 The main reason for this prohibition is, of course, the high risk of transmission of AIDS.Sex between men was and is the major route ofHIV infection in Britain. 5A recent review on HIV prevention estimates that 'the risk ofcontracting HIV from one sexual act may bearound 1 in 1000 from penile - vaginal sex, andas much as 30 times higher for receptivepenile-anal intercourse'. 6 Gay advocates often point out that anal intercourse is not universally practised by gaymen and is used by many heterosexuals.However a recent view concludes that amongheterosexuals '10% seems a conservativeestimate of the proportion of sexually activeAmericans who engage in this behaviour withsome regularity'. 7The Wellings survey similarly found that only 13.9% of men hadever had anal sex with a woman. 8 By contrast 89.5% of men who had had genital contact withanother man had had anal intercourse.9 The incidence of anal cancer has increased in recent decades, particularly among womenin whom receptive anal intercourse particularlybefore the age of 30 has been shown to be arisk factor. 10In gay and bisexual men, however, the incidence of anal cancer now exceeds theincidence of even cervical cancer in women. 11 Anal squamous epithelial lesions werediagnosed in 36% of HIV positive and 7% ofHIV negative gay and bisexual men in onestudy. 12 Another study concludes 'a history of receptive anal intercourse was stronglyassociated with the occurrence of anal cancer(relative risk 33:1).' 13In addition to the risks of HIV and anal cancer, anal intercourse is alsoassociated with the spread of a wide variety ofother sexually transmitted infections, 14the 'gay- bowel syndrome'15and rectal incontinence.16 A further important issue is the high rate of use of drugs and alcohol in the gay communityboth to facilitate intercourse and generally toenhance sexual pleasure. Most comprehensivereviews comment on this and Chris Woods, aleading gay journalist, has commented that 'thefleeting nature and instability of many gay andlesbian relationships... mean that drugconsumption, namely the lowering of barriersplays an important role in our social habits'.Studies have reported that gay men andlesbians are often unable to have sex unlessusing drugs of some nature - usually alcohol. 17 The use of poppers (amyl nitrate) to relax theanal sphincter is 58 times greater byhomosexuals than by men in general. 18 The condom is still widely perceived by many people as being synonymous with safesex. However anal intercourse with or withouta condom is dangerous. A review article citesone study which found a condom breakage rateof 32% and slippage of 21%. This issignificantly higher than the correspondingrates of 5.3% and 6.3% respectively cited forvaginal intercourse. 19 Some who consider the above to be an unrepresentative view of homosexual life arguethat most studies recruit from genito-urinarymedicine clinics and hence are notRecent Legal Developments On 7 February 2000 the House of Lords threw outGovernment plans to repealSection 28 (page 6), whichprevents public money frombeing spent on thepromotion of homosexualityin schools and elsewhere.However, three days later,on 10 February, the ScottishParliament first voted infavour of abolishing Section28 in Scotland. Also on 10 February, the House of Commonsapproved legislation tolower the age of consent formale homosexuals from 18to 16. This ruling cannotnow be changed by theLords, and it will thereforebecome law automatically inEngland, Wales and Scotlandlater this year. ( Telegraph 2000; 11 February) On 21 June 2000 the Scottish Parliamentendorsed its earlier decisionby voting 99-17 to repealSection 28 formally as partof the Ethical Standards inPublic Life (Scotland) Bill.This was despite thecampaign of Brian Souter,head of the who \u00a32million ofScots who respondedwanted to keep the law.( Times 2000; 22 June) Moves continue to repeal Section 28 in England and Wales....highlighting the risks of gay sex does not mean doctors do not feel compassion for their gay patients Homosexuality TRIPLE HELIX 71 Remafedi G, Resnick M et al.

However the Wellings data showedthat of those who had any sexual partners inthe previous five years, 25% of gay men hadattended a GU clinic during that timecompared with only 3% of straight men. 20 Whilst it is quite possible that the other 75%of gay men who may not appear in moststudies celebrate their sexual lives inexclusively monogamous, long termrelationships in which they never take drugs or have anal sex and always wear acondom, the evidence of morbidity amongstthe remaining quarter of gay men isdisturbing enough. 21Receptive anal intercourse, whether hetero or homosexual, is surely not to becommended by those who understand thattheir bodies are 'a temple of the HolySpirit'? 22T rue 'brotherly love'23(philadelphia) is as much needed today as in the earlychurch. The New T estament plainly teachesthat such love is intimately connected withpurifying ourselves 'by obeying the truth' 24 and living 'a holy life'. Such concepts seemfar removed from the homosexual lifestylesof Philadelphia . Trevor Stammers is a General Practitioner in West London who writes and broadcasts on sexuality.True 'brotherly love' (philadelphia)is as much needed todayas in the early church. References A New Religion? Richard Lovelace sees the growing acceptance of homosexualitywithin the church as due to a'false religion' opposed to biblicalrevelation and the authority ofScripture, an 'antinomian ethic'that undercuts the balancebetween law and 'cheapgrace' that ignores repentanceand a 'powerless grace' thatdenies the possibility change.(Lovelace R. Homosexuality and the Church . Lamp, 1978:65-86) Contemporary culture portrays homosexuality in a positive light; presenting gays as sensitive, caringand successful, gay partnerships asenjoyable, fulfilling and healthy andby evoking sympathy for thosesuffering from AIDS. Thosequestioning the paradigm run the riskof being labelled homophobic bigots.But as well as showing Christ-likecompassion for gay people aspatients, Christian doctors need to behonest with both them and society atlarge about the well-documentedphysical and psychologicalconsequences of gay sex. The highincidence of promiscuity, unsafe sexpractices and drug misuse among gaymen are plainly reflected in the (notwidely publicised) adverse affects onboth morbidity and mortality.KEY POINTS The HIV pandemic in the year 2000 is confronting the world with enormouschallenges. The statistics and thepredictions for the 21st Century are indeed gloomy. By the end of 1999 at least 50million people had been infected by HIV . 33.6million were still living with the effects of theinfection and 1.2 million of these were childrenunder the age of 15 years (UNAIDS/WHOestimates December 1999). Women, children andyoung people are the most vulnerable. Around theworld, about 7,000 young people aged 10-24 yearsare infected with HIV every day; five every minute.Every year, 1.7 million young people are infected inSub-Saharan Africa and close to 700,000 in Asia andthe Pacific region. Regional realities In the industrialised countries, prevention measures have resulted in some plateauing of newinfection rates. The worst predictions of the late1980s in the UK did not materialise, which led to a certain amount of complacency and a feeling that the scientists, doctors and politicians had been exaggerating the risks. The availability of antiretroviral drugs in the 1990s have re-inforced that complacency, even though there is still no cure, and more young people are taking risks again. Antiretroviral combination therapies are indeed reducing the progression of HIV infection to AIDS and the number of AIDS related deaths has declined, but the decline is now tapering off. The 'wonderdrugs' have been found to cause their own problems, with side-effects, interactions, adherenceissues and the development of resistance. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia the epidemic is showing signs of increasing spread, much of itthrough intravenous drug use. In the former SovietUnion, reported HIV figures have doubled in thelast two years, the steepest rise being due to druginjection. The total number of AIDS cases in theMiddle East is still low in comparison to otherregions, but drug injection is responsible for 66% ofinfections in Bahrain and for 50% in Iran. Central American infection rates are rising, and the Caribbean has some of the worst epidemicsoutside of Africa: the adult prevalence rate for theCaribbean as a whole is 1.96%, second to Africa's8%, with similar epidemiology. Brazil and Argentinahave a similar epidemiological picture to otherindustrialised countries, and are providingantiretroviral drugs to HIV/AIDS patients. 6.5 million people were estimated to be living with HIV across Asia and the Pacific Region, fourmillion of these in India where the epidemic isspreading at an alarming rate. People who areknown to be infected in India are highlystigmatised, with women usually taking the blamefor the spread. Women who are working ascommercial sex workers in the Red Light Districtof Bombay, as well as in many other Indian citiesand towns, have usually had little choice in thematter, many having been kidnapped, sold or lured(by promise of good work and money by pimps)into prostitution from Nepalese or Indian villages;others have been born in the District to motherswho are working there, and are naturally forced intothe life. However, if there were no clients therewould be no prostitution, and it is the clients whotravel the truck and rail routes of India. There arehigh concentrations of people living with HIV inthe large cities, but as yet the rural areas have notbeen so severely affected. Nevertheless, thepotential for an epidemic approaching, or evensurpassing, the African one is very real. 95% of people living with HIV are in developing countries where poverty, poor health systems, andlimited resources for care and prevention encouragethe spread of infection. In these countries, about50% of those who are infected, acquire HIV beforethey are 25 years old and typically die before their35th birthday.AIDS Veronica Moss surveys the HIVpandemic and findshope alongside allthe despair Gloom and AIDS Sub-Saharan Africa 70% of the world's HIV positive people, 23.3 million, live in Sub-Saharan Africa,which is home to only 10% of the globalpopulation. Most of them will die withinten years for lack of basic treatment foropportunistic infections or access toantiretroviral drugs. In Malawi, the National AIDS Co- ordination Programme estimates that 25-50% of the urban working population willhave died of AIDS by between 2005 and2010. One of the major problems in Malawiin dealing with the care needs of thosewho are infected, is the lack of basic drugs.Patients who are diagnosed as having anAIDS related illness in hospital are, inmany instances, simply assigned to 'homebased care' where there may not even beaccess to paracetamol to treat the severeheadache of cryptococcal meningitis. In Kenya, one sugar estate found that 25% of its workforce was infected; inanother one, 33% were positive. All overSub-Saharan Africa, especially in East,Central and Southern regions, largecommercial companies and banks arehaving to face the impact of HIV on theirwork output, and some are developingpolicies and employee services that takeHIV into account. Government services,such as Health and Education Ministries,are severely crippled by the number ofhealth workers and teachers who areinfected, ill and dying. AIDS is now the 4th leading cause of death in children under 5 years in Ugandaand it is estimated (UNAIDS) that it mayincrease infant mortality rates by 75%. 15 studies conducted in rural and urban areas in nine Sub-Saharan countriessuggest that 12-13 African women areinfected to every ten African men. Girlsaged 15-19 years are five to six times morelikely to have HIV than boys of the sameage. In Uganda, 62% of girls will have hada pregnancy by the age of 19 and 43% ofall first pregnancies are in teenagers. There are many reasons for thedifferences between the infection rates among boys and girls. These include thebiological vulnerability of young girls,especially if they are forced into sexualintercourse through rape, and the fact thatmany older men will induce sexualcompliance in return for school fees incountries where schooling is not free, andthe only way out of the poverty trap isthrough education. This is the 'sugarDaddy' phenomenon, and can apply toother advantages as well as to school fees.The men may believe that having sex witha virgin will cure them of HIV - this,among other things, is leading to increasingrape figures of young children. Others willlook for a young girl on the basis that she isunlikely to be positive and so will make asuitable girlfriend, wife or mother. Children and AIDS During 1999 an estimated 570,000 children globally were newly infected withHIV . Of these, 90% were babies born toHIV positive mothers, 90% of them inSub-Saharan Africa. The cumulative totalof children under 15 years of age who hadlost their mother to AIDS, and maybefather too, had reached 11.2 millionworldwide. By the year 2010, there will bealmost 40 million such children in 19African countries. From a study in eightAfrican countries with high prevalencerates, it is estimated that 25% of allchildren in these countries who are lessthan 15 years old will be AIDS orphans. Across Africa, grandmothers are burying their own children and taking in orphanedgrand children, in some cases as many as15-20. When a grandmother is unable, orunavailable, to take them in, siblings areseparated and 'farmed out' to aunties anduncles; some are welcomed and well caredfor, but others are resented and neglected;some end up on the streets. Some childrenare looked after by an older sibling, whomay herself or himself be no more than 14or 15 years old, in child-headedhouseholds.GloryEvery year, 1.7 million young people are infected in Sub-Saharan Africaand close to 700,000 in Asia and thePacific region Whilst prevention measures and antiretroviral medication have eased the AIDS burden borne by the developed world, theepidemic continues to spread at an alarming ratein Eastern Europe, the CIS, Asia and CentralAmerica. But it is still Sub-Saharan Africa, with70% of the world's HIV positive people, which issuffering the most devastating sociological andeconomic effects. The most distressingconsequences are for children; both thoseinfected, and those left behind as AIDS orphans. Inthe midst of this gloom and despair there aresigns of hope with increasing international co-operation, new scientific advances, and the widerange of efforts, many pioneered by Christians, tosupply both palliative care and preventiveeducation. There remains a huge role forChristians to play - and every individual helped isa manifestation of God's glory.KEY POINTSGLOBAL SITUATION (UNAIDS/WHO) People newly infected in 1999 5.6m Adults 5.0m Women 2.3m Children 570,000 People living with HIV in 1999 33.6m Adults 32.4m Women 14.8m Children 1.2m AIDS deaths since the beginning 16.3m TRIPLE HELIX 9The Glory Is it really possible to find any glory in the midst of all this gloom? The glory lies in seeingGod's hand of love in the many efforts that arebeing made all over the world to prevent thefurther spread, to alleviate physical andemotional suffering, to support widows andorphans, and to seek for lasting answers andsolutions. Scientists are seeking to find effective and affordable vaccines that will prevent infection.They are also constantly seeking for moreeffective treatments, ultimately hoping for acure. God is at work through their scientificskills. There is increasing co-operation andcollaboration between governments and NGO's(non-governmental organisations, many of themmission hospitals and other Christianorganisations, others are secular aid agencies) inseeking to prevent the spread and to deal withthe effects of the virus on communities andindividuals. Many mission hospitals, which in most developing countries provide a substantialamount of the health care, are quietly dealingwith overwhelming numbers of patients withHIV related illnesses and a resurgence oftuberculosis. Many of them are leading the wayin setting up services such as HIV clinics andhome care services for people with advancedAIDS. Some examples are Nsambya, Kitovuand Lachor Catholic hospitals, and Kisiizi andMengo Protestant hospitals in Uganda;Chikenkata Salvation Army Hospital in Zambiaand many, many others. Compassion and acceptance is taking the place of moralising and condemnation.Churches, both Protestant and Catholic, are nownot only teaching about Christian standards ofbehaviour, but setting up caring and supportiveservices, developing behaviour changeprogrammes, and community, schools and youthprojects, such as the Youth Alive Programme inKampala. When Bishops find HIV in their ownfamilies their perspectives often change. InSouth India, a missionary doctor has developed ahospice for patients with AIDS; in Kenya andUganda, Hospice Africa, primarily set up to provide home care for patients with cancer, alsosees many patients with advanced AIDS andprovides symptom-control and care for them.

He was askilled and artistic surgeon and it is claimedthat he laid the foundations of modernsurgical gynaecology, introducing many newtechniques. One historian of the JohnsHopkins said of Kelly that he 'was the onlysurgeon I ever knew personally whoindulged in prayer before he beganoperating'. Kelly venerated the Bible andwas staunch in its defence. 'Where the Bibleis dishonoured, life becomes cheap andscience an early victim,' he once declared.ABORTION It is striking how the age-old debate about abortion seems to have changed irreversiblyjust in the last few years. The stereotypedconfrontation between the 'right to life' of the fetus and the 'right to choose' of the motherhas become much more complex. Somecommentators are now talking about the 'newethics of abortion'. So what are the factors whichhave changed the debate so profoundly? Factors changing the debate Firstly, there is much greater public awareness of the development of the unborn child,particularly because of the almost universal use ofantenatal ultrasound screening. Advances in fetalphysiology have also received widespreadpublicity. We now know that the fetus responds tostimulation from the first trimester, developscomplex stress responses to the insertion of aneedle from before 20 weeks, learns to distinguishsounds, tastes and vibrations, orientates itself inspace and actively interacts with its intrauterineenvironment. Secondly, continuing advances in neonatal intensive care mean that survival of extremelypreterm infants at 23 and 24 weeks is now almosta matter of routine. Many parents, families andprofessionals are exposed to the remarkable sightof tiny infants attached to all the paraphernalia oflife support machinery. Charities and individualsdonate many thousands of pounds to buy intensive care equipment for their local baby unit.Behind the widespread interest and support liesmore than mere sentimentality. There are deep-rooted intuitions that the protection, support and nurturing of vulnerable human beings, offering a chance of life to those who cannot fight for themselves, is an essential duty of acivilised society. Thirdly, at the same time, there has been remarkable growth in antenatal screening for fetalmalformations and genetic abnormalities, and anincreasing 'medicalisation' of pregnancy. The new consumerist rhetoric of 'providing choices forpregnant women' has become widespreadamongst health professionals. As the number ofgenetic tests increase, the problems of providingsuitable counselling and information is likely tobecome more intractable. It seems inevitable thatmore and more couples will face decisions aboutterminating affected pregnancies. The painful reality of trying to cope with a bewildering range of choices is changing theexperience of pregnancy for many women. Onestudy found that 79% of pregnant women weremade anxious by the screening tests, and there isinteresting evidence that the anxiety about fetalmalformation often persists even when a test hasgiven a reassuring result. Some have argued thatantenatal testing encourages women to view theirbabies as commodities that may be rejected iffound to be substandard. The effect of fetalscreening is that many mothers hold back fromrelating to their unborn babies until tests haverevealed that the baby is healthy. The pregnancyis tentative - some women don't tell anyone theyare pregnant until the test results come back,sometimes 20 weeks or more into the pregnancy. The growth of antenatal screening has 'medicalised' pregnancy by raising theexpectation that medical expertise is capable ofproviding a baby free from impairment or illness,and that it would be 'selfish' or even 'antisocial'for parents not to avail themselves of this service.So technology has had the effect of encouraging amother to distance herself from the child shecarries. In some ways it seems to me that fetalscreening offers a false hope, a technologicalmirage. It seems to offer the anxious parents thepossibility of the security and confidence thattheir baby will be 'all right'. But the unpalatabletruth is that no technology can guarantee a perfectchild or a healthy outcome. Fourthly, another major development is theThe new ethics of abortionJohn Wyatt identifies a decisive shift in public attitudes to the unborn child...we must concentrate on finding and developing practical, realisticalternatives to abortion RCOG says 'abortion is ahealthcare need' New guidelines to doctors issued by the RoyalCollege of Obstetriciansand Gynaecologists saythat abortion is a 'basichealth care need', the costof which should always bemet by the taxpayer.

The guidelineswhich have been fundedand approved largest abortion'provider' and 'reviewed'before their final draft bya host of other pro-choicegroups. They are availableon the College website.(www.rcog.org.uk) TRIPLE HELIX 11growth of the disability rights movement. One eloquent voice is that of T om Shakespeare, anacademic sociologist who happens to haveachondroplasia. He argues that 'disabled peopleare not consulted on matters which affect us:professionals, un-representative charities andgovernments all make decisions about disability,without considering that the best experts on lifeas a disabled person are disabled peoplethemselves. Politicians, scientists and doctorsalike must realise that disabled people do have aparticular interest in prenatal testing and shouldtherefore be systematically involved in the publicdebate'. Many disabled people regard antenataltesting for fetal abnormalities as a form of socialdiscrimination against people like them. Theyargue that it is disingenuous for scientists andclinicians to claim that the development ofantenatal genetic testing is neutral and value-free.The option of abortion for a range of geneticdisorders places a negative value on people withthe condition, and implies that it is sociallydesirable to prevent the birth of certain fetuses. The obvious counter-argument is that abortion of a fetus with Downs syndrome, for example,does not necessarily imply disrespect for peoplewith Downs syndrome, provided we accept thatthe fetus is not yet a person. It is argued that thedecision to abort is intended to prevent adisabled person coming into existence - it has nowider social implications. But this is surelydisingenuous. There is widespreadcondemnation of the use of abortion in India toallow parents to choose a male fetus for socialreasons. This practice is seen as supportingsocial discrimination against women. In the sameway social approval of abortion of fetuses withDowns syndrome can be seen as'chromosomalism' , enshrining social discrimination against certain forms of DNA! Inthe words of one disabled person, 'T o the extentthat prenatal interventions implement socialprejudices against people with disabilities, theydo not expand our reproductive choices. Theyconstrict them.' In the new debate about abortion the social dimension is increasingly coming to the fore.The truth is that in many cases abortionrepresents an attempt to provide a quicktechnological fix - a medical, technical solutionto what is a complex social phenomenon. But medicine alone cannot solve the age-old humandilemmas of the unwanted or disabled child. Andwomen and health professionals contemplatingabortion cannot regard this decision as a purelyprivate, medical one. The social context in whichabortion takes place and its implications forsociety as a whole cannot be ignored. A Christian response So how can Christian doctors and health professionals make a practical contribution to thedebate about the new ethics of abortion? Whilstwe must seek to protect the vulnerable fetusfrom abuse, we must never forget the humanpain that lies at the heart of these complexissues. The truth is that many women (and theirpartners) in our society are carrying painful andsecret memories of past abortions. Instead ofcriticism and judgement, our duty is toempathise, to enter into the experience of pain,despair and perplexity. Firstly, we must continually learn from the example of Christ. The Incarnation and theCross are both supreme examples of empathy inaction. Jesus did not condemn from the outside.He experienced humanity from the inside. Heentered into human pain and perplexity, in orderto transform it with forgiveness and hope. Sowhenever we engage in the abortion debate weshould do so with sensitivity, with gentlenessand with compassion. Secondly, as health care professionals, we must not limit our involvement to the biological andmedical aspects of pregnancy. Elaine Storkey inher meditation on the experience of Mary, themother of Jesus, expresses sensitively the intuitivesense of wonder and the emotional demands ofpregnancy from the mother's perspective. 'Pregnancy is itself a symbol of deep hospitality. It is the giving of one's body to the life of another. It is asharing of all that we have, our cell structure, ourblood stream, our food, our oxygen. It is saying\"welcome\" with every breath, and every heartbeat...thegrowing fetus is made to know that here is love, hereare warm lodgings, here is a place of safety. This is oneof the reasons why the decision for abortion is such apainful and heavy one. Of course there are those whohave been taught by our culture to present themselves tothe clinic with barely a second thought, accepting thesterile terminology of the hospital for what they areabout to do: \"a termination of pregnancy\". Yet formany other women who have had an abortion therehas been anxiety and grief and a sense of loss. In spiteof all the reasons which directed them to take this step,some feel guilty of a deep betrayal of trust. They couldnot find within themselves the hospitality that wasneeded to sustain this life...' The concept of pregnancy as hospitality has deep resonances with Christian thinking aboutcommunity and neighbourliness to strangers.The challenge for us is how to communicatein many cases abortion represents an attempt to provide a quick technological fix... But medicine alone cannot solve the age-old human dilemmas of the unwanted or disabled child 12 TRIPLE HELIX ABORTION New booklet criticised A new Family Planning Association booklettitled 'Abortion - just soyou know' has beencriticised areal concern amongteenagers for moreinformation on a subjectwhich they no longer sawas a taboo. (BBC News Online, 9 June & SPUC media release, 8 June) TRIPLE HELIX 13ABORTION these profound concepts in ways which are intelligible to modern secular people. Thirdly we should identify with those who feel stigmatised and rejected by the practice ofantenatal screening and termination. Howeveradmirable and compassionate may be ourmotives, when we contemplate abortion for amalformed fetus we are sending an implicitmessage of rejection. We are saying that wedon't wish to accept this new other, to offerbasic human hospitality. This, of course, is whydisabled people represented by T omShakespeare and others, react to the practice ofgenetic screening and therapeutic abortion ofaffected fetuses. It strikes at the heart of aChristian understanding of community, and theresponsibilities and duties we owe to oneanother. One of the unfortunate consequencesof rapid advances in genetic knowledge may bethe formation of a 'genetic underclass' - agrowing group of individuals who are sociallystigmatised in various ways by their DNA.The identification of a particular geneticsequence may mean that an individual is unableto obtain a job, purchase life or healthinsurance, obtain a mortgage or find a marriagepartner. Since the days of the early church, theChristian community has seen a duty to providepractical protection and support for socialoutcasts of all sorts. Perhaps in futureChristians will need to find new ways ofsupporting the outcasts created by genetictesting. The theologian Joseph Pieper oncedefined the essence of Christian love, 'Love is away of saying to another person, \"It's good thatyou exist; it's good that you are in this world\".' Fourthly, we must concentrate on finding and developing practical, realistic alternativesto abortion. The way of practical, supportivecaring is never an easy alternative. It is costly in terms of time, emotional involvement andfinancial commitment. But it is an essentialresponse if Christians who defend the rights ofthe unborn child are not to be guilty ofhypocrisy. Unless we are in the forefront ofproviding practical care and support for thosewith problem pregnancies, helping parentsstruggling with the implications of bringing upa disabled or impaired child, and defending therights of the disabled and stigmatised withinour community, our supposed commitment tothe sanctity of human life is deeply suspect. There is no doubt that rapid advances in medical practice coupled with profound socialchanges have irreversibly altered the age-oldethical debates about abortion, disability andthe sanctity of human life. Yet the newlandscape offers remarkable opportunities forChristian insights and influence. The challengefor health professionals is to find ways oftranslating Christian caring into clinical practicein a way which is relevant and intelligible tomodern secular people.

An independent review of one of these cases noted: 'It washard to avoid the conclusion that that the treatment plan... was to do little more than allow the patient's life to ebb away'. 2 In 1999, The British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and the Royal College of Nursing jointly said that 'do notresuscitate' (DNR) orders could be considered only after discussionwith the patient or others close to the patient, and that they should bereviewed at regular intervals. It appears that these guidelines arefrequently flouted. In one American series, 3over two thirds of the patients studied were not involved in their own DNR decisions. Even ifthere is discussion, information given is often not recalled, viewpointsoften change as the disease progresses (or regresses), and decisions arepoorly understood. 4,5 What is even more disturbing is that DNR orders result in a greatly reduced quality of medical and nursing care and attention. One studyfound a greater than thirty-fold increased risk of dying in patients withDNR orders even after adjusting for disease severity, prognostic factors,age and other covariates. 6 But Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) after an in-hospital arrest is effective in only about 20% of patients,7and in many cases will have to utilise the scarce resource of an intensive therapy unit (ITU) bed. In the present day National Health Service, this may deny another patient (perhaps with a better long-term prognosis) their chance of life-prolonging and quality-of-life enhancing treatment such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The attempt to resuscitate is sometimes (to use Ebrahim's headline) flogging dead horses, a messy and futile exercise denying the patient a dignified death. What does the law say? In the United States, the body of law known as right-to-die cases extends ordinary treatment-refusal doctrine to end-of-life decisions. The courts, having affirmed a right to refuse life- sustaining treatment, could find no rational distinction between competent versus incompetent patients, withholding versus withdrawing treatment, and ordinary versus extraordinary treatment. The courts, however, have persistently affirmed one categorical distinction: between withdrawing life-sustaining treatmentMichael Webb-Peploe offers a ChristianPerspective Not for Resuscitation?on the one hand and active euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide on the other.In Washington v Glucksberg and Vacco vQuill, the Supreme Court unanimouslyheld that physician-assisted suicide is nota fundamental liberty interest protectedby the American Constitution. 8 New York State Statute governing resuscitative decisions requires that: 1. All persons be presumed to have capacity to make their own treatmentdecisions, and thus incapacity must beestablished by written determination ofthe attending physician; failure to do sois sufficient basis to rescind DNR ordersrequested by a surrogate. 2. Surrogate decision to request a DNR order must be supported by thepatient's current medical condition andfulfil statutory criteria; physicians'opinions regarding hypothetical futureconditions without firm evidence of the'medical futility' of treatment for thatpatient are inadequate support for asurrogate DNR decision. 3. Statutory provision allowing a surrogate to authorise a DNR order onthe basis that 'extraordinary burden' forthe patient is unconstitutionally vague. 9 In the United Kingdom, some consider that DNR decisions can legitimately bemade without consulting the patient if: nMorbidity scores indicate that theyare unlikely to survive CPR nThey are mentally incompetent. In one survey of the case notes of elderly medical patients,1030% were predicted not to survive CPR, another28% were deemed incompetent. Ofthose with DNR orders, 59% werepredicted not to survive CPR, a further24% were incompetent, and discussion ofresuscitation would have beenappropriate in 17%. Little mention wasmade of the family in these discussions. Mental competence is a very grey area. DNR decisions analysed for 97admissions to a psychogeriatric ward of aDutch general teaching hospital showedthat at the end of six weeks DNR orderswere predictable by the four variables ofdementia, use of antidepressants, age andpre-arrest morbidity index in that order. 11 The association of the use of antidepressants with the presence of awritten DNR order is surprising, andraises the strong possibility that an overlypessimistic view of quality-of-life by adepressed patient unduly influenced theDNR decision. A Christian Response Does the Christian faith shed any light on the DNR debate? I believe that itdoes, and here I must acknowledge mydebt to John Wyatt's book Matters of Life and Death , and in particular to his chapter ten, 'A better way to die'. 12 The biblical world view provides us with the following insights: 1. Human beings, even in an agony of suffering, or in a twilight mental state, areGod-like beings. And any being made inGod's image deserves a range of responses:wonder, respect, empathy, and above allprotection from abuse, from harm, frommanipulation, and from wilful neglect. 2. In the incarnation, God re-affirmed once and for all the value that he placeson humanity, created in his image. Everypatient, no matter how deformed thebody, deranged the mind, diminished thepersonality, carries this double hallmarkof divine value. 3. Human life is sacrosanct, and there is a strict line drawn between removingsuffering and removing the sufferer.Euthanasia (homicide) and suicide(whether physician-assisted or not) areboth opposed. The deliberatedestruction of a human life (whether byits own hand or by that of another)desecrates God's image. 4. Not only is each individual human life special, but we are all part of thehuman family, created to be incommunity. T o think that matters of lifeand death can be decided in isolation, bya single individual, is a dangerous illusion. 5. Death as a consequence of the fall is the 'last enemy', 13an evil and an outrage to be fought. Similarly, the loss offunction, infirmity and the degenerativedisease that come with age are real evils.Dylan Thomas expressed this in strikingterms writing of his father's blindness; Do not go gentle into that good nightRage, rage against the dying of the light.Old age itself is not an evil, but rather a stage of life to be respected andhonoured. For those trapped in a fallenand decaying body, living a severelylimited and frustrating existence, deathcan come as a merciful release, a sign ofGod's grace. Christian attitudes to deathreflect this strange ambiguity: on onehand it is an evil to be fought; on theother hand it may at times be accepted,even welcomed, as a sign of God's mercyand grace. 6. Pain and suffering are the inevitable consequences of man's rebellion againstGod, of our turning our backs onobedient communion with our creator.Suffering is a painful and universalreality which we can either accept orreject. If accepted from the hand of aloving God, he can transmute the evil ofpain and grief into the good of deepercommunion with himself. As CS Lewiswrote: 14'The human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long asall seems well with it. Now error and sin bothhave this property, that the deeper they are theless their victim suspects their existence; theyare masked evil. Pain is unmasked,unmistakeable evil; every man knowssomething is wrong when he is being hurt.... Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in ourconscience, but shouts in our pains: it is hismegaphone to rouse a deaf world.' Christianity teaches us to value human beings because of who they are, becauseof how they have been made, becausethey are known by God and immenselyvalued by him, rather than on the basisof what they can do. Medicine cannot hope to eliminate all suffering and death but must always seekto eliminate unnecessary suffering and untimely death. Quoting Wyatt again: 12 'The essence of being a good doctor is to know when \"enough is enough\". But how do weknow when we should withdraw treatment, orwithhold it? It is when the burdens of anyparticular medical treatment outweigh itsbenefits.... There is, however, a fundamental TRIPLE HELIX 17NOT FOR RESUScITATION Doctors may determine whether a treatment is futile, but they can neverdetermine whether a life is futiledifference between making treatment decisions, and making value-of-life decisions. Doctorsare qualified to make treatment decisions: todecide which treatment is worthwhile andwhich is not. But doctors are no betterqualified than anybody else to make value-of-life decisions: to decide which life is worthwhileand which is not. Doctors may determinewhether a treatment is futile, but they can neverdetermine whether a life is futile. When wewithdraw or withhold treatment, we areexpressing a belief that the treatment isvalueless, not that the patient is valueless'. Applying these insights to the DNR debate we can conclude: 1. The doctor has the responsibility of determining the likelihood of success ofCPR in the event of an arrest. A varietyof 'pre-arrest morbidity' scoring systemsexists and can be useful to anassessment of the usefulness or futilityof CPR. 2. Value-of-life in any individual patient can only be assessed bydiscussion with all those concerned:patient, relatives, medical and nursingstaff, the patient's spiritual adviser (ifknown). In the presence of depression ordementia, the patient's views may beunreliable or unobtainable. Surrogateviews from relatives may be influencedby the vested interests of physical orfinancial exhaustion or by 'carer's burn- out'. But such reservations are no excusefor failure to discuss value-of-life issues,and, in many cases, these issues willneed to be revisited and updated atregular intervals. Failure ofcommunication between doctors,patients and relatives lies at the heart ofthe present furore over DNR orders. In an editorial entitled: 'How to improve communications betweendoctors and three approaches totreatment decision-making: Paternalistic . Doctors using this approach want short descriptions ofphysical symptoms easily transformedinto diagnostic categories which in turnlead to treatment decisions consideredby the doctor to be 'in the best interestsof the patient', without having to exploreeach patient's values and concerns. Informed (or Consumerist) . The doctor's role is here limited to providingrelevant research information abouttreatment options and their benefits andrisks, leaving the patient to make aninformed decision. Shared . Doctors commit themselves to an interactive relationship with patientsin developing a treatmentrecommendation that is consistent withpatient values and preferences. For this to happen, the doctor needs to create anopen atmosphere in which informationexchange helps the doctor understandthe patient, and ensures that the patientis informed of treatment options andtheir risks and benefits. T reatmentdecisions are made jointly (not solely bya paternalist doctor, nor solely by aconsumerist patient), and patients canassess whether they feel they can build arelationship of trust with their doctor. The highest form of inter-personal (and thus of doctor-patient) relationshipis a covenant commitment of respect-love. But as Wyatt points out: 12'caring for people with respect does not mean that weare obliged to provide intensive andburdensome medical treatment to prolong lifeat all costs. As in all other clinical situations,the burdens of any proposed treatment mustbe weighed against its benefits... Withdrawingor withholding medical treatment is not thesame as intentional killing. We retain thebasic attitudes of wonder, respect, empathyand protection'.

'DNR' orders have also beenshown to affect adversely both attitudes topatients and the standard of care they aregiven. A Christian response must be based in abiblical worldview that affirms the dignity,worth and interconnectedness of all humanbeings as being made in God's image. Whilstrecognising that pain, suffering and death are,to some extent, inevitable consequences of theFall we must always seek to eliminateunnecessary suffering and untimely death.Good DNR decisions should be made inpartnership with patients and relatives,and be based on evidence-based survivalprospects BMJ 2000; R, Dillon on NHS deathdossier.

It seemsto aim to be non-confrontational, but suggeststhe possibility of not acting on same-sexattraction, and suggests change in orientation ispossible. There are links to organisations likeExodus International which is an umbrella organisation providing links to manyorganisations offering Christian support forhomosexuals 'seeking sexual purity'. Goodexamples of these, based in the UK 3areTrue Freedom Trust and COURAGE Trust which offer pastoral 'befriending' and counselling,rather than the 'reparative therapy' promotedactively by the National Association for Research and Treatment of Homosexuality(NARTH). Both sites are united in their belief thatfar from being irrevocably 'born gay' manyhomosexuals are able to change in theirorientation. The CMF website expresses thetraditional Christian view of homosexuality well. Whosoever is a web site that espouses a different view. It contains many articlesclaiming that when the Bible mentionshomosexuality it really means 'templeprostitution', and denies the claims made byothers that homosexuals can and do change.Certainly this is the most comprehensivecollection of resources that are both 'gay andChristian' I have ever come across. There aresome powerful arguments here, but much of theexplanation assumes that the Bible couldn'tpossibly say that all sexual relationships outsideheterosexual marriage are less than God's idealfor people. A page on the Religious Tolerance website claims to be portraying both sides of theargument but leans rather heavily towards aliberal approach. There is much on the web from this perspective. Homosexuality and the Bible states its credentials a written by 'a Bible Scholar', whoprecedes to worm his way out ofPaul's condemnation of homosexualsex as 'un-natural' by claiming that theApostle was ignorant of the concept ofsexual orientation. In our enlightenedage, gay people are simply doing whatis 'natural' to them. I'm afraid thatsuch an attitude to God's Word simplywill not do. In the same vein, Roy Clements , recently fallen from a prominentposition in evangelicalism as a resultof his professed homosexuality, hosts arather disappointing site containing an article (rather sadly titled 'living with our fallibility')reviewing the church's historical mistakes inBible interpretation on a host of issues andimplying (the second part of the article is still tobe posted) that similar errors have been madewith homosexuality. There is also an open letterto Brian Souter, the Stagecoach Director who championed the 'keep the clause' campaignopposing repeal of section 28 in Scotland. So, with a sigh, and in preparation for a sackload of letters, electronic and otherwise, let me finishby saying that despite all the best efforts of thesewebsites, some of them no doubt genuine in theirpurpose, I could find nothing on the web that canhonestly prove that the Bible is in favour of anyform of sex that takes place outside of marriage.This may well be an unpopular message today,and there are precious few Christian websites Icould find proclaiming it. Provided, however, weexhibit Christ-like love for those (homosexualsand heterosexuals) whose sexual behaviourcounts as sin (John 8:11), I can see no reasonwhy at the beginning of the third millennium weshould be ashamed to believe the traditionalbiblical view of sexuality. This and previous Cyberdoc website reviews Websites can be found at xtn.org/cyberdoc/ Cyberdoc is Adrian Warnock, SHO in Psychiatry and previous editor of Nucleus.Homosexuality remains a controversial subject amongst Christians. The electronic version of the British Medical Journal contains a veritableavalanche of e-letters mostly by Christian doctors in response to a 1998personal view by Sheard (BMJ 1998;317: 1532 (28 November)). This claimedthat Christian doctors who believed homosexuality was medicallydangerous were basing their views on inadequate research. In an evidentdisplay of the heat that surrounds this subject, he is himself criticised forimplying homosexuality is more common than it in fact is. It is sad to seepeople speaking with such ferocity towards others who share the labelChristian on a secular website, but some of the postings are quite useful. Dutch Courage - In sickness and in health Dirk van Zuylen Alpha 1999\u00a35.99 Pb 225 ppISBN 1 89893 868 7 This small and easy to readautobiography ofDirk specificallythose who haverenal failure. The book follows his life through his childhood ofmoving to Canada and then back toHolland. It is there that he becomes aChristian and starts his work in theNavigators, an organisation that reachesand disciples students for Christ. Hiswork brings him to England where hefalls in love with Sandra and they marryand have children. Early in their marriage, Dirk discovers that he has renal failure. He goes ontodialysis but eventually requires twokidney transplants. Later, he isdiagnosed as having cancer. Dirk talksfrankly about the physical, emotional andspiritual struggles of being ill, and theeffect these have on those who love him.He doesn't duck the enormous questionsthat arise but rather walks us throughthem from his perspective in a honestand frank manner. In the last chapter heasks the question, 'How does God feelabout all the suffering in the world?'. Heconcludes that the only way of findingout is to look to Jesus, for in Jesus we seecompassion and love demonstrated to thepoint of dying for us so that we can berestored to God. By the end of the book, Dirk is enjoying better health but is honestabout the scars. He has become adifferent man; he is more sensitive andfeels others pain more deeply. In one ofhis concluding paragraphs, he talks of hisconfusion about God's delay inanswering his prayers, but balances thiswith the truth that God is always hisanchor in the storm. This book does not offer a deep understanding of the theology ofsuffering but rather describes thepersonal experiences of a man who, after suffering for many years, it is continuingto work out the huge questions that arisesuch as God's sovereignty and his ownself-worth. If I have any concern, it is hislack of emphasis on God's sovereignty. This book can help people in different ways: firstly, it gives insight into thedifficulties of living with a chronicdisease such as renal failure; secondly, itchallenges the Christian to think aboutsuffering in this context; and thirdly, itintroduces the non-Christian to Christiantruths in a way that is unthreatening andeasy to understand.

Christians and Bioethics Edited by Fraser Watts SPCK 2000 \u00a37.99 Pb 84pp ISBN 0 281 05194 1 This book began as a series oflectures inCambridge.

T ransplantationethics and euthanasia are also discussed. The strong points of this book are the brief history of biotechnology, whichincludes discussion of legislation andethical dilemmas in this area, and helpfulsuggestions for further reading at the endof each chapter. Michael Rees' insistencethat God has revealed his truth to us inthe Christian message, absolute truththat speaks about what it means to behuman, is welcome.Despite some Bible references, the book lacks commitment to the Bible asour ultimate authority. Certain relevantbiblical truths such as God as creator, theperfection of God's original creation, theuniqueness of man as made in the imageof God, the historicity of the fall bringingabout disease, suffering and death to theworld are muted, ignored or evenimplicitly denied. There is no mention ofthe sixth commandment nor of theincarnation of Christ who, conceived bythe Holy Ghost, shared our humanityfrom conception and thereby gavedignity to human life from the time offertilisation. Indeed, Fraser Wattsespouses an evolutionary world view andstates that: 'T o assume that an individualcomes about immediately afterfertilisation is taking too simplistic apoint of view'. Those seeking a specifically Christian response to biotechnology will bedisappointed. The latest edition of Ethics and Medicine (2000;16:2) is more helpful. Stephen Browne is a General Practitioner in Birmingham Miraculous Healing Henry W Frost OMF 1999 (First published 1931)\u00a35.99 125ppISBN 1 85792 530 0 This classic book on healing,described by Dr MartynLloyd-Jones asthe best he was firstpublished in1931 and hasrecently beenreprinted for a new generation of readers. The author,Henry Frost, worked for the ChinaInland Mission (now OMFInternational). He had a wide experienceof Christian ministry and was friendswith many Christian leaders of his day.The book springs from his personalexperiences but always seeks to measurethat experience against scripture. The strength of the book lies in its balance. The main text starts with twochapters describing five notable healingsknown to the author, followed by fivenotable 'failures'. The authordemonstrates that issues such as the faith 20 TRIPLE HELIX BOOKS TRIPLE HELIX 21BOOKS of the patient and the energy or godliness of those praying do not determinewhether healing occurs. I was deeply attracted to the humility and transparent godliness of the author.He believes in healing but his trust is inGod. The high point of the book is hischapter on Christ's sovereignty. Thispreaches no easy evangelicaltriumphalism but rather explores themystery of those multitudes alive inPalestine at the time of Christ, and yetwhom Christ did not heal. There are many things one could criticise if one wished. The style andform are, naturally, old fashioned andoccasionally tedious to the post-modernbrain. Medical terminology is often usedto establish the credibility of theanecdotes. Much of this terminology andthe disease models that go with it nowseem archaic. (This should of course alertus to the transience of medical truths.) Asever, the problem arises as to whether amiraculous recovery from 'illness' actuallydenotes a miraculous recovery from'disease'. What can a book published in 1931 say to us, the children of the newmillennium? Firstly, if the language wereupdated, the book would immediatelycontribute to our contemporary debates.Frost is a voice calling from the centre,urging us to look to Jesus, to trust in himalone and to support and pray for ourfellow believers. Secondly, I could nothelp being struck by the way Frost choseto structure the book. It starts andfinishes with Frost's testimony of sicknessand of healing within his own family.There is no hint of superior triumphalismas Frost wrestles, like we all do, with hisfailure to see prayers for healinganswered. Within the book there is both areverence for the mystery of God's willand a persistent call to look to Jesus,whatever happens. As long as we canmatch Frost's attitude of trust, we will notbe found far from Jesus, whatever ourstand in the debate on healing. I'm glad I read this book. In the midst of controversy it led me to consider Jesus.I think you might be glad to read it too. David Misselbrook is a General Practitioner in London, and Course Organiser of the Lewisham Vocational Training Scheme.Breakdowns are good for you! Rev Dr RJK Law & M Bowden Sovereign Publications 1999\u00a39.95 270ppISBN 0 95060 425 9 This is an extreme book.The authors, oneof workedas a doctor illness'. Breakdowns areconsidered good because the patientcomes to a moral realisation that they areresponsible for their illness. The authorsargue that schizophrenia and depressionare not mental illnesses at all,'schizophrenia is almost entirely due tobad (ie self-pitying) behaviour'. Thisbook reminds me of Thomas Szasz'famous book, The Myth of Mental Illness , where he too argues that all non-organically proven conditions likeschizophrenia are not mental illnesses.According to Szasz, it is wrong toexculpate criminal behaviour on the basisof 'non-illnesses' like schizophrenia.Likewise, Law and Bowden state thatschizophrenic patients are 'crooked' andschizophrenia is not considered to be anorganic disease. 'Environmental andgenetic predispositions do not control ouractivity - they can always be over-ridden'. This is a simplistic, albeit imaginative, attempt to classify all mental disordersunder one large explanatory theory. Theyare all here - anorexia nervosa,alcoholism, multiple personality disorder,narcolepsy, personality disorder, mania,depression, schizophrenia. According to Law and Bowden 'T rue Biblical Counselling' is made up of threepropositions: 1. All problems that can be dealt with and solved in counselling sessions arealways due to the pride, self-centrednessand self-pity of the counsellee. 2. Medical (ie organic) illnesses do not make us sin. 3. Where there is said to be a medical problem, whether it is true or not, orwhere they have been classified as'mentally ill', self-pitying counselleesinvariably use this to excuse theirbehaviour. The authors advocate 'true biblical counselling' for case examples such as,'Anne's moody husband', 'Bill has aproblem with his new manager', 'Fred'sanger'. In treating Fred's anger and self-pity, there is useful biblical material inthe approach taken by the authors whenthey go through 'The 5R's:Responsibility, Repentance,Reconciliation, Restitution, and Re-building on Christ'. The problem arises when the authors use the same approach for schizophreniaand depression, neither of which theyconsider to be mental illnesses. Theycite a Weekend Telegraph columnist, Cressida Connolly, 'as an independentconfirmation of our basic argument whichis that depression, irrespective of medicalaspects originates within the depressivesthemselves'. Theirs is a rigid view ofdepression. In the case of schizophrenia, the authors write that symptoms appear inearly adulthood because of the 'highlevel of achievement expected of youngpeople'. This is where the book is verydifficult to get along with, because of thelack of genuine evidence. Moreover theevidence which is cited comes fromWilliam Glasser's book Reality Therapy . Glasser quotes his teacher Dr GLHarrington, who in 1962 had taken overthe care of 206 schizophrenic in-patientsand managed to discharge many of themby increasing their freedom to take moreresponsibility for their activities, sogaining self-worth. The philosophy wasone where 'mental illness was notaccepted'. T o reject all biologicaltheories of schizophrenia on the basis ofthis one non-randomised un-controlledtrial is unscientific. The authors have some useful advice on, 'How the Christian shoulddeal with life's problems', life'.But, while the authors' wide use ofscripture seems impressive, it is notmatched by reasoned understanding ofmental health issues. Dominic Beer is a Consultant Psychiatrist in London 22 TRIPLE HELIX LETTERS Postcoital contraception Sheffield GPs Mark Houghton and Chris Bronsdon continue the debate about the status of the embryo. Mandi Fry ( Triple Helix 1999; 9:6,7) attempted to help us think through inadvance a right practice on 'emergencycontraception'. However we feel it isdisappointing that her reasons for choosingimplantation as the start of life are notevidence-based or Bible-based. Mandi uses the argument that since God allows the wastage of 30-60% ofunimplanted embryos, then they are notyet alive to him and therefore we candiscard them too. There are severalproblems with this argument: notcontinue as asuccessful pregnancy.Only God knows which these are, and to say that we candiscard an unimplanted embryo, becauseGod chooses to allow some to die, is to putourselves in God's place. 2. Using this logic that 'high death rate equates with no value', then many childrenin developing countries where the perinatalmortality rate is about 50%, also have novalue before God. 3. Many patients do not believe that life begins at implantation. In the main patientsknow quickly and intuitively that life beginsat fertilisation. The common-sense view isthat a new person (or persons) are created atfertilisation. In other words they know thatthe nuclear fusion of the egg, which is partof person A with the sperm which is part ofperson B creates a third person C. Thisperson C has a distinct, unique geneticmakeup and value of their own regardless ofwhether or not implanted yet. Many patientsrealise that destroying C is to take life. 4. Furthermore, and of course most importantly, it is congruent with the overallthrust of scripture, which for Christiansshould have authority over human authority(such as the Faculty of Family Planning) if the two disagree. Many verses such as Jeremiah1:5 'before I formed you in the womb I knewyou', speak of a God who creates and knowspeople even before fertilisation has occurred.Greg Gardner has shown ( Triple Helix 1999; 10:20) that Jesus was a person from themoment of fertilisation. If scientists find that the moment of the beginning of life is unclear (Berry C.Beginnings . Great Britain: CMF, 1993) it is not unclear to God. Christians must not benaive. There is a massive industry thatwants us to believe that life does not startuntil implantation or later, and hasdeliberately lied and attempted to redefineconception and pregnancy. Population and famine Surrey GP Margaret White takes issue with the claim that population increasemaintains poverty. Professor John Guillebaud ( Triple Helix 1999; 10:4-5) is quite correct in part of hismaxim of a vicious cycle of population;poverty certainly maintains populationincrease. Everyone needs one child aliveand well to feed them when they areunable to work and one of the bestcontraceptives is an old age pension. He iswrong, however, in saying that populationincrease maintains poverty. It may dosometimes, but often the reverse is true -look at Hong Kong and Singapore! At the many United Nations conferences on the family the delegates from thewestern world (lavishly funded by theirgovernments) demand that 'reproductivehealth' - which includes abortion - bemade a 'human right'. This would forceevery country in the world to provideabortion on demand. Delegates from theThird World, the Middle East and theVatican have so far managed to out-votethem. It will however be brought uprepeatedly so that in the end the poorcountries won't be able to afford to senddelegates to places as distant as Rio deJaneiro and Peking - and the eugenicistswill have won.End of life issues Manchester pro-life commentator Stuart Cunliffe warns about phraseological slippery slopes. I am grateful to Greg Gardner for his reminder of how language has beenperverted in order to push particularcauses. ( Triple Helix 1999; 10:20) But have we all noticed what ishappening witheuthanasia? We weretold that withholdingfood and to do witheuthanasia. We hadalways understoodthat euthanasia was a deliberate act or omission intended to take the life of the patient. In 1997 the Government, which has always insisted it is opposed to euthanasia,defined euthanasia in its Green Paper Who Decides? as 'a deliberate intervention with the express aim of ending life' - no mentionof omission - and suggested legalisingwithholding nutrition and hydration. Lastyear the BMA (having claimed thatwithholding food and fluids in its newguidance was not euthanasia butwithdrawing treatment in the best interestsof the patient) insisted, in the debating packit issued before its forthcoming conferenceon physician-assisted suicide, thateuthanasia, PAS and withholding treatmentshould be kept 'phraseologically distinct'. Can we be sure that we are clear on the issues and that we are not taken in bylinguistic gymnastics? Editorial Note Associate Editor John Martin apologises.

I've re-checked.He's right. Mea culpa!Letters TRIPLE HELIX 23FINAL THOUGHTS Refined by fire One of my favourite childhood memories was waiting for goods trains to pass the levelcrossing a few miles down the dusty road from our farm in inland Australia. Most of the cargo,on its way to the coast from the remote miningtown of Broken Hill, was raw silver, lead and zinc. From my vantage point you would never have thought the grey ore in the rail trucks had muchvalue. Only when these stones were crushed, siftedand subjected to enormous heat would their realvalue and beauty emerge. The refining of silver is a delicate process. Ask any silversmith. The temperature has to be just right. Ifit's too low the process of refining won't even begin.If the furnace gets too hot, the silver will be spoilt.How, then, does the silversmith know for sure thathe's getting it right? First, refining silver requires enormous concentration. The silversmith needs to observecarefully as the heat does its work on the moltenmetal, never taking his eyes off the action for even amoment. Then, timing is everything. Leave the silveron the heat seconds longer than the ideal and itsvalue is seriously diminished. That raises an all-important question. How does the silversmith know that the molten silver has beenheated for the optimum time, at the optimumtemperature? The answer is that there comes a magic moment when the silversmith can see hisimage reflected in the precious metal in his charge.Then, and only then, it's time to take it off the fire. The Old Testament prophet Malachi compares God to a silversmith. 'For he will be like a refiners fire...'(Malachi 3:3). There are times when, under God'sprovidence, we will be tested and refined by fires ofadversity. These times can be devastating, as Jobfound. But if we trust his grace the image of thedivine silversmith will become even more visible inus, and people will notice. As St Paul wrote, 'Andwe, who with unveiled faces reflect the Lord's glory,are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord...' (2 Corinthians 3:18). There's an old chorus that I've often used as a prayer dedicated to colleagues and the peoplearound me: Let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me. All his wondrous compassion and purity.Come thou, Spirit divine,All my nature refine,'till the beauty of Jesus is seen in me.
