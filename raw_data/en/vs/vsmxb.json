About treatment modalities: Naturopathic physicians are trained in allopathic (pharmaceutical) medications as well as a variety of other modalities. Some of these modalities may be used to develop your personalized treatment plan: - therapeutic nutrition (foods and supplementation) - lifestyle counseling - botanical formulations (teas, tinctures, flower essences) - homeopathic medicine (dilute preparations of naturally-occurring substances) - spinal and soft tissue manipulation Naturopathic medicine aims to use the least-invasive approach for healing the person on a holistic level. These medicines can be gentle, powerful, and effective when used appropriately. Pharmaceutical medications may be prescribed if a higher intervention is necessary. Naturopathic physicians are trained to consider the interactions, depletions, and side effects that may be occurring as a result of pharmaceutical prescriptions and this will be taken into consideration when choosing an appropriate treatment plan.
