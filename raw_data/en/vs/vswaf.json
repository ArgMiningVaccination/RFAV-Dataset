Early 1800s In the early 1800s, the everyday lives of ordinary people living in Britain were unrecognisable when compared to today. Most of the country was still rural, and inland transport was still horse-drawn. London seemed as remote as another country to most. Cities were generally overcrowded and dirty with no sewage systems. Diseases were rife and often fatal. The average life expectancy was about 40 years. A visit to the doctor was expensive and there was very little effective medicine available beyond alcohol, opium and blood-letting with leeches. Most 'medicine' was herbal and came from apothecaries who made remedies and gave general health advice. Scientists were still developing their understanding of how the human body worked, germs had yet to be identified, and antiseptics and antibiotics were unheard of. Hospitals as we know them today did not exist and surgery would be performed with no anaesthetic in dirty conditions. Patients often died from infection or shock. But things were about to change - radically! Edward Jenner had already developed the first vaccine, which eventually eradicated smallpox, and Rene Laennec had invented the stethoscope. Over the next century, incredible medical and scientific advancements were made, and new government legislation was passed, which together transformed the lives, health and life expectancy of people throughout Britain.

[Queen Victoria](/collections/search/portrait/mw06506/Queen-Victoria) replica by Sir George Hayter 1863 (1838) NPG 1250 The Victorian period The Victorian period was a time of extraordinary change. Key scientific discoveries, changes in understanding about the human body and reform of housing, health and education transformed people's lives and greatly improved life expectancy. In the 1830s and 1840s epidemics of cholera, typhoid and influenza killed people in their thousands; surgeons amputated limbs in dirty, badly-lit rooms with no anaesthetic; and many ordinary people lived in cramped conditions with no running water. By the end of the century, the link between poor health and living cramped together in back-to-back slums had been proven, Joseph Bazalgette had built sewers under London, Louis Pasteur had made the crucial discovery of germs and their link to disease, surgery was performed using both antiseptic and anaesthetic, and nursing reformers like Florence Nightingale had transformed hospitals from 'gateways of death' to clean, efficient places of healing. It was also a time of great social change, particularly for women and children. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson became the first woman to practice medicine in Britain, and Millicent Fawcett led the campaign for votes for women. All children had access to education and became better protected from exploitation as miners, factory workers and chimney sweeps. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury (1801-1885) Mines and Collieries act Shaftesbury was a key figure in improving the working lives of people, especially children, in Victorian Britain. He led the movement for improving conditions in factories and mines, and also argued for new laws to protect apprentice chimney-sweeps or 'climbing boys'. His work led to the Mines and Collieries act of 1842. The act made it illegal for all children under ten to work in mines, and for women and boys under fifteen years old to work underground.

Before the Mines and Collieries act, some children worked underground for 18 hours a day. James Simpson (1811 - 1870) Anaesthetics Before the 1800s, operations were horrific. With filthy operating theatres and no anaesthetics, as many as eight out of every ten patients died from shock or infection. In the early 1840s, American surgeons began using ether as an anaesthetic. It was first used in Britain by Robert Liston, when removing a patient's leg. In 1847, James Simpson discovered the anaesthetic properties of chloroform while experimenting with colleagues in his dining room. Chloroform soon became more widely used than ether as it was faster-acting and not inflammable. It had to be carefully measured though to avoid overdose and death. Anaesthetics were a revolutionary discovery and transformed surgery in the 1800s. In the Britain of today, it would be unthinkable to undergo surgery without them.

Ignaz Semmelweis (1818 - 1865) The 'saviour of mothers' Without knowing it, Ignaz Semmelweis laid the groundwork for aseptic surgery. While working in Vienna in the 1840s, he demonstrated that the high number of deaths among women who had just given birth could be greatly reduced if doctors washed their hands in a solution of chlorinated lime (bleach powder). Despite becoming known as the 'saviour of mothers', his ideas went against the scientific understanding of the time and were only recognised after his death. Portrait Portrait of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis Wellcome Library, London Did you know?Many doctors at the time were deeply offended at being asked to wash their hands before dealing with patients and refused. Unthinkable today! Richard Oastler (1789-1861) Ten Hours act Richard Oastler led what is now known as the 'ten hour movement' to improve the working lives of factory workers, especially children, and became known as the 'factory king'. His work, along with that of Shaftesbury and others led to the Ten Hours act in 1847. The act meant that women and children working in cotton mills could not be made to work more than ten hours in one day. In 1867, six years after his death, the act was widened to include women and children working in all factories. Portrait [Richard Oastler](/collections/search/portrait/mw41814/Richard-Oastler) by James Posselwhite, continued his 'ten hour' campaign even while he was in prison for unpaid debts. Edwin Chadwick (1801-1890) First Public Health act In 1842, Edwin Chadwick published a report that proved poor living conditions were directly linked to disease and low life expectancy. This led to the Public Health act in 1848. This act was the first in a whole series that would improve the living and working conditions of the poorest people during the 1800s. Following the Public Health act, local boards of health were set up to appoint a medical officer, build sewers, inspect homes and check the state of food on sale. Portrait [Sir Edwin Chadwick](/collections/search/portrait/mw01167/Sir-Edwin-Chadwick) by Antoine Samuel in childbirth In 1853, Queen Victoria gave birth to her eighth child, Prince Leopold. After suffering seven painful births, the Queen was keen to try the relatively new anaesthetic, chloroform. Doctors were still divided in their views on whether chloroform was safe to use in childbirth. However, the Queen's husband, Prince Albert was a strong supporter. With John Snow as her anaesthetist, Queen Victoria safely delivered her son having successfully used chloroform to ease her labour pains. She is said to have called the drug 'that blessed chloroform...soothing, quieting and delightful beyond measure'. Chloroform had been given the royal seal of approval and was soon in much demand from women to ease the pain of childbirth. Queen Victoria was again given chloroform during the birth of her ninth child, princess Beatrice, four years later. Portrait [Princess Beatrice of Battenberg; Queen Victoria](/collections/search/portrait/mw07998/Princess-Beatrice-of-Battenberg-Queen-Victoria) by Unknown artist 1870s Jenner (1749-1823) act far back as end of the 1700s, Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine, for smallpox. In a now famous experiment, he placed a small amount of pus from a cowpox blister into a cut on the arm of a small boy called James Phipps. When Jenner exposed James to smallpox - which was highly contagious - a few days later, he was found to be immune to the disease. His idea was dismissed and ridiculed by many at the time, but Jenner was so convinced, that he gave the vaccine to his 11 month old son. Over 50 years later, in 1853, it became compulsory for all babies to be given the smallpox vaccine. Many were still suspicious, or considered it 'un-Godly' and refused to have their children vaccinated.

John Snow (1813 - 1858) Demonstrates cholera is spread through water Cholera was a major killer in the 1800s. It spread quickly and there was no cure. By plotting the location of people who had died of the disease on his now famous 'dot map' of Soho, Snow showed that cholera was being spread through the Broad Street water pump. It would be another 5 years before Louis Pasteur proved this 'germ theory' and people began to believe and understand Snow's ideas. John Snow went on to develop anaesthetics and was Queen Victoria's anaesthetist during the births of her 8th and 9th children.

Mary Jane Seacole (n\u00e9e Grant) (1805-1881) Mother Seacole In 1854, a party of nurses, led by Florence Nightingale, was sent to Crimea to nurse soldiers fighting in the war there. Mary Seacole travelled from her home in Jamaica to Britain to join nurses in this work. When she was turned down by the War Office, Mary funded her own trip to Crimea. There she set up the 'British Hotel' for sick and injured soldiers. She also tended soldiers on the battle field, putting her own life at serious risk. Mary became known as Mother Seacole. Portrait [Mary Seacole](/collections/search/portrait/mw84190/Mary-Seacole) by Albert (1827 - 1861) First publication of Gray's Anatomy Henry Gray developed his fully illustrated book Anatomy: descriptive and surgical to help medical students understand the inner workings and make-up of the human body. Along with his colleague, Henry Vandyke Carter, he carried out his research for the book by dissecting unclaimed human bodies from workhouses and hospitals. Gray's Anatomy has been continually revised and updated as new discoveries are made and is still in print and used by medical students today, over 150 years after it was first published. Portrait Portrait of Henry Gray Wellcome Library, London Manuscript Plate from Gray's Anatomy Wellcome Library, London Elizabeth Blackwell (1821 - 1910) The first woman on the Medical Register In 1858 Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman on the Medical Register, licensed to practice as a qualified doctor. It would take more than another 150 years for the numbers of women doctors in Britain to equal the number of men. Along with Elizabeth Garret and Sophia Jex-Blake, Elizabeth Blackwell was a key pioneer of women in medicine during the Victorian period. Portrait Portraits of E. Blackwell, E.Garrett Anderson, S. Jex-Blake Wellcome Library, London Did you know?Women were not allowed in to medical schools in Britain in the 1850s. Elizabeth Blackwell gained her qualification as a doctor while living in America. Joseph Bazalgette (1819 - 1891) The great stink and the modern sewage system Victorian London in the 1850s was smelly, dirty and riddled with deadly diseases. Cholera killed more than 10,000 Londoners in one year alone. The river Thames was a dumping ground for sewage, rubbish and even dead bodies. The hot summer of 1858 led to what became known as 'the great stink'. The smell from the river Thames became so overpowering that politicians threatened to decamp from the newly built Houses of Parliament. Chief Engineer Joseph Bazalgette developed an extensive sewer system under the streets of London and along the banks of the Thames to take sewage away from the river. His extensive system transformed sanitation and health in London, and much of it is still in use today. Portrait [Sir Joseph William Bazalgette](/collections/search/portrait/mw124118/Sir-Joseph-William-Bazalgette) by Lock & Whitfield 1877 or before NPG x646 Did you know?The curtains in the Houses of Parliament were doused in chloride of lime (bleach) to try and combat the terrible smell coming from the Thames. Louis Pasteur (1822 - 1895) Develops revolutionary germ theory In 1859, French scientist Louis Pasteur made the groundbreaking discovery that diseases are caused by germs (tiny microbes). He also realised they could be killed by heating and so invented the process of pasteurization, named in his honour. Before Pasteur's 'germ theory' it was widely thought that diseases literally appeared from thin air. Pasteur's work transformed public health and medicine, led to vaccines and probably saved more lives than that of any other.

Florence Nightingale (1820 - 1910) Transformation of hospitals and nursing care Florence Nightingale is probably best known for her nursing work during the Crimean war, where she became known as 'the lady with the lamp'. But this was just the beginning of the story. Deeply affected by the appalling, filthy conditions in the army 'hospitals' and the numbers of deaths among wounded soldiers, Florence set about change. With the backing of Queen Victoria she led an investigation into army deaths. The results showed that out of 18,000 deaths only about 2,000 were due to war wounds. The rest were due to disease caused by unsanitary conditions. In 1859, she published her famous books Notes on Nursing and Notes on Hospitals. Over the following years, her work transformed hospitals into clean, efficient places of healing with well-trained and newly respected nurses, saving countless lives. Florence Nightingale is considered the founder of modern nursing. Many of her practices are still used in hospitals today. Portrait [Florence Nightingale](/collections/search/portrait/mw123163/Florence-Nightingale) by William images [Florence Nightingale](/collections/search/portrait/mw39734/Florence-Nightingale) published Illustrated London News published 24 February 1855 NPG D5364 Did you know?Florence Nightingale was the first woman to be awarded the Order of Merit, an honour awarded by the King or Queen for exceptional achievements. William Rathbone (1819 - 1902) Founder of district nursing In the mid 1800s, Liverpool was home to some of the most destitute people in Britain. Numbers of deaths from hunger and disease were high. In response to the suffering he witnessed, William Rathbone developed the first organized service to provide care from trained nurses to the poorest members of the Liverpool community. Nurses were trained at a school built specially by Rathbone in 1863, on the advice of Florence Nightingale. Services were soon developed in other areas of extreme poverty such as Manchester and East London. The service became known as 'district nursing'. Portrait [William Rathbone](/collections/search/portrait/mw160929/William-Rathbone) x12794 Octavia Hill (1838 - 1912) The founder of social work Octavia Hill believed that living in a community with open spaces and neighbours to 'look out' for each other is as important to people's health and wellbeing as living in a clean, light, well-maintained home. She was also a great believer in helping people to help themselves. Octavia set up her first group of houses for the poor in central London in 1864. She collected rents personally, taking time to talk to the residents and listen to any problems they may be facing. She set up play areas and activities for the children, women and older people. In this way, Octavia pioneered a new approach to social housing and her methods were used in a number of different countries. Octavia Hill also successfully campaigned to preserve and create some of the most famous parks and open spaces in London, and co-founded the National Trust in 1885. Portrait [Octavia Hill](/collections/search/portrait/mw03150/Octavia-Hill) by John Singer (1827 - 1912) Antiseptics and aseptic surgery Victorian hospitals were dirty places riddled with disease. It was not uncommon for a patient to survive a brutal operation (with no anaesthetic!) only to die on the ward from infection. In the 1840s, Ignaz Semmelweis discovered that washing his hands in chlorinated lime reduced infection - although many ridiculed him. Joseph Lister read about Louis Pasteur's discoveries that diseases were caused by bacteria. In 1865, based on Pasteur's work, Lister experimented with carbolic acid, using it to soak dressings applied to wounds after surgery. He discovered that this greatly reduced infection, and that washing hands and surgical instruments in carbolic acid (phenol) reduced infection even further. This was the beginning of aseptic surgery - something we take for granted today. However, in the 1860s this was a revolutionary discovery that significantly improved a patient's chance of surviving surgery.

Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1836 - 1917) Founds the Dispensary for Women Elizabeth Garrett Anderson was the first woman to qualify as a doctor and surgeon in Britain. In the 1860s, women were not allowed to take up medical posts in hospitals. Elizabeth set up her own practice, the Dispensary for Women, in 1866. Along with Elizabeth Blackwell and Sophia Jex-Blake, Anderson was a key pioneer of women in medicine during the Victorian period.

At the time of his death in 1905, Dr Barnardo's charity was running 96 homes caring for more than 8,500 children and thousands of lives had been saved. The focus of care was on children's physical and moral welfare, some children saw the charity as a 'family' while others experienced harsh treatment and even cruelty. Thousands of the children taken by Barnardo were sent overseas to Canada and other British colonies as part of the child migration schemes, often into lonely and exploitative environments. Today, the Barnardo's charity has transformed from its institutional past, providing support for vulnerable children and championing the rights of the child.

In the 1870s it was very difficult for women to find a medical school that would allow them to study for a medical qualification. In response to her struggle to qualify as a doctor, Sophia co-founded the London School of Medicine for Women. Following its success she set up the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women in 1886. Along with Elizabeth Garret and Elizabeth Blackwell, Sophia was a key pioneer of women in medicine during the Victorian period.

He played a large part in shaping the social reforms of the 1870s, which greatly improved the lives of the poorest people living and working in Victorian Britain. By the 1870s, living conditions in many towns and cities were filthy and full of disease. Sewage, rubbish and even dead bodies lined the streets and the poor still lived in cramped dwellings with no running water. The Artisans Dwelling act and the Public Health act of 1875 brought together a number of changes to clean up towns, stem the spread of disease, demolish slums and provide better housing.

Like many, Burdon-Sanderson practised vivisection and argued that these experiments were essential, leading to life-saving discoveries. Vivisection - experimenting on live animals - was widespread in Victorian science and involved many practices that are viewed as unacceptable by today's standards. When The Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory, co-authored by Burdon-Sanderson was published in 1873. It fuelled the ongoing vivisection debate leading to legislation preventing cruelty to animals and regulations for laboratories using live animals for experiments.

Patrick Manson (1844 - 1922) Mosquitoes - the deadliest creature on earth In 1877, Patrick Manson discovered that parasites can be transferred through the blood by mosquitoes and so became known as the founder of tropical medicine. This breakthrough led the way for Ronald Ross to prove, twenty years later, that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.

Robert Koch (1843 - 1910) Discovers germs for different diseases In the late 1870s, German doctor Robert Koch began to develop a process and set of criteria for determining which germs cause different diseases. By growing different types of bacteria in the laboratory, and testing them on animals, Koch was able to find the germs for 21 different diseases including anthrax, cholera and tuberculosis. Koch's work built on Louis Pasteur's germ theory and, in turn, led Pasteur and others to develop vaccines that would save millions of lives. Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905.

Despite the development of braille, few blind people were educated and it was widely assumed blind people were not fit to work. Fawcett supported a royal commission to investigate and improve the lives of blind people. It was set up in 1885, a year after his death. The Commission recommended compulsory education for blind children and training for work. This was the first step in a long campaign for rights and equality for blind people.

William Hesketh Lever (1851 - 1925) Sunlight soap William Hesketh Lever was co-founder of the firm Lever Brothers, which later became Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world. The company began with a new product - Sunlight soap, the first branded and packaged laundry soap. Widely available, Sunlight soap transformed cleanliness and hygiene in Victorian Britain and, only a decade after its launch in 1886, 40,000 tons of Sunlight soap was being sold each year. The company took a keen interest in the welfare of its employees, and developed 'Port Sunlight', a 'model village' next to the soap factory. As well as 800 houses, the village included an art gallery, a cottage hospital, schools and an open-air swimming pool. The 'garden' village still exists today and includes a museum and garden open to the public. Lever was a strong supporter of the expansion of the British Empire, as production of his soap relied on the supply of palm oil, produced in British colonies of the time.

In 1866 she helped found refuges for destitute women in Liverpool. Many of the women had become prostitutes in a desperate need to earn money. Josephine brought some of these women to live in her own home and set up an envelope factory to provide them with paid work. In the 1860s, sexually transmitted diseases, like syphilis and gonorrhoea, were rife and often deadly. Acts were passed to curb the spread of them in the army and navy. This gave police the power to detain any woman thought to be a prostitute and force them to be medically examined. Josephine led a successful campaign against these acts, for which she became famous. The acts were repealed in 1886.

In 1890 he proposed the need for an organised group in Britain to represent the 'educational, moral and social interests' of deaf people, who were often also without speech. The British Deaf and Dumb Association was set up that same year. The word 'Dumb' remained until as late as 1970. It was not until the 1980s that the Association had its first deaf Chair, Jack Young.

They created safe and modern places to work, provided free education and training - with free tea! - and made sure all staff working for Boots were well looked after. Florence was particularly concerned with the welfare of women. She arranged outings to beaches and beauty spots (places otherwise out of reach for many) and invited staff to parties and celebrations at her home. Keen to promote health and wellbeing outside work, Florence encouraged employee sports and social clubs. She visited sick staff members, insisted on being notified about any serious hardship they may be suffering and arranged for girls arriving at work without having breakfast to be given cocoa at the start of the day. In the early 1900s Eleanor Kelly was appointed as a full time staff welfare officer. In 1928 Florence Boot personally funded the building of a hall of residence for women at Nottingham University. In 1934 Boots became the first company in the UK to introduce the five day working week.

Manufacturing Footage with voiceover by John Boot Jesse Boot (1850 - 1931) Chemists to the nation Before the mid 1800s, there were few medicines. Most of these were herbal remedies that could only be bought from doctors or apothecaries, making them unavailable to most ordinary people. Jesse Boot wanted to make the highest quality medicines available and affordable for all. His ethos led to a long-lasting public trust and a revolution in healthcare. By 1894 'Boots' stores were offering half price prescriptions dispensed from qualified pharmacists. During World War I, medicines were available overseas by mail order. When a deadly flu epidemic hit Britain in 1919, Boots kept stores open until midnight to meet the demand for medicines. In the 1920s, Boots offered their customers consultations with qualified nurses, and offered 24-hour access to affordable medicines. Long before it became law, Boots tested all their products for quality and safety. Jesse also established a pharmaceutical research division which developed new medicines, but also designed techniques to mass produce some of the new 'wonder drugs' such as Insulin and Penicillin. Along with his wife Florence, Jesse made sure their staff were always well looked after. In 1934 they became the first company in the UK to introduce the five day working week. Today, Boots dispense over 100 million prescription items each year - nearly 275,000 every day!

Adrenaline is released by the body when we're stressed. It causes the heart to race, pumping blood to the brain to focus the mind, and priming the muscles for 'fight or flight' - for rigorous or sudden action.

Wilhelm Roentgen Discovers X-rays In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered a special form of electromagnetic radiation he called X-rays. For the first time, the inside of the body could be seen without cutting into it. This marked a revolution in diagnosis. His discovery made him world famous and he was awarded the first ever Noble prize for physics in 1901. The first picture Roentgen took using X-rays was of his wife Anna Bertha's hand, the image showed her bones and wedding ring. When she saw her skeleton she is thought to have said: \"I have seen my death!\" Portrait Portrait of W.C.

Ronald Ross (1857 - 1932) Discovers malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes Building on Patrick Manson's work on tropical diseases, Ronald Ross discovered that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes, in 1897. Ross was awarded the Nobel prize in 1902. Despite great advances in prevention, one child still dies of malaria every minute. Nine out of every ten deaths from malaria occur in Africa. Microsoft mogul Bill Gates and his wife Melinda set up a foundation in 2000 which aims to eradicate malaria once and for all.

Malaria: Bill & Melinda Gates foundation Millicent Fawcett (1847 - 1949) President of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Millicent Fawcett was a tireless campaigner for votes for women and, in 1897, led the formation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The NUWSS was a political organisation that aimed to achieve women's suffrage peacefully and legally. Members of the NUWSS were known as 'suffragists', as opposed to the more militant 'suffragettes' who became famous for chaining themselves to railings, causing explosions and going on hunger strikes in their campaign for the vote.

She was married to Henry Fawcett, the first blind member of parliament and a strong supporter of votes for women. Henry Havelock Ellis (1859 - 1939) Sexology Henry Havelock Ellis led the development of sexology (the scientific study of sex) in Britain in the 1890s. At the time, scientific writings about sex were widely considered to be 'obscene' and homosexuality among men was illegal. Ellis was a supporter of sex education and birth control and published groundbreaking surveys on homosexuality and transgender identity to demonstrate their natural nature.

Marie Curie (1867 - 1934) Discovers radium Marie Curie worked with her husband Pierre to discover an amazing substance, which they called radium. Their breakthrough discovery would lead to new treatments for reducing tumours caused by cancer - known today as radiotherapy. Marie Curie became world famous and was the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize, along with Pierre. She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris. Although Marie and Pierre didn't know it at the time, radioactive substances are highly dangerous if not carefully controlled. Marie died from leukaemia, caused by working with highly radioactive materials.

The first was the reform through health services and unemployment insurance that transformed the lives of the most vulnerable people in society. The second was the First World War, which resulted in the deaths of over 800,000 British men and devastated families and communities, but also led to major innovations in medicine. The third was the transformation in the role and lives of women brought about by birth control, steadily enabling women to plan their families, and by a new law which meant women over 30 could at last vote in elections alongside men. Edward VII (1841 - 1910) Pioneering operation for appendicitis Just days before his coronation in 1902, the new King, Edward VII, became dangerously ill with appendicitis. Today, an operation to remove an appendix is fairly straightforward but, in 1902, this was a brand new and potentially risky procedure. Despite the King insisting that the coronation must go ahead, pioneering surgeon Frederick Treves operated on him. The coronation was postponed and the King's life undoubtedly saved, paving the way for many more life-saving appendectomies to follow.

Like many of their time, they are also known for using vivisection (experimenting on live animals) in their research. In 1903, Bayliss performed a dissection on a live dog in front of 60 medical students which would spark protest, debate and legal battles that raged until 1910. This became known as the 'Brown dog affair'.

A new statue commissioned, by anti-vivisectionists, was erected in Battersea Park in 1985. Emmeline Pankhurst (1858 - 1928) Campaign for votes for women Emmeline Pankhurst was a leading figure in the long and difficult suffrage campaign to secure votes for women. In 1903 she co-founded the militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Along with her supporters, Emmeline fought tirelessly and aggressively for her cause. She was arrested a number of times for acts ranging from leading protest marches, to conspiring to plant explosives. Like many of her fellow suffragettes, she went on hunger strike in prison and was force-fed. In one of the suffragettes' most famous acts of protest, fellow WSPU member Emily Davison ran out in front of the King's horse during the 1913 Epsom Derby. She died of her injuries a few days later. In 1918 women over 30 were finally granted the vote. This was extended to all women over 21 (in line with men) in 1928, just weeks after Emmeline died.

William Beveridge (1879 - 1963) Old Age Pensions and National Health Insurance William Beveridge advised the Liberal government on old age pensions and National Health Insurance. Pensions for people over 70 were introduced in 1908. National Insurance was introduced in 1911, providing a 'safety net' for the poorest people. Workers earning less than \u00a3160 per year now paid some of their wages into National Insurance schemes; their employer and the government also paid into the schemes. This money paid for sick leave and unemployment benefit. A similar system still exists today. The 'Beveridge report' of 1942 would be a key factor in the development of the National Health Service.

He called this the 'magic bullet' theory. He went on to carry out a number of experiments with a team of scientists that would prove he was right. In 1909, Ehrlich, and his assistant Sahachiro Hata, discovered that arsphenamine kills the bacteria that causes syphilis - a deadly sexually transmitted disease. They also discovered that arsphenamine caused no harmful side effects when taken by people. They had discovered a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich coined the term 'chemotherapy' to describe the process of using chemicals for medicinal purposes.

His theories centre around the idea that our development is shaped by early experience, that thoughts and behaviours are driven largely by our 'unconscious' mind, and that these can be unlocked through methods such as skilled guidance, hypnosis and analysing dreams. Freud co-founded the International Psychoanalytical Association in Nuremberg in 1910. Freud radically advanced understanding of the human mind and his theories still underpin many branches of psychology and psychotherapy today.

World War I The First World War was a war like no other. The need to treat a huge number of casualties led to major advancements in medicine and surgery. Men fighting on land, at sea and in the air came under attack from new and sophisticated weapons. Explosives, gas, shrapnel and machine guns caused horrific injuries to the military and to civilians. Over 800,000 British people died, and nearly 2 million more were injured. Harold Gillies developed new techniques in plastic surgery to repair disfigurements, Hugh Owen Thomas's splint saved thousands from having their legs amputated and William Rivers greatly increased our understanding of the effects of traumatic stress. The first blood banks were set up on the Western Front. Blood was mixed with sodium citrate to stop it coagulating (thickening) and preserved by keeping it on ice, ready for life-saving transfusions close to the battlefield. By the end of the War, there were around 41,000 amputees in Britain alone. Every serviceman who lost a limb was entitled to an artificial limb, and specialist centres were developed to fit prosthetics. The War led to great change for women. Thousands served as nurses, saving lives through treating casualties and developing new ways to reduce infection and diseases. More were needed at home for jobs previously only open to men. These essential roles finally led to votes for women in the UK in 1920.

In 1915 she was made Matron-in-chief, in charge of the Army's nursing operation. Thousands of trained nurses served in the War. They lived and worked in dangerous conditions, often treating wounded men close to the frontline and while under fire. McCarthy's exceptional skills as a nurse and administrator were vital to the Army. One general is reported to have said of her: '... she could run the whole Army...she'd never get flustered, never make a mistake. The woman's a genius'.

He combined the secrets and traditions of this, often brutal, practice with his medical knowledge to develop new treatments and devices. His most famous invention was the 'Thomas splint'. It wasn't until twenty-five years after his death that his splint became widely used, saving thousands of limbs and lives of soldiers in the first world war. At the beginning of the war, most soldiers with broken femurs (thigh bones) died. After the Thomas splint was introduced in 1916, over 80% of soldiers survived this injury.

William Halse Rivers Rivers (1864-1922) The talking cure WHR Rivers is best known for his treatment of servicemen suffering from 'shell shock' during World War I. It is now known as 'post traumatic stress', caused by the horrors and trauma of war, with symptoms that include twitching, stammering, nightmares, blindness and an inability to eat or sleep. Throughout most of the War, shell shock was not well understood, it was seen as a sign of weakness and there was little sympathy; some were even executed for cowardice. Rivers disagreed with the harsh views and treatments of the time. Inspired by Freud's psychoanalysis, he developed a new, successful form of therapy, which encouraged those he treated to talk about their experiences and face their fears. This became known as the talking cure. Portrait [William Halse Rivers Rivers](/collections/search/portrait/mw109877/William-Halse-Rivers-Rivers) by Walter Stoneman 1917 NPG x164465 Did you know? 80,000 officers and ordinary soldiers are thought to have suffered from shell shock during World War I. Rivers' most famous patient was the war poet, Siegfried Sassoon. Harold Gillies (1882 - 1960) The man who mended faces Harold Gillies became known as the father of plastic surgery. During the First World War, thousands of men received horrific facial injuries from bullets, explosives and flying shrapnel which could literally rip a face apart. Men lucky enough to survive were often left disfigured - badly scarred and with parts of their faces missing. Gillies convinced the army to set up a special plastic surgery hospital in Kent. Gillies developed innovative techniques in skin-grafting and reconstructive surgery to repair and restore the men's faces. He continued his work after the war and was a strong influence on his cousin, Archibald McIndoe who became famous for developing new techniques to treat RAF pilots who had been badly burned during World War II. Harold Gillies would go on to carry out some of the first gender reassignment surgeries in the 1940s and '50s. Portrait [Sir Harold Delf Did you know?As well as surgeons and nurses, Gillies set up a team of artists, like Henry Tonks, at the Sidcup hospital to take casts of the men's faces and record their injuries and recovery as detailed portraits. Marie Stopes (1880 - 1958) First family planning clinic in Britain Marie Stopes was a campaigner for women's rights and birth control. For poor families living in the early 1900s, 'another mouth to feed' often proved financially impossible, it was also still relatively common for women to die in childbirth. Being able, and having the right, to choose the number of children they had was a crucial issue for women. When Marie published her book 'Married Love' in 1918, it was publicly condemned but widely popular, and thousands of women wrote to her to ask for advice. In 1921 Marie opened the first birth control clinic in Britain, paving the way for a revolution in women's rights and freedom.
