In homeopathy, disturbance of the self-regulating Vital Force (Vf) results in dis-ease as multileveled symptom expression. Treatment aids the Vf as it attempts to restore holistic balance. Conventional medicine (allopathy) deterministically considers external agents (viruses, bacteria, etc.) or internal biochemical imbalances as disease causes. Treatment is geared to eradicating causative factors, sometimes at the expense of the homeostatic immune system. Method: A previous mathematical model described the Vf as a quantized gyroscopic \"wave function,\" equating strength of symptom expression to degree of Vf gyroscopic \"precession.\" Diseases and homeopathic remedies were interpreted respectively as braking and accelerating \"torques\" on Vf \"angular momentum.\" In this paper, approximations applied to the Vf \"wave function\" could provide insights into why conventional medicine dismisses the action of highly potentized homeopathic remedies. In addition, a simple geometric force diagram provides another mathematical model for allopathic drug action and immune system reaction. Results: The 2 models converge on the same result, delivering conventional biomedicine's conclusion: potentized homeopathic remedies should exert no clinically observable effects. Conclusions: Following the logic of these models, conventional medicine could be seen as a special case of a broader therapeutic paradigm also containing homeopathy.
