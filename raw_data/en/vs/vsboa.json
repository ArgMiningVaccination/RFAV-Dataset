In order to maximize the benefits of these therapies, it is important for individuals to properly prepare for their sessions. Preparation for a holistic healing session should begin with stress management techniques such as mindful breathing, yoga or tai chi. Practicing these activities before engaging in therapy can help ensure that both the body and mind are relaxed and receptive to the healing process. Additionally, developing an awareness of one's emotional state can also be beneficial; recognizing feelings such as anger, sadness or joy can provide insight into underlying issues that may need to be addressed during the treatment.
