A state of mind that is longed for by all, but can be barely grasped by a few. There are several factors in our day-to-day life that practically grab the idea of peace by the feet and drag it out of our minds every time we even think of it. From work stress to social responsibilities, the distractions are endless. Not only does this make peace hard to achieve, but it also affects our mental and physical health. Fortunately, there is one activity that can help you free the chaos of your mind: meditation. Being mindful and meditation induces a heightened sense of awareness and improves the attention span. Studies have shown that meditation can also help relieve stress and manage anxiety. Moreover, it improves memory as well. The peacefulness attained by meditation lasts much longer than the process of meditation. This means that if stress appears at an unreasonable time, you will know the means of redirecting it. Meditation teaches you how to respond instead of reacting to challenging situations. When meditation is combined with the power of [mantra chanting](https://nimba.in/wellness_nimba/mantra-chanting/), you can understand the magic of aligning all your chakras and influencing your nervous system. The vibrations created by meditation and mantra changing will eliminate any kind of negativity from your mind and free it from the chaos of everyday life. At Nimba, we provide dedicated meditation spaces as well, called meditation caves, wherein you can connect with your inner self and have the utmost awareness of your existence. You can choose to opt for Concentration Meditation, which aids in gaining absolute control over all mental turmoil and disciplines the mind to attract positive energies, or you can opt for Mindfulness Meditation, which obliges you to direct your focal point towards the random, tumultuous thoughts that grow in your mind naturally. This form of meditation allows you to explore the infinite possibilities of your mind and the freedom it experiences. Whichever mode of meditation you choose, you will certainly find yourself to be more at peace and more in love with yourself and life, once you embrace the holistic development of your mind and soul at Nimba Nature Cure Village.
