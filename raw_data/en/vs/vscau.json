If we don't find constructive, healthy ways to cope, our bodies and minds will eventually start showing signs that stress is taking its toll, whether we admit it or not. If you are comfortable acknowledging the stress, or are attempting to keep your feelings below the surface, there are steps you can take to lessen the impact on your body and stay healthy mentally, physically, and emotionally. You have probably heard of the mind-body-spirit connection, but might not be sure what it means and how it affects your well-being. Mind-body-spirit means that our wellness comes not just from physical health, but from mental health and spiritual health as well. To be \"healthy,\" we must pay attention to all three aspects of our nature. Here are some examples of the mind-body-spirit connection: - Many of us will get a headache when we are stressed - that is a perfect example of how your mind is affecting your body. - People who exercise regularly - whether it's a daily walk, a long run, an hour of yoga, or time in the gym strength training - will often experience depression if their exercise routine is interrupted by injury, travel, or anything that prohibits them from getting the activity their body has come to expect and rely on for stress relief. - Are you a \"stress eater?\" I am sure many people who working from home or who have had their normal routines disrupted during this time are facing that challenge today. - Remember that amazing feeling you had last time you pampered yourself by having a massage, getting your nails done, or having you hair cut, colored, and styled? That's your mind and your body and possibly even your spirit all working together to make you feel great. - People with a strong faith who practice their faith feel good after they attend services or perform their regular devotions. They feel \"whole,\" happy, and focused. The main concept behind the mind-body-spirit connection is that we are all more than just our thoughts. We are also our bodies, our emotions, and our spirituality ... all these things combine to give us identity, determine our health, and make us who we are. Chances are, if you look at your own belief system, you'll find bits and pieces of the mind-body-spirit connection already in place. Today a mix and match approach works for many people - combining traditional medicine with complementary medicine therapies, adding in exercise and meditation along with religious practice. It's not required that you go \"all in\" with one or another. A day of yoga complements your sessions with a therapist, as does your morning run, your healthy diet, or even your regular visits to the nail salon. Here are a few things that you may not have tried that might be helpful in adding to your mix and a few links to resources if you'd like to learn more: Yoga Today there are yoga options out there for every age and fitness level. In addition to various types of yoga practices, there are adaptions like chair yoga, which is a great option for those with balance, flexibility, or other physical concerns. For more information on the different types of yoga commonly practiced, [GIAIM](https://www.gaiam.com/blogs/discover/a-beginners-guide-to-8-major-styles-of-yoga) is a good resource. There are also plenty of free online yoga classes on YouTube - give one a try! Mindfulness Meditation Modeled after the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program created in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn to help counter stress, chronic pain, and other ailments, mindfulness courses can be found everywhere - including instruction and guidance on-line. Its popularity has been supported by a growing body of research showing that it reduces stress and anxiety and improves attention and memory. Mindfulness has also been shown to reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and brain activity. [Mindful](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) is a great online resource to learn more about the practice and to take part in some guided meditations but there are many great mindfulness resources out there. Other ideas to keep your mind, body, and spirit in tune and bring some fun and joy into your days: - Start a journal to record your emotions. - Laughter is the best medicine. Watch a comedy - a fun movie or an online stand-up comedy routine. - Feng Shui your home or clean out your closets - it will make you feel great and you can donate what you don't need anymore. - Treat yourself to a home spa day - a facial, mani, and pedi. - Reach to old friends - through Skype, Facebook, or FaceTime. - Make plans to do something special when we can resume normal activities again. A night out with friends, a weekend getaway, or an evening at the movies will all feel like a treat. - Make an online donation to your favorite charity. - Try a new recipe. - Spend some extra quality time with your pets! - Gather all your friends online - download the Zoom Cloud Meeting app and have a virtual disco party. These tools and tips are useful even after the current crisis passes. When we return to our usual routines - work, school, sports, and other activities - you will find that your newfound awareness of the mind-body-spirt connection and the skills you've learned will continue to bring more balance and wellness to your life.
