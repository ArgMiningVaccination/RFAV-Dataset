(Feb. 20, 2013) - Hill's Pet Nutrition is unveiling the [Hill's Ideal Balance brand](/ideal-balance) and line of food for dogs and cats that combines natural ingredients with the Hill's perfectly balanced nutrition that consumers trust. The new Hill's Ideal Balance will be the first new brand from Hill's since the launch of Science Diet\u00ae in 1968. \"We are excited to introduce the Hill's Ideal Balance brand that gives consumers an unprecedented natural pet food choice,\" said Hill's U.S. President Kostas Kontopanos. \"Hill's Ideal Balance maintains the promise of advanced nutrition crafted by pet nutritionists and is the new natural brand of pet food guaranteed to be perfectly balanced.\" The new Hill's Ideal Balance dog and cat food formulas feature: - Fresh Chicken or Natural Salmon to help keep pets slim and trim (1st ingredient) - Brown Rice for healthy digestion - Fruits and Vegetables for a healthy immune system - No corn, wheat or soy - Grain-free options for dogs and cats - Dry foods that are made in the USA in Hill's own manufacturing facilities - 100% balanced nutrition, guaranteed or your money back \"A more precise understanding of ingredient preferences helped us develop a natural pet food that reflects what pet parents told us they want while ensuring the right nutrition for pets,\" said Kontopanos. \"The result is a new natural pet food choice that delivers on all the expectations of the natural shopper. Even in natural foods, it is important not to have too much or too little of key nutrients. Hill's Ideal Balance delivers perfectly balanced nutrition for pets' overall health.\" In designing the new formulas, Hill's sought significant consumer input to better understand ingredient preferences. Hill's team of pet nutritionists then leveraged this research into the careful selection of high-quality ingredients to create great tasting pet food recipes with optimal levels of over 50 nutrients. Varieties were developed for life stage (puppy/kitten, adult and mature), size (small and large breed for dogs) and grain-free. In addition to the dry food selection, the new Hill's Ideal Balance line also features 12 new wet food varieties: six each for cat and dog. To offer pet parents a wide variety of protein sources, Hill's is also introducing new ones like Venison, Trout and Salmon. Like all Hill's products, Ideal Balance wet foods have been formulated to Association of American Feed Control Officials' (AAFCO) strict guidelines, as well as Hill's precise nutrient profiles, to offer perfectly balanced nutrition. The wet foods can be served as wholesome balanced diets by themselves or can be fed in addition to dry foods, following the feeding guide on the labels. Along with these changes, pet parents will see unique, break-through packaging and can now find Ideal Balance in the natural food sections of most specialty pet food retailers. Hill's began shipping the new product to pet retailers and veterinarians this month. In addition to its commitment to evidence-based nutrition, Hill's has made significant investments in food safety with manufacturing and quality procedures that are modeled after human food practices. Hill's products are developed in its Global Hill's Pet Nutrition Center in Topeka, Kansas by an international team of 150 veterinarians and pet nutrition scientists. Hill's Ideal Balance dry pet food is manufactured in Hill's own facilities, using high quality ingredients sourced from North America and Europe and under the supervision of Hill's employees to ensure industry-leading food safety.
