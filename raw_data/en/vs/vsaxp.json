The Arizona Supreme Court [recently granted the state's request to set a briefing schedule for Frank Atwood](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-breaking/2022/04/08/attorneys-death-row-prisoners-clarence-dixon-and-frank-atwood-question-safety-effectiveness-arizonas/9518633002/), who was sentenced to death in Pima County in 1987 for the murder of an 8-year-old girl, Vicki Lynne Hoskinson. Atwood is currently being held in the Browning Unit at the Eyman State Prison Complex in Florence. In early May, the Court will have a conference where they could decide whether to grant a warrant and set a date for Atwood's execution. Should that occur, Atwood, who practices the Greek Orthodox faith, wants his priest to be able to lay hands on him and pray over him during the execution. The current Department of Corrections protocols allow for a spiritual adviser to speak with the prisoner in the death chamber from another room via microphone, but do not allow them to be in the same room as the prisoner. Attorneys for Atwood filed a complaint this week in the United States District Court of Arizona, Tucson Division, claiming the DOC protocols would violate his constitutional rights. They are asking the federal court to stay any pending execution warrant from the state supreme court until the DOC changes their execution protocols to allow the spiritual adviser in the room and to place his hands on Atwood during prayer. In the complaint, Atwood's attorneys highlight his history of devout faith. \"Although he is incarcerated on Arizona's death row, he observes a strict schedule of prayer and study at the direction of his priest, Father Paisios, Abbot of the St. Anthony's Greek Orthodox Monastery in Florence, who baptized him into the faith in July 2000,\" the attorneys wrote. The complaint states Paisios has visited and ministered to Atwood regularly for many years \"despite, at different points, imposition by the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation & Reentry of unlawful impediments.\" According to the complaint, the current DOC execution protocols violate Atwood's rights under the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. \"Mr. Atwood seeks the modification of ADCRR's Execution Protocol to comport with his religious exercise under the law,\" said his attorney, Joseph Perkovich. \"Should he face execution, he seeks to do so in a manner consistent with fundamental tenets of his devout Greek Orthodox faith. He seeks the ability for his longtime spiritual advisor to administer last rights to him as the State would attempt to put him to death.\" The Supreme Court [recently ruled in favor of a death row prisoner in Texas](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-5592_feah.pdf) who challenged the state prison system's ban on the practice of a spiritual adviser laying hands on the prisoner during an execution. Writing the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said the prisoner \"is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief because he will be unable to engage in protected religious exercise in the final moments of his life.\" The Arizona Department of Corrections declined to comment pending litigation.
