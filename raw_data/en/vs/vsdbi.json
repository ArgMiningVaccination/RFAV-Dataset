The writer met with Dr. William Fair in his Upper East Side office, where he still practices. He's 63 and has incurable colon cancer, but he has decided to push past the usual methods of cancer treatment and seek out alternative treatments. Most cancer therapies are generic, but Dr. Fair is convinced that his best chance lies in customizing his therapy. So far the results have been very encouraging. Dr. Fair spent 13 years (1984-1997) as chairman of urology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he specialized in tumors of the prostate, bladder, testis, and kidney. In 1994, he began suffering from fatigue and dizziness, and he was diagnosed with cancer. After an unsuccessful surgical attempt to remove the cancer revealed that it had spread to his lymph nodes, Dr. Fair was given a 40% chance of living past the next 5 years. He then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy for over a year. But in 1997, a follow-up CAT scan showed the cancer growing in a lymph node near his liver. He was told by his doctors that the standard methods of treatment had been exhausted; his chances of being alive in 5 years plummeted to 1 in 10. He turned to Dr. Skip Heston, the principal laboratory scientist in Sloan-Kettering's urology department, and Heston obtained a piece of Fair's cancer for his lab. The writer describes the difficult process of transporting the cancer undisturbed to the lab and then nourishing its growth in order to study it. Heston discovered a specific derangement of a gene called p53 within the cancer. He then injected some of the cancer cells into immune-deficient mice on which he could test new kinds of treatment. After resigning his chair in the spring of 1997, Dr. Fair began to look into remedies offered by alternative medicine; he began a regular program of yoga, meditation, prayer, vitamins, and a high-soy, low-fat diet. In early August of 1997, however, another CAT scan revealed a new mass of cancer in the lymph node near the liver; this indicated that Dr. Fair's tumor was particularly aggressive. Dr. Fair decided to try two alternative agents--one a Chinese herb called SPES, and the other a tumor vaccine. The writer describes the development of both agents. Dr. Fair met Dr. Sophie Chen, a biophysicist and a professor at New York Medical College, at a cancer charity meeting in Lake Tahoe, in September of 1997. She told him about an herbal preparation for prostate cancer called PC-SPES that she was studying with Professor Xu-Hui Wang, the director of traditional Chinese medicine at Shanghai Medical University. Apparently, it restrained certain mutant genes in prostate-tumor cells and hastened their death. Dr. Fair approached Dr. Wang, who gave him the parent preparation, SPES, and suggested that it might work against tumors that had a p53 mutation. When the herb was given to Dr. Heston's cancerous mice, their tumors shrunk by 50%. Dr. Fair soon began taking SPES and in July of this year, a CAT scan showed that his cancer had shrunk and there were no new deposits anywhere. The writer describes Dr. Ronald Levy's work in creating a first-generation tumor vaccine. Dr. Levy, a specialist in lymphoma at Stanford, isolated a unique signature protein in lymphoma patients called idiotypic immunoglobulin and developed an antibody against it which appeared to cure the cancer. A major initiative launched in conjunction with IDEC Pharmaceuticals in 1986 showed that more than 3/4s of patients saw significant shrinkage of their tumors when given the vaccine. Unfortunately, while the results were promising, the costs of customized therapy were too great for the approach to be practical. Dr. Fair turned to Dr. Eli Gilboa, at Duke, for help in creating a customized tumor vaccine. Dr. Gilboa created a vaccine that presented the full range of mutated proteins in Dr. Fair's tumor, and it is now in a laboratory refrigerator at Duke. Dr. Fair hopes that one day customized therapy will be available to everyone, but the writer is skeptical about the possibility of this occurring. Dr. Fair has decided to do as much as possible with alternative therapies before using the vaccine. "}
