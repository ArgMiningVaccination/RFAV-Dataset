Throughout the development of the policies and processes cited in this document, we have: Given due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation, to advance equality of opportunity, and to foster good relations between people who share a relevant protected characteristic (as cited under the Equality Act 2010) and those who do not share it; and Given regard to the need to reduce i nequalities between patients in access to, and outcomes from healthcare services and to ensure services are provided in an integrated way where this might reduce health inequalities Plain Language Summary About ulcerative colitis (UC) Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long -term condition that mainly affects the bowel. Some people may develop symptoms that affect other body parts as well. The cause of UC is unknown and it can develop at any age, although peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 ye ars. Symptoms of active disease can include bloody diarrhoea, an urgent need to defaecate (poo) and abdominal (tummy) pain. UC is a lifelong disease that is associated with significant impact on patients' lives. It can also affect a person's social and men tal wellbeing, particularly if poorly controlled. UC has 2 phases which are called active and remission (inactive ). There are two different treatments depending on the phase of the disease, treatment of a ctive disease (inducing remission) or treatment aimed at maintaining remission . For this policy, refractory UC is defined as patients whose disease do es not respond to the use of anti -TNF alpha , or has stopped responding to the treatment (NICE, 2013). 4 About current treatments Treatment is largely to relieve symptoms rather than cure. For mild disease , two types of therapies are generally used : aminosalicylates or steroids . For moderate to severe disease , add on therapy with stronger immunosuppressive medications such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin are used , a Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha inhibitor can be used in severe , active UC. For children who have failed all the treatment as stated above , there is no alternative licensed therapy . These patients may be dependent on long-term steroids or require surgical interventions . About the new treatment Vedolizumab is a biological medicine given through intravenous infusions. It targets a protein found on the surface of certain white blood cells involved in causing inflammation in the gut . It is licensed for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC as the fourth line treatment . Vedolizumab is not licensed for this indication in children . What we have decided Vedolizumab is licensed for use in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and access is defined in NICE Technology Appraisal 342 Vedolizumab for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Vedolizumab is not licensed for this indication in children . As such, access for post pubescent children may be considered in line with the criteria in NHS England 's Commissioning Medicines for Children in Specialised Services policy (NHS England 170001/P, 2017). NHS England has carefully reviewe d the evidence to treat refractory ulcerative colitis with vedolizumab in pre-pube scent children in this policy . We have concluded that there is not enough evidence to make the treatment available at this time. 5 2 Introduction This document describes the evidence that has been considered by NHS England in formulating a proposal to not routinely commission vedolizumab . For the purpose of consultation NHS England invites views on the evidence and other information that has been taken into account as described in this policy proposition. A final decision as to whether vedolizumab for refractory ulcerative colitis in pre- pube scent children will be not for routine commissioning will made by NHS England following a recommendation from the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group. 3 Proposed Intervention and Clinical Indication Background UC is a chronic, inflammatory condition which affects the bowels. The cause of UC is unknown. It can develop at any age, although peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 years. UC is a lifelong disease that is associated with significant morbidity. It can also affect a person's social and psychological wellbeing, particularly if poorly controlled. UC usually affects the rectum and the colon proximal to the rectum. Symptoms of active disease can include bloody diarrhoea, an urgent need to defaecate and abdominal pain. Typically, it has a relapsing -remitting pattern. Current treatment The aim of treatment is to manage symptoms rather than cure, and active treatment of acute disease (inducing remission) should be distinguished from preventing relaps e (maintaining remission) (NICE,2013). To induc e remission, NICE recommends the following: First line - Aminosalicylates, followed by corticosteroids. Second line - Aminosalicylates and corticosteroi ds can be given in combination. Tacrolimus or ciclospo rin can be considered. 6 Third line - Infliximab, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitor can be used for severely active UC after the failure of conventional therapy in children and young people . Proposed intervention Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that reduces gastrointestinal inflammation in people with UC. Vedolizumab is a gut -selective immunosuppressive biologic that binds specifically to the 47 integrin. The 47 integrin is expressed on a subset of memory T helper lymphocytes which migrate into the gastrointestinal tract and cause inflammation that is characteristic of UC (vedolizumab, summary of product characteristics). Vedolizumab is licensed for treating moderate to severe active UC or Crohn's disease in adults and access is defined as per NICE Technology Appraisal 342 Vedolizumab for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. NHS England has carefully reviewed t he evidence to treat . Vedolizumab is not licensed for this indication in children under 18 years . Access for post pubescent children may be considered in line with the criteria in NHS England 's Commissioning Medicines for Children in Specialised Services policy (NHS England 170001/P, 2017). This policy therefore considers the use of vedolizumab to treat refractory Crohn's disease in pre -pubescent children. 4 Definitions Children and young people (CYP) - This policy refers to children and young people of 3-18 years. Pre-pubescent children - A child or young person in the years prior to puberty, as determined by clinical judgement. Colectomy - This refers to the surgica l removal of all or part of the colon, also known 7 as bowel resection. Inflam matory bowel disease (IBD) - This refers to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both causes inflammation in the bowels. Immunosuppressive medications - This is a group of medication that acts by suppressing the immune system. Examples are aminosalicylates ( 5- aminosalicylic acid, colitis activity index (PUC AI) - A scoring system that evaluates UC disease activity. A score of 0 to 85 with 0 to 10: remission, 10 to 34: mild disease, 35 to 64 : mode rate disease and 65 and above : severe disease. Refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) - This means there is high ulcerative c olitis disease activity despite conventional pharmacological treatment, including inadequate response to or loss of response to TNF alpha inhibitor treatment. Steroids - This intravenous hydrocortisone. Stool / Faecal calprotectin - This measures the level of the protein calprotectin in the stool. Increased calprotectin is a sign of inflammation in the intestine. Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors - This refers to a group of biological medicat ion that blocks a pro -inflammatory molecule, TNF alpha , in the body. An example of this is infliximab. Ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) - This is a measure of endoscopic response in ulcerative colitis. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 8 and takes vascular pattern, bleeding, erosions, and ulcers into account. Endoscopic remission is d efined as a UCEIS score of 0. Unclassified inflammatory bowel disease - This is a classification of inflammatory 8 bowel disease where there are features of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. 5 Aims and Objectives This policy proposition consi dered: Vedolizumab for the treatment of refractory ulcerative colitis in pre-pubescent children. It does not cover post pubescent children in whom access will be considered in line with the NHS England 's Commissioning Medicines for Children in Specialised Services policy (NHS England 170001/P, 2017) . The objectives were to: Ensure evidence -based commissioning in the use of vedolizumab as an add - on therapy to standard care. Assess the efficacy, safety, toxicity profile, cost -effectiveness of vedolizumab. Evaluate whether vedolizumab achieved improved outcomes in comparison with current treatments. 6 Epidemiology and Needs Assessment The incidence o f UC in CYP is increasing worldwide, ranging f rom 10.6 in the USA to 15 per 100,000 person years in Europe ( S\u00fdkora et al , 2018) . In England the estimated incidence is 2.6 per 100,000 person -years . Population studies such as Benchimol EI et al estimate the prevalence of UC to be 10.7 per 100,000 population (Benchimol EI et al, 2017 ). It is anti cipated that around 30% CYP with Ulcerative Colitis will require escalation to TNF alpha inhibitor treatment, out of which, 10% will fail the treatment or not maintain a response and require vedoliz umab (Ashton et al , 2018) . In paediatric - onset UC, the genetic component is more dominant and recurrence within the family is more prevalent than in adults (Polito II JM et al, 1996; Griffiths AM, 2004) . Childhood is a time of dynamic physical changes, bone accrual and growth along with emotional maturation. Paediatric IBD is also more often extensive and is associated with a more aggressive disease course , including a greater propensity for disease exten sion and immunomodulation ( Van -Massouille G et al, 2008; Pigneur B et al 2010). 9 7 Evidence Base NHS England has concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to support a proposal for the routine commissioning of this treatment for the indication for children . An evidence review was undertaken to establish the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost -effectiveness of vedolizumab compared to standard care in the treatment of refractory ulcerative colitis in CYP of 3-18 years. However, the policy provides a commiss ioning position for pre -pubescent children only, as access for older children will be provided in line with the NHS England 's Commissioning Medicines for Children in Specialised Services policy (NHS England 170001/P, 2017) . This evidence review includes 1 retrospective observational study (Ledder et al. 2017). An overview of the results for clinical effectiveness and safety and tolerability can be found in the evidence summary table . The research questions for the evidence review and the key outcomes iden tified in the scope are discussed in this section. The evidence presented in this review does not provide any data comparing the clinical effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab with any other treatment for the management of ulcerative colitis in children and young people. All outcomes in this evidence review are graded C. Clinical effectiveness This section considers whether vedolizumab is clinically effective in children and young people with refractory ulcerative colitis. Results are presented for the combined group of 41 children and young people with ulcerative colitis (33 participants) and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease (8 participants). The results for stool calprotectin and endoscopy were for a subgroup of children and young people with ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Remission and clinical response : 10 In the retr ospective observational study by Ledder et al. (2017), steroid -free remission was observed in 37% (15/41) children and young people at 14 weeks. At 22 weeks steroid -free remission was seen in 34% (14/41). Three children and young people who were in remissi on at week 14 were not in remission at week 22. Two children and young people who were not in remission at week 14 were in remission at week 22. Steroid use : Ledder et al. (2017) reported that 69% (27/39) of children and young people used corticosteroids at baseline compared with 26% (9/34) at week 14. The authors also reported a reduction in median dose of corticosteroid at week 14 compared with baseline, 12.5 mg (IQR 10 to 20 mg) at week 14 compared with 25 mg (IQR 20 to 40 mg) at baseline. No statistica l analysis was reported. Surgery : Ledder et al. (2017) found that 15% (6/41) of children and young people needed colectomy during the follow -up period (median 24 months). Only one participant had had surgery before starting vedolizumab. Stool calprotectin : Stool calprotectin was measured in 20/41 children and young people at baseline and follow -up. There was a median decrease in calprotectin levels of 518 micrograms/g (IQR 202 to 2,327 mcg/g). clinical remission with stool calprotectin <100 micrograms/g, was seen in 30% (6/20) of children and young people in whom stool calprotectin was measured. Endoscopic assessment : Colonoscopic assessment was carried out for 13/41 children and young people at baseline and follow -up. Two of 13 (15%) achieved mucosal healing at follow -up (defined as an ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity [UCEIS] score of zero). Safety and tolerability This section considers whether vedolizumab is safe in children and young people 11 with refractory ulcerative colitis. Results are presented for the combined group of 64 children and young people with ulcerative colitis (n=33), Crohn's disease (n=23) or unclassified inflammatory bowel disease (n=8). No serious medicines -related adverse event s were reported and 3 minor adverse events were reported (n=64). These were: otitis externa with periorbital oedema, intractable itch, and mild shortness of breath. Discontinuation of vedolizumab was only necessary in the young person who developed intract able itch. It is not possible to say if these adverse events were in children and young people with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease because the safety results were not reported separately. Vedolizumab was discontinued in 22% (14/64) of children and young people in the follow -up period. Most discontinuations (13/14) were because of poor response. As described above 1 participant discontinued treatment because of intractable itch, which resolved when vedolizumab was stopped. It is not possible to say how many discontinuations were in children and young people with ulcerative colitis because the results for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were not reported separately. Adverse effect information from the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) derived from use in adults can also be used to predict the type of adverse effects likely to be seen in children. Vedolizumab is contraindicated in people with active severe infections for example, active tuberculosis. The SmPC on vedolizumab also includes special warnings and precautions for use including: potential increased risk of infection and malignancy, hypersensitivity reactions, administration of vaccines, and prior use of biologics. Based on clinical studies and post -marketing experience with vedolizumab, the following adverse reactions are listed as being very common (incidence greater than 1 in 10): nasopharyngitis, headache and arthralgia. Other adverse effects seen commonly (incidence between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100) include upper respir atory tract infections, paraesthesia, hypertension, cough, gastrointestinal effects such as dyspepsia and nausea, as well as pyrexia, fatigue and muscle pain. For more information on these see the SmPC. 12 Cost -effectiveness This section considers whether ve dolizumab is cost effective in children and young people with refractory ulcerative colitis. No studies were identified during literature searches (see search strategy for full details) that compared the cost -effectiveness of vedolizumab with no treatment or standard treatment in children or young people with ulcerative colitis. The study included in this evidence review does not include an outcome investigating cost - effectiveness . 8 Proposed Criteria for Commissioning Not applicable 9 Proposed Patient Pathway Not applicable 10 Proposed Governance Arrangements Not applicable 11 Proposed Mechanism for Funding Not applicable 12 Proposed Audit Requirements Not applicable 13 Documents That Have Informed This Policy Proposition NHS England . 2019.
