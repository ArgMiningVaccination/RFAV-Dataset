We recommend that patients follow their doctor's guidance in regard to ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is becoming one of the most popular herbal supplements in the US. Consumers use it for stress relief, hormone support, and adaptogenic effects. But how long does ashwagandha take to work? Does it cause effects after the first dose, or does it need to be used for weeks or months to notice an effect? What do research studies say? And what do real users say? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze medical studies on ashwagandha supplementation to determine how long ashwagandha takes to work. We'll also feature real ashwagandha user reviews along with our picks for clean ashwagandha brands. What do Medical Studies Say? Ashwagandha supplementation has been tested in a large number of medical studies. A 2012 clinical trial found ashwagandha to be effective for reducing stress and anxiety in adults after 60 days of continuous use. A 2013 clinical trial found that ashwagandha increased testosterone levels in men after 90 days of continuous use. A clinical trial published in the Cureus journal reported that ashwagandha improved sexual function in women after eight weeks of continual use. Based on the available research, it appears that ashwagandha may take around 2-3 months to impart its full effect. Some beneficial effects may be experienced in less than this timeframe, but researchers typically allow this duration to test the maximal effects of the herb. It's also notable that in the vast majority of clinical trials we surveyed on ashwagandha while researching this article, participants were consuming the herb daily. So research seems to suggest that it takes 2-3 months to have a significant effect, but how do real users describe how long it took them to feel the effects of ashwagandha? We'll feature some unsponsored user reviews in the next section. Real Users Try Ashwagandha A YouTube creator named \"pigmie\" tried ashwagandha for 30 days and shared his experience: A YouTube creator named Dalati tried ashwagandha for a full year, and reports on whether he continued to experience benefits or if there were downsides beyond a certain point: How Long Can You Take Ashwagandha? Readers who have reached this point in the article may be wondering: ashwagandha may increase in effectiveness over months of continual use, but is it proven to be safe to take for long periods of time? Ashwagandha was shown to be safe and well-tolerated when taken for 90 days continuously in a 2021 clinical trial. A meta-study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology analyzed data from 69 trials on ashwagandha and concluded the following: \"(Aswagandha) appears a promising safe and effective traditional medicine.\" We have not come across any clinical trials testing the safety of continuous ashwagandha use for a year or longer. Unfortunately, it's extremely expensive to fund such long-duration trials. It may be worthwhile to speak to a doctor if you're considering long-term use of ashwagandha.
