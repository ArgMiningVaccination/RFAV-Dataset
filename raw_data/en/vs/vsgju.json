We aim to explore the relationship between allopathic medicine and other healing practices such as homeopathic treatments, naturopathy, chiropraction, acupuncture, musical therapy, etc. - Learn and educate about natural remedies, whether evidence-based or non-evidence based, from various cultural groups. We believe this will facilitate cultural competency and hence help us better serve the diverse patient population of Boston Medical Center. "}
