Guided by our core value, \"Live Innovation\", we explored methods and resources to improve processes and achieve higher standards of work. We encouraged creative thinking for better results as we believe that in doing so, there is much to be gained by our staff as well as by the public and our stakeholders. Some of our major achievements over the year include: Refining Our Regulatory Framework The Health Products Regulation Group recently launched two new schemes for medical devices. The Priority Review Scheme is a pro- enterprise and industry-friendly initiative that provides companies with an option for faster registration and market entry of their products, potentially reducing the processing time by 40 days or more. This is especially relevant for innovative medical devices targeting national healthcare priorities or unmet clinical needs. The Pre-market Consultation Scheme offers medical device developers, manufacturers and suppliers regulatory advice concerning a new product. The advice can be sought during the various stages of development, from conception to product registration. Another notable change in our regulatory framework is the lifting of the ban on the herb Corydalis Yanhusuo, which contains the naturally occurring substance tetrahydropalmatine or THP . This comes after a comprehensive review, which indicates that such products when manufactured and used appropriately pose no major safety concerns. Safeguarding the National Blood Supply As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the safety of our blood supply, the Blood Services Group (BSG) introduced a new initiative to use male-only plasma products for transfusion. This decision was based on studies which showed that the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury is more than halved with plasma products derived only from male donors. This reduction may be related to the lower incidence of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in males compared to female donors. Additionally, BSG implemented a process to automatically transmit pre-transfusion test results obtained from laboratory equipment directly into the computer database system. This eliminates errors from manual entry. New Scientific Capabilities A key challenge faced in analysing exhibits from female victims in sexual assault cases is that the male perpetrators' DNA is often masked by the victim's DNA. To overcome this obstacle, the Applied Sciences Group developed a novel analysis method that targets the Y chromosome, found only in the DNA of males. This allows for specific detection of the male perpetrator's DNA, helping to generate potential investigation leads for law enforcement. Our Food Safety Laboratory has developed four new analytical methods to test for new and emerging harmful substances found in food. These substances include tropane alkaloids found in cereals and cereal-based food, and amatoxin from mushrooms. These substances affect the heart rate and the central nervous system, and can result in fatality. In the area of toxicology drug screening, I am pleased to say that our customised commercial solution known as Toxtyper, implemented in April 2017, has so far helped us to cut processing time significantly. The higher sensitivity of this instrument allows us to detect more drugs, including plant poisons and previously undetectable synthetic cannabinoids. Enhancing Career Pathways As our committed and capable staff add value to HSA's work, we also strive to add value to their lives. One of the ways we do this is by ensuring that they find fulfilment and meaning in their job through our continued review of their career tracks and roles. A review of the minimum educational qualification requirements was recently concluded and greater emphasis given to competency requirements. Staff with the newly defined minimum educational Chairman ' s Message qualification requirements and appropriate accreditation or professional certification of competence can be considered for specific positions for which they could not be considered before. This increased focus on competencies ensures that the skills and knowledge of our staff are kept relevant to current needs. We are also expanding the roles of our blood donation nurses who play a key role in blood collection. HSA aims to prepare selected nurses to take on the role of Clinical Nurse Leaders through training. Additionally, some nurses were given scholarships to pursue the Advanced Diploma in Medical-Surgical Nursing. These newly-defined roles will contribute to enhancing donor safety and blood supply safety in areas such as pre- donation screening, and handling of post-donation adverse events. The importance and value of our staff cannot be emphasised enough. Their passion and commitment not only help us to remain at our most efficient, but are, ultimately, the driving force in our vision to protect and advance national health and safety. Through all these exciting developments in regulation, blood supply, scientific innovation and career path evolution, I am confident that HSA is well-equipped to provide value and service to our stakeholders and the community, even as we move boldly into the years ahead. PROFESSOR SATKUNANANTHAM S/O KANDIAH ---- CHAIRMANGuided by our core value, \"Live Innovation\", we explored methods and resources to improve processes and achieve higher standards of work. We encouraged creative thinking for better results as we believe that in doing so, there is much to be gained by our staff as well as by the public and our stakeholders. 8 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 9 Our Changing World Science and technology are fast evolving, bringing great change to our world and impacting the way we live. As the leading authority in the field of health sciences, we are feeling the full force of these disruptions. Many new products such as telehealth devices, 3D printed drugs and cell therapy are entering the global market at an accelerated pace. These innovative products bring with them new benefits to patients and new regulatory challenges. Smart yet disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet-of- things and robotics, are increasing our efficiency and productivity, but are also requiring us to pick up new skills and adopt new ways of doing things. Even the demands of consumers are evolving; many are demanding faster responses and greater convenience. Our Transformation Plans To be future-ready, we need to speed up our transformation journey. We have placed greater emphasis on research and innovation to revolutionise our services and processes. We are also reviewing our existing regulatory frameworks to meet current needs, and developing new ones to meet evolving and future needs. Our initiatives include: Implementing Transformation To drive strategic transformation across the organisation, we have set up a Transformation Working Group (TWG). It will help to identify areas of synergy, and streamline efforts and initiatives across HSA. TWG will also play a vital role in helping to future- proof our workforce by identifying the critical competencies needed to support new technologies and growth areas. Reviewing Our Regulatory Frameworks As an enabler and a gatekeeper, HSA needs to strike a balance between allowing faster access to life-saving therapies and products, while ensuring that public health and safety are not compromised. Cell, tissue and gene therapy products (CTGTPs) such as cellular immunotherapies, cancer vaccines and stem cell therapies are a novel class of health products that can bring about better outcomes or even cures for certain diseases. There is a rich research pipeline and many are now being developed commercially for clinical use. We are thus developing a new CTGTP regulatory framework that is forward-looking and fit for purpose. Digital technology is another area that has advanced rapidly. To ensure transparency and clarity to players in the telehealth field, we have published a set of guidelines to help them identify which types of products are regulated as medical devices, as well as provided relevant advisory statements to be included for products not intended for medical purposes. A good example of HSA's dynamic and astute approach to regulation can be seen from our assessment of the first dengue vaccine. We were the sole regulator recommending sero-testing to identify patients who had never had a previous dengue infection, as they would be at higher risk of severe dengue if vaccinated. Eighteen months post-approval, new data from the company confirmed this assessment, and sero-testing is now recommended by the company in all countries where the vaccine has been approved. Adopting Automation Automation and robotics are helping us to mitigate resource challenges by improving staff productivity, reducing manpower needs and enhancing the quality of our products. For example, through the implementation of a fully robotic system for sample preparation and instrument analysis, our Applied Sciences Group's (ASG) Analytical Toxicology Laboratory has managed to cut down the process of detecting monoacetylmorphine (a biomarker for heroin consumption) in urine from two days to three hours. Another area where automation made a difference is in the dissolution of illicit drug samples for quantitation. By adopting an automated syringe dispenser into the process, we have managed to improve the accuracy of results and increase efficiency five-fold. Our Blood Services Group (BSG) is also working with the Nanyang Technological University to build an automated system for blood processing, testing, distribution and inventory management. Implementing Digitalisation To spearhead our digitalisation journey, we have set up a steering committee to coordinate and drive digitalisation projects within HSA. These projects include the use of artificial intelligence by the Health Products Regulation Group. Through this pilot project, we are experimenting with chatbots for round-the-clock handling of email queries, as well as machine learning to match a user's query with draft answers in the database. For BSG, the experience of blood donors is being improved through the 3E initiative - e-Registration, e-Rebooking and e-Feedback. Donors are now able to book medical appointments, as well as provide feedback conveniently using e-portals and self-help kiosks. Digitalisation has also enabled ASG's Pharmaceutical Division to conveniently retrieve data on demand, and do away with manual printouts. Using LabX 2017, the efficiency and traceability of their daily work processes have been greatly enhanced. Leveraging on Data Analytics and Behavioural Insights To better inform our decision making, our Data Analytics Core Team (DACT) is helping to equip our officers with data analytics and behavioural insights (BI) skills. To date, DACT has already completed a few pilot projects, with more on the way. Starting with simple data analysis and visualisations, we are now steadily progressing towards more complex predictive analytics. A BI Working Group has also been formed to champion the use of BI. One notable project was the redesign of the blood donor health assessment questionnaire. The result is a smoother and easier form-filling experience for our donors. Our Future Ahead There are many exciting developments that we can look forward to - one is the upcoming launch of our revamped website. Using user experience and design thinking, we are adopting the perspective of our stakeholders to come up with a more functional and user-centric website, complete with self-help tools and chatbots to help people find answers quickly and easily. The rate of change is only going to get faster from here on. Nonetheless, I'm confident that HSA is well-prepared for the road that lies ahead. By living innovation, digitalisation and transformation, we can realise many opportunities to ensure the highest standards for health and safety in Singapore. DR CHOONG MAY LING, MIMI ---- CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERCEO' s MessageTo be future-ready, we need to speed up our transformation journey. We have placed greater emphasis on research and innovation to revolutionise our services and processes. We are also reviewing our existing regulatory frameworks to meet current needs, and developing new ones to meet evolving and future needs. 10 11 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 HSA BOARD As at August 2018 Professor Satkunanantham s/o Kandiah Chairman Health Sciences Authorit yMr Max Loh Managing PartnerASEAN and Singapore Ernst & Young Mr Tai Lee Siang ChairWorld Green Building CouncilMr Adam Abdur RahmanManaging DirectorHead of Contemporara Holdings Pte LtdProfessor Freddy BoeySenior Vice PresidentGraduate Education and Research Translation University of SingaporeProfessor Alex MatterChief Executive OfficerExperimental Holdings International Pte Ltd12 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 HSA Board Committees As at August 2018 Building Development Committee Chairman Mr Tai Lee Siang Chair World Green Building Council Co-Chairman Dr Choong May Ling, Mimi Chief Executive OfficerHealth Sciences Authority Members Mr Lionel Yee Woon Chin, SC Attorney-GeneralAttorney-General's Independent DirectorKeppel DC REIT Management Pte Ltd Mr Jeffrey Wong Group Director Corporate Services Group Assoc Professor Sunil Sethi Group Director Applied Sciences Group Assoc Professor Chan Cheng Leng Group Director Health Products Regulation Group Dr Ang Ai Leen Group Director Blood Services Group Ms Elizabeth Quah Group Director (Planning) Ministry of Health Mr Loke Mun Sing DirectorHealthcare Infrastructure Projects Division Ministry of Health Holdings Mr Hoong Bee Lok Visiting ConsultantHealth Sciences Authority Board Executive Committee Audit and Risk Committee Chairman Professor Satkunanantham s/o Kandiah MembersMrs Tan Li Lian Mr Adam Abdur Rahman Mr Alok Mishra Chairman Mr Max Loh Members Professor Freddy BoeyProfessor Alex Matter Mr Jimmy Phoon HSA Executive Committee (EXCO) As at August 2018 Dr Choong May Ling, Mimi Chief Executive Officer Assoc Professor Sunil SethiGroup Director Applied Sciences GroupAssoc Professor Chan Cheng LengGroup DirectorHealth Products Regulation Group Mr Jeffrey Wong Group DirectorCorporate Services Group Dr Ang Ai Leen Group DirectorBlood Services Group Dr Diana Teo Chairman Professional Board Senior Consultant Blood Services Group 14 15 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 Corporate Governance Statement The Board Board Members' Remuneration Notice and Declaration of Directorships and Interest in Shares and Debentures The HSA Board and Senior Management Team are committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance and complying with the recommendations set out by the Code of Corporate Governance.

PB looks at the professional development of staff and initiatives to promote a research and innovation culture. Career Track for Scientists and Regulatory Specialists We reviewed and updated the minimum educational qualification requirement in alignment with the government's move to focus on competency requirements. Now, staff with the appropriate accreditation or professional certification can be considered for specific positions. This focus on competencies ensures that the skills and knowledge of our staff are kept relevant to current needs instead of educational qualification that was attained in the past. Career Track for Technical Staff In support of the merger of the Health Sciences Professional and Technical Executive Schemes, we developed and implemented the Career Track for Technical Staff, which states the competencies requirement for each grade of Technical Staff. Professional Actualisation Training (PAT) Roadmaps We rolled out PAT roadmaps for staff to plan the training required for the competencies of their current and next grade. In this way, staff are empowered to manage and meet their career aspirations. There are four categories of trainings: Professional / Technical Training Management Training Overseas / Local Attachments Continuing Education PAT roadmaps for professionals such as nurses, forensic pathologists, transfusion medicine specialists and non-specialists were launched between September 2016 and 2017.Professional Career Tracks and Training Roadmaps Professional Critical Skills Identification Exercise This exercise was mooted by PB to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of trained professionals in areas critical for business continuity and sustainability. New Learning & Development key performance indicators were tracked over the year-in-review and linked to the acquisition of Professional Critical Skills. Professional Leadership Development Programme (PLDP) We developed an in-house programme, \"Channelling Leadership\" to give selected candidates an opportunity to realise their leadership potential with adequate guidance. PLDP consists of management training sessions, project work and informal coaching. This modular management training consists of three modules. A pilot run consisting of 20 promising officers from our four Professional Groups was launched in the first quarter of 2018. 22 23 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 Science and Innovation Day 2017 June 2017 The objective of this half-day event was to promote the culture of research and innovation in HSA, facilitate exchanging of scientific information and innovative ideas, and showcase and recognise staff who have contributed to research and innovation projects in HSA. 244 staff participated 65 abstracts accepted 6 projects awarded under the oral presentations category 5 best posters selected from each of the Research & Innovation categoriesEvent Highlights Continuing Professional Education Programmes Professional Education Lecture Series February 2017 - March 2018 Collaborations between HSA and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) May 2017 Organised by HSA and NTU, the inaugural Research Collaboration Workshop was co-chaired by Dr Choong May Ling, Mimi, CEO of HSA, Prof Russell Gruen, Executive Director of HealthTech NTU and Prof James Best, Dean of Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. The event was attended by close to 50 leaders and researchers from both institutions, who came together to discuss areas of mutual research interest, such as Robotics and Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Health Services Outcomes Research, Phenomics and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance applications. August 2017 HSA and NTU followed up with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This MOU creates many opportunities for further scientific knowledge exchange and potential research collaborations between the two institutions. The ultimate goal is to be able to leverage on each other's expertise to develop innovative solutions that will benefit national health and safety. 5 lectures on topics such as research ethics and behavioural insights Renowned speakers: Prof Alastair Campbell, Ms Rebecca Chew and Dr Serene Koh HSA Professional Staff Sharing Sessions Theme: DNA Across HSA Topics included: Biology in Crime Investigation, Molecular Testing for Infectious Disease and Clinical Applications of Gene EditingMore than 100 attendees per session Tea-time Tidbits February 2018 This is the start of a new programme of educational lectures that focuses on important aspects of professional practice that staff will find useful in their work. Event Highlights24 25 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 INCREASING EFFICIENCY BY STREAMLINING PROCESSES IMPLEMENTING NEW SCHEMES TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL DEVICES STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS TO RAISE REGULATORY STANDARDS One of our priorities at HSA is ensuring that health products in Singapore meet the relevant regulatory requirements of safety, efficacy and quality. In order to facilitate access to health products and to support innovation, we work together with stakeholders to understand the industry's perspectives, develop regulations that are forward-looking and fit for purpose, while ensuring that public health and safety are maintained.26 27ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18Knowledge and Innovation At HSA, we constantly review and update our regulatory frameworks and regulations so that they stay relevant and forward-looking. Updating Regulations on Chinese Proprietary Medicines (CPM) Corydalis Yanhusuo and CPM containing the naturally occurring substance tetrahydropalmatine (THP) have been disallowed for sale since 1995 due to overseas reports that they could cause liver toxicity when consumed. In June 2018, the ban on THP products was lifted following a review conducted by HSA and its expert panel. Results of the review indicated that THP-containing herbs posed no major safety concerns when used appropriately. Nevertheless, to ensure the safety of consumers, HSA will continue to monitor the safety and quality of CPM that contain these herbs by implementing cautionary labelling and dosing restrictions on these products.Notable Medical Products Approvals1. Zika Diagnostic TestsHSA has approved three diagnostic tests which will assist healthcare providers in managing the infection and spread of the Zika virus. Applications for these tests were first received in 2016 and 2017, when information on the epidemic was still maturing. 2. Glucose Monitoring System In 2017, HSA approved a first-in-class wearable flash glucose monitoring system for the management of diabetes mellitus. Supporting the Development of New Medical Devices Two new schemes were introduced in 2017 to support the development and early market entry of novel medical devices: 1. Priority Review Scheme Implemented in August 2017, this new scheme allows for faster registration of new medical devices to facilitate timely access to safe and quality medical devices in Singapore. As of December 2017, HSA received a total of six applications. 2. Pre-market Consultation Scheme Implemented in October 2017, this scheme allows stakeholders to seek early regulatory advice from HSA during the process of device development up to the pre-registration phase. As of December 2017, HSA received a total of seven consultation requests. Dengvaxia Update When HSA approved the world's first dengue vaccine application in 2016, it was recommended that sero-testing be done to determine whether a patient has had a past dengue infection before vaccination. This was based on HSA's assessment that there is a postulated risk of a higher incidence of severe dengue following vaccination in individuals who do not have previous dengue infection. One year post-approval, new data from Sanofi confirmed HSA's earlier assessment that there was indeed an increased risk of severe dengue in individuals without prior dengue exposure. The recommendation for sero-testing, which was previously only in place in Singapore, has been adopted by other countries where the vaccine is approved. Adding Clarity to Telehealth Product RegulationsIn September 2017, HSA published guidelines to provide clarity on the types of telehealth products that are regulated as medical devices. These guidelines will greatly facilitate the development of new and innovative high quality telehealth products, whilst safeguarding public health.28 29ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18Streamlining Our Work Processes Over the year-in-review, we made the following changes to our work processes to facilitate the regulatory filing process for our stakeholders. Easier Search for Class A Medical Devices (MD) An online searchable database has been set up on HSA's website to capture all non-sterile Class A MDs that are supplied by licensed importers and manufacturers in Singapore. This database allows consumers to search for licensed importers and manufacturers, as well as their associated Class A MDs. Increased Efficiency through Self-Help ToolAn interactive MD dealer online enquiry tool was launched as a trial project to help enquirers search for MD dealers, and locate the appropriate licences and regulatory requirements of different MDs. This self-help tool provides enquirers with quick and timely responses, while reducing the number of enquiries. Simplification of Cosmetic Products Notification We simplified the online notification form for cosmetic products to only require essential information needed for product traceability purposes. Other information relating to product supply and technical aspects could be submitted later, where necessary. Streamlined Process for Transfer of Licensed DealerA streamlined process was introduced to facilitate the transfer of CPM ownership from one licensed dealer to another. For products where there is no change of the manufacturer, dealers now only need to submit the list of products to be transferred, instead of having to submit a new listing application for each affected product.Facilitating the Filing of Therapeutic Product Dossiers A self-checking screening form was introduced to facilitate the applicants' compilation and filing of their product registration dossiers. In addition, the screening process was further streamlined through capping the number of rounds of screening queries at HSA's end and giving applicants a set period of time to respond to inquiries. Review of Processes to Reduce Investigation TimeTo enhance and optimise the efficiency of investigations into various regulatory contraventions, the Lean Six Sigma team conducted a thorough data analysis and studied measures to reduce the median time taken to resolve feedback and complaints by 20%. We have adopted some of the measures, which would enhance timely resolution of complaints. Faster Regulatory Approval of Changes to Registered Therapeutic ProductsHSA successfully implemented a new filing route - MIV-1 (minor variation-1) verification application route - for drug companies to file post-approval variation applications for registered therapeutic products. This initiative would improve process efficiency through greater leveraging of reference agencies' assessments and minimise duplication of effort. The processing timeline for these variation applications was reduced from 120 to 90 working days.30 31ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 HSA is a member of the Management Committee of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) - a voluntary group of regulators from around the world who have come together to facilitate international medical device regulatory harmonisation and convergence. We are involved in the following harmonisation workgroups:Partnership Development HighlightsGeneric Medicines Work Sharing TrialIn March and April 2017, the Australia-Canada-Singapore-Switzerland (ACSS) Generic Medicines Work Sharing Trial (GMWST) completed the review of the first generic application via a work-sharing process. In December 2017, HSA published the GMWST Expression of Interest package on its website to invite new submissions to the trial. MOU to Formalise Programme for Pharmacy Students In April 2017, HSA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National University of Singapore (NUS) to formalise the Pre-Employment Clinical Training (PECT) programme for pharmacy students' professional training in indirect patient care. Accepted as Regulatory Member In November 2017, HSA was accepted as a regulatory member of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). We now join the ranks of established regulators such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EU European Medicines Agency (EMA) to influence decision-making in pharmaceutical product development and registration. Improving Inspection Convergence As Chair of the ASEAN Joint Sectoral Committee on GMP inspection, HSA has actively driven the pharmaceutical inspection convergence between Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) and ASEAN. Korea MFDS will continue to organise the annual Korea-ASEAN Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Conference as well as the on-going Korea-ASEAN Pharmaceutical Inspectors Training Program. These two activities are expected to improve inspection convergence between ASEAN and Korea MFDS. Recognised as Comparable Overseas Regulator (COR) In January 2018, HSA was recognised as a COR by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia. This is part of TGA's new shortened process for the evaluation of prescription medicines by leveraging assessments by COR partners that have been selected for their scientific robustness and evaluation methodology.Appointment of First Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Chairman from AsiaIn September 2017, Mr Boon Meow Hoe from HSA became the first (PIC/S) Chairman to be elected from Asia. He will serve from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. New and Developing Partnerships To keep up-to-date with the latest developments in regulatory sciences, we continued to forge and strengthen partnerships with other governments and industry players. Standards Developing guidance and strategies on improving international standards for regulatory purposes Regulated Product Submission Developing guidelines, such as common data elements from device life cycle, for an electronic submission systemReal World Evidence Developing guidance on important considerations for real world data gathering for use in supporting regulatory functionsGood Regulatory Review Practices Reviewing the essential principles for safety and performance of medical devices cornerstone guidelinesAdverse Events (AE)Developing guidance on AE terminology and system to enhance AE management systems Patient-SpecificDeveloping guidance to facilitate progress of novel technology and clinical approach towards patient-specific clinical strategiesInternational Harmonisation Efforts Unique Device Identifier (UDI)Developing application guidance to facilitate UDI implementation globally Supporting the Drive Towards Standardisation In April 2017, HSA was appointed Deputy Chair of the Biomedical and Health Standards Committee. Together with other representatives from the public and private sectors, we will be assisting the Singapore Standards Council in identifying, developing and promoting critical standards for the biomedical and healthcare clusters in Singapore.32 33ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 Health Products Regulatory Conference 2017 The role of HSA is increasingly evolving from that of a gatekeeper to becoming an \"enabler\" for innovation. Engagement and partnerships with stakeholders enable us to share our regulatory approaches and philosophy as well as understand the perspectives of the industry. The Health Products Regulatory Conference was held in May 2017 with the theme, \"Enabling innovations through collaborations in advancing healthcare\" at SingHealth Academia. HSA, together with Duke-NUS Centre of Regulatory Excellence (CoRE) jointly organised the event which was attended by more than 370 participants from the public sector, private sector and academia. Through this conference, we successfully brought together various experts, stakeholders and collaborators from numerous fields to share their expertise and perspectives on regulation and advances in the fields of therapeutic products, advanced therapies and medical devices. Participants also benefitted from getting the latest updates on developments in Singapore's biomedical industry.Local Outreach Programmes Throughout the year-in-review, we reached out to local healthcare professionals and the public to strengthen our partnerships and heighten public awareness. Focus Group Discussions on Cell, Tissue and Gene Therapy Products (CTGTP) From April to September 2017, we organised 10 focus group discussions, which were attended by more than 150 people representing the different sectors dealing with CTGTP . They include the healthcare institutions, professional associations, government agencies, tertiary institutions, research institutions, stakeholders from pharmaceuticals, biotech and medical device industries. The objective was to seek feedback on the proposed regulatory framework for CTGTP under the Health Products Act. Trade Engagement Sessions on Raising of the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) for Tobacco ProductsOver three days in June and July 2017, HSA, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Promotion Board (HPB), held engagement sessions with tobacco retailers and key trade associations. The aim of these sessions was to explain the policy and implementation of raising the MLA for the sale, purchase, use and possession of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years old, as well as to gather feedback from our stakeholders. 34 35ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 Dialogue Sessions with Medical Device Associations In February 2018, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation's Medical Technology Industry Group (SMF-MTIG) and the Asia Pacific Medical Technology Association (APACMed) held a dialogue session with HSA to discuss challenges and explore potential solutions. Topics discussed include pre-market and Change Notification processes, proposed regulatory amendments, and the developments in ASEAN and the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF). Pharmacogenomics Workshop - Clinical Implementation Strategies & Pharmacists' Roles In February 2018, HSA shared our clinical implementation strategies and public health impact with healthcare professionals and industry at the Pharmacogenomics Workshop organised by the Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore. Creating Awareness for Pharmacovigilance and Adverse Event (AE) ReportingOver the past year, we organised various awareness programmes covering topics such as pharmacovigilance, risk communication, adverse event reporting and dangers of illegal health products. These programmes were targeted at undergraduates, healthcare professionals and the public. In addition, we also developed an educational video for healthcare professionals on how to assess and report adverse events. This video was published on our website as well as video-sharing sites in March 2018. The other cases of product defects were evaluated to ensure that appropriate corrective and preventive actions were taken by their companies to mitigate impact on the safety and quality of future batches.Maintaining Close Communications with Healthcare Professionals Keeping Alert We keep a watchful eye on safety issues and breaches that can jeopardise the health and safety of patients and consumers. Company DHCPLs were reviewed34 HSA adverse drug reactions news bulletins were disseminated to all registered healthcare professionalsProduct safety press advisories were issued 13 Safety updates were published on the HSA website5 productrecalls8 licensing amendments5 labellingand packaging corrections23Surveillance of Local Product Defects 32%8%12% 48% therapeutic products and traditional medicine defects were reported by companies.

These include:Educating the Public on Adverse Drug Reactions and Dangers of Purchasing Health Products from Dubious Websites A consumer guide on the risk of allopurinol was published in October 2017 to raise public awareness about rare but potentially life-threatening adverse drug reactions. We also collaborated with final-year Singapore Polytechnic students to develop ideas on how best to educate young people on the dangers of buying health products from dubious websites. Dear Healthcare Professional Letter (DHCPL) was issued136 37ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18Local Adverse Event (AE) Reports HSA receives AE reports from healthcare professionals and companies as part of our post-marketing surveillance programme. These reports are reviewed and closely monitored to ensure that drug safety signals are detected in a timely manner. HSA also partners with the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) to carry out active surveillance of AEs after vaccination in children to ensure the benefit/risk profile of the vaccines remains favourable.Product Risk ManagementSafety reviews were conducted to ensure that the benefits for therapeutic products outweigh the risks throughout the product's life cycle. Safety reviews were also conducted to assess the risk of adulterated health products detected post-market. Product RecallsIn FY17/18, there were 190 medical device recalls overseen by HSA and performed by medical device product owners to address device quality, safety or performance related issues. HSA worked with the respective product owners to ensure that the appropriate actions were completed. This included three consumer-level recalls for pen-injectors, contact lens and multi-purpose contact lens solution. There were 22,404 AE reports related to health products, of which 96.5% were associated with pharmaceutical drugs. These reports were contributed by:Health ProductsThere were 149 AE reports associated with CHPs 84 benefit-risk assessments were conductedComplementary Health Products (CHP) Actions taken to remind consumers to be cautious17 were associated with adulterated products 6 Press releases were issued to the media MediaCorp News carried an in-depth feature story, advising the public not to buy health products from unfamiliar sourcesPublic hospitals / healthcare organisations Product registrantsGP clinicsPolyclinics Private hospitals / healthcare organisations and private specialist clinics55.8%0.8% 36.5%4.6%2.3%benefit-risk assessments were tabled for Product Vigilance Advisory Committee discussion3 26 risk management plans were reviewed 38 39ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18Enforcement Operations Leveraging our scientific expertise, we worked with other enforcement agencies in various joint operations to clamp down on illegal activities relating to health and tobacco products. Prohibition on Display of Tobacco Products The Point-of-Sale (POS) display ban on tobacco came into effect in August 2017. All tobacco retailers are required to keep their tobacco covered or in drawers. As of April 2018, HSA has not come across any non-compliant retailers during our surveillance activities. Getting Tough on Sexual Enhancement Drugs (SEDs) in Geylang Largest Seizure of SEDs in 5 YearsActing on an alert from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) about the import of illegal SEDs, HSA conducted a raid at a private apartment in Geylang.

AUTOMATED DATA TRANSMISSION TO MINIMISE ERRORS ENHANCED DIGITAL SERVICES FOR BETTER DONOR EXPERIENCE STREAMLINED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY48 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/1849 Enhancing the Blood Donation Experience Through educating blood donors and by improving their donation experiences, we strive to turn one-time donors into repeat donors. Using IT to Improve Donor Experience at Our Blood Bank From September 2017 to March 2018, we implemented the 3e (e-Registration, e-Rebooking and e-Feedback) project to improve the experiences of our blood donors. With these new features, we are able to provide a faster and more pleasant donation experience. Besides raising our productivity, they also enable us to obtain valuable donor feedback to improve our services. What's new: Donors can update their particulars and print questionnaires at their convenience Ability to check their donation records Donors can book new appointments and give feedback readily Group booking functionRevised Criterion for Male Blood Donors Sufficient iron stores in blood donors' body would help regenerate red blood cells removed during blood donation. In response to the growing concern that regular male donors were at risk of depleting their body iron stores and developing anaemia, HSA raised the minimum pre-donation haemoglobin (Hb) criterion to 13.0g/dL in January 2018, in order to protect their health. The change does not affect female donors as the current Hb criteria of 12.5g/dl for females is aligned with international practices and guidelines in blood banking. Increased Engagement with the PublicDonors can now check their donation milestones on the interactive wall at our satellite blood banks. Members of the public can also tap on the interactive panels to get useful information about blood donations. To minimise the deferral rate of our regular male donors, the following measures were adopted: Education through pamphlets and posters at donation venues on how to improve body iron stores through food intake The course of oral iron supplements provided was increased from 10 tablets to 20 tablets Regular male donors were notified of this change through postal mail; an advisory and FAQs were also posted on the HSA website 14 th World Blood Donor Day The 14th World Blood Donor Day was held at the Singapore Sports Hub in June 2017 to recognise the contributions of dedicated blood donors and to raise awareness on the need for regular blood donations. The event was graced by Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong as the Guest of Honour for the morning ceremony, and Member of Parliament for Mountbatten, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, as the Special Guest for the afternoon ceremony. A total of 6,000 people attended the event 13 donors received the Medal for Life, 24 received the Champion of Champions award In total, 1,262 donors were recognised50 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/1851 Safeguarding Our Blood Supply We continually fine-tune our processes to ensure that the blood supply for our patients is maintained at the highest possible standards of safety. Reviewing Our Infectious Diseases Blood Screening Tests As dengue is endemic to Singapore and there were also reports that immunity-suppressed recipients of blood infected with Hepatitis E virus (HEV) were at risk of developing chronic liver diseases, we have decided to perform a prevalence study for these two infections in our local donor pool. Both studies employ Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) to help us assess the need to introduce dengue and HEV screening tests for blood donations. Reducing the Risk of Transfusion-related Complications To reduce the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), HSA has made the move to use male-only plasma products for transfusion. This is because studies have shown that the risk of TRALI is more than halved when the plasma supply is switched to a predominantly male-donor source, possibly because male donors have a lower incidence of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies than female donors. Minimising Errors from Manual Entry of Pre-transfusion Test ResultsTo improve work-flow processes and minimise transcription errors from manual entry of data, we have implemented a system that automatically transmits results from the laboratory testing equipment into the computer database system. Safeguarding the Quality of Cell Therapy Facility (CTF) Products We have expanded the capabilities of our transplant support lab to perform immunophenotyping tests. This test, which was previously done externally, is required before CTF products can be used on patients. Through this initiative, we are now able to meet all the necessary testing requirements within a shorter period of time, which in turn reduces the time for clinicians to make patient management decisions. Emergency Preparedness at the National LevelInvesting in Our People In today's increasingly uncertain environment, it is important to always be prepared for the unexpected. This is why we put into place policies and safety checks, as well as run emergency drills to ensure emergency preparedness is maintained at the highest level. A critical part of the mission of keeping blood supply safe is our people. We invest in our staff at HSA by providing continuous learning and career opportunities to help them reach their fullest potential.52 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/1853 Evaluating Major Threats to Blood Supply In April 2017, HSA officially implemented a Risk-Based Decision Making Framework, modelled after the one developed by the international Alliance of Blood Operators. This structured and comprehensive framework helps us to critically evaluate major threats to blood safety and adequacy in Singapore and select the most appropriate mitigating measure, proportionate to the risk level. The main principles of the framework are: Optimising the safety of blood supply within reasonable standards Balancing risks against benefits Allocating resources in proportion to the risk and potential opportunity cost Considering socio-economic and ethical factors that may affect decisionsStaying Prepared for Emergencies In April 2017, we also held our first-ever emergency blood exercise involving all the public hospitals (PHs) in Singapore. This exercise tested our readiness in ensuring timely blood supply during a civil emergency, where there may be many casualties requiring intensive blood support. The successful exercise yielded many useful learning points for both the PHs and HSA. Through the lessons learnt, we were able to update our respective Standard Operating Procedures to enhance emergency preparedness at the national healthcare level.Expansion of Nurses' Role Nurses currently play a key role in blood collection, managing daily blood bank operations, as well as ensuring donors' post-donation well-being. HSA aims to further expand their role through training and the development of a more streamlined career progression. To prepare selected nurses to take on the role of Clinical Nurse Leaders, they were: Trained to handle pre- donation screening, manage donors' adverse events, and counsel those with low haemoglobin levels Sent for a three-day theory and clinical attachment at the Emergency Department of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital to learn how to triage patients and manage clinical events Given scholarships to pursue the Advanced Diploma in Medical-Surgical Nursing 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/1855 Applying Lean Six Sigma for Continuous Improvement To raise productivity, we sent 14 staff in 2017 on an Operations Management Innovation (OMNI-LITE) course, where they were exposed to business strategy integration, operations management and systematic productivity improvement concepts. They also picked up skills in implementing Lean Six Sigma methodologies and solving real-life problems. Training CoursesThroughout the year, some of our staff attended the following courses: Monocyte Monolayer Assay Training - Philadelphia, USA Assist physicians to better decide on transfusion risks when compatible blood is unavailable CliniMACS Prodigy T-Cell-Transduction User Training - Germany CliniMACS Prodigy is an automated system for the generation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cellsImprove staff productivity by 20%Ensure inventory status in the lab is accurately maintained Reduce repetitive recording of test kits or reagents' informationMake reagent information readily available in database Improve efficiency and increase productivityEnsure effective communicationCreate visual board where delivery information of reagents is readily available Reduce annual complaint rate in the donation room to zeroReduce unnecessary walking and level out the workloadOMNI method to be applied in future improvement projectsRedesign the work flow to cut waste and increase staff productivityReduce the number of manual entry forms Achieved higher efficiency and effectiveness in improving staff moraleAverage turnaround time spent on managing inventory of lab supplies improved by 34% from 5.4 minutes to 3.6 minutes per reagent Improve staff working attitudes using pre- and post-trial survey comparisons on 35 staffEmpower staff with necessary skills and capabilities in phlebotomy Conduct pre- and post-trial survey comparisons on 35 staffContinuous Improvement Projects1. Redesigning Manpower Allocation in the Blood Donation Room ObjectivesObjectives Improvement StepsImprovement Steps ResultsResults 2. Streamlining Inventory Management Processes56 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/1857 Knowledge Sharing with Local and Overseas Counterparts We believe that through knowledge sharing, we are doing our part to help raise the standard of blood services globally. Throughout the year, we conducted training courses and hosted overseas visitors. May 2017 Hosted a clinical fellow in Bone Marrow Transplant from Mumbai, India, who came to learn about the basic methodology of HLA tests and how to search for unrelated donors for transplantation. June 2017 Hosted a study attachment for eight delegates from the Thai Red Cross Society, Thailand, on Information Management System and Smart Applications. September 2017 Hosted a team from National Blood Centre, Malaysia led by its Director Dr Noryati Bte Abu Amin. The objective of their visit was to learn more about the areas of donor management, blood collection, quality management and IT. September 2017 Conducted a blood bank tour for a Regional Medical Laboratory Scientist from the Embassy of the United States of America. He came to learn more about transfusion medicine practices in Singapore. September 2017 Hosted a study visit for two senior nursing staff from the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. Their objective was to learn ways in which they could strengthen the organisation and management of their national blood programme, in order to improve the safety and availability of blood supply in Hong Kong. January 2018Hosted a study visit for an overseas delegation from Zhejiang Blood Centre in China. The delegation, which was led by their deputy director, was interested in blood donation, donor recruitment, quality management, blood donation testing and blood service management. March 2018 Singapore Polytechnic and HSA signed a training collaboration agreement to equip medical laboratory technologists with immunohaematology knowledge.58 59 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 DEVELOPING NEW METHODS TO TACKLE CHALLENGES AUTOMATION OF PROCESSES FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCING CAPABILITIES FOR NEW BREAKTHROUGHS Using our scientific expertise, we assist law enforcement agencies, regulators and the judiciary to fulfil our common goal \u2014 to support the administration of justice and safeguard public health and safety. We continuously explore the possibilities of science to come up with new and better ways to detect, analyse and interpret. Building Capabilities We are committed to continually enhancing our expertise to better serve the nation. Digitalisation Effort This year, the Pharmaceutical Division completed the implementation of LabX 2017 software for the measurement of weights, and its integration with the titration analysis to enhance the efficiency and traceability of our daily work processes. Through this digitalisation process, data is now automatically stored on the server and can be conveniently retrieved on demand, doing away with the need for hard copy printouts. This digitalisation effort also paves the way for future digitisation of laboratory records by enabling the auto-population of electronic data. Automation of Opiate Testing in Urine Following the successful implementation of full automation for tests involving amphetamines and ketamine, we are now also able to fully automate the process for testing of monoacetylmorphine (MAM) in urine. This new method, implemented in February 2018, utilises a fully automated robotic system to perform sample preparation and instrumental analysis, doing away with the need for further human intervention after initial sample loading.From 2 days to 3 hours - the new time it takes to process a batch of 20 urine samples for drug testing New Image Analysis Technique for Forensic Document Examination We adopted a new image analysis technique for comparing paper products based on repetitive patterns created during the paper manufacturing and handling process. Using a technique called Fast Fourier Transform, these repetitive patterns are converted into spectrums, which can then be compared and analysed. In the area of ink analysis, differentiation of ink can now be done using the digital images of questioned handwritten entries. The technique is useful in detecting altered entries on documents such as cheques and in enhancing faded, erased and obliterated entries. Using 3D Technology to Enhance Efficiency of Traffic Investigations Our Traffic Accident Reconstruction team developed a new \"camera matching\" method to examine accident sites. This method allows forensic scientists to determine the position of a car or pedestrian in a video using 3D laser scans of the accident site. The technology can be applied to cases involving the calculation of the speed of vehicles, as well as those involving the determination of a driver's field of view. It also helps minimise the need for extended road closures. 61 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18DNA Analysis of Urine Samples Urine samples are commonly analysed in cases involving suspected illicit drug consumption. In certain circumstances, DNA analysis of urine samples can be useful when there are allegations of sample mishandling as it allows for the donor's identity to be verified. We have developed a new method that enables us to analyse DNA from small volumes of urine samples. With this, HSA can assist law enforcement agencies in resolving allegations of urine sample mishandling. Enhanced Workflow to Identify New PsychoactiveSubstances (NPS) The constantly evolving chemical structures of NPS, which are commonly used as drugs of abuse, are posing analytical challenges for laboratories around the world. We have therefore come up with a comprehensive analytical workflow that combines the use of two or more techniques including gas chromatography mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to help us differentiate between close structural analogues, and to accurately identify NPS. Faster and More Comprehensive Toxicology Screening To increase work efficiency of toxicology drug screening, we implemented and customised a commercial liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) solution known as Toxtyper in April 2017. Enhancements include the expansion of the default library, as well as customising the analytical report to automate and simplify data interpretation and performance checks. Expanded the default library from 900 to 1,200 with compounds relevant to Southeast Asia, including NPS Higher sensitivity of the instrument allows us to detect more drugs, including plant poisons and previously undetectable synthetic cannabinoids Processing time has now been cut by 12 hours for a batch of 30 samplesTargeting the Y Chromosome to Solve Sexual Assault Cases One of the problems faced in analysing exhibits from female victims in sexual assault cases is that the male perpetrator's DNA is often masked by the victim's DNA. To overcome this obstacle, we developed an analytical method to target Y chromosomes that are only found in males. This allows for specific detection of the male perpetrator and can help in generating potential leads for law enforcement. Fine-tuning Work Processes In the pursuit of greater efficiency, we are always looking out for new technologies that can improve our workflow and processes. Ensuring Safer Food with New Testing Methods Four new analytical methods were developed specially for the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA). These new methods enable the testing of new and emerging harmful substances present in foodstuff including natural toxins such as tropane alkaloids and amatoxins. Enhanced Testing for UV Filters in Sunscreen A new multi-screening method using reversed-phase high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on 10 UV filters in cosmetic products in Singapore has been successfully validated. This method will be used to test various sunscreen products for compliance with safety requirements. 63 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18 In 2017, we identified a total of NPS17Automating the Process for Dissolution of Drug Samples To improve the efficiency of the dissolution of illicit drug samples for quantitation, we implemented an automated syringe dispenser for the addition of suitable amounts of solvent. Reducing the Time Needed for Analysing Cannabis Samples A new method which combines the use of a weighing balance with a heating element has drastically reduced the time needed to determine moisture content in cannabis exhibits for major cases. Previously, this used to take weeks using the conventional oven drying method. This step now takes less than an hour, reducing the overall time needed to analyse cannabis exhibits. Rapid Homogenisation of Drug Samples Replacing the traditional mortar and pestle with a multi-sample grinder to homogenise drug samples has resulted in a 30-fold improvement in process efficiency Up to 16 samples can now be homogenised in 15 minutes Additionally, the closed vessel of the grinder also creates a safe environment protecting the user from the potential presence of toxic drugsFaster Screening of Illicit Drugs A handheld Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Detector has been introduced to facilitate faster screening of illicit drugs. This not only speeds up laboratory analysis, but is critical in today's environment where highly toxic opioids have begun to surface in other countries. Age and Ethnicity Prediction Studying the DNA in cells has enabled us to develop methods in ethnicity prediction, and improve on our age prediction capability. The results of both cutting-edge studies have been published in Forensic Science International: Genetics - the top ranked journal for forensic biology, and its supplemental series respectively. 90% - the accuracy in which an individual's ethnicity can be predicted using bio-geographic ancestry DNA markers, which also allows for individuals with mixed parentage to be identified. \u00b1 5 years - the current accuracy of our age prediction method based on epigenetic changes to DNA, an improvement over our earlier method that gives \u00b1 8.6 years accuracy on liquid blood. Furthermore, this method is effective for both fresh and aged bloodstains. Time-consumingfiltration stepis removed Accuracy of results is improved Sample throughput is boosted Total efficiency is increased 5-foldWith the implementation of the automatic syringe dispenser: 65 64 ANNUAL REPORT 2017/18Protecting Public HealthBenchmarking Our Standards Presence of Aristolochic Acids and Heavy Metals in Health Products We conducted a survey on 179 calcium-containing health supplements. These supplements were tested for the presence of heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium. We also conducted a follow-up survey to our 2015 survey of Chinese Medicinal Materials (CMM). For this survey, 20 Radix Et Rhizoma Asari roots were surveyed for aristolochic acids, and 10 Cordyceps and 10 Bulbus Lilii and 17 finished products containing Cordyceps or Bulbus Lilii were tested for heavy metals. The results of these baseline surveys help the Health Products Regulation Group (HPRG) with relevant scientific data to make policy and regulation decisions regarding health supplements and CMMs.Pharmaceutical DivisionThe laboratories achieved excellent results in external benchmark Proficiency Testing (PT) programmes conducted by the Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP), ASEAN Bureau of Drug and Narcotics (BDN), European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM), Bureau of Cosmetics and Hazardous Substances, Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, and Dienstleistung Lebensmittel Analytik GbR (DLA), Germany.

Knowledge Sharing Exercise and Collaboration with SPF In December 2017, HSA collaborated with the Special Tactics Advisory Team (STAT) from the Operations Department of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to record bullet trajectories using a high-speed camera. This experience provided our examiners with the opportunity to observe the trajectory of bullets that were shot through vehicle parts, and examine bullet impact areas - both potentially useful areas of knowledge for reconstructing shooting incidents. We also collaborated with the Criminal Investigation Department's (CID) Forensic Division to assess the evidential value of dust particles when associating a deceased person who had fallen from a building to a particular floor of a block. In this exercise, we evaluated the chemical compositions and the occurrence of specific dust particles on parapets of a HDB block as well as the results from the transference experiments of such particles from parapets to hands. This joint collaboration serves as a useful platform for CID officers and HSA to exchange knowledge on trace evidence collection and analysis. Performance Qualification of Dissolution Apparatus In July 2017, we completed a collaborative study with the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) to establish the dissolution reference range for a new lot of USP Prednisone Tablets. This reference range acts as the calibrator for performance qualification of Dissolution Apparatus.In November 2017, SPF and the Royal Brunei Police Force held their third joint post-blast investigation exercise (Ex-Solarwind III). An HSA team of forensic DNA scientists also participated in the exercise to evaluate the recovery of DNA from exhibits recovered from post-blast scenes such as laptops and mobile phones. Additionally, HSA forensic pathologists set up a temporary autopsy station to examine the remains from the post-blast recovery.
