Typically, these high-risk individuals are recommended to take more preventive measures. The use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the vaccine are playing a major role in the dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19. We propose a COVID-19 model with high-risk and low-risk susceptible individuals and their respective intervention strategies. We find two equilibrium solutions and we investigate the basic reproduction number. We also carry out the stability analysis of the equilibria. Further, this model is extended by considering the vaccination of some non-vaccinated individuals in the high-risk population. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations are carried out. From the results, we are able to obtain disease-free and endemic equilibrium solutions by solving the system of equations in the model and show their global stabilities using the Lyapunov function technique. The results obtained from the sensitivity analysis shows that reducing the hospitals' imperfect efficacy can have a positive impact on the control of COVID-19. Finally, simulations of the extended model demonstrate that vaccination could adequately control or eliminate COVID-19.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-20", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Model with High- and Low-Risk Susceptible Population Incorporating the Effect of Vaccines [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010003](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010003) [Dynamics of Tumor-Immune System Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00003), [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00003)]. The COVID-19 virus has been responsible for over 6 million deaths around the world by the end of March 2022, as a result, it has become the most significant global health disaster since the 1918 influenza pandemic [ [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00003), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00003)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00003), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00003)]. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that transmission cannot be ruled out completely, and given the potential importance of such transmission, urgent research on this subject is imperative [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00003), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00003)]. [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00003)]. Several clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of potential treatments. Despite this, there are treatments available that can help relieve symptoms and help shorten the length of the illness as well [ [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00003), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00003)]. There are a few treatments that are aimed at relieving symptoms, as well as supporting the respiratory system. Hospitalization may be necessary for some people, especially if they have an underlying medical condition that requires treatment [ [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00003)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00003)]. Additionally, more than half of the world's population received at least one dose of the vaccine [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00003)]. Many people refused to take the optimal dosage of the vaccine due to various reasons, including due to fake information related to its safety and long-term effects. Whatever the reason, there are significant consequences when individuals opt out of vaccines [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00003)]. Outbreaks of COVID-19 are more likely to occur in communities where vaccination rates are low. This not only puts unvaccinated individuals at risk but also increases the chances that these diseases will spread to other people, including low-risk individuals. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00003)]. [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00003)] analyze the COVID-19 model considering hospitalized individuals, and home-quarantined, or home-treated individuals. According to Iboi [ [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00003)], a mathematical model was developed for evaluating the influence of the NPIs on the transmission pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as investigating the impact of the early removal of social distancing and community lockdown measures. Their work was extended by Riyapan et al. in [ [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00003)], in which he added a compartment. [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00003)] shows that the susceptible class is divided into two: the high risk and the low risk. They indicated that the elderly, males, hypertensive, and patients with comorbidities, constitute the most well-characterized high-risk group for severe manifestations of COVID-19. None of the research mentioned above considered this division in detail mathematically. [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00003)]. [Section 1](#sec1-vaccines-11-00003), we give [Section 3](#sec3-vaccines-11-00003), we the model qualitatively, which includes computing the reproduction number using a technique called the next generation matrix, calculating disease-free equilibrium points, identifying endemic equilibrium points, analysing the stability of these equilibrium points on a local and global scale. In [Section 4](#sec4-vaccines-11-00003), we perform sensitivity analysis and numerical simulations of the model; in [Section 5](#sec5-vaccines-11-00003), we extend the model by considering movement from the high-risk to low-risk susceptible population which is caused due to vaccination of some unvaccinated individuals in the high-risk population. We provide discussion and conclusions regarding our results in [Section 6](#sec6-vaccines-11-00003). 2. Model Formulation [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00003)]. The modification procedure is presented below. We define as the total human population at time t divided into six sub-populations: high-risk susceptible , low-risk susceptible , exposed E, infected I, hospitalized H, and recovered R individuals: [23](#B23-vaccines-11-00003)], as well as the elderly [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00003)]. Undocumented migrants associated with limited access to healthcare because of legal, administrative, social barriers, etc., are also part of this population. The high-risk susceptible population is reduced by the natural death rate and the force of infection . The parameter incorporates the impact of the non-pharmaceutical intervention (wearing masks, physical or social distancing, and washing hands regularly) by individuals in on the number of contacts, [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00003-t001)contains the model's state variables, whereas [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00003-t002)lists the model parameters and their descriptions. Based on the assumptions stated above, [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00003-f001), below, describes the flow transmission of the infection from one compartment to another. The interactions is represented by the system of non-linear ordinary differential equations below: [25](#B25-vaccines-11-00003)], the following theorem shows that all the state variables are non-negative for all time . [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) with initial conditions , , and then the solution is positive in . [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) given by [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is a positive quantity in for all . [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) solution is bounded in [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) we obtain [26](#B26-vaccines-11-00003)], it can be observed that as . Hence, is bounded as . So, all solutions in of the model ( [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) eventually enter in . 3. Model Analysis [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) admits two equilibria: disease free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). 3.1. Disease Free Equilibrium [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is calculated as follows: [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00003)]. Considering the infected block we obtain the matrix as follows: [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00003)]. [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is said to be locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if and unstable if . [10](#FD10-vaccines-11-00003)) is automatically satisfied, the second inequality is satisfied when . As a result as long as holds. Hence, the disease free equilibrium DFE of the model ( [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is locally asymptotically stable when and unstable whenever . [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is globally asymptotically stable (GAS) if [13](#FD13-vaccines-11-00003)). We note that near the DFE, [15](#FD15-vaccines-11-00003)) becomes, [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00003)], the DFE is said to be globally asymptotically stable. 3.2. Endemic Equilibrium [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) substituting as defined in [Section 3.1](#sec3dot1-vaccines-11-00003)simultaneously in terms (i.e., force of infection) and obtained [20](#FD20-vaccines-11-00003)) we obtained as one of the solutions (which corresponds to DFE) and the following equation which is quadratic: [21](#FD21-vaccines-11-00003)) we have . Global Stability Analysis of the Endemic Equilibrium [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) is GAS in if , provided that [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)), we have the solution below: [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00003), [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00003)], suppose we have a function defined as if , we have and if we have Using this relation we find that 4. Numerical Simulations [Supplementary Materials](#app1-vaccines-11-00003), a copy of the simulation code that was used can be found. While it is a challenge to find suitable data for model simulation, the lack of an appropriate answer to this question continues to be a major problem. We used parameters provided in the existing literature to simulate and perform a sensitivity analysis of our model. Occasionally, we assumed the values which can be seen in [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00003-t003). [Figure 2](#vaccines-11-00003-f002)a-d shows that the system has a DFE that is asymptotically stable which supports the result stated in Theorem 3. In [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00003-f003), we examine the scenario in which for various initial conditions. When [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00003-f003)a-d shows that the system has a DFE and it is unstable whenever . Sensitivity Analysis [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00003)] to recognise these parameters. This is an efficient tool that enables us to analyze the sensitivity. We first have values and boundaries assigned to our parameters as in [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00003-t003). We then applied uniform probability distributions to each of the parameters, in accordance with the suggestion of [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00003)]. We evaluated Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) with 1000 samples for each parameter per run, which was resulted from the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00003-f004)shows how varying the parameters of model ( [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) changes the behavior of . The five (5) most sensitive parameters affecting are . Rising the value of the recovery rate of the hospitalized individuals, rate of reduction in infectiousness of the low-risk susceptible which is proportional to rising the value of might cause the value of to drop. Meanwhile, reducing the contact rate, hospital inefficacy might also cause the value of to drop significantly. This study demonstrate that isolating and hospitalizing the infected persons reduces the spread of infection. [Figure 5](#vaccines-11-00003-f005)shows the change in behavior of while varying the value of the most sensitive parameters. 5. Extended Model with Vaccination - i. - The number of high-risk individuals reduces. - ii. - Infections can be prevented with some degree of efficacy. [3](#FD3-vaccines-11-00003)) over time. The Effect of Vaccine on the Disease Dynamics [Figure 6](#vaccines-11-00003-f006), we can see that as vaccination coverage increases, there is a striking decline in the number of infected individuals at each level of effectiveness of the vaccine. In [Figure 7](#vaccines-11-00003-f007), we can see that the hospitalized population decreases relatively quickly over time at various levels of . Therefore, improving the vaccination rates for people at high risk will result in a decrease in the transmission of COVID-19 in the future. [Figure 8](#vaccines-11-00003-f008)illustrates, on the other hand, what the effects of vaccination may be on the recovered class, it can be concluded that the population of the recovered class increases as the value of increases from . 6. Discussion and Conclusions [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00003)]. It is equally vital to evaluate the impact of hospital efficacy/inefficacy. [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00003)]. The model was later extended by incorporating the vaccination of some high-risk individuals and vaccine efficacy. This study has been able to draw some important conclusions both mathematically and biologically, which are summarized below. [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00003), [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00003), [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00003), [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00003)], did not take into consideration the segregation in the susceptible class into low- and high-risk individuals. However, considering this division is essential in providing more insight into the transmission dynamics of the disease, as well as guiding the relevant authorities in introducing and providing plans to curtail the spread of the disease. - (i) - A GAS DFE occurs in the model without vaccination every time the associated basic reproduction number is less than 1 and there are multiple endemic equilibria, which is a GAS in a particular case. - (ii) - Based on numerical simulations it is indicated that if some high-risk individuals were vaccinated and moved to low-risk, the disease could be reduced to a minimum. However, this is dependent on the coverage of vaccinations. - (iii) - The Latin Hypercube Sampling to create 1000 samples and the resulting Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCCs) were used to perform a sensitivity study of the model parameter values. A tornado plot is used to visually display the results. The parameters , (hospitalized recovery rate), , (reduction in infectiousness of risk individuals), according to sensitivity analysis, greatly lessen an epidemic if increased. However, if the rates of person-to-person interaction and hospital inefficacy are reduced, transmission also decreases. Future Work Directions - Some new models with a different approach of incidence fraction can be proposed. - Several dynamical features of COVID-19 were captured by our model, though other population compartments might be added and furthermore implement optimal control strategies when having access to more detailed and authentic COVID-19 data.
