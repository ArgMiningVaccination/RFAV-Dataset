Herbs, supplements, and the food you eat are powerful allies in addressing the root of disharmonies in our bodies. Chinese herbal medicine is an ancient, highly elaborate system of natural healing that has been used by billions of people for all kinds of health conditions by naturally supporting and supplementing the body. Thrive Acupuncture and Wellness has a comprehensive herbal pharmacy of granulars (powders which are mixed with water to form a tea) and some patent pills. These forms of herbal medicine are easy to ingest and convenient for use at home or on the go. During the course of your treatment Christina may prescribe herbal remedies or supplements if she thinks they will assist your healing process. We use mostly Chinese herbs but sometimes we also prescribe a number of Western herbs and supplements that we carry in our pharmacy and in our online dispensary at WellEvate.com if that is the most appropriate for your condition. We only use high quality herbs that are thoroughly tested for your safety. Each customized formula usually contain anywhere from 3-15 herbs. It is generally very safe to take herbal medicine with minimal, if any, side effects. Acupuncturists are the only licensed health care professionals in California who are required to be trained and tested for competency in prescribing herbal medicine. It is always best to consult with an acupuncturist before taking any herbs so we can monitor the safety, adverse reactions, and interactions with other medications you may be taking. Chinese herbal medicine is a wonderful complement to acupuncture treatment as it maintains continuity in therapeutic intervention between acupuncture treatments. The herbs contain macro and micronutrients that can have specific therapeutic effects on certain organs of the body, such as the liver or kidneys. Today herbal medicine is routinely used alongside acupuncture therapy to treat a wide variety of disorders. Emotional as well as physical ailments can be resolved with the use of herbs. Everything from allergies to asthma, stress to PMS, headaches to back pain, and insomnia to hot flashes can be treated with herbal medicine. Herbs empower you to continue to support your body's natural healing ability on a daily basis, and the treatment of acupuncture with herbs is much more effective and long lasting.
