This course takes a holistic approach to investigating the death of a human being. It begins with a brief discussion of the history of the coroner's and medical examiner's systems to include a forensic autopsy. In the section on approaching the death scene, we discuss the effects of a traumatic death scene on the first officer to arrive as well as the investigator assigned to the scene. Some investigative aids and techniques are reviewed, using case examples. Also covered are the following topics: Managing Death Investigations Development of Coroner and Medical Examiner System 9 Approaching the Death Scene Post Mortem Changes and Time of Death/Entomology Injuries From Edged Weapons and Their Effects on the Body Blunt Force Injuries and Their Effects on the Body Blood Spatter Pattern Analysis Homicide by Poison Asphyxial Deaths Fire and Heat-Related Deaths Firearm Injuries Signature/M. O. Substance Abuse Deaths Autoerotic Fatalities Suicide/Equivocal Deaths XV Forensic Pediatrics/Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Criminal Investigative Analysis Overview of Drowning DNA Miscellaneous articles germane and timely to the subject of death investigation are included at the end of this publication. xvi MANAGING DEATH INVESTIGATIONS Managing Death Investigations by Arthur E.

The vast majority of cases are associated with the inhalation of large quantities of water which causes some degree of anoxia as well as acute disturbance in the electrolyte balance of the blood. Asphyxia believed to be caused by laryngeal spasm due to the aspiration of small quantities of fluid, or by vagal response to immersion, resulting in cardiac standstill.

Cheek bone. 49 Supervision And Management Of A Homicide Investigation' By Vernon J. Gerberth, Lt. Commander (Ret.) NYPD The purpose of this article is to provide homicide supervisors with practical and specific considerations for formulating management objectives in the investigation of homicides. Administrative policies and procedures employed by police agencies are usually determined on a jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction basis. Therefore, the author cannot present an all-inclusive management technique applicable to all law enforcement agencies. However, certain basic principles of homicide investigation, along with interagency responsibility, can be developed into guidelines that will contribute to the proper and intelligent handling of murder cases. Management Policy Two basic principles of any homicide investigation are documentation and preservation. To ensure that these principles are accomplished, there must be an established management policy that gives direction to the investigative unit. Various methods and techniques can be employed to properly document and preserve events at the scene. Managing a homicide investigation is simply an extension of these techniques through supervision. Management assures that the preliminary investigation and initial actions taken at the scene, as well as the total investigative effort, have been properly documented, and that any evidence recovered has been properly handled and preserved. An effective homicide investigation is the responsibility of the entire police organization, not just the individual investigator assigned to the case. Consequently, there is a need for efficient coordination of activities and procedures critical to the processing of the case. Examples of some of these activities follow: 9 collection of evidence 9 procedural tactics 9 duties of patrol officers at the scene 9 preparation of forms and reports 9 overtime allowance 9 case-officer responsibility 9 confidential informant funds 9 allocation of equipment 9 supervisor's duties and 9 notifications These activities must be properly managed in order to bring the entire organization into play to effect the successful conclusion of the case. However, management must provide for flexibility and Adapted from Vernon J. Gerberth, \"Supervision and Management of a Homicide Investigation, \"Practical Homicide Investigation Tactics, Procedures, and Forensic Techniques. Third Edition, 1996. Used with permission of the author. 51 common sense. Therefore, any system implemented to direct and manage murder cases should be realistic and allow for policy variations at the point of execution. Teamwork All members of a police department contribute to the process of crime solving, whether it be the operator in the communications division who initially takes the call and elicits additional information, or the patrol officer who responds to the scene and detains a key witness or suspect. Everyone must work together toward the common goal of solving the homicide. Teamwork is necessary if the goal is to be achieved. Therefore, the duties of detectives and the activities of patrol officers must be integrated to complement one another, and the management policy should stress this principle. Policy and Procedure Each agency must establish guidelines and procedures that will allow the organization to function efficiently within their jurisdiction purview. Homicide investigations, however, present additional management considerations because two distinctively unique operational divisions are involved. For example, the investigation of a homicide is usually initiated by the patrol division, which operates under patrol guidelines. The patrol division, in turn notifies the investigative division, which operates under investigative guidelines. Investigators, upon arrival at a scene, assume responsibility for the case and take over the investigation from patrol officers, possibly directing uniformed officers and additional police units at the scene as required by the investigation. Policy must provide for the efficient coordination of these various units by either the investigator assigned to the case or the detective supervisor, if present, in order to maintain control over the homicide investigation. In addition, any policy established must meet the legal requirements of, and be compatible with, the responsibilities of other agencies. For example, the offices of the District Attorney or Solicitor have a specific responsibility for the ultimate prosecution of the case. The Medical Examiner or Coroner's office has the responsibility for determining the cause of death. Since each of these organizations is required by law to conduct independent investigations into the facts and circumstances of death, police agency policy has to provide for mutual cooperation and exchange of information. How an agency organizes its departments or divisions to perform investigative function is important, this includes the selection and training of personnel for investigative assignment, management of investigative personnel, and the designated units that are responsible for conducting criminal investigation. 52 How are members selected for assignment to investigations ? Is the selection based on legitimate qualifications, i.e., department exam, aptitude testing, seniority in rank, supervisor's recommendation, or board qualification? What type and quality of training is afforded the members ? Is the training provided members sufficient for the assignment or does the department allow new investigators to \"feel their way\"? Are outside sources utilized for more advanced in-service training2 Are members encouraged to attend training sessions both within and outside the agency? Is specialization, generalization or rotation assignment utilized? Specialization for homicide assignment is the ideal situation if the agency can justify specialists for the work load. Even in agencies where the work load is not sufficient for a full-time homicide specialist, a select few are generally chosen to investigate homicide cases. Generalization is acceptable for smaller departments that do not have a substantial case load. Rotation must have been created by someone with no understanding or appreciation of the investigative mission. It is demoralizing for officers to be transferred out of a preferred assignment without cause; rotation does not allow for career growth, and it frustrates professional ambition. It takes as long as two years for most officers to become familiar with all aspects of investigations and become proficient at the work. It doesn't make sense to periodically transfer experienced investigatOrs back to patrol simply for the purposes of rotation. How are supervisors selected for investigative assignment ? Qualified members from within investigative units should be selected for assignment as supervisors or commanding officers of the function. The policy of sending a newly-promoted investigator back to a uniform assignment for some sort of \"cleansing\" is not good utilization of resources. Such a policy has adversely affected the overall success of many investigations sections. Inexperienced supervisors oftentimes fail to properly delegate routine matters and involve themselves in operations rather than the supervision of operations. Case Management Case management relates to the processes involved in monitoring the progress of an investigation, beginning with the initial report, or officer-initiated police action, and continuing through all phases of the investigation until the case is closed. Have administrative procedures been implemented to provide documentation of the case and preservation of evidence? The official police report and documents in the case file are extremely important instruments. The documentation of events, as well as the official police response to the investigation, form the basis for prosecution. 53 The path from arrest to conviction is fraught with technical and legal booby traps. Hence, there is a need for intelligent case management that takes into account the reality of \"Discovery v. Documentation.\" Proper case management requires documentation of the pertinent facts of the case, but not police administrative matters, i.e., supervisory reviews, case recommendations, meal times, travel to and from, roll call assignments and daily activity reports. Such information does not belong in the case file. Inappropriate departmental policy and/or procedures regarding investigative strategies are usually based on bureaucratic, political, and/or personal consideration not related to the primary objective of solving the case. The interference of high-ranking officials is also often a problem. Police Commissioners, Chiefs of Police, Sheriffs, and other top-ranking officers are supposed to be administrators, not detectives or squad commanders. The immediate mission of the supervisor of the detectives is to provide coordination of resources and to direct personnel through the Squad Commander. This chain of command is necessary to maintain order and responsibility. High-ranking officials should not communicate orders directly to officers, and they definitely should not be involved in operational processes such as interrogating suspects and tactical procedures. On-scene activities are best left to the investigators assigned to the case. Ranking officers with expertise should contribute through channels unless specifically requested to participate. Interagency Rivalry A working relationship must be established among police, prosecutors, and medical examiner/coroners based on cooperation, trust and respect. Police and prosecution should complement each other and should feel at ease in giving and receiving advice from one another during an investigation. There is no room for interagency rivalry in a homicide investigation. Agencies with dual responsibility for the investigation of sudden and unexplained deaths must reach an accord as to ultimate case responsibility among the jurisdictions involved. The best way to accomplish a cooperation venture is through continued personal contact and understanding of each other's roles and duties. Each of the three official agencies of inquiry has specific responsibilities and duties that may at times overlap, and a misunderstanding can take place. This is especially true in sensational murder cases where there are inordinate amounts of public or agency pressure, requests for regular progress reports, and demands by the news media for a story. The duties of each agency involved in the investigation of a homicide are determined by both tradition and law. However, policies should be instituted within each organization that transcend individual positions and address the common goal or objective. Courtesy and tact are always helpful in interagency dealings. 54 Basically, the duties of each are: 1. The ultimate responsibility for the investigation of crime rests with the local law enforcement agency. The chief law enforcement official within any community is the police chief, the sheriff, or the police commissioner and his or her designated representatives. 2. The District Attorney, State's Attorney, or Solicitor in turn is responsible for the ultimate prosecution of the crime and as such, should be kept aware of all developments of the police investigation. He or she is responsible for all legal investigative operations such as search warrants, arrests warrants, grand jury presentations, etc. 3. The medical examiner/coroner is responsible for the determination of cause, manner, and mode of death and should be apprised of all developments of the police investigation. Flexibility and common sense by the representatives of each of these agencies ultimately benefits all concerned and eases misunderstandings. Remember, the key to a successful homicide investigation is teamwork and mutual respect for each other's goals and objectives. Effective Procedures The management and supervision of a homicide investigation can be separated into five specific segments. The case preparation for court and prosecution and any subsequent case analysis are separate prosecutive and administrative functions, which, for the purposes of this article, do not apply to the following. Practical homicide investigation supervision techniques are: 9 Supervising the preliminary investigation at the scene 9 Directing specific investigative duties 9 Supervising the homicide crime scene search 9 Providing for the effective documentation of events 9 Conducting an investigative critique (an information conference of participants in the investigation, which can take place any time during the case.) On-Scene Supervision It is imperative that the supervisor, when notified that detectives are requested to respond to a possible homicide, record the following information: 9 Date and time received 9 How initial report was received 9 Name of person making report (this includes police officer) 9 Complete details At this point the homicide supervisor either responds directly with investigators, or responds individually. I recommend that the supervisor take his own transportation to the scene. If personnel are available, it helps to assign a member to maintain communications within the command. This person's responsibility is to make follow-up notifications, record requests for identifications and special services and take requests from the command post at the crime scene. This assignment is critical in major case investigations when trying to evaluate the full extent of the investigation. There are special duties to be performed upon arrival at the scene: 9 Record the exact time of arrival 9 Record the exact address 9 Record police units present 9 Confer with detectives at the scene to determine if an investigator has been assigned to the case. If not, assign one immediately 9 Confer with patrol supervisor and establish cooperation; 9 Confer with the first arriving officer for a quick briefing; 9 Make a visual inspection of the crime scene and the crime in order to get a feel for the case and establish perimeters; 9 Solicit opinions and/or theories from police personnel at the scene; 9 Determine investigative needs and make assignments. Providing necessary manpower and equipment establishes your authority; 9 Implement an assignment sheet. Knowing who is performing what assignment assists coordination. The supervisor's notebook should detail exactly who has what assignment. This enables the supervisor to properly assign members and record exactly what has transpired a the crime scene. As members report back, the supervisor should jot down a brief description of their activities. This notebook is valuable for subsequent written reports. Initiate an investigative canvass, which is simply a door-to-door inquiry or roadblock operation in order to obtain information and/or locate witnesses. The supervisor should assign a sufficient number of officers to effectively cover the area to be canvassed. If large-scale, assign a supervisor to coordinate the canvass and instruct to use questionnaires for follow-up surveys. If the victim has been removed to a hospital, assign either a patrol unit or detective to respond to the hospital to assure proper evidence collection procedures regarding clothing, ID papers, etc., are undertaken. There may also be an opportunity to obtain a dying declaration. Ascertain what alarms have been transmitted. Review alarms for appropriate information and consider updating them based on information developed at the scene. Provide for the dissemination of information to all units and personnel involved in the investigation. Keep the command post and investigators informed of all relative and current information as it becomes available. Utilize patrol officers to maintain lines and instruct detectives to use courtesy and tact in dealing with people at the scene. Assign members in street clothes to \"work the crowd\" to obtain leads from conversations. Depending on circumstances, bilingual officers might mingle with bystanders. Also direct that photos be taken of the crowd. Direct that ambulance or EMS personnel be interviewed if they arrived before police. Their activities at the scene, as well as people they may have seen or things they overheard, could be important. Specific Duties Regarding the suspect in custody: 9 Establish the probable cause for arrest 9 Determine the scope of the preliminary investigation 9 Advise detectives to instruct patrol officers to document their observations regarding any overhears, statements, and any information provided by informants and/or witnesses. Regarding interviewing and interrogation of a suspect in custody: 9 Direct investigators to document their Miranda warnings 9 If the suspect is cooperative, have detectives take a preliminary statement at the scene, which may be used to assist in the recovery of any evidence, etc. The formal interrogation should be conducted at the station house, and no one should interfere with an investigator in the process of taking a statement from a suspect. The cardinal rule of interrogation is: never intrude on an interview of a suspect. This includes supervisors. In the examination of a suspect for evidence, advise investigators to document--by both photography and sketch--any scratches, bruises, injuries, etc., observed on the suspect. Advise transporting officers to be aware of evidentiary considerations (do not allow victim to wash, etc.). Dying Declarations A seriously injured victim should be considered a candidate for a dying declaration. Direct investigators to respond to the hospital, obtain witnesses if possible, and attempt to obtain a statement from the injured victim. There are no set guidelines, such as an exact sequence of questions. However, you want to establish that the victim is competent, lucid, and does believe that he or she is about to die. Suspect's Mental State Evaluation of any suspect's demeanor and/or mental capacity is important. Detectives should document the suspect's actions and mental capacity from the time of arrest to arraignment. This procedure is necessary to prepare against a possible diminished capacity defense. Crime Scene Search The crime scene search, the most important phase of the investigation conducted at the scene, is a separate and distinct function. Ideally, there should be a crime scene investigator or evidence technician assigned to conduct the search. Departments should train a sufficient number of investigators for this important function. Agencies oftentimes do not put enough emphasis on this phase of the investigation, opting instead for something less-time consuming, e.g. aconfession. Make sure your investigators do a proper search. Supervision of this function is aimed at preserving and documenting the event. The purpose of a crime scene search is to obtain evidence. If there is any possibility that any evidence you are about to seize requires a search warrant, it's the supervisor's job to assure that the proper warrant is obtained. Supervisors should be aware of the warrant exceptions: 9 emergency 9 plain view 9 consent 9 search of suspect after arrest Any search method can be utilized and is usually determined by the size, location, and complexity of the scene. It doesn't matter which method is selected as long as the search is systematic and complete. The scope of a search is determined by a theory or hypothesis arrived at by the detective supervisor and investigators based on their initial observations. This theory, which is provisional, is based on simple assumptions of how and why the homicide occurred. Remember: anything can be evidence. The primary responsibility is the isolation and protection of the crime scene. The objective is to establish the corpus delicti and the identity of the criminal. Upon arrival, ascertain boundaries. Do not move blindly into an area. Confer with those already on the scene to decide the approach and paths of entry and exit. Prior to any crime scene search, direct that photographs and crime scene sketches be made. The initial survey is an opportunity to develop a mental image. Remember to be escorted by the first arriving officer. Ascertain whether or not any fragile evidence is present to assure collection. When examining an outdoor crime scene, the following procedures are important: 1. Rope off the largest area 2. Establish a path of entry and exit 3. Conduct examination as soon as possible (Before losing daylight or experiencing weather changes.) 4. Direct that surrounding area be searched 5. If weather becomes bad, order evidence be collected immediately Under ordinary circumstances, an outdoor scene would not be searched during nighttime hours. However, it is necessary to safeguard the area, take photographs before the body is moved, and protect the body against additional damage in transport. Release of the crime scene is also a critical decision. Authorities should hold on to the scene as long as possible as there may be a need for additional photos, or information may reveal the need for an additional search. Before cleaning the crime scene consider: the defense attorney might visit the crime scene to judge the extent of the police investigation. He will be alert to areas that were or were not processed. Direct that all materials used to process the scene be placed in a receptacle that can be taken from the scene when the police leave. Make sure that all police equipment has been removed from the premises before the scene is released. Supervisory Hypothesis The supervisory hypothesis is as follows: Ask yourself, \"What happened?\" Keep an open mind; don't be influenced by the police call or initial statements. Make a determination based on the total information available. The question is: was death caused by homicide, suicide, accident, or natural causes? The answer must be based on the following: 1. Do the facts, the crime scene, the statements, and the physical evidence support the explanation? Things are not always as they appear to be. Don't be afraid to change your mind. Any hypothesis is only provisional at best.\" 2. Examination of the body at the scene. All photographs and sketches should be completed before examining the body. Obtain a complete description of the body as well as the clothing. Portions of the body that were not accessible to the on-scene photos should be examined and photographed. Release of the body is a critical decision. Once it is removed from the scene, no additional procedures can be undertaken. It should be wrapped in a clean white sheet before being placed in a body bag. Investigative Conference An investigative conference is an important part of any well-run homicide investigation. The conference need not be a formal gathering; it can take place anytime during the investigation or after each of the other four phases. 59 The conference, directed by the chief investigator at each critical point of the investigation, is to assess the investigation by gaining an overall synopsis. Each member relates his or her progress and ideas; everyone is kept abreast of all developments and there is a general discussion. The daily investigative conference is somewhat different and usually takes place at the station house. It attempts to assess the entire investigation on a daily basis. Management and supervision of a homicide investigation is unique in its comparison to other police management operations. The management of day-to-day patrol operations and administrative functions can many times be proceduralized due to their routine and repetitive nature. The intelligent management and supervision of homicide investigations, however, requires a different approach that takes into account the unpredictables of a murder investigation. However, rules and procedures, as well as established policies, give direction and coordination to the function. In addition, there may be guidelines implemented for specific investigative actions. The on-scene supervisor directs and coordinates a team effort based on established policies. However, as a manager, he has the authority to allow for variations of the guidelines when needed. This flexibility is based on necessity and common sense. The supervision and management function requires the supervisor to actively participate in the investigation. This does not mean \"playing detective\" and jumping into the operational aspects, such as interrogation of suspects, crime scene collection, interviews of witnesses, etc. Active participation means sharing an interest in the investigation, intelligently directing activities and utilizing the investigative critiques to properly establish priorities. In addition, it enables the supervisor to assess the case and provide the necessary resources to effectively investigate the case. The supervisor of homicide should ideally have a homicide or an investigative background because experience is a prime asset. This does not mean that a supervisor who lacks a homicide or investigative background cannot effectively supervise investigations. However, it does suggest that there is a need for learning the investigative processes involved. 60 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORONER AND THE MEDICAL EXAMINER SYSTEM Development of the Coroner and the Medical Examiner Systems I Forensic Sciences in Antiquity The earliest application of forensic medicine had to do with the interdiction against suicide, which has been regarded as a crime against the public interest since before the birth of Christ. It appears that this was largely due to the fact that occasional communities, even in those days, sustained epidemics of suicides. It is probably also rooted in the primitive belief that the individual who took his own life was possessed by evil spirits and might pass them on to other members of his community. Anthropologists have reported a similar phenomenon in more modern days in certain relatively uncivilized African tribes, where the hut belonging to the victim of a suicide is burned to the ground and his family expelled from the village. It is recorded that suicide was strongly condemned in ancient Greece because the individual was regarded as a servant of the gods and self-destruction constituted an act of rebellion against the gods. It was accepted in certain instances, however where the community had condemned an individual, as in the case of Socrates, who in turn committed suicide by drinking hemlock. A medicolegal opinion as to manner of death had to be reached in such cases in order that a decision could be rendered as to whether the penalty-- usually consisting of denial of the funeral rights to those who had offended against religion-- should be inflicted. In the same way, in ancient Rome, soldiers who committed suicide were treated as deserters, and criminals who committed suicide in order to escape punishment were likewise condemned. In the tenth century suicide became a crime under the common law in England, and in 1184 the Council of Nimes made the condemnation of suicide part of the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church. The decisions as to manner of death seem to have been made mostly by an investigation of the circumstances without specific examination of the body, although historians have reported that Antistius, a physician in Rome, examined the body of Julius Caesar and reached the opinion that, of the twenty-three wounds Caesar sustained, the only mortal wound was one in the chest. In China a handbook entitled Hsi Yuan Lu was published in about 1250. It contained guidelines for the postmortem examination of bodies, including descriptions of various wounds caused by sharp versus blunt instruments. It also offered comments on the determination of whether an individual found in the water had died of drowning or had been killed beforehand and of whether a burned individual was dead before the onset of the fire. IThis section is excerpted from R.S. Fisher (1980), History of Forensic Pathology and Related Laboratory Sciences. In W.U. Spitz and R.S. Fisher (Eds)., Medicolegal Investigation of Death (2rid edition), Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas. 63 The Early Development of the Autopsy in Forensic Investigations in Europe The written records of the development of forensic pathology in Europe begin in 1407, when a volume subsequently known as the Bamberg Code appeared. Twenty-three years later, a more extensive penal code, known as the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, was issued by Emperor Charles V for all the lands included in his empire. The two documents portrayed the importance of forensic pathology in requiring that medical testimony be an integral part of the proof and trials involving decisions about whether the manner of death was infanticide, homicide, abortion, or poisoning. They apparently did not specify that complete autopsies were to be performed, but wounds were opened to determine their depth and direction. Thus it appears that some degree of skilled medical knowledge was required of the expert witness. Meanwhile, Andreas Vesalius, the first of the pioneers in anatomy, was dissecting cadavers and for the first time established the true facts of the anatomy of the body. In the latter half of the sixteenth century Ambrose Par6 performed official medicolegal autopsies. He reported the findings in lungs of smothered children and studied the traces left by sexual assault. Fidelis and Zacchia in Italy, in the early seventeenth century, were likewise engaged in anatomical dissections and reported analyses of injuries to internal organs. Fidelis described the findings in drowned bodies that would distinguish between homicidal and accidental drowning. Zacchia's work included descriptions of bullet and stab wounds, findings in asphyxial deaths, the distinction of suicide from homicide, the differentiation of sudden death from natural causes and, in cases of infanticide, the determination of whether an infant had been born alive. The first formal lectures in forensic pathology were held by Michaelis and Bohn at the University of Leipzig, where students were apparently instructed in the subject of violent death and simulated natural deaths. As a result of advancement of knowledge by these pioneers, the judicial authorities and the police in Europe soon began to call upon physicians to aid in the solution of fatal crimes, and most of the larger jurisdictions developed centers, commonly known as institutes of forensic medicine, where experts carried out their investigations. There was little of scene investigations by these physicians, since this chore rested principally with the police, but in instances where bodies were found in trunks or in the water it was not uncommon for the medical investigator to examine the associated evidence. Indeed , it was in this context that the recognition of the medicolegal importance of bloodstains first developed. The Coroner System in England The historical developments of medicolegal investigation in America can be clearly traced back to the English coroner system, which had developed in that country some 600 years before. The justices in eyre, who were apparently comparable to the travelling circuit court judges of modern day, could order the coroner to perform duties of administrative or inquisitorial 64 nature within the region for which he had been appointed. These duties were carried out either alone or with the sheriff, but certain of them were earmarked specifically for the coroner's office, and he could perform them without being ordered to do so. Among these were holding of inquests over dead bodies and appeals (inspection of an individual's wounds, recording the accusation against another individual and, if the wounds appear likely to be fatal, arresting the accused individual). Blackstone has written an appropriate brief paragraph describing the coroner's duties at the time Edward I became King in 1272: The office and power of a Coroner are also like those of a Sheriff, either judicial or ministerial, but principally judicial . . . And consists, first, in inquiring, when any person is slain or dies suddenly, or in prison, concerning the manner of his death. And this must be upon sight of the body; for if the body be not found, the coroner cannot sit. He must also sit at the very place where death happened, and the inquiry must be made by a jury from 4, 5, or 6 of the neighboring towns over which he is to preside. If any be found guilty by this inquest of murder or other homicide, the coroner is to commit them to prison for further trial and must certify the whole of his inquisition, together with the evidence thereon, to the Court of King's Bench, or the next assizes. In 1877 a law was enacted requiring the inquest to be conducted whenever the coroner had reasonable cause to suspect violent or unnatural death or when the cause of death was unknown. This had the effect of granting the coroner the widest authority to investigate cases and was indeed in sharp contrast to the continental system, where investigations were commenced only by the prosecutors or police officials. Thus, the coroner system developed as abroad-spectrum investigative agency concerned with a large proportion of all deaths, including ,many nonviolent deaths. In 1888 the election of the coroners by freeholders was abolished and an appointee system developed under which the head of the local governmental unit appointed the coroner. There remained, however, no minimum qualifications for office. These were established in 1926, when a law was enacted requiring five years experience as a medical practitioner, barrister or solicitor if the individual was to qualify as coroner. Interestingly enough, in Northern Ireland similar legislation excluded doctors from holding the position of coroner unless they were also lawyers. The Establishment of Forensic Pathology in America The early American colonists, originating in England, brought the coroner system with them in essentially the state of development it had reached by the early 1600s. Thus, there is a record of a coroner's inquest in the colony of New Plymouth, New England, in 1635; briefly, the inquiry found that John Deacon died as a result of bodily weakness caused by fasting and extreme cold. The govemor of Maryland, Leonard Calvert, appointed Thomas Baldridge of St. Mary's to be sheriff and coroner on January 29, 1637, and authorized him to, \"Doe all and everything.., the office of sheriff and coroner of any county in England doe .... \" 65 Baldridge was soon hard at work, because on January 31, 1637, he impaneled a jury of twelve men to hold an inquest over the body of one John Bryant. Their verdict was, \"John Bryant by the fall of a tree had his bloud bulke broken; and hath two scratches under his chinne on the left side; and so that by means of the fall of the said tree upon him the said John Bryant came to his death.\" This coroner's office was one and the same as the sheriff's office, and while it did not carry any fixed stipend, it provided a substantial income because the sheriff was responsible for the collection of property taxes, poll taxes and other levies, and he usually received 10 percent of his collections. The early definition of the coroner's duties is also recorded in the Archives of Maryland, preserved by the Maryland Historical Society, whereby on April 30, 1640, the governor appointed John Robinson, high constable, as coroner for St. Clements Hundred in St. Mary's County. The definition of duties included-- Upon notice or suspicion of any person that hath or shall come to his or her death entirely within the limits of that hundred to warn as many inhabitants of the said hundred as you conveniently may to view the dead body and to charge the said persons with an oath truly to inquire and true verdict to grant how the person viewed came upon his or her death according to the evidence .... Autopsy examinations of bodies are recorded in Massachusetts as early as 1647, when the General Court of Massachusetts Bay concerned with the teaching of medical students authorized that \"an autopsy should be made on the body of a criminal once in four years.\" The medicolegal application of the autopsy is recorded in Maryland on March 21, 1665, when a Mr. Francis Carpenter was brought before the Talbot County Court on suspicion of murdering one Samuell Yeoungman, a servant of his. The coroner's report absolved Mr. Carpenter, saying-- Wee of the Jury haueing viewed the Corps of Samuell Yeoungman and finding A Depression in the Cranenum in on [one] place, and another wound where all the muscle flesh was Corrupted, and withall finding Corrupt blood betweene the Dura and Piamater, and the braine and several other bruises in the head and body therefore our verdict in that fbr want of Looking after the abouesaid wounds, were the Cause of his death. The record does not reveal whether Mr. Carpenter may have inflicted the original wounds on the deceased's head. Perhaps the earliest formal mention of the physician in connection with the work of the coroner was in 1860 in Maryland, where the Code of Public General Laws authorized the coroner or his jury to require the attendance of a physician in cases of violent death. The choice of the physician was left to the coroner. Eight years later the legislature authorized the governor to appoint a physician as sole coroner of the city of Baltimore. In Boston in 1877 the Commonwealth adopted a statewide system requiring that the coroner be supplanted by a physician known as a medical examiner. Unfortunately, the jurisdiction of the medical examiner was confined to \"dead bodies of such persons only as are supposed to have come to their death by violence.\" The entry of the science of pathology as a subspecialty of medicine into the investigation of deaths began in the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1890 in Baltimore a city ordinance authorized the Board of Health to appoint two physicians with the titles of medical examiner and assign them the duty of performing all autopsies requested by the coroner or the state's attorney of the city of Baltimore. In 1915 New York City adopted a law eliminating the coroner's office and creating a medical examiner system, authorizing investigation of deaths resulting from criminal violence, casualties or suicide, or suddenly while in apparent health, or when not attended by a physician or imprisoned or in any suspicious or unusual manner. The medical examiner was granted the authority to make a decision as to the necessity of an autopsy, and his appointment from a civil service list by the mayor provided the first civil service appointment in the annals of American medicolegal investigation. The first chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles Norris, was also given the authority to Order an autopsy when in his judgement it was necessary, thus establishing the first essentials of a competent medical examiner's system, i.e. a broad spectrum of cases to be investigated and the authority to autopsy when the public interest demanded it .... 67 DEATH INVES TIGA TION MEDICAL TERMINOL 0 G Y I.

Dimaio, M.D. The forensic autopsy differs from the hospital autopsy in objectives, significance, and manner of approach. In a medical-legal autopsy, one must establish the identity of the deceased, the cause of death, and the manner of death. The presence of any drugs or secondary trauma, which would influence the interpretation of the cause or manner of death or of the circumstances leading to the death, must be documented. In a forensic autopsy, in contrast to a hospital autopsy, the external examination of the body is often the most important part of the procedure. In criminal cases evidence should be sought, collected, and preserved for use in subsequent prosecution of the person responsible for the injury. A medical-legal autopsy should never be performed until the pathologist knows the circumstances surrounding the death. Just as a hospital pathologist reviews the chart prior to the autopsy, so must the individual doing the medical-legal autopsy \"review\" the circumstances leading to and surrounding the death. Such a review will often guide the pathologist's approach to the case, as well as indicate what evidence should be sought. All bodies received for autopsy should be logged in as to time and date of arrival, who transported the body, and who received it. Valuables should be removed and a list made of them. Earrings, rings, and wristwatches, may be left on the body if their presence is noted. The body should then be kept in a secure area where casual visitors or the curious cannot gain access. The first object in a forensic autopsy is documentation of the identity of the deceased. In some of the older medical examiner systems, identification of the deceased is made by the next of kin. When this procedure is used, a note should be made on the autopsy protocol as to the time and date of identification, the person who made the identification, and the person to whom the identification was made. Such personal identification is the least reliable method. Under the stress of sudden, unexpected, and sometimes violent death, the next of kin have on numerous occasions identified the wrong body. It is our feeling that identification photographs and fingerprints are the methods of choice. Prior to the autopsy an identification photo should be taken, with a sign indicating the autopsy number in the picture. In court this photograph can be identified by the next of kin as a picture of the deceased. The medical examiner can then identify it as a picture of the individual he autopsied. If the defense feels that the photograph is too gory and may influence the jury, it can be admitted in evidence on the condition that it is not shown to the jury. Fingerprints should also be taken on every body examined. In all homicides, suspected homicides, or gunshot wound cases, these fingerprints should be taken only after the prosecutor has a chance to examine the hands for trace evidence, wounds, or powder soot. 87 The importance of examining clothing in cases of gunshot wounds can never be overemphasized. The presence or absence of bullet holes and of soot around such holes may indicate the position of the deceased at the time he was shot, as well as the range at which he was shot. This in turn may be of great significance in determining whether a death was suicide or homicide, and if homicide, whether it was compatible with self-defense. Following all traumatic or suspected traumatic deaths during which the victim was clothed, the clothing should be examined before it is removed from the body and a list of the clothing should be made. In cases of gunshot wounds, pertinent, positive, or negative findings concerning the clothing must be recorded. The presence or absence of bullet holes and surrounding soot should be noted. If an individual survives a gunshot wound long enough to be transported to a hospital, the clothing is often cut or tom away. This is an acceptable practic e insofar as diagnosis and therapy are concerned; the clothing, however, should not be discarded, destroyed, or released to the next of kin. The hospital should retain it and tum it over to the crime lab, the proper police agency, or the physician designated to conduct the forensic autopsy. This physician should draw no final conclusions regarding the wounds prior to examining the clothing. After the clothing is removed form the body, it should be handled as little as possible. It should be placed in a clean container and labelled with the victim's name, the date, the autopsy number, and the name of the physician, before its transfer to the appropriate authority. Whenever a piece of evidence is removed from a body, whether it be trace evidence, bullet, or clothing, it should be placed in a bag or container with at least the name of the deceased, the autopsy number, the date, and the name of the prosecutor. In the case of a bullet, it is often best to indicate the location from which the bullet was recovered and the markings put on the bullet. This evidence should be stored in a secure area. When the police or crime lab personnel come to pick up the evidence, a signed receipt should be obtained. This receipt is necessary to prove maintenance of the chain of evidence. The time and date of transfer as well as the names of the recipient of the evidence and the individual who transferred the evidence should be recorded on the receipt; the receipt should then be signed by both individuals. 88 The Autopsy Report Vincent J.M. Dimaio, M.D. The autopsy report should begin with a general description of the body. This should include the age; race; height; weight; degree and distribution of rigor mortis and livor morris; hair and eye color; and appearance of the nose, ears, mouth, teeth, and external genitalia. Any external evidence of disease, as well as the presence of scars or tattoos, should be indicated. A list of the clothing worn by the deceased should also be included. Following the general external examination section, all evidence of injury should be described. This description of injury should be kept in a separate section. It should not be distributed under the descriptions of individual organs or organ systems. Grouping all the injuries in one section makes for a more coherent autopsy report. In addition, when one later has to testify regarding the case, it is not necessary to search through the whole autopsy report to fmd the injuries. Gunshot wounds and knife wounds should be described in terms of location, shape, dimensions, and appearance. Pertinent positive and negative findings should be recorded. The distance of all wounds from the top of the head and from the midline should be specified. In addition, it is advisable, even mandatory, to orient such injuries with respect to some landmark in the vicinity of the wound, e.g., the umbilicus or the nipple. In the case of a gunshot wound, one should indicate whether it is an entrance or an exit wound. The presence or absence of abrasion rings, powder, soot, searing, and powder tattooing should be noted and the dimensions of these items described. This is especially important when dealing with powder tattooing. Defects of the clothing corresponding to the gunshot wounds should also be described. After external examination of the injury, description of the wound track should be given in anatomical order. The amount of blood present in pleural or peritoneal cavities should be indicated. A bullet should not be recovered by instruments; rather, fingers should be used in order to preserve the rifling marks on the bullet. The bullet should then be marked on its base (never on its side) with initials or numerals. If it cannot be marked on the base, it may be marked on the tip, as long as the markings do not obscure any rifling. Following a description of each wound, a sentence should be added indicating the overall path of the bullet through the body, e.g., front-to-back, left-to-right or downward. In all descriptions having to do with the size of the wound, inches and fractions of inches should be used as the system of measurement. The metric system should not be used at the present time because the forensic autopsy report is often examined by and intended for individuals not familiar with this system. In addition, when testifying in court, one is expected to describe the wound in inches rather than according to the metric system. Weights of organs and nontraumatic lesions may be described using the metric system, however. 89 In all gunshot wound cases, photographs and x-rays should be taken when possible. Diagrams illustrating the major injuries or findings are often extremely useful. All the forensic autopsies should be complete in order to be of maximum value. This means that the head, chest, and abdominal cavities should be opened and the organs removed. In cases of homicide, there is no exception to the rule that the autopsy must be complete. In the autopsy report, a description of the internal organs should follow the section on external examination of the body and description of the wounds. Previous descriptions of injuries to these organs need not be repeated. After description of the internal viscera, the next section of the autopsy report should be devoted to microscopic and toxicologic findings. Microscopic sections are often unnecessary in cases of trauma where death occurred almost immediately. Appropriate toxicologic studies should be performed depending on the type of case. In all cases of homicide, blood alcohol and blood type should be performed, as a minimum. If the victim was hospitalized for a considerable period of time prior to autopsy, blood alcohol determination is unnecessary. When drug use is suspected, a complete toxicologic examination should be performed. If there is doubt, tissue and fluids should be saved and frozen. One can always go back to these specimens if necessary. In the case of trauma, if a person has been hospitalized for a number of days or received multiple units of blood, toxicologic analysis of the blood at autopsy is generally of no use. Most trauma cases will have had blood drawn for typing and cross-matching at the time of admission. This blood is often retained in the blood bank for one to two weeks. In such cases, the blood bank personnel should be contacted to see if they have any of the original blood, so that it can be used for typing and drug analysis. The autopsy report should be concluded with sections labeled \"Findings\" and \"Opinion.\" The \"Findings\" should include all significant gross microscopic and toxicologic observations, in order of importance. The major cause of death should be listed as the first finding. The last section, labeled \"Opinion,\" should be worded as plainly as possible. Medical terms should be avoided if ordinary English will suffice. This is the part of the protocol that will interest most people when they consult the autopsy to determine how and of what the individual died. The conclusion should be short, straightforward, and to the point. Speculations concerning minor points should not be included. Extensive speculation in the conclusion often comes back to haunt the prosecutor. In difficult cases the pathologist should not hesitate to seek advice and consultation from other pathologists or forensic scientists. Even the most experienced forensic pathologist will request a second opinion on a different case. Summary In summary, there are six points to be remembered in performing an adequate forensic autopsy. . A complete history of the circumstances surrounding the death should be obtained prior to the autopsy. 90 2. The identification of the deceased should be documented. . A complete, detailed external examination of the body and of the clothing should be performed. In all cases of homicide or suspected homicide, the clothing should be saved. . A complete autopsy should be performed and injuries should be documented with diagrams, photos, and x-rays when indicated. 5. Pertinent negatives should be included in the report of the autopsy. 6. Toxicologic studies should be performed when indicated. 91 NOTES 92 APPROACHING THE DEATH SCENE Approaching the Death Scene I. PRELIMINARY m. B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I. J. K.

Summary The investigation of death, particularly the homicide, is one of the most important investigations to which a police officer may be called upon to respond. There are three basic principles involved in the initiation of an effective death investigation. A. Rapid response to the death scene by patrol officers, the purpose being to protect evidentiary materials before they are destroyed, altered, or lost. B. Evidence. Anything and everything should be considered evidence. Physical or testimonial evidence must be noted, preserved, and brought to the attention of the investigators. 99 C. Notification of additional resources. After the scene is secured, immediate and appropriate notification must be made to the homicide investigators. 100 Collecting and Handling Evidence Infected with Human Disease-Causing Organisms \"Today... investigators and crime scene technicians are more likely than ever before to encounter crimes of violence involving blood and other body fluids of persons with infectious diseases.'\" By PAUL D.

The crime scene is an apartment which has been properly secured by the first of- ricers arriving. Upon entenng the ao=rt- ment. you observe the nude body of a young man, who has been stal3ioed nu- merous times, lying in a pool of liquid and coagulated blood.

In a study by the U.S. Depa[lment of Defense. conducted from October 1, 1985. through March 3, 1986. it was de- termined that positive tests for AIDS antibodies in mditary recruits was 1 5 per 1,000, a pattern, that could be con- s~stent throughout lhe United States m general. 9 Leading experts and ep~- FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 102 III ..... \"The first line of defense against infection at the crime scene is protecting the hands and keeping them clean and away from the eyes, mouth, and nose.\" demlolog~sts anticipate that ~n the next 20 years, this number wdl ~ncrease.ex- potentially. Researchers have determined that the AIDS virus can surwve at least 15 days in dried ancI liquid blood samples at room temperature, 'o although the survivability of the AIDS virus in other body fluids has not been determined. It is not known how long the hepatitis B vi- rus and the tuberculosis spore can sur- vive at room temperature. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis) is a viral infection that can result in jaun- dice, Cirrhosis, and sometimes, cancer of the liver. The virus may be found m human blood, ur=ne, semen, cere- brospinal fluid, vaginal secretions, and saliva.\" the bloodstream, droplet exposure of mucous mem- branes, and contact with broken skin are the prima~ hazards. There =s a vac- cine currently avadable against hepa- titis B. Tuberculosis This bacterial disease can be transmitted through saliva,unne, blood, and in some cases, other body fluids by persons infecteai wtth tt. It can enter the body through droplets that are ~nhaled and primarily causes lung ~nfect~ons. The tuberculosis bactena forms spores. s=mflar to seeds in plants, that are h~ghly resistant to drying and other physical mear~s that would easdy kill other bactena.:-' Defenses Against Exposure What can be done to minimize the exposure of ~r~v, estJgators and crime scene techn~oans to pathogenpc m~cro- orgamsms? The first hne of defense against mfectfon at the crime scene is protecting the hands and keeping them clean and away from the eyes, mouth, and nose. The best protection ts to wear disposable gloves. Any person w~th a cut, abrasion, or any other break ~n the skin on the hands should never handle blood or other body fluids with- out protection. Convement boxes of latex medical examination gloves, in different s~zes, may be purchased and kept in the crime scene kit or in the trunk of a patrol car. Always keep a plastic bag, clearly marked, which will be used for no other purpose than to collect contaminated items until the~y can be disposed of properly. Replace the gloves when they become heavily stained or ~f you leave the crime scene. When you are completely finished w~th the crime scene, or ~f you leave tem- porardy, wash you hands thoroughly with soap and water. If cotton gloves are worn when working w~th items hav- ing potential latent fingerprint value. ,wear cotton gloves over latex ones. Re- member that under no circumstances, should anyone at the crime scene be al- lowed to smoke, eat. drink, or apply makeup. Shoes can become contaminated w~th blood, which can then be trans- ported from the crime scene to auto- moodes, the police station, or home. Protectwe convenngs made of dispos- able o~ast~c or paper should be consid- ered. Particles of dried blood fly in every ,a~rection when a dried blood stare ~s scraped. Because of th~s, surgical masks and orotect~ve eyewear should be considered when the poss~bdity ex- ,sis that dned b!ood Darhcles or drops of '~quld blood may strike the face or eyes. A mask and glasses wdl not protect you f,om wruses clue to their minute size but will certainly hetp prevent dried or =au~d sloop particles, whtcn contain v~- ruses, from entering the mouth, nose, or eyes. While processing the crime scene. constantly be alert for sharp objects, since hypodermic needles and syringes are often secreted in unusual places. When handling knives, razors, broken glass, nails, or any other sharp object bearing blood, use the utmost care to prevent a cut or puncture of the skin. Even seemingly innocuous items, such as metal staples in paper, present a po- tential hazard. For this reason, use pa- per or plastic tape, whenever possible, when packaging evidence. In the event you receive an acci- dental puncture or cut from a needle or instrument on which blood or another body fluid is present, immediately seek medical assistance. If an antiseptic. such as rubbing alcohol is avadable, cleanse the wound w~th the antiseptLc, then wash with soap and water pnor to seeking medical assistance. A physi- cian will decide the best course of rem- edies, depending on the situation and the type of wound. If practical, use only d~sposable items at a cnme scene where ~nfect~ous blood is present. However, even these items, such as pens, pencds, gloves, masks, and shoe covers, should be de- contaminated before disposal. Prefera- bly, the items should be incinerated: however, ff th~s is not possible, arrange with your pathologist or a local hospqtal to stentize the items by autoclawng and then dispose of them properly. All nondisposable ~tems. sucn as cameras, tools, notebooks, etc. aJso must be decontaminated These dems should be cleansed thoroughly wLm a solution conststmg of 1 cud of sodium hypochlorite (common household I~au~d bleach) dissolved in a gallon of water (never mix bleach w~th ammoma or ab \"'... protective practices ... along with exercising care and using common sense, will decrease the risk to the law enforcement officer and others.\" :C~?

Other units of the FBI Laboratory wdl then conduct their examinations. 2) Acknowledgement letters from both the prosecuting and defense attorneys must accompany all evi- dence advising they are aware that serological evidence wdl be de- stroyed and that this procedure will not be subject to legal or judicial ac- tion in the future. 3) The evidence must be properly packaged and labeled.

Westveer Violent Crimes Instructor Behavioral Science Unit FBI Academy, Quantico, VA 109 Introduction Personality Assessment The Personality Assessment is an investigative aid designed to elicit accurate answers to significant and important questions pertaining to death. In addition, this assessment can be beneficial when investigating equivocal death cases. When using this assessment it is important to ask the questions the same way to everyone interviewed and to indicate, on the record, the responses of the person interviewed verbatim. **This is modified version of the Personality Assessment form used by the NCAVC in their investigations.

Methods for Identification 1. Least reliable methods a. b. C. Personal recognition by relatives or friends Clothing - may be helpful in mass disasters Personal effects - may be helpful in mass disasters 2. Scientific methods based upon comparison a. Fingerprints: the most reliable method for identification in the United States since the establishment of a national repository for data by the FBI in 1924. Footprints, ear prints, and lip prints are also useful, provided appropriate records, or records prepared for latent prints are available for comparison. b. Dental: the individual characteristics of teeth, compared with dental records and dental X-rays, provide an excellent means for identification, as well as information concerning the age, race, preexisting disease, habits, occupation. Teeth and prosthetic appliances are often resistant to the effects of trauma and heat. C. Skeletal: bones are often resistant to the effects of environmental conditions and time, as well as the effects of heat. Depending upon the completeness of the skeletal remains, it is often possible to determine the age at death, sex, race, evidence of prior disease or injury, estimate of living stature, and other individual characteristics. Animal bones are distinguished from human bones. d. Hair: Microscopic comparative examination of the cuticular patterns and cross sections of hair are helpful in the determination of race, as well as to identify hair from animals. 127 . e. Serologic and cytologic studies: blood group and Rh type, animal versus human blood, identification of species, Gm factor, sex chromatin, karyotyping. f. Postmortem examination: occupational marks, evidence of preexisting diseases, congenital defects, tattoos, evidence of prior injuries, operative scars, and absence of organs due to prior surgical procedures provide the basis for comparison with medical and employment records. g. Radiographic: films obtained during life are compared with postmortem films. Foreign materials and metallic fragments not observed during the postmortem examination may be detected. Comparison of dental radiographs. Radiographic evaluation of ossification and fusion of epiphyses, as well as of dental development, may provide estimate of age in children and young adults. Association with or exclusion of remains from other remains based upon individual characteristics, sex, or other factors. IV. Special Procedures A. General . . . . . . For each unknown remains, as well as for multiple remains, prepare diagrams and tables for comparison between the unknown and the known features. Examine eyeglasses, including frames and lenses, for comparison with medical records. Look beneath eyelids for contact lenses. Examine lenses with ultraviolet light for markings of manufacturer. If there is a glove-like separation of the epidermis from the hands, the \"glove\" may be used to obtain fingerprints. If the epidermis is missing, it may be possible to fingerprint the denuded hands. If the hands are putrefied, desiccated, or charred, submit them to CJIS, FBI, for further study. Examine clothing and describe the size, color, condition, and type of each garment. Record descriptions of laundry marks, labels, and name tags. Examine for invisible laundry marks with ultraviolet light. Remove and examine dentures for name and identification number of individual that may be embedded in the denture base. 128 B* C. .

Compare antemortem and postmortem dental X-rays and records Microscopic examination of ground sections of teeth to determine age When there is commingling of skeletal remains, examine bones with short-wave ultraviolet light to segregate the bones. Prior to examination of bones, arrange in anatomic order. Obtain photographs and X-rays of bone lesions for comparison with antemortem films. Examine pubic bones for parturition pits, indicative of prior pregnancy. Determine estimate of living stature from accurate measurement of long bones and comparison with tables in textbooks. Record degree of ossification and fusion of epiphyses for comparison with tables of ossification centers in textbooks. Examine anterior surface of pubic symphysis in Caucasian male adults for comparison with models for estimate of age. Microscopic examination of ground sections of teeth and cross sections of shafts of long bones for estimate of age. 129 V. D. E. F. G. Hair and Fingernails 1.

Ke,, Points in determining time of death The only accurate method of determining the time of death is to be there when it happens even then. you have a small range of error. There is currently no single accurate marker of the time of death The closer to the actual time of death, the more accurate is the opinion possible from the scene and markers of death. The experience and caution of the investigator, coupled with the classic death markers and a well-established window of death can lead to a reasonable range of death. To determine the probable range of death: \u000e9 First establish a window of death. When could death have occurred? When was the deceased last known to be alive and when was the body found? This difference is the range of time wherein death could have occurred. \u000e9 Second, use those scene markers that allow some positioning of the death, within that window: morning newspaper read, phone calls made, type of meal consumed, place and state of dress. C~ Third, adjust this preliminary opinion by any additional data; e.g., that issue of the newspaper could have been available late the night before, the man works nights and sleeps days, etc. Consider environmental factors and factors that may have changed with time; e.g., sun shining on victim, air conditioner blowing on body. Use observation of the degree of rigor, amount and position of livor, body temperature, presence of fly eggs or larvae, etc., to further refine opinion. Use the temperature and vitreous potassium or other testing to further refine opinion. As a summation, use considerable caution on time of death determinations, as there can be factors tl~at markedly enhance or retard the chemistry of death and its changes. Accentuate giving range of death and basis of determination. 1This se,ction was adapted from a paper presented by Dr. Patricia J. McFeeley, Chief Medical Investigator, St.at, of New Me~:ico, Albuquerque, at the VICAP International Symposium at Quantico, Virginia, June 19-23, 1988. 135 9 Don't attempt to make your opinion more accurate than the data aiio~,. A. Ensure that you specify that these are preliminary findings or your final opinion, whichever is correct. Rigor Mortis One of the classic markers of death, its normal sequence is well documented in history. In Michelangelo's famous statue of Christ being taken from the cross. the flaccidity typical soon after death is clearly evident. Muscular relaxation immediately after death is followed by the onset of gradual rigidity without shortening of the muscle. Since muscle continues to metabolize for a short time after somatic death or from products built up during the death event, glycogen (starch used to create metabolic sugars) is converted into lactic acid (sugary milk released in urine after excretion). As the pH falls (acidic levels), the muscle protoplasm physically changes. Since ATP (Adenosine triphosphate, which is created during muscular exertion) does not regenerate in dead muscle, this process proceeds in one direction only. The solution is converted into a gel as the actin of the muscle is physically changed. Perception of rigor is more rapid in the smaller muscles, leading to the misbelief that his process starts in the head and works down the body. All muscles are affected at a similar rate; rigor is more evident in the short, smaller muscles earlier than in the longer, larger muscle masses. Since this is a chemical process, heat accelerates and cold decelerates the process. Acidosis (low acidic levels causing tissue malfunction, especially ira the central nervous system), uremia (excess waste products in the blood), or other medical conditions promoting a lowered Ph accelerate the process. The very perception of rigor depends on experience and condition. A very cold body may appear stiff because of changes in the fat layer. Mechanism: Onset: Manifested: Maximum: Disappears: physical change immediate 1-6 hours 6-24 hours 12-36+ hours Rigor is typically quantified by mild or early, moderate or mid, and full or complete as a descriptive statement of degree of change. This is totally subjective, and two observers may have different interpretations. Usually, perceived stiffness in motion of a joint is mild; difficulty, requiring force to move a joint, is moderate; and having to use great force is full rigor. 136 B. Once the physical change of the muscle is forced, that degree of change will not reoccur, so that if someone has broken the rigor, it will not reform if to completion. If only partial, some rigo; will continue to form. Rigor is an unreliable method of indicating the time of death. It is affected by illness, temperature, activity before death, and the physical conditions where the body is placed or found. It may be poorly formed in the young or the old. It is an aid in the general determination of death at best, and should not be relied on as a single indicator of the time of death. Algor Mortis (Cooling down after death) The metabolism of the tissue generates heat, which is very tightly regulated by the body to a narrow range. Cooling of the body after death is another of the classic markers of death. If the body always cooled at a uniform rate, that slope would enable an accurate determination of the time of death. However, the body temperature is a narrow range, not a fixed temperature. Activity, illness, decomposition, infection, and absorption of heat can maintain or raise body temperature after death. The body cools by radiation, convection, and direct transfer so that any facts that influence heat loss affect rate. The scene, clothing, patient size, and activity and physical factors have to be carefully considered in interpreting cooling rate. Over the years, there have been a number of formulas proffered that would, in theory, allow the calculation of the time of death. Glaister's: 98.4 - measured rectal temp = hours since death 1.5 In Fatteh is the statement that the cooling of the body is the most reliable factor for the first 12-18 hours, but he points out that exercise or struggle could raise the temperature from 98.40 by 3-40, sleep lowers, etc. He included the warning that degree of fatness, age, and ventilation all changed the rate, and that clothed bodies cool 66% slower and bodies in water 2 times as fast. Marshall and Hoar, in a series of articles on this topic, stated that the rate was not uniform, but lo/hour for the first three hours, then 2o/hr for the next six hours, then l'/2o/hour for the next three, etc. Spitz and Fisher caution that they had observed cases where 93 ~ was reached in as short a time as 2 hours and as late as 6 hours. Temperature has to be considered in light of all the scene data, and any altering factor. For example, if a dead person was in a closed car all day with the sun shining on the car and then was discovered at night, the body could not be expected to have 137 cooled in the regular fashion; in fact, it may well have an elevated or antiquity, the settling of blood to the dependent parts of the body has been recognized as a change of death. When cardiac activity stops, the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid blood causes it to settle and distend the dependent capillary bed. The color of the dependent part will depend on the skin pigment and any additional compounds in the blood that may affect color, such as carbon monoxide, but it is generally dark blue or purple. Livor begins at or very soon after death, since it is a function of blood flow and therefore cardiac activity. However, stasis can occur to some extent in shock and some degree of lividity can be present even while a person is technically alive. Mechanism: Settling Onset: Immediate Manifested: 2-4 hours Maximum: 8-12 hours Disappears: ....... There are factors that will accelerate or retard the onset of visible livor, and the disappearance rate is similarly variable. Tardieu's Spots When the accumulated area engorged with blood is large, gravity can cause capillaries in a small area to rupture so that larger, usually circular or rounded areas of skin hemorrhage occur. These have to be differentiated from the much smaller petechial hemorrhages more suggestive of asphyxia. ~ Size is important since these areas are usually 4-5mm or larger in diameter, whereas petechiae are usually l mm or smaller in diameter. Livor will not usually develop where there is pressure from clothing or objects, so important information regarding whether a patient was clothed for a period of time after death or if his position was changed can be gained from a careful inspection of livor's distribution. Generally, time can at best be supported from observation of livor and comparison with the accelerating or decelerating factors affecting that scene. 138 II. C. Vitreous Potassium A study of cell physiology reveals that the cell maintains an increased concentration of potassium in the intracellular fluid, 20-30 times the concentration in the plasma. This high concentration requires a balance between the electrical charges inside and outside the cell membrane and is maintained in this relatively high concentration by active metabolic forces that \"pump\" the electrolytes selectively across the membrane. A return to equilibrium occurs after death at a steady rate because the pumping mechanism is no longer active and the cell wall now becomes a semipermeable membrane that allows the potassium to leak through the membrane to approach equilibrium. The leak is at a steady rate because of the mechanical limits of the membrane. This steady rate provides a built-in clock that allows a projection back to the time of death. Since blood hemolyzes and loses potassium, it becomes unreliable for analysis. An ideal sample, protected from most trauma, is the vitreous fluid of the eye. The concept is valid, but it has to be interpreted in light of regional variations and with consideration for accelerating or decelerating factors. Evidence for Estimation of Time of Death Use a combination of all evidence available to you, giving weight to the more reliable/documentable. Be suspicious when some factors seem to vary considerably from the other. A. Corporal Evidence: In the body ~ 2. 3. 4. 5.

Should be treated as any other case; i.e., careful examination and documentation of scene, collection of evidence, etc. Best approach is to plan ahead (another day at this stage will probably not change the scene significantly, but could make the final conclusion better) Use the services of a forensic anthropologist liberally and early Weathering of the bones depends considerably on: buried or not buried climate moisture elevation terrain protection insects/animals (human) intervention Scene conditions should be photographed, sketched, measured, etc., for later interpretation. Collect plants when appropriate. Check weather bureaus for rainfall, temperatures, etc. Interpretation must take into account the local conditions--results vary widely with different areas of the country. VI.

Virginia ,91. Lee Goff University of Hawaii at Manoa Honolulu, Hawaii The remains of a 48 year old female in a moderately advanced stage of decomposition were found in a brush- filled ditch in a predominantly industrial area outside of Honolulu. Hawaii. The body was lying face up across the ditch, which was partially filled with water. The skull was largely devoid of flesh and the mandible was separated from the skull. Three toes of the left foot were missing. The left hand was missing below the wrist, but the right hand was intact, although mummified. The remains were clothed in a blackened skirt. Upper, ex- posed portions of the remains were dry and partially mummified, while the lower, parnally immersed, por- tions presented the appearance of the advanced decay stage of decomposition. Both feet were dehydrated, as were the right hand and arm. The rib cage was exposed. with some shreds of skin attached. Further examination of the remains at the morgue revealed a largely skeletonized body lacking internal viscera and having only portions of parchment-like skin covering the neck. face and lower extremities. With the exception of a fractured hyoid bone. no evidence of antemortem traumatic injury was tbund, although there was some evidence of postmortem vertebrate animal depredation. Due to the presence of the fractured hyoid bone. cause of death was deterrruned to have been manual strangulation. Collection of arthropods associated with the re- mains was made during autopsy. The portions of the body that were immersed in water yielded blow fly and flesh fly larvae. The former were identified as Chrvsomva megacephala and this identification was confirmed by reanng representative larvae to the adult stage. The flesh fly larvae were not successfully reared and the species identity remains uncertain. A greater variety of arthropods were present on the drier portions of the remains. Larvae of the Piophilidae, Piophila easel, were present in moderate numbers along with emergent third instar larvae of a green bottle fly, Phaenicia cuprina. Empty pupanal cases of another blow fly, Chr~'sornva rufifacies, were attached to the exposed ribs and leg bones. Adult dermestid beetles (Dermestes maculatus) were present on the external surfaces of the remains and exarmnation of the body cavities revealed a large number of both early and late instar larvae of this species. Clerid beetles, Necrobia rufipes, also were present on the external surfaces of the remains. Analysis of the insect taxa and stages of develop- ment resulted in a postmortem interval estimate of 19.5 days. This estimate was based on the total assemblage of insects present on the remains and fit well with the last confirmed sighting of the decedent 20 days prior to the discovery of the remains. The arthropods of primary significance in the post- mortem interval estimate in this case were C. rufifacies and D. maculatus, as these were the species indicating the longest period of residence on the remains. On the island of Oahu. C. rufifacies requires 10-12 days for development under ambient temperatures. This species is one of the first to arrive at remains and oviposition continues for the first 4-5 days of decomposition. Pres- ence of only empty puparial cases of this species indi- cated a minimum postmortem interval of 16-17 days. Derrnestid beetles associated with remains in the Hawai- ian Islands appear between days 6-8 in habitats similar to those of this case. Late instar larvae of D. maculatus in the body cavities were consistent with the 19-20 day postmortem interval. Also consistent with this time pe- riod were pupana of P. cupr!na in the soil near the remains and the clerid N. rufipes on the drier portions of the remains. The partial immersion in water of these remains served to keep them in a condition suitable for oviposi- tion by adult flies longer than would be usual in a purely terrestrial environment. This case vividly illustrates how insect evidence collected from in, on, and around the body of a victim of untimely death, when properly collected, preserved and analyzed by an experienced and appropriately trained forensic entomologist, can provide an accurate estimate of the victim's time of death, as well as other forensi- Dcpl. of Justxce Prr D470-M Jacket No. 342--488 Print Order 60651 Vol. 1 -- Forensic Aspects of DNA 2rid Page Proof_163 155 cally valuable information concerning the circumstances surrounding the victim's demise. Within the United States and around the world in- sect scientists (entomologistsl are being called upon with increasing frequency to apply their knowledge and ex- pertise to criminal and civil proceedings and to become recognized members of forensic laboratories and medi- cal/legal investigation teams. This need has given rise to an entomological sub-specialty termed tbrensic entomology. CHARACTERISTICS OF INSECTS Insects are members of the class Insects in the invertebrate phylum Arthropoda. As a group, insects are probably the most successful and numerous creatures on earth. Over 900,000 species are known and it is esti- mated that'this represents only 1/5 to 1/10 of the insect species that actually exist. Currently, there are about three times as many, known insect species as there are species of all other animals combined. In just the Nearc- tic region (that part of North America lying north of Mexico), the insect fauna includes an estimated 125,000 to 150.000 species. In contrast, only about 3,200 species of mammals are known in the entire world. Insects are highly adaptable creatures and can be found in nearly every conceivable habitat and situation. Annually, insects destroy millions of dollars worth of agricultural crops. They serve as vectors for the caus- ative agents of many of the worst diseases of man and domestic animals. In addition, they bite. sting and attack man and animals directly, causing irritation, blood loss and in some cases even death. Insects. however, are \"also extremely beneficial, pro- viding such products as bee's wax and honey, silk. shel- lac and many of the basic components of cosmetics. For many years insects have been used extensively in the scientific laboratory and have greatly enhanced progress in nearly \",all aspects of biological and medical research. In certain regions of the world insects are even valued as a protein-rich food source. Although there is much that can be said both for and against insects as they relate to man, the vast major- ity of insects are quite neutral, neither bestowing any great benefit nor causing any great harm. Insects include such well known creatures as flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, cockroaches, termites, beetles, butterflies and moths, wasps and bees, fleas and lice. Insect adults can be differentiated from most other ani- mals by several rather distinct traits. Among these are a hardened outer body called an exoskeleton, which is subdivided into a distinct head, thorax and abdomen; three pairs of jointed legs attached to the thorax; a single pair of antennae located on the head; large compound eyes: and one or two pairs of wings. With few exceptions, adult insects lay eggs. Imma- ture insects emerging from some eggs look very much like their parents, except that they are smaller in size and wingless. These immature insects, called nymphs, peri- odically cast their skins (moult). as they increase in size. Each stage between moults is termed an instar. Eventu- ally, nymphs pass through a final moult and display ,`all of the characteristics of adults. Grasshoppers. cockroaches and the young of several other groups grow in this gradual fashion. Most insects, however, pass through three very dis- sinular stages during their development, namely egg, larva and pupa. None of these stages bears any resem- blance to any other stage or to the adult. Larva. which hatch from these e~,~,s,o,, are often soft-bodied and re- semble caterpillars, maggots, or grubs. As they grow, these larvae can cast their skins (moult) as they increase in size. The number of larvae moults varies dramatically from insect group to group. Eventually, however, these larvae surround themselves with a hardened cocoon-like outer skin in which they undergo their final pre-adult development. This stage is called the pupa. Fully formed adult insects eventually emerge from the pupal enclo- sure. Butterflies, moths, flies, beetles and numerous other insect groups develop in this manner. Most of the foren- sically important insect species pass through this latter type of development. INSECTS AND HUMAN DECOMPOSITION Apart from the bacteria and fungi, insects are the most important processors of dead animal remains. A wide variety of carcass-frequenting specialists utilize decomposing materials both as a tbod source and as a place to rear their young. Animal studies have shown that carcasses left uncovered and freely exposed to in- sects lose up to 90% of their weight within a week during summer months. In contrast, carcasses covered with mesh to prevent insect access, gradually dry out and mummify over a period of more than 100 days. Because decomposing animal remains occur rela- tively infrequently and are widely scattered throughout the environment, insects which specialize in utilizing these resources have evolved highly developed methods of carcass detection (smell) and locomotion (flight). Ini- tially, strong flying insects, particularly flies, are at- tracted to the odors produced by gases and body fluids oozing from the natural body openings and to blood escaping from wounds. In time, the skin, underlying organs, flesh and bone become attractive to other groups of scavenging insects. Insects are responsible for the consumption of virtually all parts of the carcass except the skeleton. As a carcass decomposes, therefore, it can be viewed as a succession of habitats each attractive 156 Dept. of Justme Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-488 Print Order 60651 Vol. r. __ Forensic Aspects of DNA 2nd Page Proof I.,64 to. and supporting, a different group of specialized insects. Although the exact species may differ from country, to country, from habitat to habitat, and from season to season, the basic pattern of the succession of insect decomposers is remarkably constant around the world. Human corpses, whether they have been produced naturally or as the result of foul play. are processed by these insect decomposers in the same manner as any other piece of animal carcass. Forensic entomology, there- fore. is based on the analysis of the insects and other invertebrates which sequentially colonize a corpse as decomposition progresses and on the rates at which the various stages of their offspring develop. Entomological information can be extremely useful in deterimning man- ner of death, movement of a cadaver from one site to 9 another and length of the post mortem interval. THE IMPORTANCE OF BLOW FLIES While a wide 'variety of insect species are attracted to decomposing remmns and play an active role in the decay process, two groups, the flies (Diptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) are of major importance in most circum- stances. Diptera (flies), whose larvae are capable of living in a semi-liquid medium, are the first insects to be attracted to and colonize decomposing remains. Fly lar- vae (maggotsl are responsible for the dramatic con- sumption of the cadaver's organs and tissues. Only much later, when the corpse has to a large extent dried out, do the species of other insect groups, notably Coleoptera (beetlesl move in and continue the process. Large. strong flying, highly mobile flies are typi- cally the first insects to be attracted by the faint aromas emanating from a fresh corpse. Blow flies (family: Calliphoridae) frequently arrive within minutes to a few hours after death and are generally the first individuals to arrive at a crime scene. Blow flies amving at a corpse either begin to lay e=,:,so,,\" immediately, or first feed on the protein-rich fluids emanating from the corpse and then begin oviposition. Initially these flies feed and lay eggs in the natural body openings (ears. eyes, nose. mouth. and if exposed, the anus and genitalia). This is due to the fact that blow fly adults have soft, tongue-like mouth parts which are not capable of piercing human skin. Natural body openings also provide moist, hurmd cavi- ties which enhance egg hatching and larval survival. Blow fly eggs are small (2-3 mm), whitish-yellow and somewhat elon gate. They are frequently packed into natural body openings in large numbers and are easily visible to the naked eye. During colder months, how- ever, their numbers may be few and they may be diffi- cult to locate, being hidden in more cryptic sites such as under the eyelids or within the nostrils. Blow fly eggs will typically hatch within one to three days, depending on species and environmental conditions. When blow fly eggs hatch, they produce small. relatively featureless, worm-like creatures called larvae or maggots. Blow fly larvae have a tapered anterior end containing a pair of mouth hooks which the larvae use in feeding and also tbr locomotion. Posteriorly the larvae bear a pair of flattened nosmls called spiracles, through which they breathe. These features, along with the lar- vae size and shape, provide important diagnostic fea- tures. The larvae grow rapidly, passing through three moults (instars) before becoming fully grown. Large numbers of larvae typically hatch together and move around the corpse as a group. Blow fly larvae are respon- sible for disseminating bacteria and secreting enzymes which enable them to consume virtually all of the soft tissues contained within the corpse. Blow fly larvae become fully grown within several days to several weeks depending upon species, environmental conditions and the number of larvae present. After reaching the third instar, larvae undergo a dramatic behavioral change in which they crawl away from the corpse, burrow down into the soil and pupate. As previously mentioned the process of pupation in- volves the secretion of a hardened outer skin or casing around the body of the larvae. Within this pupal case the larvae undergoes complete physical reorganization and eventually emerges bearing all of the adult fly character- istics. Blow fly pupae are small, football-shaped struc- tures which are reddish to dark brown in color. Pupal cases are extremely resilient and will in some cases remain in the soil beneath the corpse for hundreds of years. Blow fly pupal cases can supply valuable infor- mation long after the remains of the body have decom- posed. Only through careful examination of the soil, either the corpse or at a site where a corpse is reported to have decomposed, will this valuable entomological evi- dence be found. Blow 'fly species differ in their abundance from region to region, from habitat to habitat and from season to season. In the northern U. S. for example, the blue blow fly, Calliphora vicina, is most abundant during the cooler parts of the year whereas the bronze blow fly Phaenicia sericata, dominates corpses during the warm- est parts of the summer. Similarly the green blow fly, Lucilia illustris, frequents corpses located in open, brightly lit habitats whereas the black blow fly, Phormia regina, prefers shaded localities. The careful analysis of the physical characteristics of the various developmental stages of the blow flies inhabiting the corpse, when coupled with the detailed knowledge of their ecology, and the environmental con- ditions to which they are exposed, can provide forensic D~'pt. of Jusuce Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-488 Print Order 60651 Vol. 1 -- Forensic Aspects of DNA 2nd Page P'- 157 investigators with meaningful information concerning the time of death, movement of the corpse from one site to another and manner of death. BEETLES AND THEIR ALLIES Following the invasion of the corpse by blow flies. a wide variety of other types of insects also colonize the remains. Carnon beetles, rove beetles, estid beetles all become members of the host corpse community feeding and rearing their young on the drier remaining tissues and on the large maggot mass. Addi- tionally, other types of flies including house flies, flesh flies, skipper flies, fruit flies and coffin flies also colo- nize the remaining tissues. The corpse eventually comes to support a complex and diverse community of insects often numbering hundreds of species and thousands of individuals. These insects, while far less numerous than the blow fly larvae which originally colonized the re- mains, can be seen flying, crawling and scurrying about the corpse itself and in the soil beneath the remains. As previously mentioned these insects are attracted to the corpse in an orderly, progressive fashion. The successive nature of the colonization process enables forensic entomologists, when supplied with a represen- tative sample of the insects present, to provide investiga- tors with forensically meaningful information concern- ing the circumstances surrounding the demise of the individual. Essentially. by knowing the players on the field at the time that the corpse was found, forensic entomologists are able to determine the inning of the game. COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF SPECIMENS Accurate forensic determinations depend upon the proper collection, preservation, and rearing of entomo- logical specimens. In order to accomplish this, investi- gators must be able to recognize adult and immature stages of locally abundant, cannon frequenting insects and be familiar with the proper techniques for collecting and preserving these animals. Representative samples of all adult and immature insects should be collected from on, in and beneath the corpse. Flying insects can be collected with the standard insect or short-handled hand net. It is important to make collections as soon as pos- sible as specimens of adult flies may leave the area surrounding the corpse when human activity becomes evident. Once collected adult specimens can be retained indefinitely for analysis. Adult flying insects can be immediately placed in 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol diluted 1 : 1 with water. Higher concentrations of isopro- pyl alcohol may cause speci aens to become brittle. Do not use formalin to preserve insects, unless no other preserving fluid is available. Insects preserved in forma- lin should be transferred to 70% alcohol as soon as possible. A small hand net and preserving fluid can easily be camed as part of standard equipment. Crawling insects from the surface of and within the corpse should be collected using forceps or the fingers. During sampling, hands should be protected with surgi- cal gloves at all times. Smaller specimens (under 5 mm) can be collected with a small artist's paint brush dipped in a preserving fluid. Crawling insects located on the ground beneath the corpse can most easily be collected by scooping up the top few centimeters of soil and placing it in a plastic bag. The plastic bag containing the soil should be chilled, if possible, until the insects are extracted and preserved to prevent further growth and possible predation or asphyxiation. This is particularly important when large numbers of fly larvae are present. As previously mentioned, some insects, particu- larly mature fly larvae and beetles, will burrow into the soil beneath the corpse. A careful examination of the soil beneath the corpse is important particularly in cases of advanced decay. This analysis is most easily accom- plished by removing large samples of soil from beneath the area where the corpse was located. These samples should be placed in plastic bags and refrigerated until they can be processed by a trained entomologist or labo- ratory technician. When skeletal remains are encountered in the field. a close examination of the bones and surrounding soil must be made prior to skeletal removal. Close examina- tion of bone cavities will usually produce numerous insect remains. The skull should be most closely exam- ined. particularly inside the cranial vault. The skull should be placed on a white sheet or large piece of white paper. and the eye orbits, nasal openings, cranial vault and auditory meatos probed with a pair of forceps and a penlight. The interior of the skull can then be gently washed inside and outside with water, while being held over a small collection screen or cheese cloth. Immature and soft-bodied insects, particularly the larvae of blow flies, are critical to an accurate forensic analysis. Representative samples of fly larvae, including the largest individuals present, should be collected and immediately subdivided into two subsamples. One subsample can be preserved immediately and the other should be saved alive for rearing to adult stages. Suffi- cient numbers of individuals should be collected to en- sure that a representative sample of the insect population is present. Samples of fly larvae to be immediately killed can be preserved by placing them in hot water (77\"C) for two to three minutes and then transferring them to 70% ethanol. Various alternative larval preservatives can be 158 Dept. of Justice Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-488 Print Order 60651 Vol I -- Forensic Aspects o[ DNA 2rid Page P~oofrq66 used. depending upon the avaalability, of the chemicals. Specimens for rearing should be placed alive in small ice cream cartons or similar containers 1/4 to 1/2 filled with a coarse inert material such as vermiculite. Moist soil can be used if other materials 'are noc available. Do not put living specimens to be reared in sealed plastic bags or sealed vials for longer than 12 hours, since they do poorly in such en,Aronments, especially in warm weather. Transport living material by the fastest possible means to a rearing facility. Use of the regular mail service usually is not suitable for transporting living material. Immature flies can be successfully reared on diets of beef liver, or on small pieces of musculature obtained from the corpse. Larvae should be gently transferred with forceps onto the dietary material which has been previously 'placed atop a 4-8 cm deep container filled with damp, coarse soil or vermiculite. Small glass dishes, 8-10 cm in diameter, or beakers are suitable. These cultures should contain 15-25 larvae each. Larval activ- ity should be checked daily and a record of larval size and instar recorded. Additional liver can be added to these cultures as needed. Mature larvae will migrate downward into the substrate and pupate. Adult flies will eventually emerge, crawl to the surface and attempt to fly away. Because of this. reanng containers should be placed inside standard insect-reanng cages or other mesh containers that will prevent adult flies from dispersing. Whenever possible, fly larvae should be reared in climatic conditions approximating those to which the corpse was exposed. Environmental chambers are use- ful. if available. Temperature is the most critical factor. Calculations of the average time interval required for each developmental stage (larval instars, pupa and adult emergence), allow accurate determination of corpse colo- nization and time of death. It may be helpful to allow emerged adult flies to feed for 24- hours on a cotton pad or ball soaked with a small amount of Gatorade '~. This insures that their outer skins will harden and accurate species identifications can be made. Emerged adult flies can be placed in 70% ethanol or pinned and stored in insect boxes. Immature beetles need not be reared and should simply be placed in 70% ethanol for identification. Additional observations concerning any other kinds of animals and plants found in and around the corpse may provide supplemental information about the time. cause and location of death. Collect samples of any unusual specimens such as ants, fleas, body lice, seaweeds, etc. Likewise. representative samples of speci- mens encountered at autopsy should be collected for analysis. Any specimens collected during the autopsy can be processed as previously described. Marine and aquatic plants and animals are best preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Containers which contain preserved and living speci- mens should be labeled in the following manner. 1 -- Date collected 2 -- Time collected 3 -- Location of remains (as precise as pos- sible) 4 -- Area of the body infested 5 -- Name. address and telephone number of the collector If specimens are to be shipped long distances for analysis, package containers and vials of preserved speci- mens in well-cushioned boxes to avoid breakage and ship by the most convenient means. If shipped by regu- lar mail, wrap each vial individually in a padding mate- rial such as cellu-cotton and place each vial individually in a box surrounded by styrofoam chips on all sides. This will minimize the possibility of breakage during ship- ping. Clearly mark the box \"Liquid in Glass\". This will generally receive gentler handling by the Post Office. Containers of soil samples and other living speci- mens should be kept in relatively cool. well ventilated environments. Time is critical if accurate information is to be obtained from living material. Thus, these materi- als must be shipped by the most rapid means. As with other types of physical evidence, take care to insure a continuous, well documented chain of legally acceptable evidence possession. DESCRIPTION OF LOCALITY An accurate, detailed description of the habitat in which the corpse was found is important to forensic entomologists. Whenever possible, written descriptions should be accompanied by a complete set of crime-scene photographs which illustrate the general habitat type, the terrain, the type of vegetation, type of soil and the extent to which the corpse is exposed to sunlight. Detailed photographs of the corpse are also neces- sary including photographs which illustrate the sex, age. height and weight of the remains, the presence and ex- tent of clothing, the orientation of the corpse when found. the extent of trauma, the extent and degree of decompo- sition and close-up photographs of the inhabitating in- sects. Because climatic conditions have a profound affect on the development of immature insects, the most accu- rate data available describing these conditions at the location where the corpse was found is of critical impor- tance. Whenever possible, record maximum and mini- mum temperature values at the scene as soon as possible after discovery. Obtain climatic data from the nearest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), weather station, for the entire estimated post mortem period and for a two to three week interval Dept. t)t- Justice Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-488 \" Print Order 60651 Vol. 1 -- Forensic Aspects of DNA 2nd Page P | 59 before the estimated time of death. Additionally, any information available concerning daily rainfall, cloud over and wind speed and direction should be obtained if available. ADDITIONAL CASE HISTORIES In early Spring, the fully-clothed body o[a young, white male was found in a sandy, shrub habitat, in the southwestern U. S. The victim had died of multiple gun shot wounds to the chest and back inflicted by a small caliber hand gun. While little evidence of decomposition was evidenced externally, a small amount of blood was observed to have oozed from the victim's left nostril and partially coated his left eye. Crime scene investigators noted and collected a small atypical granular mass from the surface of the victim's left eye. Exanunation of this substance in the crime laboratory a short time later revealed the material was a small mass of blow fly eggs and that several had hatched. The newly hatched blow fly larvae were allowed to grow and were subsequently identified as Cochliomvia macellaria, commonly known as the secondary screw worm. Based on the climatic conditions to which the corp~ was believed to have been exposed and a knowl- edge of the developmental biology of this fly, it was determined that the eggs had most likely been laid on the corpse for 24 to 36 hours prior to the time the body was found. Subsequent investigation determined the victim's identity and the fact that he had last been seen alive in the company of a male companion approximately 36 hours prior to the time his body was found. It was later determined that the victim had been murdered by his companion about 36 hours prior to his detection. In this case. blow fly e,:,,:,s,o,,\" collected from the re- mains and analyzed in a timely manner, provided inves- tigators with an accurate estimate of the post mortem interval and allowed them to more narrowly focus their investigative efforts enhancing their ability to identify the victim and to bring the case to a reasonable solution. Similarly, in early summer, the body of a young, unidentified white female was found at the end of a logging road in a rural section of the northeastern U. S. Investigation revealed that the unidentified young woman had died from a single gunshot to the right side of the head inflicted by a 12 gauge shotgun. While processing the crime scene, investigators collected representative samples of adult and larval blow flies which had infested the area of the wound. These specimens proved to be mature larvae and adults of the black blow fly (Phormia regina). Follow- ing an indepth review of climatic conditions, habitat characteristics and crime scene photographs, entomolo- gists estimated that the young woman had been killed about five days prior to her discovery and that her body had been placed in that location close to the time of her death. Based in part on the entomological analysis, inves- tigators circulated requests for reports of missing per- sons fitting the deceased's description who had disap- peared five days prior to the corpse discovery. Eventually, the young woman was identified and her boyfriend be- came the prime suspect. Just prior to his arrest, however. he was found hanged in a motel. A suicide note revealed that he had murdered the victim five days before her remains were found and had comrmtted the homicide at the end of the logging road where she was discovered. In late summer, a 37-year old black male was found in Kawainui Marsh. a swamp located approximately 1.6 km from the ocean on the windward side of the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The elevation for the site was only slightly above sea level. The body was clothed in blue jeans and a t-shirt. There was a gunshot wound to the right frontal skull. The corpse was in an advanced state of decay. The skull was largely devoid of flesh, although some was present on the lateral surfaces and the ears were rela- tively intact. The cervical area was largely devoid of flesh and the vertebrae were clearly visible. The groin area was largely decomposed and contained a large num- ber of Diptera larvae. On autopsy, no penetration of the abdomin',.d cavity by larvae was observed. Collections of insects from the remains yielded two species of Calliphoridae larvae. Ch~somya megacephala was rep- resented by third the chest, groin, and legs. while Chr3'somya rufifacies was represented by second instar larvae and third instal\" larvae from the chest. None of the larvae from either species were in the prepupanal stage. Temperature data were obtained from the nearest weather station and climatic information from this sta- tion was analyzed for the time period in question. This analysis, when coupled with the developmental stages of the specimens collected, suggested a minimum postmor- tem interval of approximately 117 hours. A subsequent investigation revealed that the dece- dent had last been seen at about 6:00 p.m. six days previously as he departed for work. He failed to arrive at work as scheduled at 8:00 p.m. When his remains were discovered they were placed into a refrigerated crypt. As species Chrysomya rufifacies do not form dense maggot masses, activity for this species would have ceased shortly after the remains were placed into the refrigerated crypt. The post mortem interval based on insect age in this case was about 117 hours and fit well with the last sighting of the decedent and his failure to report for work. In the southeastern U. S., police were called to investigate a foul smelling odor which was emanating 160 t.)ept, of Justice Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-488 Print Order 60651 Vol. 1 -- Forensic Aspects of DNA 2nd Page Pr ,~e ' \": ~ from a small single family home in a rural secuon of town. Investigating officers soon discovered the badly decomposed body of a young, black female in a shallow grave in a dirt basement of the dwelling. The victim had died of a single gunshot wound to the head. inflicted with a small caliber nile. Subse- quently, a careful examination of the corpse and a de- tailed excavation of the soil in and around the grave site revealed the presence of numerous larvae of the blue blow fly. CaIliphoria vicina and larvae and pupae of a relative of the house fly, Synthesiomyia nudesita. Specimens collected from the scene were reared in the laboratory to adults. Supplemental information in- cluding climatic data and soil temperatures were re- viewed in an effort to determine the climatic conditions to which the developing flies were exposed. Using infor- mation on the developmental biology of both of these species of flies, forensic entomologists were able to estimate that the victim had died and was colonized by flies approximately 15 days prior to the time that she was found. Once provided with this information, investigators were able to target their investigation in and around the time of the victim's demise. Shortly thereafter a suspect was developed and this individual eventually confessed to having killed the victim 28 days prior to the time the body was located and having attempted to bury the victim in a shallow grave located in the basement of the house shortly after comnutting the homicide. The remains of a female child (30 months of age) were recovered from a shallow grave on a narrow ledge on the side of Koko Head Crater, Oahu, Hawaii. The skeletonized remains were buried in dirt and gravel and some bones were partially exposed. Other bones were scattered on the surface. The skull was facing upward and the mandible was located several feet from the skull. Also present in the grave were tour small stuffed dolls. Examination of the remains at the morgue revealed largely skeletonized material. Present were the skull and mandible, most of the ribs, many thoracic vertebral bod- ies, the mostly skeletonized pelvis and ties. the left humerus, radius, ulna and scapula. Absent were many of the cervical vertebrae, right upper extrem- ity and scapula. Small bones of the left foot appeared to have been chewed and showed signs of postmortem animal depredation, as did the bones of the left forearm. Apparent scalp hair remaining adjacent to the skull was blond and straight and measured up to 15 cm in length. Clothing accompanying the remains in which the corpse had been buried were a hooded jacket and a pair of running shoes. A second search of the dangerously pre- carious burial site the day following the recovery of the remains yielded the right scapula and arm as well as additional vertebrae. Exanunation of the remains at the morgue yielded a limited assortment of arthropods. Empty puparial cases of the calliphorid Chrysomya rufifacies were attached to the skull under the scalp, which had been largely eaten away Adult dermestid beetles, Dermestes maculatus. were present on the bones and the late instar larval skins of that species were observed in areas under the scalp. inside the cranial cavity and on the femurs. These cast larval skins of D. maculatus were in good condition and did not appear to have been exposed to weathering ef- fects tbr any period of time. Larval scenopinids (Diptera) were collected from the skull near the bases of the hair. Adult clerids, Necrobia rufipes, were recovered from the bones of the left foot. A silverfish (Thysanura: Leptismatidae) was recovered from the body bag. In the hood of the jacket, there was a quantity of soil associated with the remains. This was processed in a Berlese-Tullgren tunnel and sorted by hand. This sample yielded additional larval scenopinind and adult D. maculatus. There was an adult histerid beetle which represents an undescribed species. Mites associated with this sample included species in the farmlies Acaridae, Histiostomatidae, Macrochelidae, Pachytaelapidae, Uropodidae ear- lier decomposition studies conducted in xerophytic habi- tats on the island of Oahu resulted in a postmortem interval estimate of 52-76 days. This estimate was low- ered to slightly over 52 days. based on the condition of -the cast larval skins of D. maculatus. In the decomposi- tion studies used for comparison, the last observed larval activity for D. maculatus was on day 5 i. The cast larval skins of D. maculatus disintegrate quite rapidly when exposed to weathering. The fact that these skins were in excellent condition and easily identifiable to species level indicated that they had been shed recently. The window fly larvae (Scenopinidae) were all late instars and of a size comparable to those collected from decomposition studies on day 51 in one study and day 48 in another. This tended to reinforce the estimate of slightly over 52 days. The mates recovered also were consistent with this time frame and the absence of any beetle mite species was indicative of the shorter portion of the com- puter estimate. The final postmortem interval estimate of slightly over 52 days for this case fit well with the interval established independently by confession of the suspect in the case. Several years ago a young woman was attacked and brutally raped in a suburban Chicago wood lot by a man wearing a ski mask. Investigators quickly developed a suspect and armed with a search warrant seized a ski mask similar to the one described by the victim from the suspect' s apartment. When questioned about the ski mask, the suspect informed investigators the ski mask was Dept. of Justice Program D470-M Jacket No. 342-48~ Print Order 60651 Vol. 1 -- Forensic Aspects o] DNA 2nil l-'age P~ 161 indeed his but that it had not been used since the previ- ous winter. Investigators observed large numbers of cockle burrs and other vegetation attached to the surface of the mask. The mask and its associated vegetation was brought to a forensic entomologist for analysis. Following a careful dissection of the cockle burrs attached to the mask. the entomologist was able to locate several small caterpil- lars inside the vegetation. The insects were subsequently identified and intbrmataon concerning their development collected and reviewed. It was subsequently determined that the caterpillars within the cockle burrs had a one year life cycle, with adults being active in the spring, laying eggs in early summer, larvae or caterpillars developing within the cockle burr vegetation during mid to late summer, un- dergoing pupation during the winter and emerging as adults the following summer. The entomologist was thus able to inform investigators that the ski mask had been present in the outside environment during mid to early summer of that year around the time the rape occurred. Armed with this information, investigators confronted the suspect and he subsequently confessed to having committed the rape. In this case analysis of vegetation associated with evidence collected from a crime scene enabled investi- gators to accurately link the suspect to the crime at or about the time of the crime. Recently, several small childrc = were brought to a local hospital emergency room suffering from wide- spread diaper rash. malnutrition and generalized neglect. A physical exarrunation revealed that the anal and geni- tal areas of these children were infested by fly larvae. Samples of the invading fly larvae were collected, pre- served and forwarded to forensic entomologists for ex- amination. An analysis of the fly larvae infesting the young children revealed that they had been present on the chil- dren for a minimum of four to five days. This informa- tion was used as an indicator of the minimum amount of time which had passed since the children had their dia- pers changed and were properly cleaned and cared for. The entomological information was the only data avail- able which provided quantitative information accurately determining the length of time the children had been without care. The entomological evidence provided cru- cial information in subsequent hearings concerning the welfare of the children. CONCLUSIONS Forensically important insects can be a powerful tool in investigations of homicide, untimely death' and other violent crimes. Accurate forensic determinations are possible, however, only when representative speci- mens are recognized, properly collected, preserved and forwarded in a timely manner to qualified forensic ento- mologists for analysis. Prosecutors, police, pathologists and others involved in solving violent crimes should become fully aware of the complex ecology of the decay process, the important role which insects play in decom- position and necessity of collecting representative speci- mens and supplemental field data.

In addition to their use in the es- timation of postmortem intervals, insects may serve as reliable alternate specimens for toxicological analyses in the absence of tissues and fluids normally taken for such purposes. Recent research has also demonstrated that the presence of drugs and/or toxins in decomposing tissues may alter the rate and patterns of development in ar- thropods using such tissues as food, thus potentially al- tering estimates of the postmortem interval.

Over the past decade, an increase in drug-related deaths has been reported in the United States and other countries. In many instances, these deaths are not reported immediately to authorities and the re- mains go undiscovered for several days or more As a result of decompositional processes, estima. tions of the postmortem interval are based on anal yses of entomological data. The data most frequentl) used are those associated with insect development rates and succession patterns (1-5). Recently, the accuracy of these estimates has been questioned in deaths involving narcotic intoxication. However, few studies are available detailing the effects of drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, in decomposing tissues on the rates of development of carrion-feeding in- sects. Additionally, data dealing with the effects of other tissue contaminants, such as toxins and en- vironmental pollutants, in decomposing tissues on the rates and/or developmental patterns of insects using such tissues as food are generally lacking. Interest also has focused on the potential for use of carri.)n-feeding insects as alternate toxicological specimens in situations where more traditional sources, such as blood, urine, or organs, are not available. These two basic areas of investigation comprise entomotoxicology. Basic to understanding the applications of ento- mological evidence to toxicological problems is an overview of the life cycles of carrion-frequenting insects. The insects most frequently involved in the estimation of the postmortem interval are the true flies or Diptera, and these taxa are most frequently used in drug analyses. The predominant species en- countered are in the families Calliphoridae (blow flies), Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), and Muscidae (house flies). The Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, and Musci- dae are highly motile, strong-flying insects and are typically the first insects to arrive at a body. Cal- liphoridae and Sarcophagidae may arrive within 165 M. L. GOFF AND IV. D. LORD minutes following death, particularly in tropical en- vironments. In more temperate climates, fly arrival ma,,' require several hours or days, depending on the habitat. Studies of carrion communities have demonstrated that muscoid flies generally dela,,' colonization until the late fresh or earl,,' bloat stages of decomposition (5). Once a suitable source is lo- cated, adult flies will either begin to lay eggs (ovi- posit) immediately or feed on the various protein- rich fluids seeping from the body and then begin to oviposit. On corpses that have not suffered trau- matic injury.', the initial sites for oviposition ,.','ill generally be the natural body openings (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and, if exposed, anus and genitals). Wounds or blood may provide preferential sites for oviposition, although this attraction ',,,'ill vary de- pending on the species of fly involved and the de- gree of injury,. Blow fly eggs are small (2-3 mm), elongate, and white to yellow. They are typically laid in large clusters and, during warmer parts of the year, may completely fill natural body~openings and wound sites. During cooler periods, when adult fly popu- lations are smaller, the eggs may be few and more difficult to locate, being hidden in cryptic sites such as the inside of the nose or behind eyelids. Typi- cally the egg stage for blow flies lasts 1-3 days. When the eggs hatch, they produce larvae, com- monly referred to as maggots. These are small, somewhat peg-shaped organisms. The anterior end has a pair of mouthhooks that are used in feeding and locomotion. The posterior end bears a pair of flattened spiracles through which the maggot breathes. These features, along with size and shape, provide important characters for identification. Maggots grow rapidly, passing through three stages or instars before reaching full size. Eggs laid on a body will typically hatch synchronously, resulting in a mass of maggots that move about a body feed- ing as group. This group feeding behavior results in the dissemination of bacteria and production of digestive enzymes that enable the maggots to con- sume most of the soft tissue on a body in a highly efficient manner. Maximum maggot size is reached in a period varying from several days to weeks, depending on the species involved, numbers of maggots present, and environmental conditions. After reaching maximum size, maggots undergo a dramatic change in behavior. Feeding ceases and the maggots begin to migrate away from the corpse. This migration is typically to a drier area where the maggots burrow into the substrate and begin pu- pariation. During pupariation, the outer skin of the maggot becomes hardened and forms a protective encasement. The resulting reddish to dark brown puparium somewhat resembles a small football. Within this protective case, the maggot undergoes a cellular reorganization and eventually emerges as the adult fix'. The period required for this transfor- mation ,.'aries depending on the species of fix, and environmental conditions, particularly temperature. The puparial case itself may remain intact in the soil surrounding the corpse for hundreds of `',ears. Blow fly puparial cases can supply valuable foren- sic information long after the body has decomposed (6). The life c,,'cle of the Sarcophagidae or flesh flies is quite similar to that of the blow flies, with one important difference. Flesh flies associated `.vith de- composing remains do not lay eggs (oviposit) but rather deposit first-instar larvae (larviposition) on remains. This process requires that the developing flv larva be retained in the body of the female longer than an egg. Thus, the numbers of offspring pro- duced per female are less for the Sarcophagidae than for the Calliphoridae or Muscidae. In total numbers of maggots present on a body, generally the Sarcophagidae are far outnumbered by other species of flies. There are exceptions to this in spe- cialized circumstances, as may occur in corpses found indoors (7) or exposed to severe environmental con- ditions (8). Careful analyses of the species of flies present on the corpse and their developmental stages, com- bined with a knowledge of fly biology, and local environmental conditions, can provide forensically meaningful information regarding the postmortem interval, movement of the body after death from one locale to another, presence of antemortem in- jury, and, as will be discussed here, drugs and/or toxins prescnt in the remains. DETECTION OF DRUGS AND TOXINS Several publications detail the detection of var- ious toxic and controlled substances through anal- yses of arthropods. In these reports, the arthropods have generally been homogenized and then processed in the same manner as other tissues or fluids of toxicological interest. Analytic procedures have in- (9) described the recov- ery of mercury from various species of calliphorid maggots fed on fish tissues containing known con- centrations of mercury. In this study, it was noted that there was a definite binaccumulation of mer- cury by maggots and this accumulation was related 166 Am J Forensic Med Pathol, Vol. 15, No. 1, 1994 E.\\'TOMO TOA7COL OG Y to the presence of mercurv in methyI,Lted form. In maggots reared on tissues in xvhich r of the rner- cury was methylated, there ~.,.as a I',ic, accumulati,_:n the cc',ncentration of mercury in the mag- gots was 4.3 times greater than in :he tissues. In fish containing lesser amounts of mcthylated mer- cury, the concentration detected in maggots was only 1.5 times greater than that in the tissues. The mercury ingested by maggots ,.,,.as retained through the pupal stage and was detectable in emerging adults. Once the adult stage `',,'as reached, mercur'y was rapidly eliminated. After 2 days, adult flies contained only 50% of the mercury levels of the larvae. A more detailed analysis revealed that mer- cury was excreted into the meconium of the hindgut during the pupal stage (9). During these studies, no ill effects were generally exhibited by the adult flies or maggots, although some indi,,,'iduals were ob- served having difficulty in pupation. Maggots that had been fed on tissues containing mercury were fed to a staphylinid beetle and a sec- ondary bioaccumulation was noted in these preda- tory beetles. Although no ill effects were noted for C. nuzvillosus (L.), subsequent work by Schott and Nuorteva (10) showed a decrease in activity for the tenebrionid beetle Tenebrio nzolitor L. fed dried maggots with a high mercury content. Nuorteva and Nuorteva (9) had previously noted the occurrence of \"Minimata-like symptoms\" (consisting of irreg- ularities in motor control and muscular coordina- tion) for adults of 7\". molitor fed on mercury- containing maggots. No change in life span was noted for beetles fed on mercury-containing mag- gots in either study. In a similar manner, Sohal and Lamb (11,12) demonstrated the accumulation of various metals, including copper, iron, zinc, and calcium, in tissues of adult house flies, Musca domestica L. As with the mercury studies cited here, no detrimental ef- fects to the adult flies were associated with the bioaccumulation of these metals. One example of the application of these types of data to forensic situations ,,,,'as given in a case pre- sented by Nuorte'*'a (13). In this instance, adult flies reared from the badly decomposed body of an un- identified woman discovered in the rural area of lnkoo, Finland, were analyzed for mercury content to determine the geographic origin of the victim. The low mcrcury content of the adult flies (0.12- 0.15 ppm) indicated that the individual came from an area relatively free from mercury pollution. When the victim was identified, she proved to have been a student from the city of Turku, an area relatively free from mercury pollution. Utsumi (14) observed that rat carcasses varied in their attractiveness to flies, depending on the poison causing death, but this research did not include any a:tcmp' to detect the toxins in the maggots that eventually did develop on the rat carrion. Leclercq and Brahv (15) noted the detection of arsenic poi- soning through analyses of species of Piophilidae, Psychodidae, and Fannia in a case from France. Detection of the organophosphate malathion was reported bv Gunatilake and Goff (16). In this in- stance, a 58-year-old man with a history of previous suicide attempts was discovered in the crawl space under his mother's home in Honolulu. Adjacent to the remains was a bottle of Malathion-50 with - 177 'ml missing. Both tissues and maggots of two spe- cies of Calliphoridae were analyzed for malathion by using GC. The fat tissues of the corpse had malathion detected at 17 mg/kg. The combined sample of maggots of Chrysornya megacephala (F.) and Cho'somya rufifacies (Macquart) showed mal- concentration of 2,050 p.g/g. It is sig- nificant that the developmental stages of both Cho.somya species in this case were indicative of a 5-day postmortem interval, because the individual had last been seen alive 8 days prior to the discov- ery of the body. The presence of malathion in the tissues of the corpse might have delayed oviposition for a period of several days. This is supported by the presence of only two species of fly larvae on the corpse. In outdoor situations in the Hawaiian Islands, a far greater number of species should have been present on the corpse at either a 5- or 8-day interval. Typically other species of flies and pred- atory beetles in the families Staphylinindae and Histeridae would have been expected to have in- vaded the remains and the surrounding substrate. Beyer et el. (17) detailed a case of a 22-year-old woman whose decomposed remains were discov- ered 14 days after she had last been seen alive. The individual had a history of five suicide attempts. An empty prescription bottle of phenobarbital (no. 100), filled 2 days before she was last seen alive, was found in a purse adjacent to the remains. As there were no tissues remaining on the almost com- pletely skeletonized body available for analysis, larvae of the calliphorid fly, Cochliomyia macel- laria (F.), found feeding on the remains, were ana- lyzed for drug content. Phenobarbital was detected by GC and,,.confirmed by TLC at a concentration of 100 ~zg/g. Kintz et al. (18) have described other cases where prescription drugs were detected through analyses of maggots. In one case, the subject was a man with a determined postmortem interval of 67 days. Identifiable organs present for toxicological anal- yses using liquid chromatography included heart, Am J Forer~ic Med Pathol, Vol. 15, No. 1, 1994 167 AL L. GOFF AND W. D. LORD lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, in addition to bile. Calliphoridae maggots also were analyzed. Results of analyses showed five drugs present in the mag- gots as well as in the bile, triazolam, oxazapam, phenobarbital, alimemazine, and clomipramine. Triazolam was not detected in the spleen or kidney, although the other drugs were present. In this case, a correlation could not be established between concentrations of the drugs in maggots and human tissues, but Kintz et al. (18) observed fewer endogenous peaks in chromato- grams obtained from maggot extraction than from human tissues. Kintz et al. (19) were also able to detect bromazepam and levomepromizine in mag- gots obtained from human remains. Using CG-MS, Wohlenberg et al. (20) were able to detect nortrip- tyline from maggots infesting the nearly skeleton- ized remains of a 40-year-old man. Similarly, Goff et al. (21) demonstrated amitriptyline and nortrip- tyline in maggots that had been fed tissues from rabbits that had been administered amitriptyline, and amitriptyline was also detectable in empty puparia. Studies by Introna et al. (22) detailed the results of analyses of maggots fed on liver tissues from 40 cases in which opiates had been detected during postmortem examinations. In this study, opiates were effectively detected through RIA analyses of mag- gots that had fed on opiat. :ontaminated tissues. A significant correlation between the concentrations of opiates in liver tissues and the paired maggot samples also was observed. While the qualitative relationship was quite clear from their results, the quantitative results were less clear and further re- search in this area is suggested. Similar results ,.',,'ere presented by Goff et al. (23,24) in studies using known varied dosages of cocaine and heroin ad- ministered to rabbits. Nolte et al. (25) used toxicological analyses of maggots to determine cocaine intoxication in the almost completely skeletonized remains of a 29- year-old male intravenous drug user that were dis- covered almost 5 months after he had last been seen alive. His girlfriend indicated that she believed he had used intravenous cocaine immediately prior to his disappearance. Associated with the remains were numerous maggots and puparia of Calliphora vi- cina (R.-D.), a species frequently associated with carrion during cooler portions of the year. Skeletal muscle ,,`\"as also present on the remains. Maggots and muscle both tested positive for cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecognine by using GC. As in previous cases mentioned, the sample from the maggots had less interference from by-products of decomposition and provided more suitable samples for quantitation. Empty puparial cases were sub- sequently found to be weakly positive for cocaine and/or benzoylecognine, indicating that these sub- stances deposited in the protein matrix of the pu- parial cases may be detectable for years following death. The extraction method used for the puparial cases in this instance was similar to that for human hair (26,27). In a somewhat similar situation, Man- hoff et al. (28) were able to detect cocaine at a concentration of 0.090 mg/L from beetle feces and Calliphoridae larvae collected from a set of decom- posed human remains by using GC-MS. Lord et al. (W.D.L., personal communication, 1992) have detected both amitriptyline and nortriptyline from Phoridae puparial cases and Dermestidae cast skins and feces associated with the skeletonized remains of a woman by using modified haft-extraction tech- niques. EFFECTS OF DRUGS IN TISSUES ON DEVELOPMENT OF INSECTS Although the previous studies documented the potential use of maggots as alternate specimens for toxicological analyses, they did not address the ef- fects of these substances on the rate of insect de- velopment. I.n the estimation of the postmortem interval, particularly during the first 2--4 weeks of decomposition, it is assumed that insects, particu- larly Diptera, ,,,,'ill develop at predictable rates for given climatic conditions. That this might not al- ways be the case was first demonstrated by Goff et al. (23) during their studies on the effects of cocaine in decomposing tissues on the rate of development of the sarcophagid Boettcherisca peregrina (R.-D.). In this study, domestic rabbits were administered dosages of cocaine based on body weight represent- ing 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times the median lethal dos- ages. The rabbits receiving the lethal dosages were allowed to die as a result of the action of the drug, and the animal receiving the median sublethal dos- age and the control were killed in a carbon-dioxide chamber. The presence of cocaine and/or benzoy- lecognine were confirmed by analyses of blood and liver tissues. Livers and spleens were removed from the rabbits after death and exposed to a colony of B. peregrina for larviposition. Samples were mea- sured at 6-h intervals and were removed at 24-h intervals for drug analyses. Samples of all maggots fed on tissues from rabbits receiving cocaine were positive for the drug and/or its metabolite. Control liver and maggots were both negative. In this study, two patterns of development were detected. The control and sublethal dosage colonies developed at approximately the same rate, as indicated by total 168 Am J Forensic AIed Pathol, VoL 15, No. 1, 1994 ENT03IO TOATCOL 0 G Y bodv lengths of the maggots. By contrast, begin- ning at hour 36, the lethal and twice lethal dosage colonies dcvelopcd more rapidly. This difference ,.,,'as observed to continue until hour 76. Pupariation was first observed in the twice median lethal dosage colony, followed by the median lethal, median sub- lethal, and control colonies. No significant varia- tion in the duration of the puparial period ,.,.'as observed and no differences in puparial mortality were detected. Adults from all colonies produced viable offspring ,*,'hen supplied with liver 13 days after eclosion of adults. The colonies ,,','ere followed through four generations and no abnormalities were observed. Similar studies were conducted by Goff et al. (24) on maggots feeding on decomposing tissues from rabbits administered dosages of heroin that were calculated to represent 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 2.0 times the median lethal dosages. Rates of devel- opment, as indicated by total body length of mag- gots, were not significantly different until hour 18. At tha~ point, maggots from all colonies fed on rabbits receiving heroin began to develop at rates significantly faster than those observed for the con- trol colony. These differences continued through hour 96, when maximum lengths were recorded for maggots in all colonies. Maggots fed on tissues containing heroin (as morphine) were significantly larger than maggots in the control colony. Duration of the puparial period also was significantly longer for the maggots fed on tissues containing heroin and was observed to be directly proportional to the concentration of the drug (as morphine) in the tis- sues. This study indicated that an estimate of the postmortem interval based c'- the normal develop- ment of B. peregtina could have an error of up to 29 h, if based on the larval stage and 18-38 h, if based on duration of the puparial stage. Studies conducted by Golf et al. (29) on the ef- fects of methamphetamine on the development of another species of sarcophagid fly, Parasarco- phaga n~ficontis (F.), exhibited some similarities to the above studies on cocaine and heroin, but also some significant differences. These studies, al- though somewhat preliminary, showed similar in- creases in rate of development for colonies fed on decomposing tissues from the 1.0 and 2.0 median lethal dosaged animals from hours 24-60, while the median sublethal and control colonies developed at approximately the same rate. Following hour 60, the rate of growth for the median lethal dosage col- ony slowed and only the 2.0 median lethal dosage colony continued to develop at a rate significantly faster than that observed for the other colonies. The maggots reached maximum sizes earlier in the me- dian lethal and t,,vice median lethal colonies, but the greatest observed sizes were in the control col- on,,,. Unlike the situation with heroin, there were no significant differences in the durations of the puparial stage anaong colonies fed on tissues from the animals administered dosages of methamphe- tamine, although all of these colonies had puparial periods that were significantly shorter than ob- served for the control colony. Puparial mortality rates for the drug-treated colonies appeared to be inversely proportional to the dosage administered to the animal model, with the puparial mortality for the control and twice median lethal colonies ap- proximately equal. Unlike the situation observed for cocaine and heroin, there were effects in the reproduction of the 1.0 and 2.0 times median lethal dosage colonies. The median lethal dosage colony failed to reproduce during the first generation and the 2.0 times median lethal dosage colony failed during the second generation. In both cases, non- viable larvae or eggs were produced. In recent studies concerning the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline on the devel- opmental patterns of P. n~ficornis by Goff et al. (21), no significant differences were obse~'ed among colonies in the rate of development to maximum size or larvae reared on tissues from animals re- ceiving 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times median lethal dos- ages by weight of the drug when compared with the control colony. In colonies fed on tissues from animals that had received the drug, a prolonged postfeeding period was observed once maximum size had been attained. Larval mortality was also significantly greater in the treated colonies. Puparia sizes ,,,.ere significantly greater both in terms of length and in ,.','eight for colonies reared on tissues .from the animals receiving the 1.0 and 2.0 times median lethal dosages. There were no significant differences observed in puparial mortali.ty among the colonies, although duration of puparial stage ',,,'as significantly longer for the 1.0 and 2.0 times median lethal dosagecolonies when compared with the median sublethal and control colonies. Although there have been, to date, few applica- tions of these data to actual cases, Lord (30) details a case that serves to illustrate the potential signifi- cance of these alterations in rates of larval and pu- parial development. The body of a Caucasian woman, approximateJy 20 years old, was discov- ered in a pine woods area northeast of Spokane, Washington. The body was physically in the early bloat stage of decomposition, with an extensive population of maggots on the face and upper torso. Maggots were submitted to the entomologist after 5 days of refrigeration and reared to the adult stage ArnJ Forensic Med Pathol, Vol. 1~.~ 1, 1>. 169 .'ft. L. GOFF.4ND C. cadavertna days following dea'A1. Three classes of mtlggots \".'.ere present, based on total body length. The first con- sisted of maggots measuring 6-9 mm in total length that ,.,.ere consistent with a postmortem interval of 7 days. The second consisted of smaller maggots, indicative of multiple broods under development. The third consisted of a single maggot from the nasophar3'ngeal area, measuring 17.7 mm in total length and indicating a period of -3 weeks. This period did not appear to be possible, given the other data associated with the case. The possibility that the maggot had migrated from another nearby source was eliminated, because no other carrion were lo- cated by the investigators and the probability that more than one maggot of that size would have been found. An alternate explanation was that the mag- got's growth had been enhanced by a particular pocket in the nasal region containing a concentra- lion of cocaine. A subsequent investigation showed the victim had a history' of cocaine abuse, and a witness later testified that the victim had snorted cocaine shortly before her death. CONCLUSIONS Insects and other arthropods can prove to be valuable tools in investigations of homicide, sui- cide, or other unattended deaths. In addition to es- timations of postmortem intervals, insects can serve as reliable specimens for toxicological analyses in the absence of tissues and fluids normally taken for such purposes. In cases of decomposed remains, analyses can provide more reliable qualitative re- suits than can the decomposed tissues. Although data currently available addressing the effects of drugs and toxins in tissues on the developmental rates of Diptera larvae are limited in scope, it is not unreasonable to assume that other substances in tis- sues also produce changes in developmental rates and patterns in cases where drugs or toxins are to be a factor. It is essential that the forensic ento- mologist be made aware of any data indicating the presence of these substances in the remains. This will allow for needed corrections to the life-cycle data, based on the substances involved, and result in more accurate interpretations of postmortem in- tervals. Acknowledgment: We thank Drs.

passenger injuries less uniform than driver injuries dicing steering wheel injury flail chest / sternum fracture (dash injuries may be similar) possibly microscopic heart injury facial laceration (especially below nose) unrestrained driver impacts steering wheel belt injuries intra-cabin protrusions (door handles, window cranks, etc.) trace evidence hairs / fibers need questioned & control of all parties involved blood possible DNA match spatter interpretation may be relevant need questioned & control ofaU parties involved pedal imprint 4) EJECTED OCCUPANT determine primary collision injuries lethal injuries result from impact of head with ground 5) MULTIPLE VEHICLE STIRIKES (pedestrian) - which was the lethal impact? establish presence or absence of typical impact point likely to be standing for initial impact and down for subsequent strike(s) look for bumper fracture / stretch striae / pattern injury legs question may be \"Was the victim dead when hit by second (etc.) vehicle?\" 6) VEHICULAR FIRE - which occurred first, injury/death or fire? very uncommon ( <0.5% of all MVC) usually fuel fed - rollover or rear impact carbon monoxide <10 % - death due tO blunt force injury flash fire rare with MVC carbon monoxide may be from exhaust system and not from fire BLUNT FORCE INJURY - Downs 190 NON-A UTOMOBILE MVC l) MOTORCYCLE \"Give your son a bike for his last birthday.\" - anonymous CAUSES ethanol / drug impairment may be more obvious with lower concentration environment reckless other drivers INJURIES.\" intrinsically dangerous - occupant(s) always ejected passenger may be thrown offprior to impact HEAD INJURY - usual cause of death (more than neck) typically basilar skull fractures due to ground impact sagittal - forehead impact transverse - temporal / chin impact whiplash due to rapid deceleration instant death with pontomedullary rent HELMET - weak front protection (none really protect chin) low speed - significant decrease in head injury high speed - no protection PATTERN INJURY driver: legs forced into gas tank with contusion / abrasion handlebars - sudden violent turn may lacerate viscera due to bike landing on top of body chain abrasion muffler burn decollement - shear off layer of skin (wheel turning) AMPUTATION - objects crossing roadway become hazard LEATHERS - some decrease brush abrasion 2) TRAIN almost all are side impacts of train hitting vehicle driver may try to beat the train often involve positive driver blood ethanol rarely car stalls on tracks or car runs into train extensive injury due to marked kinetic energy of train (large mass) mass disasters may occur with this (or any and all modes of mass transit) 3) PLANE - covered in detail elsewhere (see reference texts) LIGHT NON-COMMERCIAL PLANES usually seen by non-military medical examiner major concerns are identification of deceased why crash occurred investigation requirements - same as for larger disasters only easier fewer victims relatively good conditions still need to determine significant causal / contributing factors positives more likely than commercial natural disease drug / ethanol often plane crashes are due to poor judgement (/lying in inclement weather) human factors account for >3/4 of all plane crashes often involves civil litigation - questions regarding pain and suffering remember: as for auto, light plane may be used in the commission of suicide survivability determined by cabin compromise crash force post - crash environment BLUNT FORCE INJURY - Downs 191 4- Abrasion Tag of skin at upper left-hand comer indicates blow was directed from lower right comer. I[- Brush Abrasion Relatively bloodless (yellow-pink) abrasion extending across chest. Typical injury for pedestrian struck by motor vehicle. (- Commotio cordis. Blunt force injury to center of chest (struck by tree limb) by a second person. Rarely, this may trigger an irregular heartbeat and cause death. An additional finding is the therapeutic incision (horizontal) with a therapeutic artifactual abrasion on the left shoulder. Impact abrasion. Jumped from 16 stories height, sustaining severe wounds. The front of the chest at the point of impact had the weave of the clothing imprinted as abrasions. 192 BLUNT FORCE INJURY - Downs Impact laceration. Jumped from 16 stories height. Gaping laceration, with tissue bridging, on forehead. I[- Multiple blunt force injuries (overkill). Wound \"E\" demonstrates typical laceration caused by a firm, linear blunt object (baseball bat, lamp, etc.) The edges have marginal abrasion as the more rounded peripheral edges of the weapon (right & lett in photo) do not extend as far into tissue as centrally. Chop wound. A hybrid between true sharp & true blunt force wounds as the tissue is crushed as it is divided. Tissue bridging is present and the wound edges lack marginal abrasion. Suspect weapon would include a dull, thin, hard surface (machete). I[- Pattern injury. Stellate (star-shaped) lacerations with broad central rounded abrasions.

Multiple injuries (>100 in toto) representing patterned contusions & abrasions from long linear object. Note central clearing as the central tissue in each is crushed & the bruises occur on the borders of the blow (the width of the clear space suggests that of the suspect weapon). (-- Pattem injury (fall to back of head). A typical scalp laceration resulting from a fall. The injury is in a \"hat-band\" distribution and consists of a small central linear laceration with extensive undermining and a larger surrounding abrasion. A similar pattern may also result from a blow to the back of the head by a large flat object (a board). The two would be differentiated by examination of the brain: a fall would have brain injury opposite the blow (comre coup) & a blow would have brain injury under the blow (coup).

Closed Head Injuries by Arthur E. Westveer, Behavioral Science Unit, FBI \"The Coup-contrecoup Mechanisms\" coup-type injuries are those produced by focal compressions of the skull (with or without the area of impact). The smaller the contact area, the greater the likelihood of a coup contusion. The effects are immediate, producing contusions (bruises) and hemorrhaging. An impact from a flat surface usually does not cause a coup contusion. A blow to the resting, movable head produces coup-type injuries. II. Conlrecoup brain contusions occur opposite a point of cranial impact, independently of skull fractures. Contrecoup brain contusions are sustained when the moving or falling/accelerating head strikes a solid object. There is no proof that human coup- contrecoup injuries are ever produced by any other mechanism than impact of the moving head against a solid object. III. Principles concerning coup-contrecoup head injuries are as follows: A. A blow to the resting movable head produces brain contusions beneath the point of impact (coup-type injuries) B. A moving head strikes a firm or unyielding surface, resulting in brain contusions opposite the point of impact (contrecoup-type injuries) C. A moving head sustains mild or no coup-type injuries (with rare exceptions) from an impact D. A resting head sustains mild or no contrecoup-type injuries (with rare exceptions) from an impact E. F. The typical contrecoup lesions have never been produced in man unless the head was in motion at the time of impact Occipital trauma (i.e., hitting the back of the head) for a moving head often results in frontal and temporal (contrecoup) brain injury (at least in part because the front base of the skull is rough) G. Frontal trauma (hitting the front of the head) for a moving head rarely results in occipital (contrecoup) brain injury (at least in part because the back and back base of the skull is smooth 213 H. A head fixed against a firm surface will sustain both coup and contrecoup type injuries when struck on the free surface (this is related to the elastic properties of the skull) I. When trauma is sustained to the upper jaw or temple in a moving head, the major lesions are always contrecoup, coup lesions being lesser or even absent J. Contusions of the brain surface can result from the edges of fractured bones impacting the brain surface. In severe skull fractures, differentiating fracture- contusions from coup-contrecoup injuries may be difficult or even impossible. 214 BLOODSTAIN PATTERN ANALYSIS Bloodstain Pattern Analysis by Arthur E. Westveer, Behavioral Science Unit, FBI Blood is one of the most significant and frequently encountered types of physical evidence associated with the forensic investigation of death and violent crime. Bloodstain pattern interpretation may be accomplished by direct scene evaluation and/or care- ful study of scene photographs with a measuring device in view. A visit by the analyst to the scene is by far the preferable choice. Photographs In those cases when photographs must be relied upon: detailed sketches, diagrams, reports of the crime scene investigators, autopsy report(s), and laboratory reports should be reviewed. Reconstruction Of The Crime Scene Bloodstain pattern interpretation ~ provide information in the following areas: 1. Origin of the bloodstains. 2. Distances between impact areas of blood patterns, spatter patterns and their origin at time of bloodshed. 3. Type and direction of impact. 4. Object(s) that produced particular pattern. 5. Number of blows or shots. 6. Position of victim, assailant, or objects at the scene. 7. Movement and direction of victim, assailant, or objects at the scene. 8. Support or contradict statements given by suspect or witnesses. 9. Additional information for estimation of postmortem interval, correlation with other laboratory and pathology findings relevant to the investigation. Be conservative--do not over-interpret bloodstain evidence. Physical Properties Of Blood Physically--fluid mixture--cellular components and plasma. When blood is exposed to the external environment as the result of trauma and subjected to various forces, it will behave in a predictable manner according to the principles of physics. The Application Of The Physical Properties Of Blood: 1. Viscosity 2. Specific gravity 3. Surface tension 217 The principles of fluid in motion form the basis for the study and interpretation of the location, shape, size, and distribution of bloodstains relative to the force or forces that produced them. What Blood Can Reveal: 1. Human or animal blood. 2. Type A, B, or O blood. 3. Presence of drugs. 4. Individuality (DNA). 5. Reconstruction of events. What Can Bloodstain Pattern Interpretation Tell Us? 1. Origin of bloodstain. 2. Distance between impact area and origin at the time of impact. 3. Type of impact that produced the pattern(s). 4. Object(s) that produced pattern(s). 5. Direction blood was traveling. 6. Number of blows, shots, etc. 7. Movement and direction of victim, assailant, or others during and/or after the assault. 8. Additional information in determining time of death. 9. Position of victim and assailant at time of assault. 10. Support or disprove statements given. When attempting to reconstruct the events from bloodstain patterns, it is extremely important to accurately record the following (among other things): 1. Shape of the stain. 2. Location of the stain. 3. Direction of the stain. 4. Size of the stain. 5. Surface area of impact. Free-Falling Blood: Source: open wounds, saturated objects Force of gravity exceeds the surface tension causing drops of blood to separate from the main source in the form of drops. As gravity forces the blood to separate, the blood takes on a tear drop shape, but once free, it quickly assumes a spherical shape to minimize surface area. 218 Surface Tension: The moleet~lar cohesive forces that cause the surface of a liquid to resist penetration and separation. The spherical drop will not separate or sub-divide while falling unless coming in contact with a force other than gravity. The size of the drop will depend upon the balance gravity of the source and the object it is dropping from. The texture of the surface that falling blood strikes dictates the degree of distortion of the bloodstain. The diameter of a bloodstain depends on: 1. Volume of the blood. 2. Distance of the fall. 3. Surface texture. Terminal Velocity: A drop of blood normally reaches its terminal velocity of about 25 feet per second after falling a distance of approximately 20 feet. The smoother the surface, the more uniform the edge character of the bloodstain. Blood dropping on nonhorizontal surfaces or striking surfaces at an angle will produce a more oval, elongated bloodstain. The greater the angle of impact, (between the surface the the blood flight path) the greater the elongation of the bloodstain. The end displaying the greatest degree of distortion of the striking bloodstain will point in the direction of travel. The angle in which blood struck a surface can be determined by dividing the length into width of the bloodstain and consulting a sine table. Point Of Convergence: A common point to which individual bloodstains can be traced. Point Of Origin: Location from which the blood producing the bloodstain originated. 219 Drops of blood falling into a pre-existing liquid blood surface will produce irregular pools with small (0,1 - 1.0 ram) round or oval satellite spatters on its perimeter. Crime Scene Processing For Bloodstain Patterns: Equipment: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Lights and light stands. Protractor and compass. String and tape. Ring stands Magnifier and reticule. Meter stick and tape measure. Workshop manual, graph paper, ruler. Camera, lens, tripod, film. Blood Clotting Blood is essentially comprised of plasma and cells. When clotting takes place, the gel-like clot mass retracts causing a separation of the serum (clear yellow to red liquid). High Velocity Impact Spatter Bloodstain Pattern 1. High energy/velocity force of impact. 2. Size of individual bloodstain usually 0.1 mm and smaller. Medium Velocity Impact Spatter Bloodstain Pattern 1. Moderate energy/velocity force of impact. 2. Size of individual bloodstain usually 1-4 mm. The Greater The Energy The Smaller The Spatter Misting -- Fine -- Medium -- Large -- spatter less than 1 mm -- HVIS spatter less than 3 mm. spatter 3-6 mm. spatter greater than 6 mm. -- LVIS Considerable overlap can occur. Blood That Is Subject To An Energy Greater Than Gravity: -- Blow -- Gunshot -- Vomiting -- Arterial gushing -- Cast off 220 Transfer Blood Swipe Wipe Smudge -- bloody object transferring blood to another object. -- object that wipes blood from an object. -- bloodstain altered by contact with non-bloody object. Splashed Blood (Free Fall) When large quantities of blood fall to a surface. Large central area with elongated rather than round peripheral spatter. 221 FEAT Bloodstain Pattern Evidence and the Evaluation of Violent Crime Scenes Source: The Prosecutor, Volume 28, #3, May/June, 1994. INTRODUCHON THE LOSS OF BLOOD DURING A VIOLENT crime often produces blood patterns which may provide valuable information about the events which took place to create those pat- terns. A source of blood receiving one or more high energg\" impacts may be dispersed into smaller volumes and be deposited as spatter (not splatter) on various target surfaces within range. The bloody shirt belonging to the in- div dual who found the battered homicide vic- tim was stained, we may be told, by contact with the victim when he found her, picked her up, and held her in his arms to make her more comfortable just before she died. The shirt and the blood on it take on a new sig- nificance when we recognize that the blood- staining on the shirt is not that of a contact na- ture, but is clearly impact spatter. Such staining, caused by an impact applied to a source of blood, would have resulted #ore the shirt being adjacent to a source of blood at the time of impact. A transfer of blood from a blood-bear- ing object may leave a pattern identifiable with the original object still bearing blood and later found in the possession of a suspect. Found next to a stabbing victim is his jacket which be~rs con- tact bloodstains clearly outlining the unique shape, size, and edge detail of a knife which may have been used to stab the victim. In- vestigation leads to an un- injured suspect who has in his possession a bloody knife which can be shown to match in all observable detail the stains on the jacket. Here, blood types of the victim's blood at the scene may be of little value, but by Robert P. Spalding Robert P. Spalding is an instructor in crime scene processing and general laboratory matters at the FBI Academy. Mr. Spalding is a member of the International ,~sociation of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts. SHIRT AND THE BLOOD ON 1T TAKE ON A-~ SIGNIHCANCE WHEN ~VE: NOT TE[A.T OFA _CX)NTAC'I\" ~4\"ATURE,'\" blood .typing of the blood on the knife and th features of the stain patterns on the jacket ar of considerable importance. The ultimate objective of studvin bloodstain patterns and related informatior then, is to as nearlv as possible reconstruct ~hos events which led to the deposition of the stair and stain patterns associated with a crime scent Observation of data involving spot size. quan tity, shape, distribution, location, angle of im pact and target surface character may provid valuable insight into the wents which too place. Stains indicating movement of or mask ing by an object and transfer of blood betwee persons or objects would likewise be observec documented, and studied to identify any pro bative information available. The purpose of this discussion is t increase awareness among prosecutors wit respect to bloodstain spatter interpretatio and to provide some g-uidelines for scene evai uation, documentation, and evidence c()llet tion. With this, hopefully, will come a recoe nition of the possibilities for bloodstain patter analysis to not only provide valuable infor mation but to also save time and effort for th investigator, whether in the laboratory or o the street. Even with these objectives me~ however, there is the cri~ ical need for communica tion. Effective communi cation between member of the investigative reave from the crime scene offi cer to the investigator t the laboratory analyst t the prosecuting attorne is essential to any thor ough, well-prepared in vestigation and prosecution. Communicatio\" is a two-way process; not simply a flow of in formation in one direction. -- 223 THE STUDY OF BLOODSTAIN PATTEP~NS IS NOT NEW THE STL-DY oF BLOODST&LN PATTEI~\\'S at clime scenes dates back to the 1890s. Bloodstain pattern interpretation is a field of study which relies on the fact that blood, as a fluid. follows certain physical laws and, as such, will form repro- ducible patterns under separate sets of similar circumstances. If the original conditions and environment of the incident are sufficiently reproduced, then subjecting blood to forces and actions similar to those originally used in the crime will result in stares and patterns similar to those found at the scene. \\Ve need \"onlv\" identify those forces and actions. This reproducibility of bloodstain patterns has been shown not to be significantly affected by the age, sex, or disease state of the bleeder. Nor does the blood alcohol, drug, or anticoagulant content present serious problems as long as these substances are present in clinical amounts. Further, temperature and humidity (within reasonable lim- its) do not significantly affect the reproducibility of these patterns. Ex'perimentation can be a useful tool in stud.wing and recreating stains. An analvst may rely on knowledge gained through previous experience as well as data observed during experiments based on the specific circumstances of the case at hand to evaluate a scene and evidence. WHAT CAN BE DETERMINED THROUGH BLOODSTAIN PATI'ERNS? OBVIOUSLY, EVERY CRLVIE SCENE HL $ ITS OX, VN UNIQUE SIT- UATION and specific problems. Generally speaking, how- ever, determinations made from a study of the scene and the evidence taken from that scene may help to confirm or re- fute assumptions or allegations concerning the events which took place to produce the stains observed. Some questions which mav be answered include: 9 What was the position of the victim or suspect (sitting, standing, lying down, etc.)? 9 Does the scene show evidence of a struggle (blood smears or trails, footprints, fabric impressions, etc.)? 9 Are there areas where there is a lack of staining, partic- ularly spatter--voids in patterns? Was someone or some- suspect, the victim, the weapon--blocking the flight of blood? 9 Are there in-line stain patterns where blood was cast from a bloody object being swung? What was swung-- the weapon, the victim? 9 Is there a particular sequence of events indicated--smear- ing of a transfer or spatter pattern subsequent to the ini- tial deposition of the blood? 9 How many impacts are indicated? Is there blood spat- ter which indicates the nature of the impact(s)? 9 Is there any information or bloodstaining to indicate that the scene was altered before bloodstain examinations were begun? Before the crime scene examinations were begun? Additionally, an analyst may be able to confirm or refute statements made by suspect(s) or victim(s) in a case: .~e the stain patterns on the clothing of the ~u~pect(s) anti at the scene consistent with each person's sto~:; Are there any stains visible on the clothing of the suspect(s)? A_re the stain patterns on the victim(s), the clothing of the victim(s), and at the scene consistent with the sto- ries of the victim(s) or wimess(es) or the suspect(s)? Finally, it may be possible to determine information which may eliminate the need for time-consuming in- vestigation or laboratory analvsis which might otherwise be routine in such an investigation. As an example, in- vestigation might disclose that the scene, the witnesses. and the evidence indicate an event or action could have happened in one of two or three different ways. A blood- stain pattern evaluation might then establish that, given the available information and based on the patterns pre- sent, only one of the suggested possibilities is actually possible. The need for extensive determinations of \"Whose blood is where?\" through conventional blood typing might then be unnecessary. DO YOU NEED BLOODSTAEN PATTERN EXAMINATIONS? IT FOLLOWS TttEN, that an extremely tmportant point for a prosecutor to consider in deciding on the need for blood- stain pattern analysis examinations is: based on knowledge of the crime and the scene, what realistic, specific questions can a bloodstain pattern analysis an~c~er? In conjunction with the questions set forth above, one might ask, Is it important: do I need to know? Whenever a blood-splashed and spattered crime is encountered, an examination of the scene and the available evidence by an individual experienced and qualified in bloodstain pattern interpretation should be considered. Frequently it is nearly the last thing to be considered as an investigative resource. YVhen this occurs at the expense of valuable stain patterns, the results are limited at the outset. Immediate (telephonic or in person) contact with a labo- ratory which has expert personnel available may help to deter~nine the extent to which a bloodstain pattern exam- ination is needed, or indeed, if such an examination may be of value at all. Often such contacts will mean a saving of time and effort for everyone and result in either a more ef- ficient submission of evidence to the laboratory or a more complete on-scene examination bv an analyst. The labo- ratory analyst should be ready to provide information and make analytical needs known to the investigators. Both the investigator and the analyst invariably will already have a full workload. The prosecutor needs to understand the re- sources, limitations, and frustrations they face. THE ANALYST SHOULD VISIT THE SCENE WHEaN BLOODSTAIN PATTEP~N INTERPRETATION is to be em- ployed on a case, it is best initiated by one or more ana- lysts on the scene rather than on evidence sent to a labo- ratory. Certainly, when an analyst can study the scene, personally be involved in the evidence collection process, (Continued on page 16) 224 Bloodstain Pattern E~'i dence r page 14) and inspect undisturbed stain patterns at the scene, there is the greater likelihood of the needed information being gathered with the minimum of difficulty. It may be, of course, that available resources or another reason will pre- clude such a visit. The suggestions presented later in this dis- cussion are intended for ase either before the arrival of an analyst at the scene or in the event an analyst cannot a~tend the scene at all. Talk to the analvst to determine ~'hat needs to be done. If it is determined that an analyst will be able to examine the scene, any ad- vance preparation the prose- cutor's investigator can ac- complish will uhimatelv benefit your case. ,~sembling in advance some of the ma- terial discussed below will go a long way to simpli .fying the work both will have to c-qrrv out. The analyst may wish to personally cover photo~aphic documentation of the scene. Photography bv the prosecutor's department, while it mav largely be a duplicate effort, will give the perspective of a second photographer which can often provide information not otherwise obtainable. \"NOR IS IT BEING SUGGESTED THAT LARGE VOLUMES OF EVIDENCE BE PACKAGED AND SENT TO THE LAB TO ~LET FIGURE IT OUT.'\" SENDING EVIDENCE TO A LABORATORY IN THOSE CASES VJHERE .NO SCENE E32~MINATION by an an- alyst is possible, the call to the lab is all the more important. A careful evaluation of the evidence to be sent should be car- ried out to determine, insofar as possible, that examination of the items sent will provide information meaningful to the prosecution of the ease. Of course, it is not always pos- sible for the investigator to thoroughly evaluate the evi- dence. Discussing the case with an experienced examiner will often be beneficial. It should be recognized that this type of examination can be extremely time consuming (sometimes more so than manv of the more conventional serological ex- aminations). The questsons to be answered should be pro- bative and pertinent to the investigation and not of the \"Gee, what if...\" variety, perhaps ~II~_~ .TI-IOSE ~ ~ NO other areas of ex- pertise will pro- $C~N]E F_.XAIVII1MATION BY AN vide information in ~TO TI-IE I,,AI3 ~ AIkL Tt~ the end. Of course, there are .'MORE ~RTA~'T2 times when there are no specific ideas or logical directions to pursue~no leads, a dead end. Similarly, there are situations where the only answer is to examine the item of evidence. Call the lab and talk it over with someone. Carefully consider the advice you get in light of the inves- tigation as you know it. The categories of evidence set forth below are in- tended to be helpful in organizing the submission. Havinr as much as possible of the materials and the information outlined below on hand will make matters easier and avoid havin~ to ~o back to get that forgotten photograph or mea- surement. This is not to say that huge submissions of evi- dence are best. Nor is it being suggested that large vol- umes of evidence be packaged and sent to the lab to \"let them figmre it out.\" Often ex- ev- idence include manv unnec- essarv items accompanied by information inadequate to al'- low the analyst to determine appropriate forensic objec- tives.

The laboratory analyst will t, 7 to develop a mental picture of the crime scene that is as good as (or possibly better than) the one yon _yourself have. The qualin,, not necessarily the quantio', of the evidence available ='ill often detemnine the final result. Crime scene administration, that is, command and control, is a subject beyond the scope of this discussion: however, it should be stressed that the prosecutor's inves- tigator who is in- vol ,ed with the activities below should not be \"s ~ SEARCH OF hampered with SCENE, OBJECTIVES the responsibili- ties of protecting - VCI-IICH SHOULD BE MAJOR the scene and di- PRIoRrrlES INCLUDE: recting the activi- PRESERVATION, ties of sit- DOCUa~ENTATION AND uation, control of COLLEC~ON.\" the scene must be maintained. During the search of the scene, objectives which should be major priorities include: preservation, documen- tation, and collection of the stains, patterns, and physical ev- idence at the scene. While this is, in principle, no different from any other crime scene, the uniqueness of bloodstain patterns adds a new dimension to the task at hand. More than likely, the fruits of the efforts of the prosecutor's in- vestigator will fall within more than one of the categories below. EVIDENCE TO CONSIDER Graphic Information GRAPHIC INFOP~MATION in the form of clear, informative sketches, diagrams, drawings, maps (topographical, road, or hand-drawn as appropriate), with dimensions, should define the crime scene. Sketch and locate stains and stain 225 patterns to static features of the scene such as corners of rooms, walls, floors, ceilings, attached cabinets, etc., usin~ ~vo measurements, each taken from fixed points. ~,Vhere it mav be necessary to reproduce objects for courtroom presentation (grap~cally or physically), remember to record length, width, and height and any unique features about the objects. Scale drawings can be vet3.- helpful and are cer- tainly preferred. Computer graphics programs are now available in manv departments and can often be a ~reat help to all concerned. In any event, it should be remembered that crime scene sketches supplement, but cannot replace, photographs and vice versa. Narrative Information COMPREHENSI~'E AND DETMLED CRL\\IE SCENE REPORTS pre- pared by crime scene specialists are not a routine proce- dure in many departments. Often the volume of work and available resources preclude this. Such reports, however, include valuable information on the events thought to have occurred, the features of the scene itself, physical descrip- lions of the individuals involved, and the injuries sustained. Such information as right or left handedness, association with drugs or alcohol, medication, and infectious diseases is also of value. Narrative coverage should also include a description of the scene (in- or out-of-doors) and weather or environmental conditions such as temperature, winds, precipitation, presence of os- cillating fans, and open win- dows. Observations of any blood pools and stains should also be recorded (wet, dwing , dry., mixed with other sub- stances or fluids, etc.) in a crime scene report. Investigative reports often contain recorded inter- views with wimesses which detail particular actions or sce- narios. Additionally, any information on events which are supposed not to have happened should be documented. When providing narrative information, avoid large amounts of information which reflect unproductive investigation, such as interviews of persons who may not have seen or contributed anything of value. An autopsy report is normally prepared by a med- ical examiner or pathologist to record the observations made during the post-mortem examination of the deceased. It will usually include a description of the body and the specific nature of the injuries sustained. A review of the au- topsy report is often helpful in gaining a picture of the wounds and the manner, angle, and direction in or from which they were inflicted. \"VIDEOTAPING CAN BE IIELPFUL TO GAIN AN OVERALL PERSPECTIVE OF THE SCENE. BUT THE SPECIFIC DETAIL OF STAINS AND STAIN PATTERNS CAN BE BETTER RECORDED PHOTOGRAPHY.\" Photographic Information PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION of the scene with large format color photography will not only make it possible for an analyst to better \"learn\" the scene, but will eventu- ally provide an oppommity for the jury to view the scene as welt. Color prints (eight-by-ten-inch) and the ori~inat neg- atives should be provided for examination. Too many phi> tographs are usually better than not enough. If a depart- mental limitation exists as to the number of photographs that may be taken at a scene, some reconsideration may need to be done. Small iJtstant print fb~vnat canteras r,?re/v provide the detail aJ2d clas'itv reqztired for the analysis of bloo~/- stain patterns. Negatives of sufficient size to allow clear. sharp enlargements should be the objective. Normalh. this will mean 35 mm or larger format. Photographs sl~ould both supplement and complement the sketclaes and narra- tive information. The scene should be photographed as soon as pos- sible and without people (and people's feet) in the wax'. Any delav in completing the photography process mav'allo(v time for evidence to be relocated or contaminated, xihether inadvertent or not. Include recognizable scales and the identification date wherever possible. Such scales should have sufficient contrast to photograph well. Standard mea- sure mav be used for medium or more distant photographs. but metric is preferred for close-up views of bloodstains and patterns. YVith video recording technology as readih\" avail- able as it is, a natural thought is to videotape the scene. In many departments this is stan- dard operating procedure. Videotaping will often pro- ~de useful information; how- ever, it should be recognized that normally-available video equipment (both recording and playback) is not capable of producing the highly-re- solved detail desirable for the analysis of individual stain pat- terns. Thus, videotapinr can be helpful to gain an overall perspecm-e of the scene, but the specific detail of stains and stain patterns can be better recorded with still photography. A. Outdoor Scenes 9 Use of distance photographs will help to document and establish the location of the scene by including land- marks and unique features in the immediate vicinity. In approaching the scene, a logically organized photo~a'phic record is often far more informative than random pho- tographs taken of features as they are encountered. 9 Medium range photographs should be used to record relative positions of more closely related items and larger stain patterns within the scene itself. 9 Close-up photographs of individual items will establish the nature of the items as found and the presence of any bloodstains or stain patterns. Remember to include a scale and some means of relating the photographs to the scene for later orientation. B. Indoor Scenes 9 As above, the use of distance photographs will help to document and establish the location of the scene by in- cluding landmarks and unique features in the inmledi- 226 ate vicmiw. In indoor scenes it is even more important to have a logically organized photographic record rather than random photographs. YVhen entering a room, for ex- ample, it may be helpful to take an initial series of pho- tographs sequentially in a clockwise or counterclock~qse fashion, documenting the overall features of the room before concentrating on specific details. The specific or- der in which the photographs are taken is not critical, but using a photographic log with an organized approach will help ensure that the scene is completely documented. A recent case encountered by the author involved a victim whose body had been moved during the photo- documentation process but no log was kept of the photos or the activities. Only a small number of photographs were provided for examination. Bloodstains in different pho- tographs were inconsistent, with no explanation available. Such an approach is best avoided. 9 Photographs of rooms and other interior areas from typi- cal observation points with various lenses (wide angle, tele- photo, zoom, etc.) will help estabfish relationships between objects in the room. Views of an area from the same van- tage point using different magnification can be very useful in gaining an overall perspective of the area of study. 9 Close-up views with appropriate scales should be used to show details on individual items and particular stains and patterns. Remember, a photograph of a stain with nothing to relate it to its original position and orientation in the overall scene is rar~ ly of any significant value. C. Photographs of Stains and Stain Patterns 9 Take photographs perpendicular to the surface bearing the stains whenever possible and include a scale. Be aware, however, that a flash used carelessly may wash out stain pat- tern derail or reflect from a scale with a reflective surface. 9 Insure that a deceased individual is photographed from all vantage points before the body is moved. ?my move- ment of the body should then be documented with pho- tography. Bloodstains on the body surface or in the im- mediate vicinity of the body (particularly bloodstains which can be shown to have fallen vertically to the sur- face bearing them) may be the result of blood dripping from a weapon or an injured attacker. 9 Be alert to such features as voids (an absence of blood- stains within a pattern which might indicate an object masking or shielding a surface from the deposition of blood). In-line cast-off stains such as might be thrown from a blood-bearing object being swung may, be pre- sent on walls or ceilings (always look overheadi. dence (and packaging), to avoid creating new stains not re- lated to the commission of the crime. Drying of blood- stains also helps to arrest the biological degradation of the biochemical constituents of the stains which are important to serological and DNA analysis. Phvsical evidence beating bloodstain patterns which might crack or flake off(particularly those on non-absorbent surfaces) should be thoroughly described and photo~aphed (with a scale) to document the stains in their original con- dition and orientation. Valuable stains can be lost com- pletely with a gust of wind. Patterns on such surfaces whic]: are not to be used for any other analysis including latent finger- prints may be sprayed gently with clear polyurethane to ad- here the stains to the surface before collection of the evi- dence. Be aware that this will probably interfere with future efforts at latent fingerprint and biochemical analysis, so consider your options. If bloodstain lifts are necessary for preservation and later examination, they should be made only by or with the specific advice of an individual trained and experienced in bloodstain pattern examinations. Often the spraying tech- nique described above is preferable to lifting tape. When such o lifts are made for examination away from the scene, they mz~ contain some indicators (arrows, measurements, etc.) to ori- ent accurately the stains ~ithin the overall scene. Chemical Visualization of Bloodstain Patterns-- Luminol OCCASIONALLY THE QUESTION of detecting bloodstain pat- terns with luminol arises. Luminol is an organic compound Physical Evidence IT WILL PROBABLY BE NECESSARY to secure, collect, and package items of physical evidence (clothing, weapons, etc.) bearing blood or trace evidence to prevent loss. This should be accomplished with as little disturbance as possible to bloodstain patterns present. It may be necessary to docu- ment or collect some patterns immediately to avoid their distortion or destruction. A good photographic record may be sufficient. Normally, however, bloodstains should be at- lowed to dry as much as possible before movement of evi- 227 O which may. be used as a presumptive blood identification test. Like any presumptive test, it cannot be interpreted as a positive identifier of blood; however, it does provide strong evidence to indicate blood is present. The test is based on a chemical o.vidation reaction which results in a blue-white to yellowish glow in darkness when blood is present. It is very sensitive and is best used when blood is thought to be pre- sent but cannot be seen (normally due to cleaning efforts). When the luminol preparation is sprayed over a suspected bloodstained area in darkness, an immediate glow which may last for 30 seconds will indicate the presence of blood residues. The advantage of the glow, which can be pho- tographed, is in the definition, configuration, and distribu- tion of the bloodstain patterns present. While luminol represents an advantage in pro- cessing large areas at crime scenes, it should not be used on clearly-visible bloodstains until samples are taken for analy- sis. Stains that are clearly visible will, in all probability, be sufficient in quanti .ty to allow biochemical analysis (blood typing and DNA analysis) to determine possible origin. Stains too limited to be seen will probably, not represent sufficient amounts to allow further characterization. Ad- dition of luminol to an already visible stain will thus po- tentially interfere with subsequent biochemical analysis. Robert Grispino, in an article published in The Prosecutor several years ago (see References), presented a more lengthy treatment of the subject of luminol. CONCLUSION THE ABOVE GLIDELLNES FOR PROSECUTORS, prosecutors' in- vestigators, and law enforcement agencies, will apply in many cases whether the scene and evidence are examined in place by an analyst or all of the information and evidence is collected and sent to a laboratory. Vfhile considerable detail is involved, the material is not intended to be all-inclusive. There will be situations not covered by the foregoing discussion which mav require independent action or communication with a blood'- stain pattern analvst. Finally, it should be recognized by the prosecutor that an important point in the process is arriving at a well-founded decision that bloodstain pattern work will provide probative information and aid the investigation. Once that decision is made, the more routine time and effort re- quired will be well invested. SUGGESTED REFERENCES 3 C.H. Wecht, Forensic Sciences (1981).

The more acute the angle of impact, the more extreme the ellipse. Determination of the angle of impact involves measurement of the maj or axis (length) and minor axis (width) of this elliptical stain. When the length is divided into the width, the resulting value is the sine of the angle of impact. Measure length and width of each of the bloodstains. See figure detailing proper measurement of stains. Divide width by length to get sine of the impact angle: Sine of impact angle = W/L Use the data table to record your results and confirm them with the instructor. Extreme care should be taken to avoid measuring the ~ too long. Practice is necessary to gain the ability to recognize the curvature of the ellipse covered by the leading edge distortion. 229 Angle of Impact \u000e9 Z 90 degrees Angle to Normal Angle of Impact Target Surface 231 Measuring Length and Width of Bloodstains l. 232 f / 1 / 233 WORKSHEET - BLOODSTAINS OF UNKNOWN IMPACT ANGLES STAIN WIDTH OF LENGTH OF W/L ANGLE OF ELLIPSE ELLIPSE RATIO IMPACT A B C D E F G H 234 INTERNAL ANGLES OF IMPACT 10o 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 .o O. 235 Notes 238 Area of Origin DeterminatFon Area of Origin ct / Angle Area ~ in ConvergeInmlact Angle / Bloodstain 1 Impact Angle 239 HOMICIDE BY POISONING I. Introduction Homicide By Poisoning by Arthur E. Westveer, Behavioral Science Unit, FBI One of the most perplexing cases for a death investigator is a death by poison. Many times poison is not even considered when an elderly person dies or becomes violently ill. Also to be considered are hospital patients who die while under treatment for various illnesses. If a medical examiner does not do toxicological testing for poison, it will not be found, as it does not cause any marked change in tissue in most cases. The availability of poison is surprising. Most hardware stores carry a full line of insect sprays and ant/roach killers, most of which contain arsenic. The cost of testing for poison is another factor to be considered when investigating a suspected poison death. II. III. Statistics of Poisoning Cases A. The amounts and types of toxic substances ingested by or injected into individuals either by accident or on purpose is hard to believe. The 430 Poison Control Centers throughout the U.S. report 1.5 million calls yearly where potentially toxic substances were involved. Of the 1.5 million calls, 91% occurred in the home; 60% of these were children under 7 years of age. B. From 1979-1982, 21,600 children between birth and 9 years of age were hospitalized for poisoning. C. In 1980 there were 10,968 poisoning deaths reported in the U.S. Of these, 4,331 (39.5%) were accidental deaths and 5,453 (49.7%) were suicides. D. Poisoning patterns have changed dramatically as a result of the availability of new drugs and the passage of the Child-Resistant Packaging Law. E. Pharmaceuticals, both prescription and over-the-counter medications, account for about 40 % of exposures in children under the age of 5, followed by cleaners, polishes, and plants. Vitamins are among the pharmaceutical products most often involved, accounting for 14.1% of exposures in one series. F. Type of drug depends on the area of the country. A hospital in Boston reported that in 1978, salicylares were the drugs involved in most cases, followed by diazepam, acetaminophen, and vitamins. Historical Look at Homicides Involving Poison 243 A.

Recent use: manufacture of imitation jewelry pigments, optical lenses, low-temp thermometers. Its use as a rodenticide was banned in 1965 because of accidental and suicidal exposures and its severe toxicity. Thallium is an acknowledged cumulative, homicidal poison. The average lethal adult dose is 1 g. of soluble thallium salt. The onset of thallium poisoning is insidious, reaching a maximum in 2 or 3 weeks, followed by gradual resolution or death. 246 2. Physical effects a. immediate (3-4 hours) Mostly gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, Vomiting, and diarrhea. Hematemesis may occur. b. intermediate (hours to days) Central nervous system disorientation, lethargy, coma, convulsions, psychosis, thirst, insomnia, cerebral edema with central respiratory failure. Peripheral nervous system combined motor and sensory neuropathy, including severe hyperesthesia of palms and soles. Unlike Gullain-Barr6 Syndrome, stretch reflexes are preserved until late in the course of toxicity and prominent sensory changes precede motor weakness. Autonomic nervous system tachycardia, hypertension, fever, salivation, and sweating. c. Late (24 weeks) Dry scaly skin, white stripes across nails (Meer's lines), and scalp and facial hair loss. d. Residual (months) Central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities may persist, including ataxia, tremor, foot drop, and memory loss. B. Arsenic Arsenic has a long, nefarious history of use as a homicidal agent. It is an odorless, tasteless compound. Americans ingest an estimated 1 mg of arsenic daily in the water they drink. Arsenic is the most common cause of pesticide- induced deaths in children and is the most common cause of heavy-metal- related death, second only to lead. Ant pastes are a major source of exposure. (For effects, see Selenium) 247 C. Selenium Selenium toxicity resembles arsenic toxicity. . include: horizontal streaking on fingernails, paronychia, fatigue, irritability, hyperreflexia, nausea, vomiting, garlic odor on breath, and metallic taste. Selenium poisoning also results in muscle tenderness, tremor, light-headedness, and facial flushing. 2. Acute ingestion of selenious acid is almost always fatal. . Stupor, respiratory depression, hypotension, and death can result several hours after ingestion. D. Water Intoxication Excessive water intake may result in severe neurologic symptoms and death. Hyponatremia--abnormally low sodium concentrations in blood. Causes of hyponatremia after excessive free-water intake: 1. Infants a. feeding mismanagement b. swimming lessons with water swallowing c. vigorous hydration d. use of dilute formulas 2. Adults a. professional weight-loss programs (8-12 8 oz glasses per day) b. Polydipsia associated with salt depletion or thiazide-induced decrease in urinary diluting capacity c. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone d. Excessive water intake after accidental ingestion of caustics e. Psychogenic polydipsia f. Excessive beer drinking g. Use of 5 % dextrose in water as a vehicle for oxytocin for therapeutic abortions E. Strychnine 1. Median lethal dosage At one time strychnine was used as an appetite suppressant, aphrodisiac, and purgative. These uses have been discontinued. Strychnine is an alkaloid extracted from the dry seeds of the indian tree. The estimated lethal dose in humans is 5-8 mg/kg. Small children may develop symptoms with 15-20 mg; adults may develop 248 . symptoms with 30-80 mg, and death occurs from 100 mg doses. Half of the absorbed dose is distributed to tissues within five minutes. Strychnine appears to excite all levels of the CNS, but stimulation at higher brain centers is much less than at the spinal cord. Symptoms begin rapidly (5 to 60 minutes), lasting 15-20 minutes. Physical Effects Affected persons will experience apprehension, fear, nausea, muscle twitching, feelings of depersonalization, and hyperreflexia within one hour. Severely affected persons progress to extensor spasm and opisthotonos, causing interference with breathing without loss of consciousness. Convulsions occur from 1-2 minutes at 5- to 10-minute intervals with extensor spasms, the patient usually remains conscious, but coma may follow repeated convulsions. The presence of symmetrical seizures, extensor spasms, trismus, opisthotonos, and risus sardonicus in awake patients strongly suggests strychnine poisoning. Respiratory depression secondary to spasms of the diaphragm is the major life-threatening emergency. There is no specific antidote available nor are there any effective elimination methods. V. Medical Elements of Investigating Poisoning Cases I A. Medically, the basic approach to the poisoned patient is: . 2. . 4. 5. 6. Stabilization Complete patient evaluation (history, physical examination, laboratory tests) Appropriate treatment to reduce absorption Appropriate measures to improve elimination of the toxin Consideration of the use of antidotes Continuing care and disposition B. However, the investigation of a poison case is extremely difficult because, in most cases, the crime scene is virtually nonexistent. The victim is usually diagnosed as being ill or dying from a disease. Determining that a person has died as the result of homicidal poisoning is the most difficult type of investigation for law enforcement officers and medical experts. The general evidence of poisoning is obtained from a knowledge of the symptoms displayed by the decedent prior to death, the postmortem examination of the body by the pathologist, and the isolation and identification of the poison by the toxicologist. For successful prosecution of a suspect, law enforcement officers must establish a motive for the crime, access of the perpetrator to a supply of the poison, that he was aware of the lethal effects of the poison, 1This section is by Dr. Alphonse Poklis, Director of Toxicology, Medical School of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia. 249 and had opportunities to administer the poison to the decedent. Each aspect of the investigation is dealt with below. VI. Lack of Suspicion A. When the victim is attended prior to death by a physician, the doctor seldom, if ever, considers poisoning as a cause of the patient's ills. Only if the patient's occupation brings him into contact with toxic substances (works in a refinery, chemical or smelting plant; farmer who uses pesticides or herbicides) will the physician suspect a chemical intoxication. B. Self-poisoning (suicides or drug abuse) is common today; however, murder by poison is rare. C. Persons who resort to the use of poisons are usually very stupid or very clever. The stupid ones make obvious their crimes; the clever ones may never be unmasked. VII. Signs and Symptoms Prior to Death A. There is rarely any symptom of poisoning that cannot equally well be caused by disease; however, there are conditions or symptoms that render a diagnosis of poisoning moderately certain. For example, the onset of symptoms immediately after eating or drinking, a progression of symptoms and rapid death indicate acute poisoning. (Bacterial food poisoning has a delayed onset of symptoms.

B. If medical assistance is called prior to death, the following should be noted: 1. Time medical personnel arrived 2. The signs and symptoms of intoxication a. condition of the pupils b. pulse and respiratory rate c. convulsions or paralysis d. stomach pain 3. Time the symptoms started and their order 4. Smell and color of the subject's vomit, odor of breath 5. Time of death 6. M1 statements made by the victim Evidence A. From the victim's residence and/or from witnesses obtain the following information: 1. MI substances, food, and drink, that the deceased ingested 24 hours prior to the onset of the symptoms. If still available, collect all such items. 2. Time of last meal or drink. 3. The state of health of the victim prior to the onset of symptoms. 4. Did others who shared the deceased's last meal become sick; if so, what were the symptoms. 5. Had the subject ever attempted suicide (suicide defense) 6. Where poisons and medicines were kept. 7. Inquire of the victim's personal physician all pertinent medical information. 251 B. Collection of evidence at the scene Remember that in all legal cases, it is essential that the proper chain of custody of evidence be maintained. Conduct a complete and thorough search of the premises where the deceased was found and collect the following: 1. All medicine bottles, hypodermic syringes, etc. 2. All empty, partially empty, or opened containers of poisons or medicines 3. All food the victim may have recently eaten. Place each item in a separate clean glass container (rinse the container with water prior to use and submit a sample of the rinse water to the laboratory with the samples), close and seal, and label. All utensils, plates, cuts, etc., used for recent eating and drinking. Garbage left from the victim's last meal. Vomit, urine, excretion of the victim prior to death. Soiled linen or clothes of the deceased. o 5. 6. \"7. IX. Postmortem Examination of the Body A. The pathologist can recognize the effects of certain poisons at autopsy. Strong acids and alkalies may cause extensive burns around mouth or on the surface of the body and severe destruction of the tissues. Metallic poisons may cause intensive damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys. Phosphorous causes gross fatty degeneration of the liver. B. Most drugs and poisons do not produce characteristic pathological lesions and can only be demonstrated in the body by toxicologic analysis. C. In many instances of poisoning, the value of the pathologist's examination is the establishment that death was not due to natural causes or traumatic injury, that there is not evidence for death except from possible poisoning. X. Toxicologic Examination A. Death due to poisoning cannot be established without contention unless the agent can be demonstrated in the body by chemical methods of isolation and identification. 252 B. C. D. E, F. G. The stomach and the intestines are \"legally\" considered outside the body. The presence of the poison must be established in blood, liver, or other tissues in the body. The presence of a poison in urine only indicates that it was at some time present in the body; the significance of urine levels is subject to question. There are thousands of compounds that are lethal if ingested, and the toxicologist has only a limited amount of material on which to perform analysis; therefore, it is imperative that the investigators supply the toxicologist with as much information as possible concerning the facts of the case. The possible identity of the poison in question would greatly help. Embalming and putrefaction may greatly hinder the toxicologist's work. Many poisons are rapidly biotransformed or excreted by the body; in such cases only the biotransformation products (metabolites) or low levels of the poisons may be detected. Many poisons can be detected for many years after death (arsenic). XI. Collection and Preservation of Specimens A. All specimens, whether food or garbage or tissues obtained at autopsy, should be placed in separate containers. Glass jars with screw tops (mason jars) or plastic bags are acceptable. B. Each container should be labeled and the identification should bear the date and time of collection, the name of the victim, the identity of the sample and the signature of the law enforcement person or pathologist. C. All containers should be sealed and initiated by the person collecting the sample. D. When exhibits are handled by several persons and when they are accepted by the analyst, a written receipt must be obtained,, one that can subsequently be produced in court. 253 PROFILES OF COMMON HOMICIDAL POISONS by John H.

BIBLIOGRAPHY ................................................ 7 257 INTRODUCTION These substance profiles are designed for the use of law enforcement officers responding to scenes of potential poisoning homicides. This material describes the essential features of some of the more commonly utilized homicidal poisons. Homicide should always be suspected in the case of a sudden death, and certainly poisoning must always be considered when there are no visible signs of trauma in a normally healthy individual now deceased! Poisoning fatalities can result from: accidents, or suicide, as well as from homicidal causes. Always remember the essentials of crime scene investigation: 1. Until facts prove otherwise, a death MUST be considered a homicide. 2. All things MUST be considered as potential evidence. 3. After the crime scene has been secured, the appropriate homicide investigators MUST be notified immediately. 4. The proper chain-of-custody for evidence MUST be maintained! 5. To establish death from poisoning, the presence of the poison MUST by proven, by means of analytical methods. 6. The gut is like a garden hose (hollow and open at both ends). In order to cause death, the poison MUST be absorbed through the walls of the gut and enter the body's systemic circulation. 7. \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, MUST be the truth\" - (Sherlock Holmes, The Sign of Four).

(AsC13) is an oily liquid. Arsenic trioxide (As203) is a crystalline solid. It can also exist as Arsine gas (ASH3). Lewisite, a war gas, is a (steel-gray), salts (white powder). ODOR: odorless, but garlicky odor to the breath. SOLUBILITY: Arsenical salts are water soluble. TASTE: almost tasteless. SOURCE: pesticides, rodent poison, ant poison, homeopathic medications, weed killers, marine (Copper arsenate) and other paints, ceramics, livestock feed. LETHAL DOSE: 200 mg (As203) .9 HOW IT KILLS: Arsenic is a general protoplasmic poison, it combines with sulflaydral (-S/-/) groups on enzymes to inhibit their normal function. This results in disruption of normal metabolic pathways related to energy transfer. POISON NOTES: the trivalent Arsenic (As +3) is MORE toxic than the pentavalent (As +5) form. Arsenic is one of the oldest poisons used by man. THE VICTIM OF ARSENIC ADMINISTERED: often administered to victim in food or drink. SYMPTOM ONSET TIME INTERVAL: hours to days SYMPTOMS - ACUTE: GI (30 minutes to 2 hours post exposure) = vomiting, bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, burning esophageal pain, metallic taste in the mouth. Later symptoms include: jaundice, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathies (destruction of the nervous system). Death from circulatory failure within 24 hours to 4 days. SYMPTOMS - CHRONIC: GI (diarrhea, abdominal pain), skin (hyper pigmentation of palms and soles), nervous system (symmetrical sensory neuropathy with numbness and loss of vibratory or positional sense, burning pain on the soles of the feet), localized edema (face, ankles), sore 261 Page 2 throat, stomatitis, pruritis, cough, tearing, safivation, garlic odor On breath, Aldrich-Mees lines (horizontal white lines which normally take 5 to 6 weeks to appear after the exposed nail bed area grows), hair loss. DISEASE CONFUSION: gastroenteritis, neurological disease. VICTIM NOTES: in homicides the amount of Arsenic administered could be a large ACUTE dose, or chronically in small CHRONIC doses to make the symptoms appear like a progressing natural illness. In suicides, the amount of Arsenic taken is usually large. THE DETECTION OF ARSENIC SPECIMENS: food, beverages, medications, blood, urine, gastric contents, hair, nails, autopsy organ specimens. METHOD: colorimetric, atomic absorption (AA). TOXIC LEVELS: 0.6-9.3 ? 3 mcg/gm dry weight ANALYSIS NOTES: Arsenic can be detected in hair and bones many years after the poisoning. Several hairs pulledout by the root should be sent for analysis, with a clear indication of which end of the hair is the root. Segmented hair analysis using neutron activation gives an indication of arsenic exposure over the last several months. SELECTED ARSENIC HOMICIDE CASES Mary Blandy - Mabel Case - 1919 Herbert Armstrong - 1921 Michael Swango - 1985 Marie Hilley- 1986 Blanche Moore - 1988 Revised: November 16, 1997 CYANIDE THI~ POISON FORM: in liquid form, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is also known as \"Prussic Acid\". Pure hydrogen cyanide is a gas which is usually made by mixing an acid with cyanide salts. It is more commonly 262 Page 3 found in form of its Sodium, Potassium, or Calcium salts, which are crystalline materials. Industrial cyanide can take the form of large nuggets called cyanide eggs\". COLOR: the sodium and potassium salts of HCN are white. ODOR: supposed to elicit the odor of almonds to some persons (NOTE: 40-60% of the population can NOT detect the odor due to a genetic difference - a form of\"odor blindness\"). SOLUBILITY: the salts of cyanide are easily dissolved in aqueous liquids. Acidic liquids would cause the release of some HCN gas. TASTE: salts of cyanide have a bitter (alkaline) taste, and can have a mild corrosive action on tissues. SOURCE: fumigants, insecticides, rodenticides, metal polishes (especially silver polish), electroplating solutions, metallurgy for the extraction of gold and silver from ore, photographic processing, jewelers, and chemical laboratories. Contained as cyanogenic glycosides inside the pits and seeds of certain plants of genus Prunus (i.e. cherry, peach, bitter almonds, cassava, Laetrile, etc.). Cyanide can also be produced by the action of flame on certain synthetic plastic materials polyurethane & polyacrylonitrile). ~Also in the intravenous antihypertensive drug Sodium nitroprusside (Nipride). Cyanide is also found used in the most commonly employed method of synthesizing Phencylidine (PCP). LETHAL DOSE: 270 200-300 rng (NaCN or KCN) .9 HOW IT KILLS: Cyanide shuts down respirations at the cellular level by inactivating essential enzymes resulting in metabolic asphyxiation. Critical effects are on those organs most sensitive to oxygen deprivation (brain & heart). POISON NOTES: extreme care must be taken in providing mouth-to-mouth respiration support to victim, to avoid contamination of the individual providing aid! THE CYANIDE VICTIM ADMINISTERED: often administered to victim in food or drink. 263 Page 4 SYMPTOM ONSET TIME INTERVAL: immediate (as little as 30 seconds), few poisons are as rapidly lethal! SYMPTOMS - ACUTE: headache, nausea, vomiting, difficult breathing, and confusion. These initial symptoms are rapidly followed by: seizures, coma, gasping respirations, and cardiovascular collapse. SYMPTOMS - CHRONIC: NOT applicable. DISEASE CONFUSION: heart attack, acute asthmatic attack. VICTIM NOTES: an abrupt onset of profound symptoms after exposure is classic for cyanide exposure. THE DETECTION OF CYANIDE SPECIMENS: food, beverages, medications, blood, urine, gastric contents, and autopsy organ specimens. METHOD: colorimetric techniques TOXIC LEVELS: 12.4 mg/Liter 0.1 mg/Liter ? ? ANALYSIS NOTES: toxic levels of cyanide in tissues may diminish significantly after death by mechanisms that include evaporation, thiocyanate formation, and reaction with tissue components. The formation of cyanide in postmortem tissues with accumulation to toxicologically significant levels apparently ~om the conversion ofthiocyanate to cyanide, has been demonstrated, but can be prevented by the addition of Sodium fluoride (NaF). Blood specimens should be kept at temperatures from -20 to 4 degrees Centigrade to reduce losses. SELECTED CYANIDE HOMICIDE CASES Theodosius Boughton Case - 1781 Dr. Collidge - 1847 Mrs. MacFarland Case - 1911 Twigg/Elosser Case - 1911 Jessie Costello - 1933 Ronald O'Bryan - 1974 People's Temple Case - 1978 264 Page 5 Tylenol tampering (Chicago)- 1982 Donald Harvey - 1987 Stella Nickel - 1988 Revised: November 16, 1997 STRYCHNINI THE POISON FORM: Strychnine is an alkaloidal plant compound obtained from the tree Strychnos nux-vomica. The seeds are discs (1 inch diameter, 0.25 inch thick at the rim), with a central depression, gray-green in color, and a satin-like appearance. Pure Strychnine alkaloid is a white powder. COLOR: white, crystalline powder. ODOR: none that is characteristic. SOLUBILITY: soluble in aqueous solutions. TASTE: Strychnine is extremely bitter, with a taste that is detectable at a dilution of 1:100,000. Strychnine could be administered in alcohol, if the victim was used to bitter drinks (tonic water). Strychnine can also be introduced into foods that normally have a sour or bitter taste. SOURCE: rodenticides (concemrations over 0.5% are curremly distributed only to licensed exterminators), sometimes found as an adulterant in illicit drugs. At one time Strychnine was sold over-the-cotmter as an ingredient in a variety of stimulant tonics and laxatives. LETHAL DOSE: 5-8 mg/Kg ? 30-100 mg (oral) ? HOW IT KILLS: respiratory arrest. POISON NOTES: THE VICTIM OF STRYCHNINE ADMINISTERED: food, beverages, medications. 265 Page 6 SYMPTOM ONSET TIME INTERVAL: 15-30 minutes (oral route), 5 minutes (IV or nasal routte). SYMPTOMS - ACUTE: muscle stiffness and painful cramps which precede generalized muscle contractions. The victim's body may take the form of an arch (with only head and heels touching the floor) -- this is called an \"opisthotonic\" convulsion. The face may be drawn into a forced smile or sardonic grin \"risus sardonicus\". The muscle contractions (spasms) are intermittent and can be easily triggered by emotional or physical stimuli (sound, touch, light). Death is usually due to respiratory arrest. SYMPTOMS - CHRONIC: ? DISEASE CONFUSION: grand real seizures, tetanus. VICTIM NOTES: Strychnine does NOT cause true seizures, and the patient is awake and painfully aware of the contractions. THE DETECTION OF STRYCHNINE SPECIMENS: food, beverages, medications, blood, urine, gastric contents, autopsy organ specimens. METHOD: colorimetry, ultra-violet (UV) spectrophotometry, 61 NOTES: SELECTED STRYCHNINE HOMICIDE CASES Edmunds 1871 Thomas Cream - 1892 Jean-Pierre Vacquier - 1924 Ethel Major - 1934 Floyd Horton - 1937 Patsy Wright Case - 1987 Revised: November 16, 1997 266 Page 7 HOMICIDAL POISONS BIBLIOGRAPHY Ballantyne B, Marrs TC (eds): Clinical and Experimental Toxicology of Wright Pub., Bristol, England, 1987.

And there, distilled in precious drops, stands many a spiced oil...And high on the wall, beneath lock and key, the powers of the Quick and Dead! Little low bottles of blue and green, each with a legend red...From the Borgias' time to the present day, their power has ever been proved and tried! Monkshood blue, called Aconite, and deadly Cyanide! Here is sleep and solace and soothing, of pain - courage and vigour new! Here is menace and murder and sudden death! In these vials of green and blue...Beware of the Powers that never die though men may go their way, The Power of the Drug, for good or ill, shall it ever pass away? (The Road of Dreams, \"In a Dispensary\", 1924, Agatha Christie) NOTE: Dame Agatha Christie, between 1920 and 1975, wrote 85 books (41 of which involved poisons) and 148 short stories (24 of which involved poisons). She held a certificate from the Whorshipful Society of Apothecaries of London, as a \"dispenser\" (assistant pharmacist), That in the mortar - you call it a gum? Ah, the brave tree whence such gold oozings come! And yonder soft phial, the exquisite blue, Sure to taste sweetly - is that poison too? (The Laboratory: Ancient Regime - Robert Browning) When the fatal cup was brought, he [Socrates] asked what it was necessary for him to do. \"Nothing more\", replied the servant of the judges, \"then as soon as you have drunk of the draught, to walk about until you find your legs become weary and afterwards lie down upon your bed\". - (on the death of Socrates, - Plato) She had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison\", it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. - (Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll) I maintain that though you would often in the fifteenth century have heard the snobbish Roman say, in a would-be off-hand tone, \"I am dining with the Borgias tonight\", no Roman was ever able to say, \"I dined last night with the Borgias\". - (And Even Now, Sir Max Beerbohm) Were you enamoured on his copper rings, His saffron jewel, with the toadstone in't? ( \"Fox\", Ben Johnson) Pronounce not the name of I-A-O under the penalty of the peach. (From an Egyptian papyrus - possibly relating to cyanogenic glycosides) Credence and tastynge is used for drede ofpoysenynge all officers yswome and grete othe by 273 chargyne. - (Book of Nature, Russell - dated 1480, it is the earliest allusion to assay cups of the horn of the rhinoceros and the \"unicom\") She drank prussic acid without any water. - (The Tragedy, Richard Harris Barham) Bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him. (Henry_ VI, William Shakespeare) Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will dispearse itself through all the veins That the life-weary talker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. (Romeo and Juliet, William Shakespeare) Put this in any liquid think you will, And drink it off; if you have the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. (Romeo and Juliet, William Shakespeare) Toad, that under cold stone, Days and night went thirty-one Swelter'd venom sleeping got. (Macbeth, William Shakespeare) There was a king reigned in the East: There, when kings will sit to feast, They get their fill before they think With poisoned meat and poisoned drink. He gathered all that springs to birth From the many-venomed earth; For a little, thence to more, He sampled all her killing store; And easy, smiling, seasoned sound, State the king when healths went round. They put arsenic in his meat And stared aghast to watch him eat; They poured strychnine in his cup And shook to see him drink it up: They shook, they stared as white's their shirt; 274 Page 1 POISONERS THROUGHOUT HISTORY I. POISONING IN ANCIENT TIMES A. Prehistoric Man 1. The Medicine Man discovered that his knowledge of special substances conferred on him a position of privilege and authority in his tribe. This was reinforced by associating with certain magicrites and charms, which produced a halo of mystery around his actions. 2. Logical beginnings came the magician, sorcerer, poisoner, physician, pharmacist, and toxicologist. B. The Surnerians (-4500 BC) GULA - the earliest deity associated with poison was the \"Mistress of Charms and Spells\" & \"Controller of noxious poisons\". C. The Egyptians 1. King Menes (-3000 BC) - studied plant properties. 2. \"Pronounce not the name of LA. O. under the penalty of the peach \". From the Ebers Papyrus, this is thought to refer to cyanogenic glycosides. 3. The Egyptians believed even their gods were susceptible to poisoning: a. RA (the Sun God) nearly died of a snakebite. b. HORUS (son of ISIS) died from a scorpion sting. 4. Psammentius (525 BC), King of Egypt was forced to drink bull's blood which immediately occasioned his death. 5. Zopyrus - a physician of Alexandria, concocted an antidote of 30-50 ingredients. 275 Page 2 D. The Hebrews - had words for some specific poisons: . words for \"Son\" = ergot 2. The witches of the Old Testament were probably sorcerers and poison vendors. E. The Asian Indians 1. Famous writings on poisons are the Charaka Sambita and the Susruta Sambita, written about 600-100 BC. . It has been suggested that the practice of\"suttee\" or burning of the widow on the death of the husband may have had its origin as a discouragement to conjugal homicide. 3. The Veda, gives the physician specific directions in the detection of poisoners: \"He does not answer questions, or the answers are evasive. He speaks nonsense, rubs the great toe along the ground and shivers. His face is discolored. He rubs the roots of the hair with his fingers and he tries by every means to leave the house. The food which is suspected should be given to animals. It is necessary for the practitioner to have knowledge of the symptoms of the different poisons and their antidotes, as the enemies of the Raja, bad women and ungrateful servants sometimes mix poison with food.\" F. Nicander of Colophon (204-135 BC): 1. Compiled the first poison pharmacopoeia. 2. Physician to Attalus III, King of Pergamum. 3. His favorite antidote: viper parts seasoned with aromatic roots and fruits (ginger, cinnamon, myrrh, iris, & gentian). 4. Wrote two poems on poisons: \"Theriaca\" - 1,000 lines dealing with poisonous animals. \"Alexipharmaca\" - 600 lines dealing with antidotes. 276 Page 3 G. Philon of Tarsus 1. Physician who came up with one of the most celebrated and long-lived potions. 2. Phi[onium H. Mithridates (-100 BC) - King of Pontus 1. Had the reputation of knowing more about poisons and their antidotes than any other man of his time. 2. Invented Mithridatum, a \"universal\" antidote against poisons. I. The Greeks 1. The Greek word \"toxicon\" was used to denote poison, from a word signifying a bow (a poison-tipped arrow). 2. Hecate's Garden - the Greek goddess of witchcraft, and the first to discover the existence of poisonous plants. The first to use aconite. 3. Medea - supposed to have discovered the use ofcolchicum as a poison. 4. Circe - one of the first Great Sorceresses (Homer's Odyssey). 5. The Athenian State Poison - \"Poison Hemlock\" (Conium maculatum), supposedly claimed the following victims: BC Theramenes 362 BC Socrates 402 BC Phocion 317 BC 6. Hippocrates' genuine works contain NO information on criminal poisoning. . Aristotle - described the preparation and use of arrow poisons by the Scythians: \"snakes are left until they decay and the liquid which oozes from them is added to the clear fluid exuded from decomposing blood, and the resulting mixture is smeared on al\"l'o ws\". 8. Galen (born-129 AD) a. Compounded the \"Nut Theriac\" as a remedy against bites/stings and poisons. 277 Page 4 b. Nut Theriac - consisted of: 4 figs + salt + nut and Rum graveolens. [Of the Ruta 20 parts; the inner part of the nut (2 nuts), salt 5 parts, dried fig 2 parts, mixed into a porridge]. J. The Romans 1. As early as 331 BC, according to Livy, there was an outbreak of poisoning in Rome in high circles. 2. Loeusta - poisoner to the Emperor Nero. Nero poisoned his stepbrother Britanicus with cyanide, and also killed his mother and wives likewise. 3. Livia - wife of the Emperor Augustus. Used belladonna. 4. Agrippina - wife of Claudius. Injected poisons into his personal figs. 5. The Emperor Trajan (98-117 AD), decreed that no Wolfsbane was to be grown in domestic gardens. 6. Ovid - refers to Aconite as the \"step-mother's poison\". 7. Sulla in 82 BC issued an edict, the \"Lex Cornelia\", against assassination by poison. This was the first legislative enactment against poisoning. 8. Other poison-minded Roman emperors included: Venetian \"Council ofTen\" - (1419) a. Members carried out murder by poison, for a fee. b. Three recipes for poison are preserved as secreta secretissima in the archives under dates of 1540-44 AD. and Rome had schools for poisoners from the 15 th to the 17 th Centuries. 3. The Borgias (-1455) 278 ~ 5. . . . a. Page 5 Rodrigo Borgia (born 1431), became Pope Alexander VI, he had 5 children including Cesare and Lucrezia. (1) Lucrezia died at 39 years, and probably never killed anyone. (2) Cesare - died at 32 years of age, being responsible for dozens of murders. b. The \"Gift of the Borgia\" C. They used a poison called \"La Cantarella\"- a mixture of arsenic + phosphorus. Believed to have been made as follows: \"A hog was killed with arsenic. Its abdomen was opened and sprinkled with more of the same drug. The animal was then allowed to putrefy. The liquor which trickled from the decaying carcass was collected and evaporated t ~ a powder.\" Most famous victim was Zizin, the son of Sultan Mahomet II, for a price of 300,000 ducats. John of Ragusa (1543), had a price list for doing away with specific officials. The poison \"Venenum Lupinum\" consisted off aconite + Taxus baccata + caustic lime + arsenic + bitter almonds + powdered glass. Mixed with honey and rolled into pills. Madame Giulia Toffana (1650) - made the famous \"Aqua Toffana\", thought to have been a solution of Arsenic trioxide (As203). She is credited with over 600 successful poisonings. Hieronyma Spara (1659) - taught women through her \"Society\" how to murder their husbands with poison. Dispensed her poison in small vials labeled \"Manna of St. Nicholas of Bari\". Catherine de Medici, the Italian bride of Henry II - introduced the methods of the \"Italian School of Poisoners\" into France. a. Her accomplices were the Florentines, Rene Bianco and Cosme Ruggieri b. She is usually credited with the poisonings off Jeanne d' Albret (Queen of Navarre), the Cardinal of Lorraine, Coffe (a marshal of France), and the Duc d'Anjou. 9. Antonio Exili (aka Eggidi) - most notorious maker of poisons in the 17 Th Century. 279 L. The \"French School\" of Poisoners Page 6 M. 1. Marie Madeleine, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers (1670). a. Became acquainted with poisons through her lover, Gaudin de Sainte-Croix, and used: arsenic, sugar of lead, corrosive sublimate, tartar emetic, copper sulfate, and other poisons. b. She experimented on hospitalized patients to test her recipes for effectiveness. c. To gain property she supposedly poisoned her father, two brothers, and a sister. d. She was executed in 1676. 2. Catherine Deshayes (\"La Voisin\") - an arch poisoner, abortionist, and sorceress. a. She was the last of the \"poisoners for hire\". She accepted a commission of 100,000 crowns to poison Louis XIV. She was tried and condemned by the Chambre Ardente, and after torture, was burned at the stake. b. Provided poisons to women in order to get rid of their husbands. One of the poisons was known as \"La Poudre de Succession\", to hasten the succession of rich estates. The powder was supposed to have a base of arsenic but was mixed with aconite, belladonna, and opium. . In the 17 th Century a popular method was for a wife to soak her husband's shirt tail in arsenic, corrosive sublimate, or cantharides, which would produce a violent dermatitis around the perineum and neighboring parts. When a doctor made the diagnosis of syphilis, mercury was ordered; and the wife then gave excessive doses of mercury to poison her husband. . Formation of the \"Chambre Ardente\" (1679-1682), to deal with poisoners. Investigated 442 persons, ordered 367arrests; 36 individuals were executed, 23 banished, and 218 imprisoned. Others 1. Edward Squires - hired by Spain to poison Queen Elizabeth I, in 1596, by smearing opium-based poison on the pommel of her saddle. . Thomas Hickey - in 1776, attempted to assassinate George Washington, by poisoning a dish of green peas. Foiled, he was hanged, becoming the first American traitor executed. 280 Page 7 II.

Commit a crime and the whole world is made of glass. - (Ralph Waldo Emmerson) Poisons and medicine are oftentimes the same substance given with different intents. - (Peter Mere Latham) The coward's weapon, poyson. - (Sicelides, Phineas Fletcher) Difficult as it may be to cure, it is always easy to poison and kill. - (Philosophy of Medical Science, Elisha Bartlett) He feasts secure on mushrooms fine as those Which Claudius for his special eating chose Till one more fine provided by his wife Finished at once his feasting and his life. (Gifford) Through this rose which the spell-breather had given him Fear overmastered the foe and he gave up the ghost. That one by treatment expelled the poison from his body, While this one died of a rose from fear. (Treasury_ of Secrets, Nizami) Take then the antidote the Gods provide The plant ] give through all the direful power Shall guard thee and avert the evil hour. (Odyssey, Homer) Passion often makes fools of clever men; sometimes even makes clever men of fools. - (La Rochefoucauld) \"POISON\" - any substance in relatively small quantities can cause death or illness in living organisms by chemical action. The qualification \"by chemical action\", is necessary because it rules out suck_effects as those produced by a small quantity of lead entering the body at high velocity. - (Scientific American) \"TOXICOLOGY\" - a noun, (from the Greek for \"I never liked dogs\"). Animal testing based on the premise that if something makes a dog sick, it isn't good for humans. It ignores the obvious corollary that humans should therefore thrive by drinking from rain puddles and eating dead possum at the roadside. - (Journal oflrreDroducible Results) 327 What is there that is not poison, all things are poison and nothing [is] without poison. Solely the dose determines that a thing is NOT a poison. - (\"Third Defense\", Paracelsus, 1564) When you consider what a chance women have to poison their husbands, it's a wonder there isn't more of it done. - (Kim Hubbard) One man's mate is another man's poison. There's one thing in favor of drinking poison: it never becomes a habit. Justice, while she winks at crimes, Stumbles on innocence sometimes. (Hudibras, Samuel Butler) Murder, like talent, seems occasionally to run in families. (The Psychology of Common Life, George Henry Lewes) Sleeping within mine orchard, My custom always in the afternoon, Upon my secure hour they uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of mine ears did pour ' The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body; And witha sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body. (Hamlet, Act I, Scene 5, lines 59-73, William Shakespeare) Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd; all murder'd. - (King Richard II, William Shakespeare) Revolted by the odious crime of homicide, the chemist's aim is to perfect the means of establishing proof of poisoning so that the heinous crime will be brought to light and proved to the magistrate who must punish the criminal. - (Matthew J.B. Orfila, Traite de toxicologic, 1814) 328 MARTHA: Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoonful of arsenic, and add a halfa teaspoonful of strychnine, and then just a pinch of cyanide. - (Arsenic and Old Lace, Joseph Kesselring) Mr Pugh Here is your arsenic dear, And your weedkiller biscuit, I've throttled your parakeet, I've spat in the vases, I've put cheese in the mouseholes. Here's your... [door creaks open] tea, dear. (Under Milkwood, Dylan Thomas Of all forms by which human nature may be overcome the most detestable is that of poison, because it can of all others be the least prevented either by manhood or forethought. - (Mr. Justice Avory, at the trial of Jean Pierre Vaquier, 1924) Every murderer is probably somebody's old friend. - (Agatha Christie) Then the defenceless state of the victim, who unconsciously receives from professedly friendly hands the deadly draught or poisoned food, or is unknowingly made the instrument of his own destruction, makes us furious against this violation of every principle of manliness and fair play, deprives the poisoner of every speak of sympathy, and makes us consider him an enemy of the human race, at whose detection and punishment every one rejoices. - (Davies. Liverpool Lit. & Philosophical Society, 1876-77) Poison has a certain appeal...It has not the crudeness of the revolver bullet or the blunt instrument. - (Murder With Mirrors, Agatha Christie) Poison is a woman's weapon...There must be many secret woman poisoners -- never found out. (Cards on the Table, Agatha Christie) If all those buried in our cemeteries who were poisoned, could raise their hand, we would probably be shocked by the numbers! - (John Trestrail) Murder is first conceived in the heart. But if it remains there -- as it often does -- it is no crime, though it may well be a sin. Is the acceptance of the idea of murder as a possible means of getting what one wants that is the decisive step. For most normal and sane people the idea is still-born. They smile to themselves and say \"What am I thinking of?.\" The thought passes, and is lost in the limbo of forgotten fantasy. But if the thought is not forgotten? If it recurs? If it is first half-accepted and then embraced? From this point we have a woman who intends to murder and 329 we pass to the field of strategy and tactics. (Gerald Sparrow). Alone in the hissing laboratory of his wishes, Mr. Pugh minces among bad vats and jeroboams, tiptoes through spinneys of murdering herbs, agony dancing in his crucibles, and mixes especially for Mrs. Pugh a venomous porridge unknown to toxicologists which will scald and viper through her. (Under Milk Wood, Dylan Thomas) 330 TH8, TO IC cIIg GS by John H. Trestrail, III, RPh, ABAT From the grave, if lips could speak the person who was, pleads -- you must seek the individual who had my trust, and thru deceit and cunning into grave did thrust this body once alive and well, now silenced by death, who cannot tell my death was NOT what all thought then, for a poison brought my life to end! Avenge me now, for you alone can find the truth beneath this stone. Look close and the clues you'll see that tell the tale of what killed me. For you must tell all others now, that this was MURDER -- and tell them how! For if no one looks to find what's here, an injustice was done to a life so dear. If now only you could hear, my muted pleading to make wants clear. ~ I'd speak as plain as it could be. Since I can't -- YOU must AVENGE ME! 331 mile by John H. Trestrail, III, RPh, ABAT ~- ,. The Borgias, DeMedicis, and all those past -- you may have thought you had seen the last. But, we poisoners are still around today, and if you miss my crime, I'll get away. The body lies there neat and dean, as the cause of death is seldom seen. And the Coroner may take time to pause -- \"is this death due to a natural cause?\" I An autopsy or tox screen may reveal death's why, but I hope the case will just slip by. My crime is quiet and well thought through. For you're used to violence -- can I fool you? The event's rarity is on my side, for I count on you burying my homicide. And though I roam free 'round the nation, I live in fear of an exhumation. The clues I leave may be hard to find, you see, to me, I have a superior mind. My weapons are there before your eyes, but they are so very small -- of molecular size. I don't think you'll have a notion, for mine is murder in slow motion. It gives me time to just slip by, and create my perfect alibi. Where to look for me isn't dear. I may be far, or I may be near. I could be a stranger, though it is quite rare, for I'm probably related to the victim there. I chose the place, the means, and time, for poisoning is usually a household crime. The knowledge gained by my living close, made it so very easy to deliver the dose. Seeing it as poisoning would be profound, but I think you'll miss it as you look around. I'm a different kind of killer as you can see. I am a POISONER -~ can you catch me? 332 m % k. ar i @ V,. S No matter how hard we try to solve a poisoning homicide- sometimes \\ the Dragon wins! 333 Page 1 CRIMINAL POISONING - Forensic Toxicology - I. INTRODUCTION Homicide by poisoning is one of the most difficult types of cases to prove for the death investigator and medical expert. A. Rarely encountered? = -3-6% of known homicides B. Often, no visible signs of trauma. 1. Bullets leave holes, knives leave cuts, clubs leave bruises, but the poisoner covers the murder with a blanket of invisibility! 2. Important clues are usually buried with the victim. C. Poisons are OFFENSIVE weapons NOT DEFENSIVE weapons. D. Crime scene may seem nonexistent. II. THE POISON A. Definitions - a legal definition is difficult. . POISON [Paracelsus. 1564] - \"What is there that is not poison, all things are poison and nothing (is) without poison. Solely the DOSE determines that a thing is NOT a poison.\" . POISON - \"a substance which exerts a deleterious (and ultimately fatal) effect by virtue of its chemical action, even when it is administered in relatively small quantities, usually <one ounce (30 grams).\" . POISON [Blakiston, 1979] - \"a substance that in relatively small doses, has an action, when it is ingested by, injected into, inhaled or absorbed by, or applied to a living organism, that either destroys life or impairs seriously the functions of one or more organs or tissues.\" . POISON [WA Dorian& 1985] - \"any substance which when injected, inhaled or absorbed, or when applied to, injected into, or developed within the body, in relatively small amounts, by its chemical action may cause damage to structure or disturbance of function.\" 335 B. Characteristics of the ideal poison: Page 2 1. Tasteless - easier to administer 2. Odorless - easier to administer 3. Colorless - easier to administer 4. Readily soluble (in water, etc.) - easier to administer 5. Delayed onset of action - allows for alibi 6. Undetectable - less likely to be caught 7. Exotic - less likely to be looked for 8. Low-dose lethality - easier to administer 9. Easily obtained (not traceable) - allows for alibi 10. Chemically stable - easier to store 11. Mimics a natural disease - less likely to be suspected C. Poison's advantages over more traditional weapons 1. Invisible (\"stealth\") weapon. . . Chemical \"bomb\" - thus, a bomber's profile could show some similarities with the homicidal poisoner: a. white, male b. average to above intelligence c. underachiever d. inadequate personality e. non-athletic f. cowardly g. neat & orderly h. meticulous i. loner j. careful planner k. non-confi'ontational (physically or psychologically) No trauma or visible signs - body kills itself physiologically by a chemical short circuit. Allows the design of the symptoms exhibited by the chemical and toxicological nature of the poison. 4. Victim has no protection: must eat, drink, & breath! 5. No noise like a gun - a supreme silencer. 6. Precise victim targeting - innocent bystanders won't get hurt. 336 Page 3 7. Easy to overcome a physically, or mentally, stronger person by invading their defense zone. 8. Physically or psychologically non-confrontational. 9. If the attempt is unsuccessful - a chance to try again. The Victim is NOT even aware that a first attempt was made. 10. Unlikely to be disarmed and used against the Offender. 11. Weapon most likely overlooked at the crime scene. 12. Makes murder look like suicide, or suicide look like murder! 13. No gore for the squeamish. 14. Depersonalizes the murder. In their mind, the POISONER sets the trap, but the VICTIM actually springs it. \"Chemical monkey wrenches\" - like a wrench in the engine of a car disrupts the proper running, the chemical molecule disrupts the proper running of the body's biochemical processes. The molecule can be carefully selected to disrupt a specific process: 1. Inflammation - irritant chemicals (acids) 2. Enzyme inhibition - heavy metals (As, Sb, Pb, T1) 3. Receptor site interference in the ANS, CNS, & other sites (atropine, botulism, hyoscyamine, strychnine) 4. Lethal synthesis - chemicals (Monofluoroacetate \"1080\") 5. Essential organ necrosis - chemicals (Mushroom amatoxins) 6. Lipid peroxidation - chemicals (Carbon tetrachloride) 7. Neoplasia - carcinogenic chemicals (Benzene) 8. Pharmacological effects - multiple chemical substances How do poisons kill? D. E. 337 Page 4 1. Central Nervous System (CNS) effects: a. Depression causes coma. b. Loss of the respiratory drive (respiratory arrest). c. Loss of reflexes protecting the airway (1) Flaccid tongue obstructs the airway. (2) Aspiration of gastric contents into the bronchial tree. 2. Cardiovascular (circulatory) effects: a. Hypotension (low blood pressure) from decreased cardiac contractions. b. Hypovolemia from loss of fluids. c. Peripheral vascular collapse. d. Cardiac arrhythmias. 3. Cellular hypoxia (lack of Oxygen) - due to a breakdown in the normal transport of Oxygen. 4. Seizures: a. Muscle hyperactivity (1) Hyperpyrexia (increase in body temperature) (2) Kidney failure resulting from destruction of muscle tissue (deposition of myglobin in the kidneys). b. Pulmonary aspiration c. Brain damage from lack of Oxygen 5. Other (e.g. destruction of vital organs): a. Lung destruction - Paraquat (herbicide) b. Liver destruction - Acetaminophen (APAP), Amatoxins (mushrooms) 338 Page 5 F. Poison profiles: NOTE: for the common homicidal poisons, see supplemental handout, Profiles of Common Homicidal Poisons, by JI-I Trestrail. 1. Form 2. Color 3. Odor 4. Solubility 5. Taste 6. Source 7. Lethal dose 8. How it kills 9. How it is administered 10. Symptom onset time interval 11. Symptoms - acute exposure 12. Symptoms - chronic exposure 13. Disease state confused with 14. Victim notes 15. Specimens 16. Detection method 17. Toxic levels 18. Analysis notes 19. Selected homicide cases G. Poison equivalents to the weight of a \"dime\" =2,600 mg: Thallium 1,000 milligrams 2 milligrams Arsenic 200 H. Number of MOLECULES\" a Based on \"Avogadro's Number\" of 6.02 x 1023 molecules per gram molecular weight (GMW) of a substance: 339 POISON P~e6 GRAM MOLECULAR WEIGHT # MOLECULES Amatoxin (mushroom) 900.00 10 10 ~8 Arsenic 74.92 1,607 x 10 Js Botulinus 10 ~ Compound \"1080\" 100.03 4,213 x 10 ~8 Cyanide 26.02 4,627 334.45 180 10 TM Thallium 204.37 2,946 x 10 TM NOTE: 10 TM = one billion billions! Thus, Cyanide has 4,627 billion billions atoms in a LETHAL DOSE of 200 milligrams. This represents a lot of \"chemical firepower\" for a few cents worth of a substance: at a cost of $14/pound, this pound of chemical represents 2,270 LETHAL DOSES, or 0.6 cents per LETHAL DOSE, or 1.7 LETHAL DOSES for a cost of one penny. Cheaper than bullets (a 9mm round costs -$0.40 -- thus, for the same price one can purchase ~68 lethal doses of Cyanide)! I. Poisoner's access to knowledge/poison (which comes first?): 1. Access to KNOWLEDGE about the poison a. Educational background: chemistry, pharmacology b. Printed media: books, manuals, magazines, newspapers c. Workplace: labels, manuals, MSDSs d. Visual media (movies, TV) - life imitating art e. Computers - Internet, World Wide Web f.. Word of mouth 2. Access to the POISON a. Laboratories (1) Industry 340 Ill. A. Page 7 (2) Medical (3) Educational facilities b. Hobby chemicals: photography, jewelers c. Antique drug/chemical bottles: flea markets dl \"Underground\" catalogues THE POISONER Poisoner types - based on victim specificity and degree of planning involved (classification method by Trestrail): 1. \"Type S\" - specific victim a. Group \"S\" - ~ planned crime, with a carefully selected poison. Example - a woman mad at her husband, goes to the library, reads about a particular poison, procures the chemical, and decides the best manner of administration to the victim. (Type S/S) b. Group \"Q\" - ~ made decision, with a poison selected as a weapon of opportunity. Example - a woman mad at her husband, while preparing dinner, quickly takes a can of herbicide from storage and adds it to his food. (Type S/Q) 2. \"Type R\"- random victim a. Group \"S\" - slowl~ planned crime, with a carefully selected poison. Example - a tamperer intent on industrial blackmail, adulterates a food/drug with a carefully selected poisonous substance. Also includes terrorists. (Type R/S) b. Group \"Q\" - quickly made decision, with a poison selected as a weapon of opportunity. Example - an employee upset with his employer picks up a toxic substance and adulterates the batch of food/drug with which he has access. (Type R/Q) 341 B. Page 8 3. Watch out for the \"Camouflaged\" poisoner! (\"Type S\" as \"Type R\") Example - an offender poisons his spouse by tempering with her medication, then places similar tampered containers into a retail store, to make the death of the victim appear to be a random act, due to the work of a product tamperer. RECORDED \"CAMOUFLAGED\" CASES chocolates in confectioner's shop - 1 child victim. Specific target = wife of the man who thwarted her affection. Ronald Clark O'Bryan, Pasadena, Texas, 1974: Cyanide tampered Halloween candy - 1 victim, 3 attempts. Specific target = son. Stella Nickell, Auburn, Washington, 1986: Cyanide tampered Excedrin capsules - 2 victims. Specific target = wife. Joseph Meling, Tumwater, Washington, 1991: Cyanide tampered Sudafed 12-hour capsules - 2 victims. Specific target = wife. Paul Agutter, Athelstaneford, Scotland, 1994: Atropine tampered tonic water - 8 attempts (no deaths). Specific target = wife. Poisoner myths: 1. Most poisoners are female. a. In actuality the majority of poisoners that have been detected have been male. b. Are females more successful are getting away with the crime? c. It could be the favorite weapon of the female murderer! An analysis of the 49 women executed for murder in Great Britain from 1843-1890, shows: (1) Motive - 22 (45%) were motivated by money, 10 (20%) were motivated by sexual triangles, 17 (35%) the motive was unclear. (2) Weapon - 29 (59%) of the women used poison. Arsenic was used by 23 (79%) of the poisoners. 342 . Page 9 For every poison there is an emergency antidote! There are only about five FDA approved drugs which make a life and death difference in the poisoning emergency: 9 ~ ::~IDOTE : i : .i. Atropine Cyanide Antidote Package (Lilly) Epinephrine Naloxone Oxygen POISON Organophosphates: nerve gases, insecticides Cyanide Allergic shock Opiates, narcotics Carbon monoxide 3. There is a perfect undeteetable poison! a. If there was such an undetectable substance how would we ever know it existed? If it has a name someone must have detected it at least once! b. If poisoning is suspected, and the analytical experts are given proper guidelines, almost every toxic chemical can be identified. c. The problem is NOTthe perfection of the poison, but the imperfection of the analytical process. C. Poisoner schematic 1. Why does the murderer select poison as the means of getting to the goal? a. An invisible weapon. b. A sort of chemical bomb. c. Allows completion of the assault without physical confrontation with the victim. 2. An intelligent-coward. D. Poisoner thought processes: All MEANS--> OPPORTUNITY--> DETECTION E. Poisoner's profile - the psychology of the poisoner: 343 Page 10 1. Has an absolute defiance of legal authority. 2. Refuses to accept any moral basis for life. Kills in order to gain: emotionally or materially. 3. Has/had an unfortunate married life. 4. Childhood has usually been one of two classes: a. Spoiled by parents (1) Poisoning is the most childish of all the criminal acts. (2) Turns the victim into an object with no feelings. b. Reared in unhappy homes 5. Has/had an abnormal life with: wife, children, and home. 6. Most have failed to make any kind of impression on life. a. High proportion are daydreamers and fantasists. b. Usually have a touch of the artistic temperament. Able to design and set up the murder scene like a theatrical production. 7. High proportion have connections with the medical world: a. Physicians b. Nurses c. Pharmacists d. Dentists e. Other health care workers f. Laboratory workers - familiar with chemicals 8. Possesses vanity, and thinks he/she cannot be discovered. Carefully calculates the odds and believes can get away with the crime. 9. Possesses limited mind: without sympathy. 344 Page 11 a. Childish personality: immature desire for own way, dreamy, romantic disposition. b. Something in the poisoners that keeps them permanently immature. They never seem to grow up. c. They try and make the world obey their will by cheating it in minor ways, and thereby stealing what it refuses to give them. d. They are: weak, cowardly, and avaricious. F. Motives for murder - NOT much different from other homicides: 1. Money - insurance, tampering 2. Elimination - goal-blocker, political, etc. = \"A 1,000 Ways to Kill Your Lover\" 3. Jealousy - \"lover's triangle\" 4. Revenge - make them pay 5. Sadism - make them suffer 6. Conviction - political motives (assassination, terrorism) 7. Boredom - wants to have fun, challenge of wits 8. Ego - belief in mental superiority G. Public perception of the poisoner: 1. Public have a special hatred for his/her sinister nature. 2. Poison is considered the \"coward's weapon\", because it is administered unemotionally and by stealth, often little by little over a long period of time, and in full recognition of the victim's often prolonged suffering. 3. Reviled for his/her lack of pity. H. The \"Toxicomaniac\" (lover/collector of poisons) 1. Like gun or knife collector. 345 I. J. Page 12 2. Gives a sense of power. 3. Prime example - England's Graham Frederick Young MO vs. SIGNATURE 1. MO - learned behavior that may change through trial-and-error method. 2. SIGNATURE - should NOT be found with poisoners. It reflects the offender's personality (calling card). Repetitive behavior, with little changes. Not necessary to complete the crime. An analysis of actual homicidal poisoning cases: 1.

Classes of poisoning murders: 1. Suicidally motivated parent Wants to take the children with them (example: use of Cyanide on the Goebbels' children, Berlin, 1945). 2. Unintentional homicidal poisoning = manslaughter a. Drug abuse overdose (example: John Belushi) b. Sexual arousal (example: use ofcantharides by Arthur Ford, England, 1954). c. Behavior modification - black pepper deaths in children. d. \"Munchansen Syndrome by Proxy\" - mentally ill parent administers poison to child to draw attention to themself. The offender gets some psychological reward from having doctors listen and begins to exaggerate symptoms. 348 B. . 2. Page 15 (1) Offender usually a mother. (a) Usually come from a background where they were ignored & unrecognized. (b) Some have histories of being abused themselves. (c) Many consider the relationship they had with their obstetrician the most intense, personal, and rewarding they ever had. They then transfer the role to the pediatrician. (d) Many have some nursing training, or a history of weaving false tales of medical tribulations. (2) Must be considered child abuse. (3) Father is usually oblivious or in subconscious collusion. 3. Euthanasia of the elderly and terminally ill. a. Nursing homes b. Terminally ill patients - at home (1) Dr. Jack Kevorkian's process (2) Final Exit - the guidebook (3) The \"Hemlock Society\" 4. Intentional homicidal poisoning - the emphasis of this discussion = murder in the 1 s' degree. Indices of poisoning: Suspicious friends/relatives. Suspicious circumstances. a. Sudden death after eating, drinking, or going into the bathroom. b. Poison containers found near the deceased. 349 Page 16 3. Antemortem clinical course - confusion is very easy! \"Most signs and symptoms associated with natural disease can be produced by some poison, and practically every sign and symptom observed in poisoning can be mimicked by those associated with natural diseases.\" [L. Adelson] 4. Research conducted in 1958, indicated that 10% of homicides go unsuspected! 5. When autopsy results were compared to death certificates, there was found to be an error rate of-50% in the cause of death as indicated on the certificates. C. Poison lesions and their pathogenesis: 1. No morphological changes are present which can be attributed to direct chemical action by the toxic agent. a. Acute CNS depressants (alcohols, Organo-phosphate insecticides (OPI) d. Alkaloids (Strychnine, Opiates) 2. Systemic lesions are produced without creating injury at the portal of entry. a. Arsine b. Nitrobenzene 3. Injury is present at portal of entry without remote or systemic evidence of direct cell damage. a. Immediate cellular necrosis (corrosives) b. Gaseous irritants (Chlorine, Sulfur dioxide) 4. Local and systemic injuries are present. Heavy metals (Mercuric chloride, Arsenic) D. Classic clues to poisoning: 1. Hair loss - heavy metals (Arsenic, Antimony, Thallium) 2. Fever - body defenses are active 350 V. Page 17 3. Constricted pupils (\"miosis\") - opiates, Organophosphate Insecticides (OPI), etc. 4. Dilated pupils (\"mydriasis\") - atropine, hyoscyamine, insulin, cocaine, nicotine, etc. 5. Odor - some poisons have characteristic odors 6. Oral burns - caustics and corrosives (acids and alkalies (e.g. Sodium hydroxide = Lye) 7. Gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea) - many poisons, especially the heavy metals 8. Skin color - cherry-red color of Carbon monoxide, blue color (cyanosis) from Nitrites (methemoglobinemia) 9. Vomiting - due aconite, acids, alkalies, colchicine, cantherides, Phosphorus, Mercury, Iodine, etc.) 10. Injection tracks - from multiple administrations of poisons by parenteral route 11. Skin speckling - cased by repeated doses of Arsenic (look like raindrops) 12. Stomach cramps - a classic sign of chronic poisoning 13. Brittle nails - heavy metals can change the nail structure. Also look for Mees' lines 14. Convulsions - strychnine, OPI, camphor, cyanide, etc. 15. Coma - opiates, hypnotics, sedatives, CO, CO2, ethanol, phenols, etc. 16. Paralysis (general or partial) - botulism, cyanide, Thallium, Arsenic, etc. TIlE CRIME SCENE - Never forget \"chain of custody\"! A. Crime scene investigation: 1. Victimology a. Why was the person targeted? b. Get a complete history of the victim, 2. Crime scene indicators - the VICTIM itself is the most prominent crime scene! . Page 18 a. How many crime scenes? Usually more than one! (1) Where the victim is FOUND = vomitus, clothes (2) Where the poison is ADMINISTERED = medicine bottles, food/beverages (3) Where the poison is DISPOSED = storage areas, trash (4) Where the poison is PREPARED = tools, utensils, clothes, containers (5) Where the poison is PROCURED -- stolen, receipts, purchased, poison register b. Environment/place/time? c. How many offenders? Majority = single offender on a single victim. d. Organized/disorganized/physical evidence? (l) Organized characteristics (a) Planned offense (b) Weapon/evidence absent (2) Disorganized characteristics (a) Victim/location known (b) Body left in view (c) Weapon/evidence often present (d) Body left at death scene e. Body disposition? f. Items left/missing? g. Other indicators? h. Watch out for the masking effect of tobacco smoke on unusual odors associated with some poisons. NO SMOKING AT THE CRIME SCENE! Staging = purposeful alteration of the crime scene a. Mostly left in a natural state, except the vehicle for administering the poison may 352 . 5. Page 19 have been removed or cleaned. b. Women are the best at cleaning up the evidence, as they are more familiar with how it should be done properly (domestic abilities): cleaning dishes thoroughly, cleaning up spills and stains, etc. She probably does this cleaning much more efficiently and completely than a male. Forensic findings Investigative considerations a. Interview the first aid responder, as to what the victim looked like before therapy was attempted. b. Was the victim cleaned up? 6. Search warrant considerations a. If the poisoner doesn't think he/she will be suspected, the area of preparation may NOT be cleaned up, as it is the \"den of security\". Why hide something you don't think they will ever look for? b. Must stay within the \"four comers\" of the warrant! Specify specific location, place, & items. c. Must have \"probable cause\" - see Constitution's 4 th Amendment. d. Could be found anywhere! = wastebaskets, sink traps, garbage, work areas e. Most likely will be in small quantity (<200 grams) f. Related items to search for (NOT all inclusive): publications on poisons receipts medical publications recipe cards chemical catalogues diaries/journals g. Other points (1) Read search warrant and affidavit prior to execution of the warrant. 353 B. Page 20 Become very familiar with all details of the proposed search. (2) Leave a copy of the search warrant at each location. (3) Leave a ~, and note date/time of execution and securing of evidence. (4) Maintain a complete and detailed inventory of seized properties. (5) Do NOT consume any edible materials at the site. Poisoning as contrasted with other types of violent deaths: 1. Usually secret, quiet and covert. 2. Usually no visible external signs of violence. 3. Almost always involves careful planning and cool deliberation (the murderer engineers the well conceived opportunity). 4. Murderer is most thoughtfully and seriously concerned with discovery of the crime. 5. Most cunning of the murderers. 6. Murderer possesses a high degree of skill and knowledge of the victim's routine/personal habits. 7. Murderer usually acts alone - thus, no witnesses. 8. Offender kills because he/she really believes can kill and \"get away with it\". 9. Usually an intimate or \"household\" crime. Principles are usually united by close emotional ties (the marital bond being the most common). The victim is defenseless, with no protection. Murderer has a high degree of knowledge of the lethal potentialities of the poison to be used. Least used method of homicide (accounts for 3-6% of known homicide cases). Most difficult homicide to prove. Homicidal poisoning is almost always murder and never manslaughter (unless legally 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 354 C. Page 21 insane), because of premeditation, deliberation, and intent to kill. Investigating a criminal poisoning NOTE: all death investigations should be handled as homicide cases until the facts prove otherwise. Is the poisoning death: accidental, suicidal or homicidal? 1. Questioning the victim - if still alive 2. Questioning the witnesses 3. Essential information a. Location of victim when symptoms first appeared? b. What were the symptoms? c. Did someone give the poison intentionally? (1) Who? (2) What was the motive? d. Did the victim administer the poison him/herself? (1) Accidental? (2) Intentional? (3) What was the reason? e. Who summoned assistance? When? How? f. What did the victim do prior to appearance of symptoms? g. What did the victim eat or drink prior to symptoms? Did the victim abuse any drugs, especially controlled substances (which could have been easily adulterated!)? (1) Where? (2) Food/medication - requested or offered? (3) Who prepared it? (4) Who served it? h. Did any other person consume the same items? 355 Page 22 (1) What is their condition? (2) Did they notice anything peculiar? i. Did the victim notice anything peculiar? j. Was the victim in the habit or consuming the substance in question? k. Was the victim in the habit of consuming any form of alcohol NOT intended for drinking purposes? Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) Methanol (antit~eeze, Sterno) 1. Did the victim eat or drink anything after the symptoms first appeared? m Did the victim take any medicine before the appearance of the symptoms? n. What was the victim's general health condition? o. Was the victim recently unhappy, depressed, jealous, or angry? p. Did the victim have money on his/her person prior to the symptoms, what was the condition of his estate, and did he/she owe large sums of money? q. Who would inherit the victim's estate? (1) Did that person lose money recently? (2) Does he/she gamble? (3) Does he/she handle money in their occupation? r. Did the victim have any recent difficulties with regard to his/her employment? s. Was anyone jealous of the victim because of his/her position? Who will be promoted to the open position? t. Did the victim receive any threatening letters or other communications? (1) Examples: (a) Unsolicited gifts received by mail for birthday or special holidays? (b) Unsolicited sample of new product received in the mail? 356 Page 23 (2) Source? (a) Where are they? (b) Who sent them? u. Did the victim write any letter recently? 4. Investigating the activities of the victim prior to the poisoning event. 5. Ascertain the source of the poison. a. Pure poison? - see \"Poison Register\" at pharmacies b. Commercial products? c. Stolen from place of employment? d. Ordered from chemical supply houses? 6. Collecting the physical evidence (remember \"chain of evidence\"!) a. Remains of food and drink b. Drugs, medicines, chemicals in the home c. Glasses, bottles, spoons, syringes d. Soiled linen, or clothing 7. Product tampering a. Federal Anti-Tampering Act: it is a felony to tamper foods, drugs, devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products. b. Investigational agencies: (1) Prior to 1989, the FDA maintained the \"Elemental Analysis Research Center\", Cincinnati, Ohio. (2) In 1989, the FDA began the \"Forensic Chemistry Center\", Cincinnati, Ohio. c. Points of entry for contamination: (1) During manufacturing -- employee sabotage. (2) During distribution -- product is tampered with and returned to the shelf looking untouched. Frequently the offender has a specific victim in mind, and tries to make the crime look like a random death. 357 Page 24 (3) After purchase -- usually false report cases seeking settlement from the manufacturer. D. Analytical toxicological analyses: 1. Tests do NOT detect all chemical substances! a. Drug screen: Arsenic, Antimony, Thallimn, Lead General Unknown screen: Cyanide, Volatiles, Strychnine, Heavy metals, Drugs 2. Analysis is aided by indication of suspected substances. One can NOT find what one is NOT looking for! 3. Can only indicate the presence & quantity, but NOT the reason for the exposure. 4. Differences in quantitative amount: a. Homicide - usually just the right amount for a lethal dose is given. b. Suicide - usually a massive amount is taken. E. Avoiding detection: 1. Witnesses 2. Evidence 3. Medical - (autopsy) Cremated remains can NOT be analyzed to produce utilizable information. a. Most chemical substances will be burned offat the high temperatures required for incineration. b. Can NOT prove that sample is pure. Could be contaminated with other cremains. c. Would NOT be able to prove that the poison was in systemic circulation. d. Would NOT be able to prove what organ the poison originated in. There would be no basis for comparison (e.g. milligrams of Arsenic per gram of liver). 358 Page 25 e. Chain of evidence is difficult to maintain. F. Things that should arouse an investigator's suspicions! 1. Sudden death in a normally healthy individual. 2. An individual interfered with the victim receiving proper medical attention. 3. No signs of violence to the body. 4. Illness reoccurred in cycles: chronic exposure? 5. Mysterious symptoms in a common group of people. 6. An individual is anxious to dispose of food, drink, or medicine, of which the victim partook. 7. An individual prevented friends or relations being sent for during the illness. 8. Insistence on NO autopsy. 9. Insistence on a rapid cremation. 10. Explanation offered by family member for cause of death. 1 I. Attempts by family member to guide the investigation. 12. An individual shows a familiarity with poisons. G. Forensic autopsy 1. Irritated tissues 2. Odors 3. Mees' lines - heavy metals 4. Toxicological screens a. heavy metals b. volatiles c. common drugs 359 Page 26 5. Specimens for testing (be certain all specimen containers are clean and NOT contaminated!): a. Urine (all available) b. Gastric contents (all available) c. Blood (heart = 25 ml, peripheral = 10 ml) d. Brain (100 grams) e. Liver (100 grams) f. Kidney (50 grams) g. Bile (all available) h. Vitreous humor (all available) i. Hair/nails VI. PROVING THE POISONING CRIME A. Detection - the role of Analytical Toxicology. 1. The \"shot gun\" approach to detection will most likely NOT be successful. 2. The analysts need some guidelines to what compounds are suspected. a. Crime scene b. Autopsy - pathological findings 3. Cardiac blood may differ from peripheral blood in the quantitative analyses. 4. Get qualified Medical Examiner on the case immediately! B. Discovery - proving legally that a crime was committed, and demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that death was caused by poison, administered with malicious/evil intent to the deceased. C. Motive - the instigating force responsible for carrying out the action. D. latent - the purpose or aim behind the commission of the act (the hoped for or desired outcome). E. Proof - that the accused had access to the poison responsible for the death. 1. Proof of sale - (receipts, poison registers) 2. Proof of access at work place, occupation, or hobby 360 Page 27 F. Proof- that the accused had access to the victim. 1. To administer the poison directly or indirectly 2. Original packings or wrappers, associated to suspect G. Proof - that the death was caused by poison - sufficient sound evidence as would induce a reasonable person to come to this conclusion. 1. In order to prove death by poison, the presence of the poison in the systemic circulation and/or body organs must be made! . The presence of the poison only in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract does NOT prove death by poisoning. The GI from mouth to anus is like a garden hose - hollow, and open at both ends, and \"outside\" the topological frame of the body. 3. The poison must be absorbed through the walls of the gut and enter the body's systemic circulation. 4. Chain of evidence MUST be maintained! H. Proof - that the death was homicidal. This can NOT be done analytically or by autopsy, but depends on the work of the criminal investigator at the crime scene and examination of witnesses! Must exclude categorically: 1. Accident 2. Intentional abuse 3. Suicide 4. Homicide I. Proofs necessary for a conviction! 1. The death was caused by poison: a. Chemical analyses b. Pathological exam 2. The accused administered the poison to the deceased a. Opportunity 361 VII. Page 28 b. Possession c. No other person was possible or probable 3. The accused was aware of the poison's lethality THE POISONER ON TRIAL A. The poisoner defense 1. The best defense? The simplest answer that explains the facts! 2. Defenses a. Death was by another cause. b. Death was NOT homicidal. C. Death was NOT the intended outcome. d. Definition = substance is NOT a poison. e. Reasons for possession of poison: (1) Job/hobby related (2) Pesticide (domestic) B. Poison conviction problems: 1. Evidence is circumstantial (indirect). 2. No witnesses. C. 3. Scientific evidence in dispute, and rebutted by other technical experts. 4. The \"legal definition\" of the poison can be a problem. 5. The \"CONIqCTIONPYRAMID\" - (four points that need to be proven to be connected): a. Victim b. Poison c. Poisoner d. Motive Battery by Poison 1. One may commit a battery by causing injury through poisoning. 362 Page 29 2. Battery may result when a person is injured in a dangerous situation intentionally created by the defendant. 3. A defendant is held to be culpable in a battery charge if he acts with either an intent to injure or with criminal negligence. . \"Aggravated battery\", punishable as a felony, results from actions taken with the intent to kill. Usually, the defendant must have intended to cause the specific result; otherwise the crime is considered a \"regular battery\" charge. VIII. CONCLUSION - \"The game is afoot\" - (Sherlock Holmes) A. Unless we remain ever vigilant, we will loose the game! B. Unless poisoning is considered in the first place, the evidence will most likely be buried with the victim, and the poisoner will walk offinto the sunset with a feeling of superior intellect and smugness! C. The Prime Directive for criminal investigation! Every death must be considered a HOMICIDE until the facts prove otherwise! D. The Sub-Directive for criminal investigation! Every death, with no visible signs of trauma, must be considered a POISONING until the facts prove otherwise!! E. Putting the clues together -- when all the clues overlap, one will match the offender. 1. WHO? - specific or random target. 2. WHAT? - one must prove poison is systemic! Solid, liquid, or gas, the weapon is a chemical molecule. 3. WHERE? - a poisoning may have multiple crime scenes. 4. WHEN? - time from administration till death? a. Acute dose = sudden onset. Analysis of Blood, Urine, Gastric (= BUG). Look for rapid action (Cyanide, Strychnine) b. Chronic dose = prolonged symptoms. Analysis of hair. Look for heavy metals. 363 Page 30 5. WHY? - victim stood between what goal? 6. HOW? - look at the items the victim used routinely, 364 POISONER SCHEMATIC-- cunning J \" conviction boredom avaricious .\" ~POISON\"-. revenge ego childish-fan tasy .... ~ elimination tampering cowardly ~ + jealousy sadism artistic ~ money [ MURDERE.R. l I (V'c,,\"~I E: ........................ ] -- ,,~mF--= OTHER HOMICIDES shooting \" stabbing bludgeoning rim,, t~ .11 r,~d - mlte.i POISONER THINKING I want something! ~ME-ANd] ~lcan remove obstacle to goal. l I have access to knowledge I have access to poison OPPORTUNITY -oETE-c-,~ 4 ,---,-''-[ ............................................. ] ....................

Poisoning homicides have remained among the most difficult crimes to detect and to bring the of. fender to justice (I). The following four eases selected from FBI and police files (2) represent homicides in which the nature of the poisoning homicide was initially missed by criminal and medical investigators, but determined at a later date. CASE REPORTS CASE I In 1980, Audrey Marie Hilley (\"The Black Widow\"), a middle-aged Alabama woman, gained notoriety by using arsenic to murder her husband, and later made a similar attempt on her 19-year- old daughter. The poisoner managed to ~lude cap- ture for 3 years by creating new identities for herself. Hilley subsequently remarried under a new identity, and when she thought she had been dis- covered, faked her own death and returned to her husband as her own twin sister. The death of her first husband was initially attributed to hepatitis. The classification of homicidal poisoning was con- eluded only after the discovery of arsenic in Au- drey Hilley's own daughter. Case Di.rgosition The offender was subsequently convicted and sentenced to Hie in prison for the 1975 murder of her first husband, Frank Hilley, and the 1979 at- tempted murder of her daughter. Audrey Marie Hil- ley died in 1987 while on a 3-day pass from prison to visit her second husband. Case 2 In 1983. Texas-licensed vocational nurse Genene Jones was tried on a single charge of murder, even HOMICIDAL POISONING IN THE U.S. 283 though those who had worked with her believed she had been responsible for the deaths of more \" than a dozen children under her care. As a poi- soner, she used succinylcholine, a powerful muscle relaxant. She was finally jailed in 1982. In her first 31 days of work for a pediatrician, nine incidents of respiratorY arrest involving eight patients oc- curred before Jones was finally arrested. Case Disposition The offender was sentenced to 99 years for the murder of one patient and 60 years for the st- tempted murder of a second. Case 3 In 1988, Blanche Tyler Moore was sentenced to death aRer discovery that while her boyfriend lay in a hospital bed, she was feeding arsenic-laced food to him in the form of peanut butter milk shakes and banana pudding. She was then subse- quently charged wifla the death of her first husband and the poisoning of her estranged husband, who had become sick aRer their honeymoon but sur- vived. Case Dispositinn Moore died by execution Case 4 In 1988, George James Trepal of Florida spiked a neighboring family's Coea Cola bottles with thal- liurn because of his dislike for the family. The poi- son eventually killed Peggy Cart, the mother, aRer she had been hospitalized for a number of weeks and erroneously diagnosed with a nervous system disorder of unknown cause. The poisoner was charged with first degree murder, attempted murder of the other members of '..he family, and product tampering. Cane Disposition TrepaI was sentenced to death and is awaiting execution. sing, and also not infrequently the repetition of the act of administering poison .... [ts characteristic being one of premeditation, it is a method of mur- der which therefore cannot be the subject of exten- uation as some other forms of killing can. Rowland (4) listed the following as characteris- tics ofth~ poisoner, has an unfommate married life, fails to make an impression on life, is connected with the medical world, is vain, possess a mind without sympathy and/or imagination, and is spoiled by his/her parents. Another author, Wilson (5), described One char~'~isfics of the poisoner as weak-willed, a daydreamer, a fantasist, possessing an artistic temperament, cowardly, and avaricious. Are the current percepdo-s of law enforcement and some of the medical profession's smzemenm about a poisoner's characteristics accurate7 When a death investigacor flxinks of a poisoner, the following stereotypes misht come r mind: fe- male, highly intelligent, cowardly, artistic, domes- tic, subtle, and manipulative. When homicidal poisoners and their victims are studied as a group, what relationships and characteristics are, in fact, observed? Other than the published reviews of some fa- mous his:orical poisoning cases, such as the four referred to earlier, little has been wrimm about the characteristics of the poisoner and of his or her vic- tim. A review of international forensic literature did not locate any published epidemiological studies about the criminal investigative analysis or psycho- logical profile of the homicidal poisoner. As a first attempt to give forensic scientists and law enforce- ment personnel a clearer picture of some charac- teristics of poisoning homicide victims and offenders, we believed an analysis of reported poi- sordng homicides might help clarify the most sa- lient characteristics of this kind of killer. Although it is limited in derail, we decided that the most ac- curate statistical document on poisoning homicides is the FBI's Uniform Cr~me Reports (UCR) (6). The period we selected for analysis was the decade 1980 through 1989. CHARACTERIZING THE POISONER Only a few efforts have characterized the poi- soner. The subtlety of the homicidal poisoner was ideally summed up by the toxicologist Olaister (3): Poisoning, of course, differs considerably from many other crimes frequently committed in uncon- trolled passion and in the heat of the moment. The innate character of the crime of homicidal poison- ing demands subterfuge, cunning and, what is equaiIy important, usually a period of carefu/plan- 9 The UCR program has traditionally been used to look for fluctuations in the level of crime and to provide criminologists with statistics for varied re- search and planning. In the US, the UCR is the result of a nationwide, cooperative effort of > 16,000 city, count, and state law enforcement agencies , who voluntarily re- port crimes that come to their auention. In 1991, those law enforcement agencies active in the pro- 388 Am J Forennc M~d Pa~o/. V~l. 17 No, ,#. 1996 284 A. E. WESTVEER ET AL. gram represented 96% of the country's population, some 2,~ I million individuals. The demographic in- formation compiled by UCR contributors is for- warded directly to the FBI from local law enforcement agencies or through a UCR program at the state level. The FBI then edits and reviews each individual agency report for completeness and accuracy. For UCR purposes, criminal homicide and non- negligent manslaughter are defined as the willful (normegligent) killing of one human being by an- other. The classification is based solely on police reports, as opposed to the determination of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other judicial body. Not included in the reports are deaths caned by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable horn- icicles; and attempts to murder or assaults to m, tr- der, which are scored as aggravated assaults. METHOD For this study, the total number (202,785) of UCR homicides in the US for the 10 years from 1080 through 1989 were computer analyzed to yield demographic data on crimes in which a chem- ical (nondrug) poison or a drug/narcotic was used by an offender for homicidal purposes. Any substance taken in extreme amounts can be lethal. Even water, in excessive amounts, can cause death by creating an electrolyte imbalance or hy- ponatremia. Certain substances are known to be toxic (e.g., arsenic, cyanide) and require very small amounts \"o cause death. The dose -,done determines what is a poison. This search was conducted by using specific UCR codes identifying every case within the da- tabase in which chemical (nondrug) poison or a drug/narcotic was a weapon for homicidal pur- poses. if obtainable, after the percentage for the poi- soning homicide criterion in the database will be the notation {AN%}, which represents a corre- sponding percentage value for the poisoning crite- lion compared to \"all homicides.\" To tained fi-om a sample of UCR homicide reports by averaging the published UCR homicide data for the years 1980, 1985, and 1989. Those data represented values from the beginning, middle, and end of the decade, as published in the annual report Crfme in the U~ted Stares. RESULTS Of\" the 202,785 UCR-listed homicides in the US tbr the decade studied, 292 (0.14%) or 14 per 10,000 were homicidal poisonings involving a sin- gle victim and a Single offender. Criminal investigators approach a crime to an,. swer the basic questions of Who?, What?, Where?. How?. The results of this dem- ographic study have been grouped together into these same investigative categories. Because of rounding to the nearest whole percentage, percent- ages may not total 100. Demographic information relating to race and gender are shown in Tables I through 4. Poisoning Victim Gender Versus Offender Gender Victims of homicidal poisonings were almost equally divided between male and female genders as seen in Table I. If the victim was a female, the offender was predominantly a male. If the victim was a male, the offenders were almost equally di- vided between males and females. Poisoning Victim Gender Versus Offender Race As shown in Table 2, whether the victim was male or female, the poisoning offender was pre- dominantly of the white race. Far fewer black of. fenders were involved with male or female victims. The rate of unknown poisoning offenders compared to all other unknown homicide offenders was 20 to 30 times higher, probably because there were no wimesses to the crime and therefore no helpful clues to offender identification. Poisoning Victim Race Versus Offender Race It appears typical that homicidal poisonings with identified offenders have not crossed racial lines; predominantly, the offender had the same racial background as the victim. Poisoning Victim Race Versus Offender Gender For poisoning homicides involving known of_ fenders, as in Table 4, whites were predominantly the victims of a male offender, blacks were almost equally the victims of male and female offenders, and people of other racial backgrounds were pre- dominantly the victims of female offenders. Poisoning Victim Race Versus Victim Gender By race, blacks were victims of poisoning hom- icides at a rate almost one third that for all homi- cides on black victims. By gender, black males were victims almost twice as often as black fe- males. White victims were almost equally divided between males and females. Victims of other racial backgrounds were females three times as often as males. 389 HOMICIDAL POISONING IN THE U.S. 285 TABLE 1. Victim genOer/offender gender Victim gender UCR no.

Poisoning Offender Race Venus Offender Gender By race, black poisoning offenders were 'males almost twice as often as females. White poisoning offenders were almost twice as often males as fe- males. By gender, the result that 49~ of the poisoning offenders were male, compared to 22% female of. fenders, might challenge the popular perception that poisons are primarily used by female offend- ers. Note that the gender of 29% of the offenders remains unknown. Age of Poisoning Victims The victims' ages ranged from one aged <1 week to 13 aged >75 years. The age range for the greatest number of victims was 20 to 34 years, which constituted 140 (48%) of the victims. The age of the victim was unknown in 4 (1%) of the homicides. Age of Poisoning Offenders The offenders' ages ranged from two offenders in the t0 to 14 year range, to seven who were 275 years. The group aged 20 to 34 years accounted for 102 (35%) of the offenders. The age of the offender was unknown in 85 (29%) of the homicides. Relaflonsldp of Polsoelng Victim to Offender Homicide carried out on a v~cdm who was re- ]ated to the offender accounted for 100 (34%) of the poisonings. \"]'be four most frequent relation~ ships with/n the family were wife 04 or 12%), son (17 or 6%), husband (16 or 6%), and daughter (14 or 5%). Victims who were outside of the family of the offender accounted for 114 (39%) of the poi- soning homicides. The five most frequent relation- ships outside of the family were acquaintance (57 or 20%), friend (14 or 5%), gill friend (13 or 4%), stranger (12 or 4%), and other (12 or 4%). In \"78 (27%) of the homicides, the victim had an un- known relationship to the offender. For UCR data including the relationship of the offender's victim, slightly more of the victims were outside (39%) than widen the family (34%) of the offender. Poisoning Offender Gender Versus Class of Poison UCR data do not identify the exact kinds of poi- son involved, but only its major classification as chemical (nondrug) or drug/narcotic. Thirty-three (30%) of the female offenders and 49 (45%) of the male offende~ used an u.nspecified chemical (non- druB) poison.

POISON:NG IN THE U.S. 287 F'fG. 1. Homicidal poisonings, arranged by state. of analytical toxicology laboratories in the area, or the workload of local law enforcement and/or fo- rensic pathology personnel. Poisoning Homicide Rate by Population In the US, the rate of poisoning homicides per decade averaged 1.47 per million inhabitants, for the 44 states involved. The five states with the highest rate of poisoning homicides per million in- habitants were California (21.72), Illinois (10.40), Florida (8.29), idaho (3.85), and New Hampshire (2.71). California had a homicidal poisoning rate per million inhabitants 18.7 times the average rate (1.16), compared to the remaining 43 states in the group. Poisoning Homicides by Year and by Month The number of poisoning homicide reports for each year in the decade studied remained relatively constant, mad the number of poisoning homicide reports for each month in that decade remained rel- atively constam. Poisoning Homicides by Circumstance The 112 (38%) homicides whose circumstances were determined had occurred under the following circumstances ~zd involved the following number of victims: rape (2), robbery (2), other sex crime (5), narcotic drug laws (51), other---not specified (13), lover's triangle (6), child killed by baby-sitter (I), brawl influenced by alcohol (I), brawl influ- enced by narcotics (3), other arguments (14), gangland killings (I), and all suspected felony type (20). We cannot determine from UCR data an exact motive in 180 (62%) of the reports; they fall into such general UCR categories as \"Other,'\" \"Other--not specified,\" or \"Unable to determine circ,,lr'~tRBer s. ' ' In only six (2%)' of the reports was the circum- stance related to a \"Lover's wiangle,'\" which seems conlz'afy to the popular pemcption that poi- sons are often used in domestic situations to m- move a \"significant other\" and to allow the offender to achieve a romantic goal. However, because of the large number of reports that fall into the generalized \"nnlmown'\" catego- ries, it is impossible to determine exact motive as related to the relationship of the victim and of- fender. It is interesting that three times as many husbands were victim in the \"Lover's triangle\" as were wives. Also, in two reports, the vicTh-ns were the acquaintances in the \"uiangle.'\" It is not possible from the UCR data to determine how poison was administered. CONCLUSION Because of the tmummi c~cumsmnces of poison cases, this study is limited to those reported cases in which poison was determined by the investigat- ing agency to be the cause of death. Many poison cases are undetected because many of the symp- toms displayed by toxic substances mask them- selves as symptoms of disease.

In the remaining cases, of unknown offender's gender, an unspecified chemical (nondrug) poison was used in 27 ~9%) of homicides, and an unspecified drug in 58 (20%) of homicides. Chemica! (nondrug) poisons were used in a ratio of 1.5: I by male compa_md to female offenders. A drug/narcotic was utilized in a ratio of almost 3:I by maJc offenders compared to female offenders. Poisoning Homicides by Geographic Area From the 292 studied cases, a total of 44 (88%) of the 50 states had poisoning homicides reported for the decade. The five states with the most cases, accounting for a total of 129 (44%) of the reported homicides, were California (66 or 23%), Texas ([ 9 or 7%), New York (16 or 5%), North Carolina (15 or 5%), and Michigan (13 or 4%). The six statvs that had no UCR poisoning homicide reports for the decade were Delaware, Hawaii, Montana, South Dakota, Vermont, and Utah. Analyzing the 292 poisoning homicide reports by geographic regio: of the United States gave the following results Northeast (48 or 16%) {AH 17%}, South (103 or 35%) {AH 21%}. Figure 1, a map of the United States, shows the geographic dismbution of homicidal poisonings by state ant region. Homicidal poisonings have occurred throughout almost the entire coumtry, with 44%, as noted, re- ported from only five states. The reason for this higher incidence fi'om the states and regions could not be ascertained from the UCR data, but specu- latively could be related to population. The fact that fewer UCR reports were received from one geographic axca over another does not necessarily mean that certain areas had lower poi- soning homicide rates. Factors that could affect the number of reports from a jurisdiction include leg- islation requiring autdpsies or toxicology screens on all deaths of unknown cause, the sophistication 9 TABLE 4, Victim race/offenOer gender Victim race UCR no.

From this study, it is evident that the incidence of reported poisoning homicides made up only a small portion of the UCR data for the decade. We note that the race or gender of poisoning offenders remained unknown more frequently than in other homicides of the decade. This could indi- cate that homicide investigators were more often presented with a poisoning homicide victim, and were never able to identify the offender. Levels of awareness need to be raised among homicide investigators and medical examiners so they become more wary of crime scene details that may indicate poisoning: lack of external trauma to the body; sudden, unexpected death of an individual in good health; past history of flu-like syrnptems; relented visits to clinics or hospitals with flu-like symptoms. If suspicion of homicide by poison arises, ~ecific screening tests must be ordered by the medical examiner to rule out death by poison. Closer examination and study of individuals xvhc have been charged and convicted of poisoning neec to be made. Characteristics of' individuals whc choose poison as their instrument of hormcide should be compared to the characteristics of other homicide offenders to determine whether specific profile traits surface regarding the poisoning of. fenders.

Westveer, Behavioral Science Unit, FBI Asphyxia (Definition): A lack of oxygen or excess of carbon dioxide in the body that is usually caused by an interruption of breathing and that causes unconsciousness and death. II. General Points & Artifacts of Asphyxia A. After pressure is applied [to the neck], unconsciousness supervenes in a matter of seconds. The heart may continue to beat for 15-20 minutes. B. Pressure on the base of the neck may cause the tongue to protrude between the teeth. The exposed portion of the tongue will dry and become dark (post- mortem artifac0. C. Fracture of bone or cartilage is rare except in judicial hanging, where the cervical vertebrae is fractured and death is instantaneous. D. Asphyxial death may cause the face to be congested or discolored (cyanosis). E. Petechial Hemorrhage may be observed in the face and conjuncture of the eye and the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat. III. Manner of Death A, B. C. D. Homicide Suicide Natural: heart failure, pneumonia, diseases that interfere with oxygen supply Accidental: allergic reaction to shellfish, bee sting, or medication IV. Types of Asphyxia A. Compression of the neck Amount of pressure necessary to cause asphyxiation: Jugular veins 4-5 lbs Carotid arteries 11 lbs Trachea 33 lbs Vertebral Arteries 66 lbs 397 1. Hanging a. Suspension or partial suspension of the body; the body weight provides the restricting force for cutting off the oxygen. b. The blood supply to the brain and airway is generally obstructed in hangings. c. Furrow tends to angle toward suspension point (inverted V) d. Abrasions or contusions may be present e. Fingers may be trapped under ligature f. Not to be confused with manual strangulation g. In nontotal suspension hangings, internal bleeding or local hemorrhage is uncommon. h. If a fall is involved, as in judicial hangings, some tearing of internal muscles, organs, and blood vessels may occur, and there may be some bone fractures or damage to the cervical vertebrae. . Strangulation: Compression of the neck structures without suspension of the body. a. Manual: hands (throttling) or arm (yoking) b. Ligature (1) Hemorrhage may be present between the strap muscles and the ligature (2) Abrasions may be present due to struggle (3) Furrow or groove will usually be lower than that of a hanging 398 B. Obstruction of the airway Co D. E. F. 1. Choking a. b. blockage of the internal airway by a foreign object. Many are accidental: adults in restaurants (cafe coronary) hospitals children (marbles, balloons) 2. Smothering ao b. blockage of the internal airway, or the nose and mouth Mechanisms and methods: (1) hands (2) pillows (3) plastic bags (4) gags Compression of the chest: normal mechanism for respiration cannot occur Depletion of Oxygen . 2. Sudden loss of cabin pressure at high altitudes Consumption of available oxygen in a sealed space Replacement of Oxygen (Chemical Intoxication) . Carbon monoxide: deprives the body of oxygen by restricting the ability of the red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues of the body. . Cyanide intoxication: chemical reaction on the body cells that prevents them from utilizing the oxygen carried to them by the blood. . Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants: inhibit the respiratory centers, causing respiratory depression. Using the chemical agents in combination creates a synergistic effect (they work off each other). Breathing slows, then stops, resulting in asphyxial death. a. alcohol b. opiates c. barbiturates Positional Asphyxia 399 NOTES 400 ASPHYXIATION J. C. Upshaw Downs, M.

J. DiMaio, M. D. & V. J. M. DiMaio, M. D.) 1) SUFFOCATION - oxygen does not reach the blood ENVIRONMENTAL SMOTHERING CHOKING MECHANICAL ASPHYXIA GASES 2) STRANGULATION - compression of neck structures from applied external force HANGING LIGATURE MANUAL 3) (BIO)CHEMICAL - cellular lack of adequate oxygen utilization 4) OTHER AUTOEROTIC CRUCIFIXION NECK COMPRESSION (choke hold / carotid sleeper) These broad categories can be defined in another way: 1) air / airway obstruction -

The uppermost aspect of the furrow may be indistinct or absent due to a lack of contact with the skin surface. The hands may be found underneath the ligature as if attempting to remove the noose. This is a reflex action (loss of consciousness occurs in - 15-20 seconds) and does not indicate the victim suffered. The neck may appear elongate due to stretching of soft tissues with gravity. The neck vertebrae are rarely fractured except in judicial executions. 9 \" Asphyxiation (hanging) A close up view of the typical dried orange-yellow abrasion furrow seen with hanging deaths. The weave of the ligature may be imparted on the skin surface as evident here. In contrast to suicidal hanging, a homicidal ligature throttling would impart a horizotal abrasion furrow on the skin surface. The furrow may be indistinct or absent with a broad, soft ligature (sheet, towel, etc.). 9 - Asphyxiation (hanging) Irregular or crescentic abrasions (fingernail marks) can be seen in suicidal hanging, ligature strangulation (throttling), and manual strangulation. These may be a result from the assailant grabbing the victim's neck during the comission of a homicide or from the victim's conscious (homicide) or reflexive (suicide) attempts to remove the offending agent (see above). ASPHYXIATION - Downs 9 \" Asphyxiation (all neck compressions). A step dissection of the muscles & soft tissues of the neck should be done with layer by layer reflection of the tissue to expose the thyroid cartilage & hyoid bone. This should be performed after the chest, abdomen, & head cavities have been eviscerated in order to exclude possible artifact. 9 \" Asphyxiation (strangulation). The right horn fracture is obvious here. The neck structures including the hyoid bone & thyroid cartilage should be removed by the dissecting pathologist after the chest, abdomen, & head cavities have been eviscerated in order to exclude possible artifactual blood. Or fracture. A pre- mortem fracture is confirmed by fresh blood surrounding the site. 4- Asphyxiation (strangulation). Palpebral & bulbar (eyelid & eye) conjunctival petechiae (pinpoint hemorrhages) are common in manual strangulation and are due to rupture of the small vascular branches. Petechiae may also be seen in hanging deaths with continued arterial flow but obstructed venous return (partially suspended position). ASPHYXIATION - Downs 411 ~- Asphyxiation (mechanical compression). Victim pinned underneath car which had been lifted on two automobile jacks. The jacks gave way, entrapping the deceased underneath the vehicle. {-- Asphyxiation (carbon dioxide). See accompanying article. Both the deceased & his cat were dead at the scene. Whenever > 2 living creatures are found dead at a scene and a traumatic cause of death is not apparent, a gas should be considered as a possible agent. Some gases are highly toxic (cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide, etc.) and can kill responders rapidly. Others are less toxic but act by displacing oxygen from the air (carbon dioxide). 412 ~- Asphyxiation (environmental hypoxia). Two individuals went into the hold of a ship to clean up a long- standing water spill. Both were rendered unconscious within several minutes and one died; toxic or suffocating gas should be suspected. In this case, the rust formation of the metal walls of the hold depleted oxygen from this relatively confined space. ASPHYXIATION - Downs NOTES: REFERENCES Forensic Pathology, 1989, D. J. DiMaio, M.

We have previously reported our concerns about the deleterious physiologic effects of a restraint ma- neuver that employs a \"hog-tied\" prone position (1). This method is commonly employed by law enforcement to incapacitate a suspect and occasion- ally is used during transport. We have had occasion to study three deaths where this method of restraint was employed by law enforcement while trans- porting suspects. Autopsy findings in these deaths did not demonstrate anatomic or toxicologic find- ings sufficient to explain death. Additionally, his- torical information indicated that the victims were thought to be alive at the time they were placed in the rear seat of police vehicles. Following several minutes of transport, the suspects became quiet and inactive. When they arrived at their destination, it was not immediately determined that each was ex- periencing respiratory difficulty although each re- mained motionless. After a few minutes, it was determined that the victims were not breathing and the alarm of a cardiac arrest was sounded. All three deaths are strikingly similar in circumstances and findings. Because of this, we reason that deaths in each instance were the result of adverse physiologic effects created by a semiprone and hog-tied position in a confined space. We report these deaths to alert law enforcement agencies to the potential conse- quences of this restraint during transport and to share with other death investigators the critical impor- tance of historical information and the mechanics of events necessary to understand this type of res- piratory death. CASE REPORTS Case I The first victim was a 28-year-old white man who, 4 years prior to his death, had been seen for a nonclassified psychiatric illness for which psy- 415 POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA 4!6 \"x \"- _ FIG. 1. A sketch of the resting position of the first victim during transport to hospital. chotropic medications had been prescribed, leading to improvement in his behavior. One month prior to his death, he became more agitated and was again seen for psychiatric evaluation. He was diagnosed as manic depressive. All medications were stopped and he was started on lithium therapy. On the day of his death in the early morning hours, the victim became extremely agitated, and assaulted and threatened to kill his wife. His mother-in-law in- tervened, but was choked and escaped to a neigh- bor's house and called for police assistance. Two officers responded to the scene where a violent con- frontation ensued. One police officer was choked. The victim was forced to release his hold only after the officer's partner struck him with a nightstick and choked him. The victim subsequently ran from his house and was cornered in the yard when he became trapped between dense bramble bushes and the front end of a law enforcement patrol car. Once cornered, he was overpowered by several police officers who placed him facedown on the ground and handcuffed him in a hog-tied fashion. Flexcuffs immobilized the ankles while handcuffs were used on the wrists. During the restraining maneuver, he continued to resist; once subdued, he became more relaxed, but was still responsive. At no time was it witnessed that a neck hold was applied during the restraining maneuver. The victim was then loaded onto the rear seat of a mid-sized patrol sedan for transport (Fig. 1). Because of the two nightstick blows to the head that caused lacerations and bleeding, and because of multiple scratches over the body surface sus- tained when the victim contacted the bramble bushes, a police officer was directed to rush the victim to a local hospital. A high-speed transit ensued that was estimated to have taken 5-7 min. The victim, although not monitored during this period of time, did not show noticeable activity. Upon arrival at the emergency room, he re- mained prone when he was removed from the ve- hicle and transferred to an emergency room stretcher. Nursing personnel reported a faint, slow carotid pulse and spontaneous respirations, but the emergency room physician who saw him within a minute of arrival reported no respiration, poor facial color, and no blood pressure. Restraints were removed and the victim was placed on his back. Vital signs and cardiac telemetry demonstrated cardiopulmo- nary arrest with asystole. Resuscitation was, initi- ated, which resulted in ventricular fibrillation, eventually converting to a sinus tachycardia. Administration of lidocaine and a dopamine drip resulted in maintenance of this rhythm with a blood pressure of 90-100 mm Hg. His blood lithium lev- els sampled during this period were determined to be subtherapeutic. The victim remained totally un- responsive during this period, with fixed and di- lated pupils. Because there was concern that he might have a head injury, he was transferred to a larger medical center in a comatose, unresponsive con- dition and was admitted with a diagnosis of anoxic encephalopathy. Cerebral flow studies showed no perfusion and his condition rapidly deteriorated. He died 5 h after admission. The autopsy was per- formed 68 h after death. The body at the time of autoPSY measured 73 in. (1.85 m) in length and weighed 267 lb (121.36 kg). A noteworthy feature was the abundant abdominal panniculus. A proper assessment of the body ha- bitus was limited because of early postmortem gas distention of soft tissues along with early skin slip- page, the result of inadequate refrigeration. The surface examination of the body showed multipl,e bruises of the extremities and back and there were two gaping lacerations of the occipitoparietal scalp. In addition, multiple scratches were present over the surface of the extremities. All of these findings corroborated the historical information that this man had been struck with nightsticks and had become entangled in bramble bushes. Other noteworthy findings at the time of autopsy included a few pe- 9 techial hemorrhages in the conjunctiva of the right upper eyelid with a single flame-shaped hemor- rhage in the inner canthus of the left lower eyelid. Internal examination showed that there was no in- jury to the cranial cavity and brain except for subga- Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 13, No. 2, 1992 D. T.

Layered dissection of the neck was essentially free of any injury except for a small 1.3 cm area of bruising in one subman- dibular gland. There was mild to moderate focal coronary arteriosclerosis and a heart weight of 415 g. Moderate fatty change of the liver was likewise noted. Toxicologic examination of antemortem blood showed the presence of 0.2 mEq/L of feine were als0 detected, but no other drugs were demonstrated. Death was attributed to positional as- phyxia. FIG. 2. A sketch of the final resting position of the second victim on the floor of the police vehicle used for transport to hospital. Case 2 The second victim was a 28-year-old healthy white man who was house sitting and drinking beer with his brother most of one afternoon. A small group of me\", arrived and tried to enter the house. A ver- bal confrontation took place and the group left. Later, the brothers went out to their van for a trip to the store for more beer. They noticed their van had been tampered with and began shouting at each other about the problem. Neighbors assumed they were fighting and called police. Two police officers arrived and tried to calm the brothers and get them to go into their house. During this time, a records search found outstanding traffic warrants on the victim. The victim would not quiet down and became increasingly agitated. When faced with the option of going into the house or being arrested, he raa. A pursuit and struggle ensued. He was struck several times with nightsticks, once to the head. After the victim was partially subdued prone on the ground, a witness to the event ran out had held the victim's legs. Several officers arrived to help restrain and hog tie the victim. The witness heard the victim say during the struggle on the ground \"gimme some air, gimme some air.\" The pursuit and struggle lasted -7 min. There is no evidence that a neck hold was used at any time during the confrontation. When the victim was at last restrained, and while still resisting and complaining, he was placed in a prone position in the back of a patrol car on a nar- row, molded plastic, one-piece seat. The trans- porting officer left as soon as the victim was in the car. An officer at the scene called for an aid unit to meet them at the jail in order to treat the head injury. While en route to the jail, the victim slipped down and became wedged between the front and back seats with his left shoulder partway up the back of the front seat and his right shoulder against the bot- tom panel and foot well of the back seat (Fig 2). The transporting officer recalled that the victim had been \"'rustling\" around a little bit and that his breathing had been raspy. About 3 min later, his breathing was \"'gurgly\" and the transporting offi- cer called a Code 3 upgrade to paramedics. Medics arrived at the jail about the same time as the officer and victim. Approximately 4 min had elapsed dur- ing the trip from the scene to the jail. The victim was unresponsive when removed from the patrol car. Despite all efforts, he never regained any vital signs. He was pronounced dead 26 min after CPR had been initiated. At autopsy, the body measured 70 in. (1.78 m) and weighed 220 lb (99 kg). Deep neck muscle hemorrhage was present adjacent to the left carotid artery and structures of the neck. There was some vomitus in the airway. Other injuries included lac- eration and contusion to the right parietal scalp at= tributed to a nightstick blow. Other abrasions and soft tissue contusions to the body surface and ex- tremities were also present and attributed to mul- tiple nightstick blows. Also noted were minor circumferential abrasions and contusions to both wrists and one ankle from restraints. No petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctivae were noted. Find- ings in all thoracic and abdominal organs were within normal limits without significant anatomic change to account for death. Toxicologic tests found a blood alcohol level of 0.12 g/100 ml, LSD blood level of 3.2 ng/ml, THC blood level of 4.1 ng/ml, and THC blood metabo- lite level of 108 ng/ml. No other drugs or chemical findings of note were present. Death was attributed to positional asphyxia. 417 Ant J Forenaic Mecl E~athol, Vol. 13, No. 2, 1992 POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA FIG. 3. Arresting officer demonstrating approximate po- sition of decedent in back seat of patrol car. Note that the lower portion of the body still remains on the seat. The legs have not been tied and flexed as occurred during the actual transport of the victim. Case 3 The third victim was a 34-year-old black man with a long psychiatric history of undifferentiated schizophrenia, who had stopped taking his medi- cation on his own sometime prior to the described incident. On the day of his death, he began to show bizarre behavior in the home of his grandmother, including wandering about talking to himself and sticking his head in an oven and attempting to turn on the gas. The grandmother called the police. The victim apparently became quite agitated upon the arrival of the police officer and a verbal confron- tation, followed shortly thereafter by a physical confrontation, took place. A backup patrol car was summoned. A scuffle took place inside the grand- mother's home with one police officer admitting to several fisted blows to the decedent's chest and ab- domen, but not to use of a baton or a neck hold. The victim was wrestled to the ground, whereupon his arms were placed behind his back, two sets of handcuffs were applied, and leg straps were placed around his ankles. He was taken to the waiting pa- trol car and placed into the back seat with his head, shoulders, and chest in the foot well behind the driver's seat and his right flank over the drive shaft hump. His legs were in a flexed position on the rear bench seat behind the front passenger seat (Fig. 3). The arresting officer got in the back and rode with the victim to the city jail, which was -5-7 min away. The officer stated that the victim became quiet, but nothing was noted to be wrong until their arrival at the receiving dock at the city jail, at which time the arresting officer said to his partner, \"I think he's dead.'\" The victim was removed from the vehicle and emergency respc -ase personnel pro- nounced him dead at the scene. Upon the arrival of the Medical Examiner (A.D.S.) at the scene, the deceased was lying on his side on the concrete floor with his hands cuffed behind his back by two sets of handcuffs. The legs were tied together at the ankles. The body was immediately removed for a postmortem examination. At postmortem examination, the body measured 68 in. (1.73 m) in length and weighed 150 lb (67.5 kg). Insignificant injury to the head consisted of two small abrasions to the skin of the left side of the face and a small abrasion of the right side of the nose. Two minor contusions of the scalp were noted. Petechiae were noted in both eyes and on the pleural surfaces of both lungs. No abnormalities other than congestion were noted. Complete micro- scopic examination showed no histologic abnor- malities. Results of toxicologic analysis of body fluids including vitreous fluid were within normal postmortem limits. Death was attributed to posi- tional asphyxia. AUTOPSY FINDINGS AND PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS The conclusions drawn from these investigations were based primarily on the reconstruction of events surrounding each death. Complete detailed autop- sies showed limited findings that did not enable any anatomic cause of death to be established. In two of the victims, cutaneous injuries were compatible with impacts by nightsticks. There were scattered bruises over the bodies and lacerations of the scalp. In the first victim, considerable attention was given to the neck dissection since conjunctival petechial hemorrhages were present and there was evidence that the victim had been choked early in the con- frontation. However, historical accounts of the choking episode indicate that it occurred 15-20 min before the victim was subdued. Multiple witnesses denied that choking occurred during the \"take- down\" and placement of restraints. Additionally, the victim had received vigorous chest compression during resuscitation. The second victim had no physical or historical evidence of cervical com- pression. Conjunctivae were congested, but free of petechiae. Neck compression, although considered to have been possible, could not be supported by historical accounts of witnesses. Hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the left side of the neck was probably impact injury from a nightstick. The third victim showed minimal cutaneous abrasions, but did show 418 Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 13, No. 2, 1992 D. T. REAY ET AL. conjunctival petechiae. Again no cervical injuries were present and no historical information to sug- gest choking was elicited. The presence of con- junctival petechiae appears ~o have resulted from the head placed at a lower level than the rest of the body. This would increase venous pressure in the head and promote petechiae. In all three victims, no significant natural disease process was present that could account for an independent \"cardiac event.'\" Toxicologic analyses of the body fluids of two of the victims demonstrated subtherapeutic levels of lithium in one, while in the other there was evi- dence of alcohol, LSD, and THC. These findings were considered significant only in that the erratic and violent behavior of those two victims had some explanation. Subtherapeutic lithium levels in the manic--depressive illness of the first victim could account for an emergence of manic behavior. In the second victim, the presence of alcohol, LSD, and THC provides a reasonable explanation for irra- tional, violent, and uncontrollable behavior. In these two instances, toxicologic findings shed some light on the decedents\" behavior, but do not explain their deaths. Positional asphyxia occurs when the position of the body interferes with respiration, resulting in as- phyxia. The deleterious positional effect may result either from interference with the muscular or me- chanical component of respiration, from compro- mise of the airway, or from some combination of these. In addition, in all cases of positional as- phyxia, one or more contributory factors provide an explanation for the inability of the victim to cor- rect the deleterious and potentially lethal position, for example, alcohol/drug intoxication, concussive head injury, entrapment, restraint, or physical dis- ability. In our view, the application of hog-tied- type restraints and subsequent positioning of the victim in a confined space are the critical factors that led to the respiratory compromise that caused these men's deaths. Hence, all three men died as a result of positional asphyxia. This conclusion is drawn from the totality of the investigation and de- pends on historical information and reconstruction of events. These deaths can only be properly eval- uated with knowledge of the dynamics of the events preceding and surrounding death. In the first vic- tim, obesity with a large abdominal panniculus in- terfered with respiration in the prone position in a confined space, whereas, in the other two deaths, mechanical displacement of the abdomen by the convex contour of the floor and the edge of the car seat accounted for loss of effective diaphragmatic excursions of respiration. In each instance, the final fatal event was hypoxia. DISCUSSION Respiration depends on three critical elements: the gas exchange function of the lungs, the patency of the airway, and the muscular pump or bellows that ventilates the lungs. All three are vital to life. The parenchyma of the lung, if severely diseased or damaged by injury, results in failure of the gas exchange function and hypoxemia. If the airway is obstructed at any level, a similar consequence will ensue. The same result occurs in pump or bellows failure where the lung may be healthy and the air- way patent, but the mechanical muscular bellows of the chest fails. Pathologic causes of respiratory bellows failure are detailed in the medical litera- ture, but respiratory failure attributed to adverse body positioning has not been scrutinized (2). The three deaths in this report are the result of disturbed physiology because of failure of the respiratory bel- lows produced by an adverse position in a confined space. The respiratory bellows or pump depends upon the output drive of central nervous respiratory cen- ters that control respiratory muscle activity. This neural impulse center may not be capable of re- sponding to oxygen demand. Such failure occurs when these respiratory centers are chemically de- pressed as in drug intoxications, for example with barbiturates or opiates. In these instances, the cen- tral nervous system drive is attenuated or dampened and fails to respond to biochemical demands of the body. Unless life is artificially supported, death oc- curs rapidly. Since the higher centers of cerebration are also affected by drug intoxication, the intoxi- cated person may be unaware of impending death. Only careful blood-gas monitoring and artificial support of respiration can overcome the deficits in central nervous system drive to maintain respiration and life. Failure of the bellows or the pump function of respiration can result from a mechanical abnormal- ity of the thorax that impedes a proper bellows ac- tion. A flail chest or severe chest deformity can cause bellows failure and, ultimately, respiratory failure and death. A nonfunctioning or poorly syn- chronized respiratory bellows causes severe bio- chemical disturbances. Since such anatomic abnormalities can be readily identified, the patho- physiology leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death is easily understood and generally accepted. Bellows failure can also occur from respiratory Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 13, No. 2, 1992 419 POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA muscular failure. Muscles of respiration may be un- able to Contract and generate the motion of respi- ration even though the central nervous system drive is functioning and the thorax is structurally intact. Physiologic inspiratory muscle fatigue can occur (3). The exact cause of inspiratory muscle fatigue has yet to be clearly defined, but there are other recognizable clinical conditions such as myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders causing muscle dysfunction, in which respiratory muscle fatigue results in hypercapnia and its attendant bio- chemical consequences (4). This is rarely a cause of sudden death, since the process, although insidi- ous, is generally clinically recognizable and treatable. There is an additional cause of bellows failure that has not been cited in the clinical or forensic literature, but is illustrated in the three deaths that form the basis of this report. Here the restrained position of the victims in a confined space creates a circumstance for bellows restriction and failure. The chest wall depends on the interaction of the diaphragm with the musculature both of the rib cage and the abdomen. Breathing takes place by dis- placement of either the abdomen or the rib cage (5). The total volume displaced in the abdomen by the rib cage bellows action is the total volume of change produced during inspiration in the lungs. When the muscle of the diaphragm contracts, the dome of the diaphragm displaces abdominal viscera downgcard. Muscles of the diaphragm, in addition to displacing abdominal contents, also act on the costal attachments to lift the rib cage in a respira- tory movement. Contraction of the intercostal mus- cles during inspiration expands the rib cage. If respiration depends totally on the intercostal and accessory muscles of the neck, as when the phrenic nerve is severed and the diaphragm is paralyzed, the bellows action of the thorax displaces the ab- domen inward so that abdominal volume is dis- placed upward and reduced. Any increase in the lung volume is offset by abdominal displacement due to inward volume change. Roussos and Mack- lem detailed these observations in their report on the respiratory muscles, an excellent review of res- piratory muscle physiology to which the reader is referred (6). In the normal supine person, breathing is primarily the result of diaphragm muscle activity. The excursion of the chest during respiration in a supine position is the result of diaphragm muscle contraction. On the other hand, a normal person in the erect position uses both the intercostal chest muscles and the diaphragm. Consider the adverse effects of the prone position in breathing, particu- larly where the abdominal panniculus is so large that it displaces the abdominal volume or when the abdominal volume is displaced by an object. The consequence is that the effective abdominal excur- sions produced by contraction of the diaphragm are reduced and the tidal volume of respiration is sub- stantially reduced. If uncorrected, percapnia and hypoxemia. Roussos and Macklem point out that, as the work of breathing becomes very difficult, many muscles in the arms and trunk and neck are recruited and contribute to the total oxygen utilization of breath- ing. The specific role of the hog-tied restraint pos- ture and its biochemical effects on those muscles is unclear at this time, although it is obvious that any restraint that prevents a change of position could restrict breathing further by preventing those mus- cles from assisting in respiration. Another, more ill-defined, factor that is likely to augment respiratory muscle fatigue is related to prior violent muscular activity. Weakness of muscles due to hypercatabolic states occurs withsepsis or when long surgical procedures cause increased energy de- mands (7). During the violent confrontations that ensued in these instances that we report, the ex- penditure of muscular energy by each victim was \"probably substantial. Energy that is expended by the contractile muscle machinery of the body is sub- tracted from the respiratory muscle needs. Muscle fatigue may induce the central nervous system to shunt energy to contracting muscles. A deficit in energy supply to respiratory muscles can influence their performance. A decrease in chemical energy supply to respiratory muscles will hasten their fail- ure as well as the failure of other muscle groups (8). All three victims were rendered more vulner- able tO respiratory muscle fatigue through deficits of energy created by violent muscle activity before they were placed in their final restrained positions. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS The diagnosis of positional asphyxia should be considered when (a) circumstances surrounding death indicate a body position that could interfere with respiration; (b) historical information indicates \"difficulty in breathing\" or unusual physical res- piratory signs such as cyanosis, gurgling, gasping, or any other physical manifestations that could be interpreted as evidence of respiratory distress; (c) there is absence of significant or catastrophic ana- tomic pathologic changes at autopsy that would conclusively account for death, including such cat- astrophic events as intracerebral hemorrhage or rup- tured myocardial infarct; and (d) clearly toxic or 420 Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 13, No. 2, 199~ D. T. REAY ET AL. fatal levels of drugs or chemicals that are ordinarily incompatible with life (including carbon monoxide, cyanide, and lethal levels of therapeutic and abused drugs) are absent from body fluids. During the evaluation of deaths such as those reported here, sudden cardiac death without patho- morphologic changes must be considered. A rela- tionship between stress and death is known to exist, but there is a dearth of factual data because of the unpredictability and suddenness of such deaths (9). Certainly primary sudden cardiac death without pathomorphologic changes is a well-recognized en- tity. However, in view of the pathophysiology of the respiratory disturbance created by respiratory restriction, it is likely that any fatal cardiac event would be precipitated by the adverse respiratory physiology produced by respiratory restriction. Since it is known that biobehavioral stresses can augment cardiac susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (10), one might contend that these deaths were caused by a malignant ventricular arrhythmia triggered by the psychological events and is unrelated to and independent of the position of the victim. Ventric- ular fibrillation has been reported spontaneously and has been triggered by psychiatric interviews, by stressful emotions, and during REM sleep stages (11). However, recognizing that biobehavioral fac- tors predispose to sudden cardiac death does not allow for the conclusion that the deaths reported here are the result of such factors. There are no pathomorphologic changes that enable differentia- tion between death induced by psychobehavioral factors and the pathophysiologic disturbance cre- ated by body position. Until such time as we have a means of differentiating between these two phys- iologic events, it is our view that the best expla- nation for such deaths is positional asphyxia, which is supported by circumstantial events. Another possible cause of death that needs to be considered, especially when sudden death occurs in psychiatric patients, is the so-called neuroleptic ma- lignant syndrome (NMS). In the late 1800s, the di- agnosis of \"'acute exhaustive mania\" was given to sudden death of psychotic patients from apparently natural but undetermined cause. This condition is poorly understood and may be related to a \"cardiac event\" due to psychological stress as described above. NMS is a hyperpyretic syndrome that is frequently fatal and occurs in people who are taking antipsychotic agents, which include phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thi- oxanthenes, and other drugs (12). A drug's potential for inducing this syndrome appears to parallel its an- tidopaminergic potency. Additional predisposing fac- tors include physical exhaustion, dehydration, organic brain disease, and the use of long-acting depot neu- roleptics (13). Classic features of NMS are hyper- thermia, hypotonicity of skeletal muscles, and fluctuating consciousness along with instability of the autonomic nervous system. NMS has been seen in psychiatric and medical patients given neuroleptic drugs and is not related to previous exposure to the drug or to toxic overdoses. However, NMS may also occur in the absence of the administration of neuroleptic- type drugs and appears to be indistinguishable from the poorly understood \"acute exhaustive mania\" de- scribed prior to use of neuroleptics (14). Sudden phe- nothiazine-related deaths that lack the other distinguishing features seen in the typical NMS death have also been described (15). A history of neuro- leptic drug use or the other clinical features of NMS in an unexpected death might suggest that this syn- drome is the most likely cause of death. Because neither NMS nor positional asphyxia show definitive pathologic/toxicologic findings, positional asphyxia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are not mutually exclusive and may coexist. Each death must be in- vestigated not only by examining the morphologic features at autopsy and the toxicologic results, but also by evaluating the victim's medical history in con- junction with the scene and circumstances surround- ing death. Without a consideration of all these factors, it is likely that some deaths due to positional asphyxia will go unrecognized. There will be deaths, particularly those where co- caine, methamphetamine, and high levels of alcohol are present, in which it becomes tempting to assign the cause of death solely to these intoxicants, and to ignore or discount the final position in which the vic- tim was found dead. In a previous report on cocaine deaths, Wetli and Fishbain (16) cite instances where victims were found dead in the back seat of police cars and in other unusual circumstances where there was the potential for the position of the body to ad- 9 versely affect respiration. Whether any of these deaths had an unrecognized pathologic respiratory contri- bution because of body position is unknown. Such assessments must take into account the total death investigation and not focus on anatomic findings and toxicologic values without due consideration of the resting position of the victim. The same dilemma occurs in deaths where sig- nificant, but not necessarily fatal, natural disease exists. Finding advanced coronary artery disease, cirrhosis, and even diabetic ketoacidosis in a person who is restrained in a position that can compromise respiration may tempt the death investigator to at- tribute death solely to the natural disease process and discount any contribution to death by the po- Arrt J Forenair Med P~thol, VoL 13, No. 2, 1992 421 POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA sition of the body. Again, we do not know of a clear or direct way to settle such issues. Because the positional asphyxia diagnosis is primarily based on scene and historical information, it is not often an unequivocal diagnosis in any given death inves- tigation. Nevertheless, our view is that positional asphyxia should be seriously considered whenever unusual positional stress has been placed on respi- ration. Until postmortem methods are developed to better assess physiologic disturbances, the ultimate judgment will be in the hands of the examining pathologist. Because of the complexity of the issues involved, there certainly will be a spectrum of opin- ions and no clear answer. The ultimate and difficult assessment as to cause of death is in the hands of the certifying physician who is left to make a judg- ment that incorporates the bias and prejudice in- herent in each of us, but is also based on the important principle of forensic pathology which requires that each death be evaluated using all available infor- mation, especially historical and scene investigative material, rather than relying solely on anatomic- toxicologic information.

Discharge of a Gun On discharge of a gun, the following material leaves the barrel: . 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. the bullet; gas; powder (burning and unburned); soot; bullet and jacket fragments; primer compounds (lead, antimony, and barium); copper, brass, and nickel from the cartridge case. B. Contact Wounds 1. The muzzle is in contact with the body. 2. In all contact wounds there are: a. b. C. scorching of the wound edges; soot (powder blackening) deposited on the wound margins; soot and powder particles driven into track. 3. In all contact wounds, there may be: a~ b. a muzzle impression, due to blow-back of the skin, caused by the gases; soot on the skin adjacent to the wound. 4. In contact wounds over bone, as in the head: a~ b. C. d. soot is usually deposited on the outer table of the skull around the entrance in the bone. a stellate wound of entrance is, often produced by subcutaneous expansion of the powder gases between the skin and bone. soot may also be deposited on the inner table of the skull and on the dura. discontinuous skull fractures may be present. 433 5. Loose contact wounds differ from hard contact wounds in that: a. b. there is an area of powder blackening (soot) around the entrance wound not confined to the edges of the wound. stellate tears usually do not occur. . In contact wounds over clothing, the clothing may absorb all the external soot and powder. Powder grains and soot will still be inside the wound track, however. C. Intermediate Gunshot Wounds . The range is greater than for contact wounds, but close enough to cause Npowder tattooing\" of the skin. . Maximum range of powder tattooing for handguns is 24 inches for flake powder, 35 inches for flattened ball powder, and 48 inches for ball powder. . Powder tattooing occurs as a result of the impaction of unburned and burning grains of powder in the skin. . The diameter and density of the powder tattoo pattern can be used to determine the range. The same weapon and ammunition should be used, as powder patterns are variable from gun to gun and ammunition to ammunition. . Soot (powder blackening) is also present on close-up gunshot wounds out to 6 to 10 inches. 6. Soot can be wiped off, but powder tattooing cannot be. . Hair and clothing may interfere with powder to some degree. All clothing should be examined. D. Distant Gunshot Wounds . The range is greater than intermediate wounds. No soot or powder tattooing is present. 2. The exact range cannot be determined. 3. An entrance wound can be differentiated from an exit wound. 434 E. Entrance Wounds F. G. H. . Every entrance wound has an abraded margin, called the abrasion ring. This is due to the bullet's scraping the margins of the bullet hole as it enters the skin. . The abrasion ring is present in contact, close-up, and distant gunshot wounds. . Entrance wounds, with the exception of contact wounds over bone, tend to be small, circular, and regular. . Symmetrical abrasion rings suggest a head-on shot and oval rings an angular shot. This is not necessarily so, however. The course of a bullet can only be determined by internal examination of the body. Exit Wounds . These are usually larger and more irregular than entrance wounds, because of: a. \" lack of support (reenforcement) of the skin; b. bullet tumbling; c. bullet deformation. 2. There is usually no abrasion ring. . Very rarely an abrasion ring is present. This occurs when the exit is \"shored up\" by a firm object such as a belt or a wall, as in the case of a wound inflicted on an individual leaning against a wall. Bullet Wounds of Bone . The entrance wound is a punched out, circular or oval hole with sharp edges. The opposite surface is bevelled. In skull, for example, the entrance bullet hole is bevelled on the internal table. . The exit wound is bevelled or cratered. In skulls the exit hole is bevelled on the outer table. Bullet Wipe . The bullet wipe is a grey ring around the entrance hole in skin or clothing, appearing when bullet grime is wiped off on the skin or cloth as the bullet enters. 435 II. 2. It is more common with revolvers. 3. It must not be mistaken for soot on the wound margin. I. Miscellaneous Points It is impossible to tell the caliber of a bullet by x-raying it in the body, due to x-ray distortion. . The caliber of a bullet cannot be determined from the entrance hole in the skin. 3. The trajectory of the bullet through the body is dependent on : ao b. C. the position of the victim; the position of the assailant; the angle was which the weapon was held. Notes On Suicide . Right-handed individuals occasionally fire the gun with the left hand, steadying the barrel with the right. . Multiple bullet wounds do not rule out a suicide. One woman shot herself ni,e times in the chest, while a man shot himself five times in the head. . A fatal \"accidental\" shooting of an individual while he is \"cleaning \" his gun is almost always a suicide. Most one-man hunting accidents are suicide. 436 Firearms Evidence For The Homicide Detective Eric W. Witzig Introduction The purpose of this monograph is to familiarize the reader with terms and conventions used in the field of small arms firearms examination. To the newcomer firearms examination often sounds like a collection of seemingly contradictory, obtuse rules that have no readily apparent foundation, little direction, and too many exceptions. In truth, the art and science of firearms is more than a thousand years old and is the result of contributions made by hundreds of individuals. Chapel wrote that gunpowder was known as early as 846 and that in 1267 the monk Roger Bacon mentioned gunpowder in his writings. ~ The Chinese knew of gunpowder as early as the seventh century. 2 It is possible that the Chinese were the first to use gunpowder in a firearm that took the form of a cannon. In Europe firearms were used to propel projectiles as early as the 12th century) What little is known today about the early development of firearms was gleaned from a few drawings and surviving examples of the gunmakers' art. It is little wonder, then, that the field of firearms seems arcane and sometimes difficult to understand. In an effort to create a common language among firearms examiners, in 1977 the Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners (AFTE) formed a standardization committee to prepare a glossary of terms used in the science of firearms examination? AFTE published its first Glossary in 1980. Terms and expressions used in this work are consistent with the AFTE Glossary. The term ballistics is frequently used incorrectly as a synonym for firearms examination. Ballistics is the science of projectiles in motion. Ballistics for firearms is divided into three types: internal ballistics, or projectile motion within a firearm; external ballistics, or projectile motion outside of a firearm; and terminal ballistics, the impact of a projectile on a target or other object. This work will concentrate on the forensic aspects of internal ballistics. tCharles Edward Chapel, The Boy's Book of Rifles (New York: Coward-McCann, Inc., 1961), p. 3.

Among the many benefits to the detective, examination of firearms evidence can prove that: O A bullet or casing was fired from or in a class of firearms (an aid in search warrant preparation) or one specific firearm (the firearm recovered in the defendant's possession). O Multiple bullets or casings recovered on a scene were fired from one firearm (suggesting one shooter) or multiple firearms (possibly involving several shooters). O Bullets or casings recovered from multiple scenes were fired from one firearm (thus linking the cases together). O The defendant did know how to use the pistol, as evidenced by markings on unexpended rounds showing that they were worked through the action of the pistol. O The defendant(s) handled individual rounds as evidenced by the recovery of their fingerprints on expended rounds or rounds within a pistol's magazine. 5 Rifle And Handgun Ammunition For rifles or handguns, a finished cartridge, or round of ammunition, is composed of four parts: O O O O Casing, usually made of brass. Primer (seated in the base of the casing). Powder; smokeless powder of either single-base or double-base composition; black powder was laistorically used. ~ Bullet, typically made of lead or lead with a copper jacket. Casing The cartridge casing, usually yellow or silver metal in color, is the most visible component of ammunition and the one that holds together the other three components. round of ammunition may be properly called fixed, or live ammunition. 7 A SVinceat J. Dimaio, Gunshot Wounds (New York: Elsevier, Glossy, p. 5. Omark Industries, 438 Prinler The primer is a small metal cup containing an explosive mixture used as an ignition device, s When struck by the firing pin in a modern firearm, the primer is compressed, the mixture explodes and, in turn, ignites the powder, or main iJropellant charge, in the round of ammunition. Powder Powder may be either black powder or smokeless powder. The latter is by far the more popular for fixed ammunition. Black powder is composed of charcoal, saltpeter, and sulphur. This is the mixture that was recorded by the Chinese. 9 Black powder has three disadvantages: when ignited it produces a large volume of smoke; it produces low pressures in a firearm which translates into low projectile velocity; and it leaves debris, or fouling, in the barrel of the arm, making difficult the loading of bullets from the muzzle of the barrel. A few cartridges are assembled today with black powder, or Pyrodex, a black powder substitute. These cartridges are designed for use in antique arms manufactured from the 1860's through the 1880's or in reproductions of those arms. Smokeless powder became available in the 1880's. Single-based powder contains nitrocellulose; double-based powder contains nitrocellulose with the addition of nitroglycerine.~~ Smokeless powder eliminated the three disadvantages experienced with black powder. Modern ammunition is exclusively loaded with smokeless powder. In any discussion of powder it must be stressed that firearm propellants, whether black powder or smokeless powder, do not explode in a firearm. Both types of powder burn in a firearm. Black powder burns slowly; smokeless powder burns very quickly. Although there is a loud report associated with the discharge of a firearm, the report is the result of high pressure gases escaping quickly from the firearm and not the result of an explosion within the firearm. Slbid., p. 141. 9NRA, Fact Book, p. 31. l~ Reloadin~ Manual, pp. 30-39. 439 Bullet The bullet is an elongated \"non-spherical projectile for use in a rifled barrel. \"u Historically bullets were manufactured of lead or with a lead core, although there has been success with steel or tungsten carbide cores, n Bullets made of lead were satisfactory until the introduction of smokeless powder. The new powder burned with a higher temperature and melted the lead before the bullet traveled through the barrel. Cladding, or jacketing, the bullet core with metals whose melting point was higher than lead, such as copper, proved to be a solution to bullet melt down. Modern handgun ammunition is manufactured with bullets made of lead or of lead with a copper jacket. Modern rifle ammunition is typically assembled with jacketed bullets. Cartridges Cartridges are referred to by a measurement and frequently a few letters or a word or two. When interpreting cartridge information three symbols should be considered: the period (.), the hyphen (-), and the letter \"x'. Each of these symbols marks and separates information in a cartridge name. In the United States the unit of measurement is the inch. For cartridge names the usual practice is to state the caliber, or diameter, of the bullet, written in hundreds of an inch. The measurement is preceded by a period. Examples of such calibers are .22, .32, or .38. But the caliber alone does not give enough information to specifically identify a cartridge because a number of cartridges fire a bullet with the same caliber, or diameter. We need more information to state with certainty the cartridge name. Additional information about a cartridge's name is provided by the one or two words following the measurement of bullet diameter. For example, in caliber .22 there are cartridges named .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle (all of which are rim fire cartridges with the primer material located in the rim of the casing), .22 Hornet, .222 Remington, and .223 Remington (all of which are center fire cartridges with the primer located in the center of the casing). In a cartridge name the word or words following the measurement of bullet diameter can be as short as few letters, like the 6ram PPC, or as long as .38 Special, .45 Long Colt, or .600 Nitro Express. The word or words after the measurement can specifically identify a cartridge within a caliber, ttAFTE, Glos~rv, p. 30. t2Lyman Gun Sight Corporation, Handbook of Cast Bullets (Middlefield, CT: Lyman Gun Sight Corp., 1958), pp. 72-73. 440 Cartridge names become a little confusing when exceptions to conventions are introduced. Examples of exceptions include the .30-40 Krag, the .30-30 Winchester Center Fire, and the .30-'06 Springfield. The first two cartridges are about a hundred years old and were introduced at a time when black powder was loaded into cartridge cases. Cartridge names in the 1870's included the bullet diameter in thousands of an inch 13 followed by the number of grains of black powder loaded into the brass easing. Examples of 1870's cartridge names include the .47-70, the .32-40, and the .38-55.14 One cartridge name, the .45-70-500 Government, carded this to an extreme, giving the caliber of the bullet in thousandths of an inch, followed by the amount of black powder measured in grains, and finally the weight of the bullet in grains. Is Smokeless powder was perfected contemporaneously with the creation of the .30-40 Krag. The .30-40 Krag was a military cartridge fired in the first bolt action rifle adopted by the United States Military in 1892.16 The rifle was designed by Norwegian Army Capt. Ole H. J. Krag. Slightly modified for the United States Military, the rifle became known as the Krag-Jorgensen. The cartridge for the Krag fired a bullet .30 inches in diameter ~7 and the casing was loaded with 40 grains of smokeless powder. Note that in the name of this cartridge (.30-40 Krag) the number after the hyphen is not preceded by a period. Although this cartridge was introduced in 1892, popular usage continued to refer to the round as the .30-40 Krag, a name unique to this cartridge and one which specifically identifies itfl The .30-30 Winchester Center Fire (WCF), also known as the .30 Winchester or simply the .30-30, fired a bullet with a diameter of .30 inches. ~9 Again, note that the number after the hyphen is not preceded by a period. The second number was a measurement of the grains of smokeless powder loaded into the casing, in this case 30 t3Some writers omit the period before the measurement, assuming that the reader knows what is being discussed. The omission of the period is but another exception to convention. In the interests of clarity the period is included at all times in this work. 14Clay Harvey, Popular Sporting Rifle Cartridges, (Northfield, IL: DBI Books, Inc., 1984), p. 156. ISNRA, Fact Book, p. 53. t6Ibid p. 69. 17The precise measurement of the bullet diameter is .308 inches. The last digit, representing thousandths of an inch, is typically omitted in cartridge names. Some cartridges, however, do extend the measurement out to the third place and include that information in the cartridge name. See: precise measurement of the bullet diameter is .308 inches. 441 grains. Introduced in 1895 as the .30-30, the cartridge has continued to be known as such. 2~ In 1903 the United Sates Military adopted its second bolt action rifle, the .30-'06 Springfield. The cartridge fired a .30 caliber bullet 21 and was initially called the .30-'03. The hyphen in the cartridge name separated the caliber from other information about the cartridge, i.e., the year the round was adopted. When the cartridge was improved in 1906 it became known as the .30-'06, or .30-'06 Springfield, thus specifically identifying the cartridge as that adopted in 1906 and designed to be fired in the rifle manufactured at the military armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. z~ In Europe the unit of measure is the meter, subdivided into millimeters, or thousandths of a meter. By convention, the millimeter is expressed in lower case letters as \"mm\". European calibers, or bullet diameters, are expressed as 5ram, 6mm, 7mm, 7.62mm, 8mm, or 9mm. But the caliber of the bullet alone does not sufficiently identify the cartridge, or finished unit of ammunition. Again, we need more information. European cartridge names include the length of the cartridge case in millimeters and possibly a word. The length of the casing is separated from the caliber by the letter \"x\". Thus, the 9mm Luger, also known as the 9mm Parabellum (a center fire handgun and submachinegun cartridge), becomes the 9mm x 19, and the cartridge adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as a standard rifle cartridge becomes the 7.62mm x 51, also known as the 7.62 NATO. 23 European use of the metric system appears to provide a more accurate and scientific system for cartridge names. Nonetheless, confusion can enter the scheme of things. Consider that in the United States one cartridge is known as the .380 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), while in Europe it may be called the 9mm Browning Short, the 21The precise measurement the bullet diameter is .308 inches. 22julian S. Hatcher, Maj. Gen. (USA Retired), Hateher's Notebook Stackpole Publishing Company, 1962), pp. 19-31. 23The millimeter notation (ram) is sometimes omitted in metric measurements just as the period is sometimes omitted in inch measurements. When either is omitted the writer of the piece makes the assumption that the reader knows what is being discussed. 7\"4Omark, Reloadin2 Manual, p. 382. 442 Cartridges can be named by units of measure expressed in inches or in millimeters 9 Examples include: M_ram Inches 7.62 x 63 7.62 x 51 7.62 x 51R 6.5 x 52R 5.6 x 52R also known as also known as also known as also known as also known as .30-'06 Springfield 9 308 Winchester (7.62 NATO) .30-30 Winchester .25-35 Winchester .22 Savage High Power 25 Shotgun Ammunition Shotgun shells have many of the same components as rifle and handgun cartridges. Shotgun shells contain: 0 Casing, usually made of plastic or paper, occasionally made of metal. O Lead or steel shot ranging in sizes from the large 00 buck to the smaller number 4 buck, then from BB to number 12 shot; the cartridge can also contain one projectile commonly called a slug. 0 Powder; smokeless. ~6 0 A primer of large size, frequently called a battery cup primer. 0 An over-powder/under-shot wad made of either plastic or paper; an over-shot wad is occasionally seen. . The convention establishing the gauge of a shotgun does not follow the measurement system used in rifles and handguns. Instead, the establishment of shotgun gauges follows long standing tradition. The gauge of a shotgun is equal to the number of lead spheres necessary to equal one pound in weight 9 If a pound of lead were divided into four equal parts and those four parts were reshaped into spheres, the gun firing one of those spheres would be a 4 gauge shotgun 9 If the same pound of lead were divided into twelve equal parts, the gauge of the gun firing one of these spheres would be a 12 gauge shotgun. The bore diameter of a 12 gauge shotgun measures .729 inches. 27 Most modern shotguns are chambered for ammunition in 10 gauge, 12 gauge, 16 gauge, 20 gauge, and 28 gauge. Shotgun ammunition in the United States is manufactured in 25NRA, Fact Book, p. 56. 26Omark, Reioadin2 Manual, pp. 30-39. 27NRA, Fact Book, pp. 179-85. 443 lengths of two and three-quarters inches or three inches. 28 With conventions there is often an exception and this is true for shotguns. The exception to the rule is the .410 bore shotgun. The .410 shotgun has a period before the measurement telling the reader that the measurement is in inches. The .410 shotgun is not a gauge but rather a bore; the diameter of the bore being measured in inches. 29 3o If the .410 bore were expressed as a gauge it would be 67 gauge. 3~ 32 Shotgun shells are usually filled with shot in sizes from large O0 buck shot down to small number 12 shot. Shotgun shells can be manufactured with only one projectile called a slug. InterchangabUity Of Cartridges Firearms chambered for a particular cartridge type cannot fire a different cartridge. This is a general observation. However, there are a number of exceptions to this generalization. As mentioned above, firearms chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge will also fire the .22 Short and the .22 Long. Other cartridge alternatives include: 2gIbid, p. 184. 291bid, p. 179. 3~ Keith, Shotguns by Keith (Harrisburg, PA: The Stackpole Company, 1950), p. 105. 31NRA, Fact Book, p. 179. 320130 should not confuse the .410 bore shotgun shell with a .41 Magnum handgun cartridge. The .410 shotgun measurement is carried to three places; the .41 Magnum handgun measurement is carried only to two places. 444 Firearm Chambered for: Mav Fire: .22 Win. Mag. Rimfire .22 Winchester & Wesson Long .32 Smith & Wesson .32H&RMagnum .32S&W or .32S&WLong .32 Long Colt .32 Short Colt .38 Long Colt .38 Short Colt .38 Special .38 Short Colt, .38 Long Colt .357 Magnum .38 Special, .38 Short Colt & .38 Long Colt .38 Super .38 Automatic Colt Pistol .41 Long Colt .41 Short Colt .44 Special .44 Russian .44 Magnum .44 Russian, .44 Special .45 Colt .45 Smith & Wesson 33 A twenty gauge shotgun shell can be loaded to and through the chamber of a twelve gauge shotgun. A twelve gauge shotshell can then be chambered behind the twenty gauge shell and the shotgun can be discharged in this configuration. The combination is known as the 12/20 and usually destroys the shotgun because of excessively high pressures. Use of one cartridge in a firearm chambered for another is an occurrence that can be discovered by the experienced firearms examiner. The use of alternate cartridges is usually not the result of a shooter attempting to inject confusion into the interpretation of recovered evidence but is typically predicated on ammunition availability. Rifling A rifle is a firearm \"... having rifling in the bore and designed to be fired from the shoulder.'U Rifling is a set of grooves cut or pressed into the inner surface of a barrel and designed to impart rotary motion, or spin, to a bullet. 35 Imparting spin to a bullet enhances gyroscopic stability and is a great aid to accuracy. Peterson wrote that the inventor of rifling was unknown. ~ Carmichael agreed and questioned whether tiffing was an intentional or accidental invention because some early barrels exhibited grooves that were straight and of no use in imparting spin to a bullet. 37 pp. 1-2. 33NRA, Fact Book, p. 66. ~AFTE, Glos~rv, p. 154. 35Ibid, p. 155. 36I-Iarold L. Peterson, The Treasury of the Gun (New York: Golden Press, 1962), p. 133. 37jim Carmichael, Jim Carmichael's Book of the Rifle (New York: Outdoor Life Books, 1985), 445 Olson credited Kollner, a gunsmith from Vienna, Austria, with developing the first rifled barrel in 14987 s There are four methods by which rifling is produced in the bore of a barrel: broach, button, hook (or scrape), and swage. 39 Rifling is created by cutting, or pressing (depending on the method) a spiral set of grooves into the inner surface, or bore, of the barrel. In addition to creating lands and grooves in the bore, the machine tools used during the tiffing process leave behind microscopic markings that are cut (or pressed) into the lands and grooves. The microscopic markings are used to identify the one tiffed barrel through which a bullet was fired. Lands and grooves cut into a barrel can be measured in terms of number, direction of twist, and width. The number of lands and grooves in a barrel ranges from a low of two to as many as twenty-two. The depth and width of lands and grooves varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and with the model of firearm made by a manufacturer. The direction of twist is either left or right. A bullet fired in a rifled barrel will have engraved upon its surface the number of lands and grooves in the bore of the barrel, the width of the lands and grooves, and the direction of twist. All three of these characteristics are of great value in fu'earms identification. Rifle Actions A discussion of rifle actions must include the distinction between muzzle-loading and breech-loading arms. Muzzle-loading arms are those which receive powder and projectiles through the muzzle end of the barrel. ~ Muzzle-loading firearms, fired from the shoulder, were in use by the 16th century. 4t 42 These arms were the best possible product of then- available manufacturing technology. One of the most difficult problems faced by those arms makers was the issue of a good gas seal at the breech end of the barrel, that end of the barrel closest to the shooter's face. Although the muzzle-loader was slow and cumbersome to reload for second and subsequent shots, the design had a life cycle of more than three hundred fifty years and continues to be manufactured today in small numbers. Creation and manufacture of a successful breech loading shoulder arm firing fixed ammunition was technologically possible by 1837. In that year the Dreyse needle fire bolt 3SJohn Olson, John Olson's Book of the Rifle (Chicago: J. philip O'Hara, Inc., 1974), p. 7. 39AFTE, Glos~rv, p. 155. 4~ Glossa~, p. 42Lyman, Handbook of Cast Bullets, pp. 34-36. 446 action rifle was manufactured in Europe. 4s Metallic cartridge development continued after that date. Colonels Berdan and Boxer completed their improvements to the cartridge in 1866. '~ There have been no major changes in cartridge design since that date:5 Design of gas sealing metallic cartridges, coupled with ingenious methods for breechblock or breech bolt mechanisms completed the development of the breach loading firearm. Breech loading made possible the rapid reloading and firing of a firearm. The action of a rifle is the mechanism by which the breech end of the arm is opened and closed. Action functions assigned by the designer can include extracting an expended cartridge from the chamber and ejecting it from the arm, cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a fresh cartridge into the receiver. Rifle actions manufactured today include: 0 Automatic, which will cycle the action and fire rounds as long as the trigger is pulled; sometimes referred to as a machine gun. 0 Bolt action, where a turn bolt or straight pull bolt is manually operated by the shooter. 0 Lever action, where the breech mechanism is cycled by a manually operated lever. 0 Semi-automatic, which cycles the action and fires one round with each release and pull of the trigger; often referred to as an autoloader. O Slide, where the breech mechanism is cycled by a manually operated forearm moving parallel to the barrel; also known as a pump action. 4~ Modern sporting ann rifle manufacturers such as Browning, Stevens, Remington, Ruger, and Winchester make a number of different rifle models. Remington alone offers nineteen rifle models for sale. Each of these rifles may be chambered for a different caliber. The Remington Model 700 bolt action rifle may be chambered for sixteen different calibers ranging from the small. 17 Remington to the large .338 Winchester Magnum: 7 Thus, although various makes and models of rifles may be chambered for different cartridges, a rifle is chambered for and fires only one specific cartridge. 43pe_~erson, Treasury of the Gun, p. 173. 441bid, p. 180. 4Slbid. ~6AFTE, Glossary, pp. 2-3. *Tpotomac Arms Corporation, 1993), pp. 40-42. 447 Handgun Actions The handguns most likely to be encountered by police officers today include the revolver and the semi-automatic pistol. The barrels of both the revolver and the pistol are rifled. Unlike the traditional rifling of lands and grooves, certain pistols of very modern manufacture feature polygonal rifling. 4g The revolver is fitted with a cylinder chambered to hold between five and nine cartridges. Each chamber in the cylinder is in line with the axis of the barrel and is successively rotated into firing position behind the barrel by action of the revolver's mechanism. Mention the word revolver to most people and they think of the standard, police type revolver where the cylinder swings out of the frame on the left side. However, Smith defined seven different types of revolvers including one that is semi-automatic. 49 As specified by the designer, with each pull and release of the trigger a semi- automatic pistol fires a cartridge, extracts the expended casing, cocks the action, and chambers a fresh round. Smith classified the designs into simple blow back, blow forward, delayed blow black, and locked-breech, s~ More than thirteen designs fall into the category of locked-breech) m Both the revolver and the pistol create markings on bullets and casings that are of use to the firearms examiner. The pistol creates additional markings on the casing as it is fed into and through the magazine. Shotgun Actions The major difference between dries or pistols and the shotgun is that the latter has no rifling in the bore. The three most frequently encountered shotgun actions are the semi- automatic, the slide action or pump, and the hinged frame. The hinged frame design allows the barrel(s) to pivot away from the standing breech in an up, down, or sideways direction. 52 Shotguns of the hinged frame design are typically equipped with one or two barrels. If the design includes two barrels they may rest side-by-side or one on top of the other. There are some exceptions to the convention of shotgun action design. One exception is a shotgun action of turnbolt design. A second exception is a shotgun action which includes 4SDimaio, Gunshot Wounds, p. 26. 49W. H. B. Smith, Smith's Book of Pistols 1968), 448 a cylinder that turns and aligns a fresh cartridge with the bore, visually very much like a revolver. This type of shotgun action is marketed under the brand name \"Street Sweeper.\" When a shotgun is fired in the commission of a crime only the expended casing can exhibit markings of value for identification with a particular firearm. The brass head of the casing may bear breech face impressions, firing pin impressions, or extractor markings that could identify the casing as having been fired in a particular shotgun. Because the shotgun is not equipped with rifling, markings on the wadding or the shot are unlikely to be of value in identification of an individual firearm. Nonetheless, over- powder wadding recovered on the scene of a homicide or from the body of the decedent, will be helpful in establishing the gauge of the firearm used in the commission of the offense. A count of the pellets recovered on the scene or evidenced on the scene by passage through an intervening object (such as through a door or wall) can greatly assist in the determination of the gauge of the shotgun discharged. If at the time of autopsy the decedent presented with one gunshot wound to the body and nine pellets of 00 Buck were recovered from him, this would strongly suggest that a 12 gauge shotgun was discharged at the decedent because 12 gauge shotshells are loaded with nine pellets of 00 Buck shot. F'wearm Discharge Regardless of action type, when the trigger is pulled in a rifle or handgun a hammer is released and strikes the firing pin. In some designs the trigger will act more directly on the feting pin releasing it under spring loaded tension. The firing pin moves forward to strike the rear of the primer with some force. The impact of the firing pin creates a potentially distinctive mark on the primer. In a center fire round the firing pin compresses the primer material against an anvil. The pressure associated with that event causes the primer material to detonate, The explosion of the primer material ignites the charge of propellent, or powder, contained in the cartridge casing. The power begins to burn and creates a large volume of gas. As the gas pressure builds the head of the casing is forced against the breech face and tool marks from the breech face are transferred to the head of the casing. Gas expansion within the casing causes it to obturate, or grip the walls of the chamber, providing an effective seal and preventing the gas from traveling with destructive force through the breech of the arm. The contact between casing and chamber walls, under pressure, can create discrete chamber markings on the sides of the casing. All of these markings are useful to the firearms examiner. Contained within the easing and allowed to travel in only one direction, continued expansion of the gas overcomes the inertia of the bullet causing it to gain speed and travel through the rifled barrel. As the bullet moves down the barrel it engages the rifling, begins to spin in the appropriate direction, and has engraved upon its surface discrete markings from the lands and grooves and the tools used to create them. After the round is fired and pressures subside within the barrel and chamber, the action is opened automatically or manually, and the expended round is extracted from the 449 chamber. The process of extraction typically places on the casing markings that are of value to the firearms examiner. Principles of Identification The firearms examiner will begin the examination of bullet or casing evidence by looking for class characteristics and individual characteristics. For bullets, class characteristics include the number of lands and grooves, the diameter of the lands and grooves, the width of the lands and grooves, and the direction of twist, s3 Individual characteristics are those discrete markings placed on the bullet by the set of lands and grooves in the barrel through which the bullet was fired. Class characteristics for casings include breech face impressions, the placement, size, and shape of ~the ejector and extractor markings, the shape, size, and depth of the firing pin impression,, chamber markings, and magazine markings (if any).S4 The individual characteristics are those discrete markings made by the one extractor, firing pin, chamber, or breech face with which the casing came into contact during firing. When working with fired bullets, the firearms examiner begins his work by weighing the bullet and noting evidenced class characteristics. Measurement of the lands and grooves, coupled with their number and direction of twist, will allow the examiner to determine the make and model of firearm through which the bullet was fired. The weight of the recovered bullet aids the examiner in determining its manufacture and possibly the cartridge.' There are several different methods by which lands and grooves may be measured. Each firearms examiner using the measurement methods will obtain slightly different results. As a control on this human variable, firearms laboratories use one examiner to make all measurements. Use of one examiner will introduce systematic error into the measurements. However, all measurements made in that laboratory will have the same systematic error. The issue for the investigator is that although land and groove measurements from different laboratories may contain the same numbers, only visual examination of the fired bullets is sufficient for identification purposes. The absolute identification of one bullet being fired from one rifled barrel is predicated upon the fact that when two metallic objects are in contact with each other the harder metal object will engrave markings upon the softer metal object. In the ease of a rifled barrel and a bullet, certain imperfections in the barrel's manufacture will engrave individual, discrete, and reproducible markings upon the bullet. These markings have individual characteristics. In order to make a comparison between a questioned bullet recovered at the scene of a homicide and a firearm recovered from a suspect, the fireaxms examiner will examine the weight, construction, and manufacture of the questioned bullet. The examiner will identify 53DiMaio, Gunshot Wounds, pp. 30-3 I. S41bid, p. 33. 450 the questioned bullet and select an identical cartridge from his laboratory's reference collection of ammunition. The identical cartridge will be fired in the recovered firearm. The bullet will be stopped, unharmed, in a water recovery tank. Good firearms identification laboratory practice calls for two or more rounds of ammunition from the reference collection to be fired in the recovered firearm. The recovered bullets are called test fires, or known bullets. The examiner will mount both of the known test fired bullets in an optical comparison microscope. Each of the test fires is compared against the other for the individual characteristics consisting of microscopic, engraved markings (also known as striations). If the two test fires compare favorably, the examiner knows that engraved markings from the rifled barrel are reproducible. The examiner then mounts the questioned bullet on the optical comparison microscope and compares it with one of the known test fires. If the striations on the questioned bullet match those on the known bullet then the questioned bullet was fired through the same barrel as the known bullet. The firearms examiner begins his examination of a fired casing by noting the words and numbers stamped into the head of the casing (if any) and looking for individual markings engraved on the casing. When a cartridge is fired firing pin impressions are struck into the surface of the primer. In certain instances the shape and size of firing pin impressions will immediately suggest the brand name of the firearm. As the powder in the casing burns the casing expands in all directions and breech face impressions and chamber impressions are forcibly pressed into the casing. Finally, when the casing is extracted from the chamber of a firearm, extractor impressions are engraved on the casing. It is possible that casings can be better evidence than bullets. Depending on the composition of the material they strike, bullets can be mutilated and their engraved surfaces rendered useless for comparison purposes. Cartridges are usually not subject to such mutilation and the individual characteristics on their surfaces may be more suitable for identification by the firearms examiner. 451 Works Consulted Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners.

Dimaio, M.D. Detection of firearm residues on the hands of an individual may be of great importance in evaluating deaths due to gunshot wounds. Detection of such residues on the hands of a deceased individual is often confirmatory evidence of a suspected suicide. One of the earliest methods of determining whether an individual discharged a weapon, the \"paraffin test\" or \"dermal nitrate test,\" was based on the detection of nitrates on the surfaces of the hands. Paraffin was employed for the removal of powder particle residues from the hands. Diphenylamine was the reagent used to detect the nitrates picked up by the paraffin. This test is no longer considered valid, as no distinction can be made between nitrates of gunpowder origin and those from other sources, which are quite commonly encountered in day-to day living. In 1959 Harrison and Gilroy developed a series of chemical spot tests for detection of metaUie components of firearm discharge residues. Such metallic substances mainly originate from the primer, though they can also come from the bullet or cartridge case. The authors developed spot tests for the presence of antimony, barium, and lead, substances found in most primers. These tests are inconclusive, as they are essentially qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. The concept of detecting metallic primer components has led to more sophisticated approaches now in general use. Compounds of antimony, barium, and lead are used in 9 modern non-corrosive primers. One or more of these substances are present in a primer, depending on the manufacturer. When a handgun is discharged, discrete particulate matter containing these elements is deposited on the thumb, forefinger, and connecting web, i.e., the \"back\" of the hand holding the weapon. The metallic compounds are removed from the hand, either paraffin, or more commonly, with cotton swabs saturated with a dilute solution of acid. This material is then submitted for analysis. The two methods for the detection of firearm discharge residues now in general use are neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption analysis. Neutron activation analysis is used for the determination of antimony and barium concentration deposited on the hand where a gun is discharged. It is based on the principle that when materials are irradiated in a nuclear reactor, some of the atoms present are converted into radioactive isotopes. The type and energy of the irradiation, and the decay rate, are specific for each material. A quantitative estimation can be made by comparing the elements' radioactivity with a suitable standard. Lead is not analyzed by this method. Neutron activation analysis, while extremely sensitive, requires expensive, elaborate equipment and access to a nuclear reactor. In contrast, atomic absorption equipment is relatively inexpensive and is found in most laboratories. In addition, atomic absorption procedures will detect not only antimony and barium, but also lead. 453 Whatever the system of analysis to which the pathologist has access, the procedures, for removal of firearm discharge residues from the hand are the same. The solution most commonly used is a dilute solution of acid. Four cotton swabs are used to remove the firearm discharge residues from the hands. Two swabs are used on each hand: one for the palmar aspect, the other for the \"back\" of the hand. The swabs of the nonf'kring hand and the palm of the hand suspected of discharging the weapon act as controls. If a person has discharged the handgun, firearm discharge residues should appear only on the \"back\" of the hand that fired the weapon, not on the palm of that hand or on the other hand. Some people, because of their occupations, may have high levels of barium, antimony, or lead on their hands. Thus if the \"back\" of the hand were the only area submitted for examination in such an individual might not have discharged the weapon. If analysis of the hand washings reveals firearm discharge residues only on the palms, this is strongly suggestive that the individual had his hands around the weapon at the time of discharge or was trying to ward off the weapon. When swabs of the hand are taken, a control swab dipped in the acid should also be submitted as a blank. Cotton swabs with wooden shafts should not be used, only those with plastic shafts. This is because wood may be contaminated with some of the aforementioned metallic elements; as wood shows great variation in the concentration of such elements, no blank can be used. It must be realized that determination of whether an individual fu'ed a gun cannot be based on absolute quantities of primer residue on the hands. Rather, it is based on contrast of the levels of these compounds from fight to left and from palm to back. 454 References Harrison R.C., Gilroy R.: Firearms discharge residues.

Also referred to as fixed ammo. Three basic shapes: straight, tapered, and bottlenecked. Head of the case is rimmed, semi-rimmed, rimless, rebated rimless, or belted. Centerf'u'e Cartridge: Cartridge in which the primer compound is located in primer cap in the center of the base. Chamber: Special enlarged area of the breech of the barrel where the cartridge fits when it is fired. Class Characteristics: Those unvarying characteristics of a particular make of fli'earm or ammunition; e.g., number of grooves in rifling, direction of the twist of the rifling. Clip: Mechanical device for holding cartridges to speed the loading of a magazine; commonly mistaken by the layman for the magazine. Deterrent Coating: Chemical coating used on smokeless powder particles to control combustion rate. Drift: The lateral deviation from its trajectory of a bullet in flight. Ejector: Part of the firearm action that kicks out or ejects the cartridge ease from the firearm after firing or during hand operation. Erosion: Removal of metal from the inside of the barrel by friction of bullet and action of the voluminous high temperature gases; generally first seen in the \"throat\" of the rifle (the junction of the mouth of the cartridge case and the barrel); will make some changes in individual characteristics. Extractor: Part of the action of the firearm that pulls or withdraws the cartridge case form the chamber. Firing Pin: Part of the action that transmits the blow that detonates the primer. Flash Hole: Aperture through the web of a centerfire case from the primer pocket through which primer flame passes to ignite the powder. Groove Diameter: Diameter of a bore measured from depth of groove to depth of opposite groove. Grooves: Spiral cuts or impressions inside a barrel that rotate the projectile and stabilize its flight. Hammer: Part of the action that strikes the primer or moves the firing pin forward, causing it to strike the primer. 458 Handgun: Short firearm intended to be aimed and fired from one hand. Three types: Automatic Pistol (semiautomatic) - Common term for a self-loading handgun that fires, ejects the empty cartridge, reloads, and cocks itself each time the trigger is pulled; accurate designation of this type of fh'earm is \"semiautomatic,\" since the fully automatic weapon will continue firing as long as the trigger is held back and ammunition lasts. Derringer - Small, easily concealed handgun; may have one, two, or four barrels; fires a single shot from each barrel. Revolver: Repeating handgun with a revolving cylinder chambered to hold the cartridges; cylinder may contain as few as five chambers or as many as twelve, most common number being six. Two types: Single Action - Hammer must be cocked each time before fLring. Double Action - Trigger pull alone will cock and fire, although hammer may be cocked by hand. Individual Characteristics: Those characteristic markings or details of a firearm that serve to distinguish it from all other firearms, including those of the same caliber, make, and model. Keyhole: Shape of wound caused by bullet's not striking noes- or point-first; caused by loss of gyroscopic stability (spin) of bullet. Land: Original part of the bore left after rifling grooves are formed; width and number constitute class characteristics. Leading: Deposit of lead in the bore of the rifle or pistol when lead bullets are fired; extensive, positive bullet identification is difficult if not impossible. Magazine: Holder for cartridges in a repeating firearm from which cartridges are automatically chambered; sometimes detachable (as in semiautomatic pistols); commonly, though inaccurately, referred to as clip. Magnum: Cartridge of greater power than earlier standards for the same caliber; also, firearm with the capacity to use magnum cartridges. Manufacturers sometimes use word for glamour, not to indicate increased power. Metal Fouling: Deposit of metal in bore, from bullet or jacket. Muzzle Energy: Amount of energy of the bullet at the muzzle expressed in foot pounds (Fp). 459 Muzzle Velocity: Speed of the bullet or shot at the muzzle expressed in feet per second (fps); measurement customarily made a few feet away from the muzzle. Penetrating and Perforating Wound: Penetrating - wound with an entry but no exit. Perforating - a \"through-and-through\" wound; has an entry and an exit. The terms \"penetrating\" and \"perforating\" apply to missile wounds as well as stab wounds. In a penetrating missile wound, the projectile is retained within the anatomic region or in organ or the tissue involved; in a perforating missile wound, the projectile is not retained. Powder: Two basic types - Black Powder: Mixture of 10 parts sulfur, 15 parts charcoal and 75 parts potassium nitrate by weight; presently used in muzzle loading rifles and shotguns and cap and ball pistols; ignitable by shock, friction, or spark. Smokeless Powder: High-energy chemical compound that requires a high kindling temperature for\" ignition; does not ignite form shock or friction; grains usually ball- shaped or tubular; burns rather than explodes; rate of burn increases with confinement. Two types - Single base smokeless powder: composed of nitrocellulose. Double base smokeless powder: nitrocellulose. composed Of nitroglycerin absorbed in Primer: Small metal cap holding compound that is detonated by blow from either the hammer or the firing pin; replaceable ion centerfire cartridges; compound variable, but customarily contains some or all of the following: antimony, barium, lead, mercury, and potassium. Range: Maximum distance a bullet will travel. Examples: maximum range at muzzle elevation between 20 ~ and 35 ~ - .22 long rifle with 40 grains of powder = 1500 yards; .45 ACP with 234 grains of powder = 3500 yards. Also, distance that bullet traveled from muzzle to target. Recoil: \"Kick\"; backward motion of gun when fired. Ricochet: Glancing shot. Rifling: Spiral grooves, parallel-cut or engraved on the inner surface of the barrel; sometimes formed by forcing a tungsten carbide steel button in the negative image of the rifling through the bore by hydraulic pressures; primarily to impart to bullet a rotation or spin around its own axis in order to keep it gyroscopically straight or point-first, and secondarily to retain the bullet in the barrel to await more complete combustion of the propellant. A class characteristic. 460 Rim Fire Cartridge: Cartridge in which the primer compound is positioned in the hollow rim of the cartridge case. Squib Load: Defective load that does not impart full propulsive power to the projectile; hence bullet fired has less destructive effect. Striker: Firing pin or part of the action that strikes the firing pin found in hammerless firearms. Trajectory: Path of bullet in air. Velocity: Speed of a projectile in feet-per-second (fps); important in determining trajectory, stopping power, and extreme range. Low velocity for bullet fired from a rifled firearm is from 600 to 1750 fps, high velocity form 1750 to over 3000 fps. Usually expressed in terms of muzzle velocity. Yaw: Deviation between the long axis of the bullet and the axis of the path of the bullet; can cause keyhole entry wound. Two types: Nose Yaw: Nose of bullet spinning around the axis of flight; variable causes such as defect in bullet and imperfect seating of bullet in case; tends to increase in flight, eventually causing bullet to tumble. Base Yaw: Base of bullet spinning around the axis of flight; variable causes such as excessive velocity, wrong combination of rifling twist, and bullet weight. 461 FIRE DEATHS I.

West, FDNY/BFI The successful investigation of a fatal fire is usually the result of a team effort. varying degrees, this type of investigation may involve the participation of f'trefighting personnel, fire investigator, police personnel, District Attorney, forensic pathologist, odontologist, toxicologist and radiologist. To Ideally, the most effective means of investigating fires is the fully integrated police/fire investigative team. Integral to the fire investigation team concept, is the qualified and experienced fire investigator. In addition to determining the cause and origin of the fire, this individual is uniquely qualified to collect, document and evaluate fire scene information. Since there are many facets of fire investigation, the fire investigator will also know how to access specific technical information and the specialized personnel necessary to successfully complete the fire investigation. The fire investigator should also be directly involved in the interview/interrogation of all persons having knowledge of facts surrounding the circumstances of the fire. The accuracy of statements made by individuals should be evaluated by him/her. The reliability of the information obtained should be supported by the fire investigator's own investigative determinations. It is important that fire investigators make every effort to arrive at the fire scene as soon as possible, preferably while firefighting operations are still in progress. At this time, in addition to firefighting personnel, witnesses and/or victims may still be at the scene. Also, the fire investigator can personally observe fire volume, movement and extension; fire operations and extinguishment; and specific fire conditions of interest to the investigation. In cases of incendiary fires, it is not uncommon for the arsonist to remain at the scene to observe his/her handiwork. A timely arrival at the fire scene may also preclude certain legal problems specific to fire scene searches and criminal investigations (refer to Appendix E). Investigators assigned to a fatal fire investigative team should not be discouraged by the degree of fire damage. Do not be unduly influenced by the severity of burns to the victim or fire damage to the fire scene. These factors can be, but are not necessarily, an indicator that the fire was incendiary in nature. Be aware that the observations and opinions of firefighting personnel can be extremely beneficial to the fire investigator. However, he or she should also be aware that said personnel may have little, if any, fire investigation training. Inexperienced fire investigators and more commonly police officers with limited fire investigation awareness, have been known to assign a high degree of credibility to the unsubstantiated statements made to them by firefighting personnel regarding the accidental or incendiary nature of a fire. Corroborate all information regardless of its source. Fire/police investigators must make every effort to protect the scene of a fatal fire or any other fire still under investigation for as long as necessary to complete said investigation. The fact that numerous persons may have entered the fire scene during firefighting operations and the postfire overhaul process does not mean that the scene does not warrant protection. Where evidence of a crime is determined, a CRIME SCENE LOG should be established. 473 Upon finding remains at the fire scene, first attempt to determi,ie if the remains are human. If the remains are determined to be human, investigators will be faced with several problems. 1. Who is the victim? 2. What was the cause of death? 3. What was the manner of death? 4. Was the person alive at the time of the fire? 5. Why did he or she not escape? Of course, it is entirely possible that some or all of these questions will remain unanswered until the entire investigation is completed and all investigatory findings are thoroughly reviewed and analyzed. If the victim is known to be dead, unless absolutely necessary, the body should not be moved. Allow enough time to thoroughly examine the body and its immediate surroundings. Photograph the body where discovered. At this time complete a rough sketch of the scene and incorporate the body therein. Search the area immediately under the body once it has been removed. If the body has already been removed, it is important for the assigned investigator to examine the body at the location it has been removed to, as soon as possible. Photograph all evidence prior to removal and indicate the area of recovery in the rough sketch. Observe the clothing of the victim. Examine the body for tattoos, scars, jewelry and personal papers. This information may prove invaluable in ascertaining the identity of the victim. Due to the nature of burn injuries, it is especially important that those charged with the investigation of a fatal fire control their emotions and not be overly influenced by the effects of heat when applied to the human body. Consciously maintain a professional demeanor at all times and view the body as another piece of the evidence puzzle. Burns are classified by the depth tissue destruction: 9 1st Degree--Burned area red, swollen and painful 9 2nd Degree--Blistering, sloughing and scarfing of the skin may occur 9 3rd Degree--Complete destruction of the skin and charring of the underlying tissues Note: Some classification charts will list as many as 9 separate burn degree categories, with highest degree indicating the complete cremation of the human body. In most cases a fatal fire victim will be found face down. The fact that a victim is found in the face-up position, by itself, is not necessarily indicative of foul play. However, if investigators cannot account for the face-up position of the body, they should be alerted to the possibility that a homicide has occurred. Rarely will the human body be totally consumed by fire. Even under severe fire conditions, portions of the victim's torso and skull will remain. It is also not unusual for the fatal fire victim to sustain extensive surface burns and yet the internal organs will remain 474 relatively unaffected by fire. Burn patterns and degree of bum evident on the body of a fire victim should be consistent with the fire conditions at the incident scene. Conduct a visual comparison of the body and other nearby combustibles. Ask yourself the following questions: Do other combustibles in close proximity to the body exhibit the same degree of bum? Is there a discernable bum pattern on the victim's body and/or in the surrounding area? Is there a protected area under the victim? Are there differences in the degree of burn to various parts of the victim's body? Does the body fit properly into the fire scene reconstruction? If not, why? One of the most important issues that must be determined by a fatal fire investigation is whether or not the victim was alive or dead at the time of the fire. Some on-scene factors to consider include whether there is evidence that the victim attempted to escape; sign of struggle; visible soot (carbonaceous materials) in the victim's nostrils, mouth or throat; presence of cherry red lividity, or nonheat/fire related injury. A careful, on-scene analysis of ante- or postmortem injuries and/or bums may also enable the investigator to make a preliminary determination regarding the status of the victim when the fire occurred. Needless to say, a timely on-scene determination of whether the victim was alive or dead when the fire occurred can be of tremendous value to the investigator. Note: Although a field investigator may be able to ascertain, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that a victim was alive at the time of the fire, this preliminary determination should be considered tentative pending a final analysis of the victim's injuries at autopsy. It is necessary that those assigned to a fatal fire investigation be aware that certain postmortem changes occur when heat is applied to the human body. These changes are natural and should not be misinterpreted by the investigator. Pugilistic Stance: The pugilistic stance or boxer's pose is frequently exhibited by fatal fire victims. It is not a defensive posture on the part of the fire victim, nor is it caused by rigor mortis. This phenomenon results from the contraction of the joints and large muscles of the body under high heat conditions. Skull Fractures: Extreme heat may cause fluids in the skull to boil and expand, resulting in an explosive skull fracture. This explosive reaction, in some cases, can expel brain matter and bone up to twelve inches from the victim. A careful examination of the victim's skull may enable the investigator to differentiate between an explosive skull fracture caused by the fire and an implosive fracture caused by a whole range of accidental and homicide possibilities. Bone Fractures & Shrinkage: When exposed to high heat conditions, human bones will fracture, and the large bones of the body will shrink up to 25 %. The preformative bones of children are particularly susceptible to this type of shrinkage. Splitting, Sloughing & Blistering Of The Skin: (Can be postmortem or antemortem) Exposure to high levels of heat will cause the skin to shrink, resulting in a rip or tear that may resemble stab or incised wounds. In fatal fire cases, especially when the 475 victim evinces a pugilistic stance, this type of fire-induced injury can easily be confused with defensive wounds. Heat will also cause the skin to separate or slough from underlying tissue. This sloughing can be relatively localized or in some instances, large sections of skin will separate from the body in sheets or folds. Note: Tattoos may still be identifiable even after the surface layers of skin have sloughed. Human skin can blister after death. Usually postmortem blisters are smaller than antemortem blisters and contain only air and a small amount of body fluids. A more complex mix of body fluids are contained within antemortem blisters. Additionally, due to antemortem inflammatory reaction, this type of blister will usually be surrounded by a reddish ring. REMEMBER - DAMAGE CAUSED BY FIRE IS RARELY LOCALIZED AND SURROUNDING TISSUE WILL USUALLY EXHIBIT SOME DEGREE OF DISRUPTION, Asphyxiation by Carbon Monoxide: Asphyxiation by carbon monoxide (CO) is responsible for 60%-70% of all fire-related fatalities. Carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas, is a product of incomplete combustion of carbon-based materials. It is directly related to the supply of oxygen available during the fire and is present to varying degrees in all structural fires. There is a measurable amount of CO in most of the air we breathe. It is present in relatively high levels in the atmosphere of big cities, due primarily to auto exhaust emissions. Smokers also inhale comparatively high concentrations of CO and it is not unusual for a smoker to have a CO blood saturation level in the 4 % to 5 % range. Carbon monoxide has an affinity for red blood cells that is 210 times greater than oxygen. CO combines with blood hemoglobin and produces a complex called carboxyhemoglobin. As the victim inhales CO, oxygen is gradually displaced, resulting in CO asphyxiation. In determining if the victim was alive at the time of the fire, the pathologist will test for blood carboxyhemoglobin levels. A CO level of less than 10% is a good indicator ~that the victim was dead at the time of the fire. Inhalation of CO results in cherry-red postmortem lividity; therefore the presence of cherry-red lividity is also a sign that the victim was alive at the time of the fire. 0-10% 10-20% 20-30% 30-40% 40-50% 50-60% 60-70% of mental sharpness Slight headache, dilation of skin vessels Severe headache, throbbing Severe headache, weakness, dizziness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, collapse. Fainting, rapid heartbeat, collapse, death in some individuals Fainting, rapid heartbeat, possible coma, convulsions, respiratory irregularity Convulsions, depressed heart action, death Weak pulse, respiratory failure, death 476 (Source: Besant-Matthews, P.E. \"Investigation of Fire Related Deaths,\" Arson Investigation, California District Attorney's Association, Sacremento, CA,, 1980, pp. vii-8.) Relevant factors in reactions to carbon monoxide exposure inlcude: l~ 2. 3. Rate of inhalation (most important) Oxygen requirements--activity or lack thereof Individual susceptibility The synergistic or enhanced reaction between alcohol and/or drugs and carbon monoxide can increase an individual's rate of carbon monoxide absorption. Alcohol and drugs restrict oxygen to the brain and allow CO to replace oxygen in the blood more rapidly. Case #1 - Long Exposure To A Relatively Low Concentration Of Carbon Monoxide Small smoldering mattress fire produces marginally excessive amounts of CO which is inhaled by the victim. Blood saturation gradually increases over a relatively long period of time. When carboxyhemoglobin concentrations reach lethal levels, the victim dies. Blood saturation will show concentrations minimally compatible with death (40-60% CO saturation). Note: In the above scenario, ac.mal flaming may never occur and the victim may sustain little, if any, burn injuries. Case #2 - Short Exposure To High Concentration Of Carbon Monoxide A large, fast-moving fire traps a victim in a rear room of a burning building. Initially a closed door provides some protection from heat and direct flame impingement. However, smoke quickly fills the room and CO levels rise rapidly. Victim inhales high concentration of CO and is rendered unconscious, but continues to inhale additional CO due to the time lag in absorption and death. Blood saturation will be relatively high (70-80% CO saturation). Note: If the fire extends to the victim, he/she may also sustain extensive thermal burns. Other Types Of Fire-Related Asphyxiation: A reflexive constriction of the pharynx or epiglottis, caused by the inhalation of superheated gases, can cause a cessation of breathing. Inhalation of these gases can also cause an edema of the tongue and/or the pharynx producing same symptoms as asphyxiation. (Note: Victim CO saturation will be low). REMEMBER - DEATH BY OXYGEN DEPRIVATION IS NOT A RAPID PROCESS Large amounts of the victim's blood at the fire scene is considered unusual and should alert investigators to the possibility that the fire may not have caused the victim's death. It is not uncommon for a fire to be intentionally set to cover up evidence of a homicide and/or other crime(s). If blood is observed, examine the victim's body closely for evidence of nonheat- related injuries. Keep in mind, however, that victims of a fire may sustain nonheat-related 477 injuries in a myriad of ways. Such persons may jump or fall from great heights be struck by falling structural members injured in an explosion cut or impaled by sharp objects or sustain crushing injuries in a collapse. These and other similar injuries sustained during fire are to be classified as fire related. Fire-related injurie s can account for substantial amounts of blood at the fire scene. A systematic examination and reconstruction of the fire scene will, in most cases, reveal how the victim sustained specific nonheat-related injuries. This information, combined with other investigatory findings, will be of great assistance to the forensic pathologist in determining the cause and manner of death during the medicolegal autopsy. The forensic pathologist must be provided with all available information of relevance to the death of the fire victim. This information should include, but is not limited to, the following: 1. Any determination if the fire is accidental or incendiary. . A description of the fire conditions with an emphasis on the specific environment the victim was found, e.g. smoke and heat levels, structural failures, explosions, description of objects that burned. . Presence of flammable or combustible liquids. (The pathologist will then order specific toxicologic analyses of the victim's lung tissue and blood.) . A listing of any protective gear worn by the victim. This is especially important in fire investigations that involve the deaths of firefighters, refinery personnel, chemical plant workers, etc. . Did victim collapse immediately, fall any distance, exhibit signs of incoherence/disorientation or loss of motor function? Did victim become trapped or entangled by debris? Was victim caught in a blast, struck by falling objects, injured by sharp objects or shrapnel? 6. Did other person(s) in close proximity to victim manage to escape? Why/how? 7. Why did victim fail to escape? Thermal burns to the body of a fatal fire victim are frequently so severe that nonheat-related injuries are difficult to discern. Even the most experienced fire investigator may not be able to visually identify these injuries during an on-scene examination of the body. It is therefore necessary that the pathologist x-ray the body of the fire victim prior to autopsy. He or she may then be able to locate and identify foreign objects in the body, such as spent bullets, shotgun pellets, shrapnel, or knife blades. It is good practice to x-ray not only the body but associated debris also, as foreign objects will .sometimes pass through the victim (antemortem) or fall from the body as it desiccates when subjected to heat produced by the fire (postmortem). Due to the degree of burn sustained by many fatal fire victims, the fire investigative team may not be able to establish the sex, race, approximate age or height or identity of the victim by an examination of the victim's body at the fire location. When all other field 478 investigative means have been exhausted, it may be left up to the pathologist to attempt to complete the identification process during the medicolegal autopsy. In many ca:~s of death by fire, the odontologist may be called upon to assist in the identification of the fire victim. Teeth and dental work are rarely destroyed by fire. The swelling of the victim's tongue may serve to protect not only the teeth but the inner mouth as well. The odontologist will x-ray the victim's teeth, remove the upper and lower jaws and prepare a dental chart. If a presumed identity of the victim is established, antemortem dental records can be obtained and a comparison made. Even if a presumed identity has not been established, the odontologist may be able to identify the \"style of dentistry\" (materials used) and thereby the socioeconomic status of the victim. The effects of fire on the human body can greatly complicate the work of those involved in fatal fire investigations. Lividity, rigor mortis, body temperature are often compromised by fire, making time of death difficult to estimate. Thermal burns can mask wounds or cause wound configurations to change. As we have seen, certain artifacts of fn'e can be misinterpreted as blunt force injuries, incised wounds, a defensive posture, etc. Fire can increase the degree of difficulty during the postmortem analyses of the victim's blood and body fluids. In extreme cases, only the deceased's teeth and/or dental work, together with small sections of the pelvis and skull may remain. The crime scene itself can be severely contaminated and physically changed. Yet those charged with the investigation of fatal fires, working as a team, with clearly defined areas of responsibility to maximize interagency coordination and individual expertise, can bring most fire investigations to a successful conclusion. Remember, even fires that result in ruin and ash will provide some evidence for the fire investigator and/or the fire investigative team, to build upon and the fatal f'u-e will usually provide more evidence than any other type of fire. 479 APPENDIX A HEAT RELATED ILLNESSES HEAT CRAMPS Due to water and salt depletion.

(Source: BUREAU of FIRE INVESTIGATION REFERENCE MANUAL, NYC Fire Department, March 1991.) 482 APPENDIX C Cremation of the Human Body: Requires the body to be exposed to a well-ventilated constant fire for one to two hours, at 1800~ to 2200~ Even under these conditions, parts of the skull, pelvis, teeth and dental work will remain. A typical structural fire will seldom result in a fire that exceeds 1900/2000~ for an extended period of time. Fires involving high temperature accelerants (combustible metal fuel/solid oxidizer mix, e.g. solid rocket fuels, therrnite mixtures, etc.) can result in temperatures between 25000 to 5500~ Depending on the length of exposure, temperatures in this range can reduce the human body to a few pounds of calcium and silicon salts. Hair Discoloration: White hair will turn yellow at 290~ but other colors will remain unchanged. Human hair will char at 500~ Blood: Blood can still be typed if the temperature of the stain does not exceed 120~ temperatures above 400~ blood will deteriorate rapidly and will probably not be recognizable as blood. At Fingerprints: Don't give up on fingerprints. Although many fingerprints will be destroyed by fire, in some cases fingerprints have been fixed in place by heat, and soot from a fire may actually protect some fingerprints. Even the partial print of a burn victim can be of value as can sole or palm prints. Spontaneous Human Combustion: There is no scientific evidence that the human body suddenly bursts into flame. When this phenomenon is alleged, the typical victim is elderly, partially incapacitated and in many cases, obese. Commonly the torso is cremated, with the head and feet remaining. An examination of these cases has shown that ignition is the result of an accident, such as careless smoking. The victim is overcome by smoke, and the fire progresses as a slow, smoldering fire consuming the victim's clothing and other fuel such as bedding and upholstery. The victim's body fat begins to render, and if the body is positioned right, the rendered fat fuels the fire. The body is slowly consumed. This type of fire is affected by the insulative qualities of the materials burned (clothing, furnishings, etc.), producing a smoking flame, with a low heat output. The localized temperatures are high enough to destroy tissue and bone but insufficient heat is generated to ignite nearby combustibles. The manner in which the body burns has been referred to as the Candle or Wick effect. Backdrafl: Fire occurs in an area that is relatively airtight. The fire soon becomes oxygen depleted. Due to incomplete combustion, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases are produced. When an oxygen source is introduced, such as by opening a door, the collected gases ignite, producing a powerful, low-order explosion. Backdrafts are relatively rare, and conditions necessary for creating a backdraft are extremely difficult to intentionally reproduce. Flashover: Heat from a fire is confined by walls and ceiling of a room or compartment. A layer of superheated gases is formed at ceiling level. As the fire grows, the temperature of 483 the hot smoke and gases increases. Radiant heat raises the surface temperatures of combustible materials below. When temperatures reach approximately 1100~ all combustible contents ignite simultaneously. Once flashover has occurred, survival, even for firefighters wearing protective fire gear, is limited to no more than a few seconds. Flashover is therefore of great concern to firefighting personnel and is also a much more common phenomenon than a backdraft. Flashover is usually preceded by a rollover. Rollover: Superheated gases at the ceiling level ignite and propagate across the ceiling surface. This condition poses an extreme danger to firefighting personnel, as rollover results in a rapid rise in temperatures directly below, and the flame front can extend behind advancing firefighters. Flame Front: Leading edge of flaming combustion. A flame front in a rolling cloud of fuel and air can reach speeds of 15 feet per second. 484 APPENDIX D Source of Ignition: Heat producing device, substance or circumstance that could have caused ignition. Point of Origin: The exact physical location where a source of ignition and a fuel come together and a fire results. Fire Cause: The circumstances under which a fuel, air or oxygen and an ignition source come together. Plant: Used by arsonist to increase or boost the fire, e.g. kerosene-soaked clothing, cans of gasoline, etc.. Trailer: Used by arsonist to carry the fire from one area to another, e.g. accelerant poured between plants, or gasoline-soaked rags tied end to end. Accelerant: Any substance used to initiate or accelerate the spread of fire (usually a flammable liquid). Fire Physical Breakdown: (Point of Origin) Investigation discloses that the fire originated on the first floor of the subject premise, in the Bravest Uniform Supply Store, at the juncture of the west and south walls of said occupancy, on the floor, (~re Cause & Source Of Ignition) in the vapors of a flammable liquid (gasoline) introduced thereto, in heat from an open flame (road flare). Fire extended north, approximately 20 feet, from the indicated point of origin via (Trailer) gasoline-soaked cotton rope, to a (Plant) plastic balloon suspended from the first floor ceiling via nylon string and containing approximately 1 liter of a flammable liquid (kerosene), igniting the vapors of said flammable liquid. Fire extended therefrom to all areas of subject premise first floor and the entire contents thereof. Fire was confined thereto and extinguished. 485 APPENDIX E Michigan v Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 94 S.Ct. 1942, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978) Michigan v Clifford, 464 U.S. 287, 104 S.Ct. 641 (1984) PSNY v Calhoun, 90 Misc.2d. 88, 529 (Sup.

Geberth This article should provide law enforcement officers with an effective and practical strategy for the investigation of drug-related homicides. Drug related homicides are defined as those murders that occur as a direct result of the use, sale, and distribution of narcotics and other illegal drugs. The classification of drug-related homicides can be divided into four specific categories: drug hits, which represent the largest percentage of drug-related homicide and take into account the killing of undercover police officers involved in narcotics enforcement; interpersonal violence drug disputes; the murder of innocent bystanders; and drug assassinations. Although each of these categories involves violence and criminal enterprise, the cause, reason, and intentions for the murderer present authorities with additional investigative options and considerations. These categories are listed numerically based on their frequency of occurrence. 1. Drug Hits Premeditated murders intended to eliminate competition or enforce control over the members of a cartel or drug group are drug hits. Or the victim may have been murdered because he provided information to police authorities or was a potential witness in a drug proseeutiort and considered to be a risk to the drug group. Murders that occur during \"drug rip-offs\" are also considered drug hits. 2. Interpersonal Drug Disputes Homicides that occur spontaneously, usually without any premeditation, are often the result of interpersonal drug disputes. Such murders take place during drug-related disputes and interpersonal violence scenarios among and between those who under the influence of drugs and/or are involved in illicit drug activity. 3. Murder oflnnocent Bystanders Drug-related homicides also include the murder of innocent civilians and bystanders, including those caught in a shooting cross-fire or hit by random shots fired between rival gangs or participants during drug-related disputes. The number of civilian casualties, especially within the inner cities, has dramatically increased with the proliferation of drugs and the high-powered weaponry utilized by drug dealers.

Used with permis\" sion of the author. 497 4. Drug Assassinations Premeditated murders directed towards government officials, law enforcement personnel, and civilians are considered drug assassinations. Such attacks are actually a form of terrorism and are intended to discourage active drug enforcement policies and/or create the impression that the drug groups or cartels are as powerful as authorities. Drug assassinations rarely occur in the United States. However, United States authorities and government officials operating or traveling within countries that operate as home bases for the major drug cartels are certainly potential targets of an assassination as this country continues to put pressure on drug-producing countries. On February 26, 1988, New York City Police Officer Edward Bryne was assassinated by members of a drug cartel while guarding the home of a drug witness. The subsequent homicide investigation revealed that the officer was killed on the orders of a jailed drug lord because he wanted revenge on the police. The drug dealer had been prosecuted and incarcerated on an unrelated narcotics ease. The Investigative Dilemma Drug-related homicides are difficult to solve because of the nature of the incident. In most instances, the murder is a premeditated act and the actual motive for the killing is not readily apparent except that criminal enterprise or drugs may be involved. The exception to the above scenario is sudden and violent confrontations between persons involved with drugs and/or the murder of innocent civilians. Therefore, the police investigation actually becomes a two-pronged inquiry. The police must first investigate the homicide case and then concentrate their investigative efforts on the narcotics aspects of the case. Actually, these types of cases create at least twice the workload of a routine murder investigation and may be further complicated by interjurisdictional considerations. In addition, drug-related homicide incidents within the United States have significantly increased, which further depletes already strained law enforcement resources. In some jurisdictions, drug-related murders account for 40% to 50% of the homicide investigations. Jurisdictions that police large urban areas traditionally encounter high levels of violence and drug-related criminal activity. The clearance rate for murder within these jurisdictions has been appalling due to the overwhelming work loads, lack of personnel and the absence of an effective strategy for dealing with drug-related murder investigations. Investigative Reality Most drug-related homicides are eventually solved through intelligence and/or informant information. Witnesses in homicide investigations are generally reluctant to get involved. This reluctance oftentimes turns into active resistance during a drug-related murder investigation. The only exception is in the murder of police officers and innocent civilians. 498 Therefore, police must concentrate their efforts on obtaining information by gathering criminal intelligence. Intelligence information is usually developed through an independent police narcotics operation, which may evolve within the department or through outside agencies such as DEA, ATF, US Customs or the FBI. Such intelligence may be in the form of court-approved wiretap or electronic eavesdropping warrantsemployed during a narcotics investigation, the execution of search warrants, or through routine debriefings of information and/or subjects arrested for drug violations. Informant information is the most valuable source of inside knowledge about any criminal enterprise. It may be motivated by a number of factors including financial reward, fear, revenge, or court consideration in pending criminal action. The ability of authorities to develop and maintain current intelligence sources and reliable informants is a prerequisite to the successful investigation and/or resolution of a drug-related murder. Three-Phase Strategy Practically speaking, authorities should implement an enforcement strategy that addresses three distinct phases of the drug-related murder investigation. PHASE I - The application of procedural and forensic techniques and investigative resources to the homicide crime scene and murder investigation. PHASE 2 - The evaluation of intelligence resources with the objective of cultivating reliable sources whose information can be effectively corroborated with the information developed at the homicide crime scene. PHASE 3 - The implementation of the crime clearance procedures that enable authorities to successfully clear a case without an arrest utilizing exceptional means. The rationale of a Three-Phase strategy is based upon the premise that most drug- related hornieides are the result of ongoing criminal enterprise. The solvability of each case depends on the factual information developed at the time of the event coupled with current information intelligence. Phase One-The Homicide Crime Scene Properly processing a homicide crime scene is without a doubt the most important phase of any murder investigation. However, in drug-related homicide investigations, the crime scene process takes on an additional significance. In this phase of the investigation, it is imperative to effectively document every aspect of the event with the objective of establishing a basis for future corroboration. 499 The investigators must first attempt to establish the facts of the case based upon the dynamics of the event as well as the circumstances under which the person was killed. The investigation usually starts at the point where the body is found. This is the primary crime scene. This presents two possibilities: Was the deceased killed at the location of discovery? Or was the body dumped at the location? This is an important consideration because the answer will focus the investigation and determine the scope of the crime scene process. If the homicide is a \"dump job,\" there may be two or more crime scenes; i.e. the location where the actual assault and murder took place and a possible vehicle used to transport the body. Obviously, investigators will not have access to these areas during the initial inquiry. However, as the investigation unfolds, additional scenes may be discovered. These scenes and areas should be processed as soon as possible in order to obtain additional evidence and information. If the person is killed at the location of discovery, the crime scene process may result in the retrieval of new evidence as well as additional sources of information. Personal papers and effects, telephone records, correspondence, address books, etc., and any property that may aid in the investigation should be seized by detectives for later perusal and disposition. Such information might assist in conducting interviews with family members and friends and may well reveal a possible motive. Identification and victimology of the deceased becomes an extremely important starting point for the investigation. If the murder took place at the point of discovery, the identification of the victim is usually established early on either due to witness identification or personal papers and information at the crime scene. If the homicide was a \"dump-job,\" then identification may be delayed pending fingerprint analysis or subsequent notification through missing persons reports. During Phase I of the investigation, authorities should also attempt to ascertain the motive and specific category of the murder: drug-hit, interpersonal drug dispute, murder of innocent bystander, or drug assassination. Each category will suggest an investigative option.

Any subsequent prosecution under state or federal conspiracy laws and/or implementation of exceptional clearance procedures will require the independent corroborative information developed during the Phase I operations. Phase II-The Application of Drug Intelligence In this phase of a murder investigation, authorities should direct their resources towards developing intelligence information as it relates to the murder. The objective is to establish the identity of the members and structure of the drug cartel or operation so as to focus on motivations and possible suspects involved. Drug operations and \"key players\" within criminal organizations may change. Arrests, prosecutions, murders, and any number of factors may impact on specific individuals or groups; however, the illegal activity remains the same. Criminal enterprise maintains its continuity through adjusting operations and recruiting the members to engage in criminal conduct on an ongoing basis. This generates a tremendous amount of strategic and tactical intelligence information. This intelligence information, which is ut'dized by narcotics officers to identify, target, and penetrate drug operations and arrest offenders, can also be utilized by homicide investigators. Each drug-related homicide should be analyzed and assessed in conjunction with available drug intelligence information for the purposes of identifying and targeting specific offenders involved in the homicide investigation. In fact, in jurisdictions that experience a high percentage of drug-related murders, it is recommended that a homicide division maintain within the command an intelligence operation team consisting of a sufficient number of personnel to effectively engage in reactive and proactive operations. 501 The mission of this team is to develop pertinent information on the homicide through analysis and assessment. This can be accomplished through debriefings of confidential informants and the exchange of intelligence information with other law enforcement agencies. It requires establishing intelligence liaison with narcotics enforcement units as well as outside agencies involved in the investigation of narcotics violations with the objective of establishing an effective intelligence network. Many arrested offenders are willing to make deals. They elect to cooperate with authorities to avoid extended jail time. Their willingness to cooperate presents homicide detectives with an effective strategy for developing criminal informants for drug-related homicide investigations. Specific offenders who have been identified as witnesses in the drug slaying can be targeted with a \"narcotics buy operation\" in order to force their cooperation in the case. Or, A particular neighborhood can be targeted with a \"buy and bust\" operation with the objective of snaring potential witnesses to the drug slaying. In some instances, authorities at a homicide crime scene may be provided with \"bonus information\" in the form of elaborate records of drug deals. I have been involved in a number of drug-related homicide investigations in which the records and ledgers seized contained code names of dealers and customers, dates and quantities of drugs sold, and financial transactions of specific drug operations. Such information can be provided to narcotics officers to assist in their operations as well as used to target potential witnesses in the drug-related homicide investigation. The intelligence aspects of a drug-related homicide investigation require mutual cooperation between law enforcement units and agencies involved in narcotics investigations. Phase l/I-Crime Clearance Procedures Homicides are usually considered solved or closed when an offender has been arrested and charged with the murder. However, homicides can also be effectively cleared utilizing Exceptional Clearance. Exceptional Clearance procedures enable authorities to successfully clear a case without an actual arrest. This method of crime clearance requires an agency to document the following: 9 The identity of the offender is known 9 The exact location of the offender is known 9 There is sufficient information to support and arrest and prosecution 502 There is some reason beyond police control that prevents the offender from being arrested The specific explanation of \"beyond police control\" must be documented within the report dosing the case by Exceptional Means. An example of\" beyond police control\" in a homicide case would be the verified death of the perpetrator either through an unrelated homicide or hy official state execution. Ironically, drug-related homicides, which are difficult cases to solve, are particularly amenable to Exceptional Means clearance due to the continuity and violent nature of drug criminal enterprise. However, in order to effectively utilize this method of crime clearance, the agency must invest the necessary time and resources into Phase I and Phase II of the drug-related homicide investigation. The process of classifying each drug-related homicide into one of four categories and then applying the Three-Phase Enforcement Strategy to the investigation enables detectives to establish priorities and maximize their investigative efforts. Upon the completion of Phase I operations, a homicide investigation can either be inactivated or pursued depending on whether further information can be developed in Phase H operations. This strategy allows investigators to concentrate their efforts on the cases that are most amenable to clearance. However, in order for this strategy to be effective, police agencies must implement a persistent and aggressive law enforcement policy as it relates to narcotics violations. The strategic and tactical intelligence generated through this continuous narcotics enforcement will provide the informational basis for the successful investigation of drug- related homicides. 503 A UTOERO TIC FATALITIES / C~ 9 AUTOEROTIC DEATHS 9 ACCIDENT/SUICIDE [~ Autoerotic Practice 9 A solo sexual activity which combines ritual and 9 endangerment with erotic gratification through 9 fantasy. r~h \"Sex without a partner\" 9 -Not new- Mayan Culture 9 1791 Francis Kotzwarra I-h 1 791 9 First documented case 9 of autoerotic death 123 Terminology for Autoerotic Practice / Varied: 9 Suicide without motivation 9 Sex hanging 9 Plastic bag asphyxia 9 Sexual asphyxia 9 Autoerotic death 9 Terminal sex 9 Kotzwarraism Cb Autoerotic Activities 9 Masturbation 9 Voyeurism 9 Pornography 9 Fantasy 9 Cross dressing 9 Props Cb Important Factors to Consider 9 Injurious agent 9 Escape mechanism 9 Victim judgement [113 Estimates of Cases/Year Vary 9 Rosenblum and Faber = @ 250/year ~ E]srq[~ 9 has Cb Difficult to Gather Statistics Regarding [] [] Autoerotic Fatalities 9 Lack of established criteria to identify and label this type of death 9 Problems in categorising the manner of death 9 Lack of access to large numbers of these cases in order to study well Cb Methodological Problems Exist in Researching this Type of Death 507 9 Definitions 9 Insufficient number of cases 9 Samples unsystematically collected 9 Taboo 9 Secrecy D FBI (1981) Study of Autoerotic Deaths 9 Age range: 9 to 77 9 Majority: teens/20's 9 @ 45% married 9 Most middle class 1311 63 white males 9 3 black males 9 3 white females 9 1 black female r-h Asphyxia 9 A decrease in the availability of oxygen 9 to the tissues of the body, particularly the 9 brain (cerebral hypoxia).

Lanning Why Autoerotic? Autoeroticism may be defined as sexual feelings or sexual gratification that is self-induced without having sexual relations with another. It might be asked why someone would choose to have sex without a partner. There are, of course, many possible reasons, some more obvious than others. One of the more obvious reasons is simply that no sex partner is available when the sexual gratification is needed or wanted. This unavailability may be due to some special circumstances such as separation from a spouse or confinement in an institution. It may also be due to time constraints or limitations that prevent seeking out or meeting with a sex partner. Another reason for choosing to have sex without a partner might be there is no preference for or desire to have sex with another. This lack of preference for a partner may be due to a variety of personal inadequacies or insecurities. It may also stem from a need to be in total control during sexual activity. This need for control may result in the autoerotic practitioner assuming the dual role of both participants in some sexual fantasy. In other situations, another person may be present during the sex act, but because of these persona ! inadequacies or needs for total control, this person is used more like a prop than a true sex partner. In other situations, autoerotic activity may be chosen because of shame or embarrassment over the nature of sexual desires or fantasies. A spouse or lover may be embarrassed to admit that he or she is interested in bondage or sadomasochistic sex acts. Rather than communicate these desires to a partner and risk rejection, alienation, or ridicule, the person may incorporate these interests into autoerotic activity. In the previously mentioned dual role situation, the autoerotic practitioner could assume the role of both the giver and receiver of the pain and suffering associated with such activity. Another possible reason may stem from moral or religious beliefs. Sex with a partner other than a spouse may be viewed as sinful. Therefore, when that spouse is unavailable for or is uninterested in interpersonal sexual activity, autoerotic activity may be viewed as a more acceptable alternative than adultery. Sexual desires repressed as immoral or sinful may be expressed in rationalized autoerotic activity. Possibly the most common reason for selecting autoerotic activity, particularly for adolescents, is experimentation. The young teenager attempting to learn about developing sexual desires and body functioning is a likely candidate to explore autoerotic activity. 513 In the adolescent it is perhaps easier to see the combinations and complexities of motivation that drive any of us to engage in any form of sexual behavior. The adolescent may be experimenting in autoerotic activity because no sex partner is available. This lack of a sex partner may be due in part to personal inadequacies, insecurities, shame, embarrassment, or moral beliefs. Therefore it is possible that anyone's motivations for autoerotic sex may include part of one, one, more than one, or all of the above- mentioned reasons as well as any number of additional individual variations of them. Variations of Autoerotic Activity After the choice to engage in autoerotic activity is made, a wide variety of activity is possible, some considered normal, some abnormal. Probably the most widely practiced and best known form of autoerotic activity is simple masturbation. In its broadest definition, masturbation may be considered synonymous with autoerotic activity. However, a more narrow definition describes masturbation as obtaining sexual satisfaction from manual or mechanical stimulation of the genitals. No effort will be made to discuss whether masturbation is normal or abnormal. Suffice it to say, it is believed to be practiced to some degree by the vast majority of men and women, although some still consider it to be an offense against nature or the law of GOd. Other common forms of autoerotic activity include viewing pornography or erotic literature and sexual daydreaming or fantasy. Other types of activity may or may not be considered to be autoerotic depending on definition of terms and opinions concerning the nature of the acts. An individual using an inflatable doll or mannequin (pygmalionism) as a sex partner is in essence an autoerotic practitioner. A solitary voyeur prowling the back alleys at night for sexual stimulation is engaged in essentially autoerotic activity. Even the exhibitionist who uses his victims more like props than partners might be considered an autoerotic practitioner. Depending on how you define \"sexual relation with another,\" the individual engaged in sexual relations with an animal (bestiality) or with a dead body (necrophilia) might also be considered an autoerotic practitioner. It is obvious that deeper and more complex motivations, other than merely the previously mentioned motivations for autoerotic activity, are involved in these more \"unusual\" forms of autoerotic sexual behavior. Law enforcement interest in the above autoerotic activities is generally dependent on whether the acts involved are violations of the law. However, other autoerotic activities become of interest to law enforcement merely because of their nature. These activities are referred to as dangerous when there is the possibility of serious bodily injury or death. Why would someone choose to engage in an autoerotic act that is dangerous? Again there are many possible reasons. One such reason might be the need for risk taking. The prevention of a basic drive such as breathing sometimes causes excitement. Another possible reason might be the need for pain or humiliation. The introduction of pain to sexual activity brings with it a certain potential for injury or death. A third possible reason might be a need for experimentation. Continually trying something new and different may result in 514 finding something new and dangerous. A fourth possible reason might involve the use of hypoxia to enhance sexual pleasure. For some, the interference with the body's uptake and utilization of oxygen becomes a desired or necessary part of sexual activity in spite of or maybe because of the danger involved. A final reason for engaging in dangerous autoerotic acts might be that the participant is unaware of the danger. The danger or risk may not be desired, wanted, or understood. In one case, a young man died of exposure and exsanguination when he was accidently trapped naked in the bottom of an outhouse latrine while engaged in autoerotic activities involving coprolagnia. He did not anticipate that the rope he apparently had used many times before to pull himself up would fray and break. In some parts of the country, sadomasochists and bondage practitioners are being instructed on \"safe\" ways to engage in their potentially dangerous sex practices. Autoerotic Fatalities Almost any activity of man has certain possible risks. And so it is always possible that someone engaged in even so-called nondangerous autoerotic practices may meet with unexpected injury or even death. The risk of such injury or death is even greater when dangerous autoerotic practices are involved. The greatest concern of law enforcement is, of course, in those cases where the autoerotic activity results in death. The recognition and investigation of autoerotic fatalities may not be one of the major problems confronting modem law enforcement. However, it is an area where a small amount of training and knowledge can go a long way towards proper identification of a crime scene and the saving of investigative man hours. Although the number of such cases investigated by the police may be relatively small, any situation involving the suspicious death of a human being must be considered a serious matter. Although the manner of death during autoerotic activity is usually accidental, it can be natural, suicide, or even homicide. An individual engaged in either nondangerous or dangerous autoerotic practices may die of natural causes such as a heart attack. The autoerotic activity may or may not have been a contributing factor. In any case, the evidence of autoerotic activity (bondage, erotica, fetishism, etc.) might be confusing or misleading to the police investigator in such a case. It is also possible that a person engaged in autoerotic activity may decide at some point to commit suicide. This point of decision might be prior to engaging in the activity but with the person then deliberately deciding to incorporate his or her autoerotic activity into the suicide or vice versa. This point of decision might also be during the autoerotic activity. In either case, because autoerotic fatalities are typically accidental deaths, determining the manner of death would be extremely difficult. Hopefully, in most cases there will be some behavioral indicators prior to the act that such a suicide was intended. In other cases, a friend or relative may alter the appearance of a true accidental autoerotic death scene to make it look like a suicide. An individual engaged in autoerotic activity may also become the victim of a homicide. The autoerotic activity may have nothing to do with the homicide. The victim, 515 for example, coincidently may be found engaged in autoerotic activity when the killer strikes. The autoerotic activity may also have some bearing on the homicide. In one case, for example, a wife shot and killed her husband in his bed, believing he was in fact her husband's female lover. What she did not know at the time of the shooting was that her husband was a transvestite and had fallen asleep dressed in his female clothing after engaging in autoerotic activity. In other cases, homicide crime scenes may be deliberately staged to appear to be accidental autoerotic deaths. Various items (mirrors, bondage, escape mechanism, etc.) indicating autoerotic sexual activity might be planted at the crime scene to mislead the police investigator. Typical Autoerotic Fatalities The manner of death in most autoerotic fatalities is accidental. This is particularly true in dangerous autoerotic practices. Because of the inherent risks in such practices, a variety of things can and do go wrong, which can result in the death of the participant. The most common form of dangerous autoerotic activity involves the use of some method of asphyxia to achieve a state of euphoria during the sexual activity. Any of the following four methods of asphyxia can and have been selected by the autoerotic practitioner: (1) Neck compression (includes hanging and strangulation), (2) airway obstruction (includes suffocation and choking), (3) chest compression, and (4) oxygen exclusion. If any of these four methods of asphyxia are not terminated in time by the autoerotic practitioner, death will result. Therefore, the most common cause of death in autoerotic fatalities is asphyxiation. It is important to note the distinction between sexual asphyxia and asphyxial death. One refers to the use of the effects of asphyxia to heighten sexual arousal and the other refers to the cause of death. Although not necessarily always fatal, the practice of sexual asphyxia is clearly a dangerous autoerotic activity. The autoerotic practitioner who dies while engaged in sexual asphyxia typically dies from accidental asphyxiation when for various reasons he is unable to terminate his means of sexual asphyxia. However, it is possible that someone engaged in sexual asphyxia might die a nonasphyxial death (heart attack, exsanguination, etc.) during this activity. Conversely, it is also possible that someone engaged in nonasphyxial autoerotic activity might die an asphyxial death (compression of chest, hyperventilation, etc.). Atypical Autoerotic Fatalities As just mentioned, there are other forms of dangerous autoerotic activity that do not involve the use of sexual asphyxia. These activities can involve a wide variety of potentially dangerous practices such as the use of bondage, infibulation with objects and electricity, and life-threatening games. Although it cannot be said with certainty whether these nonasphyxial dangerous practices are more widely practiced than sexual asphyxia, they do appear to be less likely to result in death. Because deaths from such activities are less common, they are referred to as atypical autoerotic fatalities. 516 These nonasphyxial dangerous practices can result in a wide variety of causes of death as illustrated by the following examples: A bondage practitioner dies of exposure when he was unable to remove his bindings and is forced to remain seminude in a cold, remote area. A man dies of electrocution when the wires he was using to induce electrical current into his genitals becomes short circuited. A man dies of peritonitis when he failed to seek medical attention after inserting and losing a large soda bottle up his rectum. A man bleeds to death when he failed to seek medical attention after accidentally stabbing himself while using a knife for autoerotic stimulation. A man dies of a gunshot wound after he \"lost\" a game of Russian roulette he was playing with a partially loaded revolver during autoerotic activity. Equivocal Deaths The typical autoerotic fatality is an accidental death caused by some form of asphyxiation. However, as this overview of autoerotic activity has illustrated, such fatalities can and do involve any of the four manners of death and any number of varied causes of death. Of greatest concern to the police investigator is usually whether the death is natural, accidental, suicide, or hcmicide. Some cases are relatively easy to investigate. All the pieces are there and they all fit together. Many others are not so clear cut. In the investigation of an equivocal death,the police investigator has two major areas to evaluate: the crime scene and the victim's history. In order to evaluate the scene of a possible autoerotic fatality, the police investigator should have some knowledge of sexually associated factors such as sadism, masochism, bondage, fetishism, transvestism, ritualism, and fantasy. In addition, the investigator should know what a typical autoerotic death scene looks like, including methods of escape and evidence of prior activity. The investigator should also be aware of the typical victim profile. In evaluating any crime, the assistance of a good, qualified forensic scientist can be invaluable. This is especially true when evaluating a questionable autoerotic death or one involving an altered or staged crime scene. A forensic scientist who can recognize and evaluate forensic considerations such as petechial hemorrhage~, pulmonary edema, hyoid bone fracture, bloody mucous from head orifices, ligature mark locations, absent or 517 inconsistent lividity, and seminal discharges can make the difference in the proper determination of the manner of death. The evaluation of the victim's history and background is the other critical area in the investigation of an autoerotic fatality. A good psychological autopsy to determine the victim's state of mind and behavior prior to the incident may be the best way to determine if a death was suicide or an accident. The background investigation should include interviews of friends, relatives, co-workers, etc., to determine these things as well as to determine any indications of prior autoerotic activity. Any diaries, writings, or recordings should be examined and evaluated whenever possible. Any area to which the victim had access or expectation of privacy should be searched in accordance with appropriate legal considerations in an effort to establish victim's state of mind and sexual interests and/or to uncover evidence of prior autoerotic activity. 518 SUICIDE I.

Geberth The reasons a person Mils himself can be as simple or as complex as life itself. The person who commits suicide may accept his action as a solution to a severe physical or psychological problem. During a police investigation of a suicide, oftentimes a note will be found indicating that the victim had suffered psychological torment or was severely depressed. note will usually suggest that the person believed suicide was the last resort. The Depression is the primary motive for suicide; however, other factors frequently play a part in the decision. Alcohol, drugs, stress, frustration, fear, anger, hostility, and guilt may lay the groundwork for suicide. Some people may actually take their own life in order to punish their family, fellow worker or society in general for some conceived wrongdoing. In a particularly bizarre case, the victim planned his death for several months, and actually did it as television camera recorded the event. The victim, a state official who had been found guilty of bribery earlier in the year, had promised reporters that his story would be \"the story of the decade.\" On the day of his death, he called the news conference to resign his public office. As he read his statement, he urged the reporters and camera crews to keep their lenses on him. Then he pulled a .357 magnum from an envelope, placed the barrel of the gun in his mouth, and fired. He effectively blew his brains out for the viewing audience. Depression does not discriminate. It affects the young and old alike. Teenage suicides have been described as epidemic in proportion to their representation within society. According to a 1987 study conducted by The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, more than 5,000 people between the ages of 15 and 24 take their own lives every year. This is an invisible problem until it strikes in one's own neighborhood. Periodically, the nation's newspapers and television networks may cover this phenomenon by reporting a series of events including \"teenage suicide pacts.\" Ironically media attention oftentimes results in further teenage suicides. The course of action would be to seek out professional assistance and create programs within the school system to deal with this problem. There should be one hard and fast rule in all police departments: all death investigations should be handled as homicide cases until the facts prove otherwise. The resolution of the mode of death as suicide is based on a series of factors that eliminate homicide, accident, and natural causes. 1Adapted from: Geberth, V.J. (1988, Dec.) Investigating a Suicide. Practicle Homicide Investigation: Tactics, Procedures, and Forensic Techniques. Third Edition, 1996. 529 Suicide cases repeatedly cause more problems for investigators than homicide investigations. It is not surprising to encounter misdirected grief or anger. The surviving family inherits the grief of losing a loved one as well as the psychological uncertainty of whether or not they could have prevented the act. There is also the possibility that suicide notes may have been taken or destroyed. In addition, the weapon and other evidence may have been removed prior to the arrival of the police. I experienced a case in which the daughter of an 84-year-old woman notified the police of her mother's death. Unknown to the police, the deceased had suffered from terminal cancer and had been very depressed. When the daughter called her mother at home and did not receive an answer, she went to the woman's house, opened the door with a key and discovered her mother's body. She saw a .32 caliber handgun, which she recognized as an old family heirloom. She looked through her mother's dresser drawers for some personal papers and the codicil to her will, took the gun and left. She went home and called the police to report that she had not been able to get through to her mother. She requested the police meet her at her mother's apartment. When we arrived we were looking at a burglary-homicide case, not a possible suicide. Later, we were called by the family parish priest who advised us of what had taken place. The case was properly reclassified as a suicide. Surviving family members often have difficulty accepting that a relative has committed suicide. They have been known to accuse the police of a cover-up, or even petitioning state and federal agencies to review a local investigation with the belief that they can change the outcome. One of the most bizarre cases of suicide I ever investigated involved the death of a 27-year-old woman. She was discovered in her sister's apartment with a cut throat and three stab wounds in the chest. She had been hiding at the apartment from her boyfriend, who at first was our primary suspect. Upon a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the circumstances of her death, as well as the evidence obtained during the crime scene search indicated the death was a suicide. The cutting to the throat was superficial, with a stigma of hesitation, and the stabbing to the chest was self-inflicted. The weapon came from the scene and the apartment door was locked from the inside. Her palm prints were found on the blade of the kitchen knife. A note found at the scene indicated the victim's depression, and a subsequent handwriting analysis revealed that the deceased had written the note. A background check of the deceased indicated drug and alcohol abuse, and interviews of family and friends were conducted. Additional evidence was discovered that indicated the deceased has attempted to kill herself with a rifle found in the apartment. There weren't any signs of struggle and there wasn't any forced entry into the locked apartment. The medical examiner confirmed that the death was a suicide. 530 However, the next day an associate medical examiner reclassified the case as a homicide. Her rationale was that she had never seen a body with three stab wounds to the chest and a cut throat. She made the determination without consulting the \"tour\" doctor, who had been on the scene, and she disregarded his official notes. She refused to discuss the case with the detectives and insisted that the case was a homicide. After investigators conferred with her superiors, the case was properly reclassified as a suicide. But the damage was done. The girl's family is firmly convinced that their daughter was killed by her boyfriend. It is easier for them to believe that than to accept that she killed herself. Investigators should be aware of three basic considerations that may establish that a death is suicidal in nature. 9 The presence of the weapon or means of death at the scene 9 Injuries or death wounds that are obviously self-inflicted or could have been inflicted by the deceased 9 The existence of a motive or intent on the part of the victim to take his or her own life A final determination of suicide is made only by a medical examiner/coroner after all the factors are evaluated. However, investigation at the scene and inquiry into the background of the deceased may indicate the presence of life-threatening behavior or activities that suggest suicidal intent. Medical examiners/coroners are supposed to avail themselves of the input of the investigators who were at the scene and conducted the death investigation. The Weapon The weapon or means of death should be present in cases of suicide. The absence of a weapon, however, does not necessarily indicate that death was due to a homicide. The weapon could have been stolen or disposed of prior to the arrival of the police. There are many recorded cases where a suicide victim has arranged to make his death appear to be a homicide. Family members concealing weapons and/or suicide notes in order to avoid the embarrassment of having a suicide in the family or to collect money from the insurance policy is common. If a weapon is observed in the hands of the deceased, the investigator should examine the hand to see if the weapon is clutched tightly due to cadaveric spasm (instantaneous rigor mortis). It is not uncommon for a person who had a firearm or knife in his or her hand at the time of death to clutch it tightly after death. It is important to note this since, you can be sure that the person held this weapon at the time of his death. A person attempting to place a weapon in the deceased person's hand after death would not be able to recreate the same grasp. 531 A weapon does not have to be in the deceased person's hand for the death to be a suicide. The survival time factor (time between injury and death), that may have enabled the deceased to perform any number of activities, including disposal of a weapon or leaving the location where he first attempted suicide. Wounds Injuries and wounds in suicides may be similar to wounds observed in homicides. Certain observations can be made about whether wounds found on the body are consistent with homicide or suicide. For example, a person found dead from multiple stab wounds of the back would certainly not be considered a victim of suicide. In suicide cases, there appears to be a preference for certain parts of the body. If the victim uses a knife, the wounds will usually be on the throat or wrists. If the injury is a stab wound, it will generally be through the heart. Investigators should closely examine any slashing-type wounds for evidence of hesitation marks. They appear as parallel slashes alongside the mortal wound and are indicative of suicide. But do not jump to a fast conclusion based on hesitation marks. An assailant knowledgeable about these factors might leave similar markings to cover up a homicide. If the victim uses a gun, the most common part of the body affected is the head, followed by the heart. Head shots are usually found in the temple, the forehead or directly into the mouth and are at close range. There should be evidence of powder burns and/or smudging. In some instances, there may even be evidence of hesitation gunshot wounds or evidence of other shots fired prior to the fatal shot. Investigators should examine the hands of the deceased for evidence of any blood or tissue splattering. An important note: a wound is never too painful if a person is determined to take his life. Deranged people may inflict several extensive wounds on themselves before they collapse and die. Investigators should never presume homicide based upon a casual examination of the extent of the injury. My experience includes a case in which the deceased had first attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself with an electrical cord, but the cord broke under his weight. He then proceeded to cut open his stomach with an eight-inch knife and systematically began removing his intestines--which he cut into pieces using a pair of tinsnips. Suicide by fire is extremely rare. A person who has made up his mind to kill himself, however, may utilize any available method. Since gasoline is readily available, it is a convenient weapon. I have found more women resorting to death by fire than men. Perhaps the reason is that men are more likely to obtain firearms. The manner of death may be important in determining suicidal intent. For example, people who hang themselves or jump to their deaths from buildings have certainly 532 indicated an intention to take their lives. Similarly, deaths that involve a combination of methods, (poisoning, shooting, slashing, inhaling, gas, etc.) show an extreme desire to die. There are a number of possible motives to consider in suicide ca.w.s. I have found from my own personal experience however, that some motives may never surface. A motive only in the mind of the deceased is a secret well kept. Some common motives are: 9 Depression 9 Drugs 9 Alcohol 9 Frustration 9 Fear 9 Anger 9 Hostility 9 Guilt 9 Terminal Illness 9 Illness in the family 9 Severe emotional crisis 9 Psychological problems 9 Physical Deterioration 9 Loss of a loved one 9 Death of a child 9 Financial problems 9 Teenage problems 9 Loss of employment 9 Despair and general inability to cope with life In another case I recall, a body was found at the base of a high drop. It was apparent that he had jumped or fallen from the ledge approximately 70 feet above, but there was evidence of some cutting on the wrists. A check of his clothing indicated that his wallet was missing. Further inspection of the area failed to locate the wallet or any type of blade that could have been used to cut his wrists. Investigation showed that the deceased had been at work the day before and everything seemed fine. There was no indication from friends or family that the deceased was suicidal. Police in a neighboring jurisdiction recovered a wallet belonging to the deceased in a motel room. The room was very bloody and it appeared that there had been an assault. Examination disclosed a suicide note, an empty bottle of pills, and a bloody razor blade. Apparently the man had gone to the motel room, cut his wrists, and consumed pills. When death did not occur, he got into his car and drove approximately ten miles back to New York City. Then he selected a high building in the area and jumped to his death. The recovered suicide note indicated that he was extremely upset with his life and had planned to kill himself at the motel. 533 Suicide Notes A suicide note is certainly indicative of suicide, but investigators should conduct an inquiry to determine if the note is genuine. Was it written by the deceased? it written voluntarily? The note should be collected in a manner to preserve any latent fingerprints. Past writings of the deceased should be collected for comparison. Was A suicide note is an integral part of a professional investigation and oftentimes provides detectives with a basis of inquiry into the background of the victim for a psychological autopsy. In order to provide detectives with some insight into a \"suicidal mind,\" I have provided excerpts of suicide notes from cases I have investigated over the years. These notes and brief case histories bring us into the psychology of suicide, Dearest Mom and Dad, I guess the past ten years escapades have f'mally paid off-with my Life...I'm sorry I'm letting a lot of people down, who had faith in me, but I no longer had any faith in myself... The young man had a serious problem with alcohol. The note was two pages long and contained his telephone number and home address. It was found in his vehicle, which had been left parked on the George Washington Bridge in New York City. The note also contained a drawing indicating that he jumped into the Hudson River. His body was found five days later. To my family, I just got a little tired. It's not your fault, but I want you to know I love you very much...Love always Dad. This was the suicide note of a police officer I had known for 15 years. I never suspected that he could commit suicide. I interviewed his wife, who said, \"This was not the man you or I knew. He changed. There was a drastic change during the week. I think it was the medication he was taking.\" The officer had a prescription for an infection. It had put him into a deep depression. Last will and testament, Everything goes to (Jim) with the exception of the things that belong to (John) I love you all. A young woman, who had moved to New York City from the Midwest, had become depressed with her life. Although she had a good job as a nurse her real goal was to be in the fashion industry. She decided to kill herself in front of her place of work. She probably decided that no one would miss her and she did not want to die alone, so she took her pet dog with her. She hooked up a vacuum cleaner hose to the exhaust pipe of her car, and ran the hose into her vehicle. She was found be her fellow employees the next morning. 534 Now, (Eva) doesn't have to say Oh she's a pain now I'm dead. Now everybody is happy. I hope I wasn't a problem to nobody but if I was now I am not...I hope I didn't cause so much trouble. Tell everybody I say goodbye. Have a Happy Thanksgiving... This sad case involved a 12-year-old girl who took her life rather than being sexually abused further by her father, who had been recently released from prison. Investigation indicated that she had been abused since she was five years old. She shot herself with an unlicensed .38 caliber after swallowing a number of pills. Brother and sister, we didn't have anything else in this world. Please put our bodies in the same coffin...We love you all...Don't be sad about us. Everything is in God's hands... This is a classic \"Lover's suicide pact.\" The two bodies were found in bed in a motel room. Both had been shot through the head. The male had the gun in his hand. The note was found on a lamp table next to a Chinese symbol, which meant eternity. Background Information A suicide victim may have indicated an intent to commit suicide through activities and statements prior to death. Many suicides are preceded by verbal threats of self- destruction and other indications of despondence. In some instances these threats are made to people the deceased respects. In other instances a sudden change in behavior is shown by more subtle actions such as increasing life insurance, giving away prized possessions, disregarding a doctor's advice, or abusing alcohol or drugs. Any diaries, unmailed letters, or similar writings should be examined for information that may explain the death. Obviously, the stated intention of a person to take his or her life and other sudden and unexplained activities are important investigative considerations. I recommend that investigators consider the application of a psychological autopsy. A psychological autopsy is a collaborative procedure involving law enforcement and mental health experts who attempt to determine the state of mind of a person prior to the fatal act. By examining the victim's life style and interviewing the victim's friends and relatives, they determine whether the death was accidental or involved suicide. Warning Signs 9 A change in sleeping habits; sleeping more than usual or staying up later, followed by sadness 535 9 A lack of interest in sex; loss of sex drive 9 A change in eating habits; weight loss or lack of appetite 9 A sudden drop in grades or school attendance (young people) 9 Loss of work interest (adults) 9 Loss of interest in favorite activities, hobbies, or sports 9 Loss of interest in friends, family, etc. Isolation. 9 A preoccupation with death, or an unusual interest in art or music dealing with death. Teenagers: heavy metal rock, etc. Adults: preoccupation with death and the afterlife. 9 Loss of interest in personal hygiene and appearance 9 Involvement with drugs, including abuse of alcohol Extreme Danger Signs 9 Suddenly becoming cheerful or calm after a depression; a sudden euphoria or burst of activity. This could mean that the person has resolved the inner conflict by deciding to take his or her own life. The decision is made. 9 Giving away prized possessions. 9 Speaking of life in the past tense. For example, saying, \"I've been a good mother.\" Suicide is a tragic ending to a person's life. Things may get bad, but never bad enough to give up your life. Police officers investigating such tragedies are often reminded of just how precious life is. loved you,\" or \"You've 536 Investigative Checklist Investigative Considerations * Evaluation of the wounds [] Could the deceased have caused the injuries and death?

U. Downs, M.D., Sandra E. Conradi, M.D., and Clay A. Nichols, M.D. Suicidal suffocation by forced oxygen depletion (envi- ronmental hypoxia) with carbon dioxide (CO2) and with propane is discussed in two cases. No toxicologic proof was available with the former and circumstantial evi- dence weighed heavily. The latter case demonstrated in- haled propane by an on-scene transthoracic aspirate; all other toxicology specimens, including brain, liver, blood, kidney, fat, and vitreous, did not contain hydrocarbons. This second fatality was complicated by multi-agent ov- erdose, including diphenhydramine, fluoxetine (Prozac), and nordiazepzm. The designation of these deaths as due to oxygen depletion involved careful scrutiny of the au- topsy, toxicologic, and scene findings. Complete analy- sis of all factors surrounding these rarely encountered suffocation deaths is usually results from hanging or drowning. Smothering gases rarely are employed actively to induce asphyxia. Accidental deaths are more frequently encountered and usually are associated with industrial exposure. Carbon dioxide and methane are most often implicated (1- 3). The authors are aware of only one report de- scribing suicide by carbon dioxide hypoxia (4); in that case, the immediate cause of death was drown- ing. Two suicidal asphyxias by suffocation are re- ported herein, one involving carbon dioxide (CO2 as dry ice) and the other propane. The value of scene investigation, toxicologic findings, and cir- cumstantial evidence is stressed in cases of this na- ture. In addition, a technique of on-scene trans- thoracic aspiration for toxicology samples is de- scribed. Received July 1, 1993; accepted September 19, 1993.

CASE HISTORIES Case 1 The decedent was a 36-year-old white male dairy- plant employee who had failed to show up for work on 2 consecutive days. His supervisor became con- cerned, went to his apartment, and found the door locked. Police were summoned and forced entry. The studio apartment's ambient temperature was 88~ (31~ and the officers noted a foul odor. A 2 \u008d 3-foot (60 x 90-cm) poster inside the front door of the squalid, single-bedroom apartment warned of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the bathroom (Fig. 1). Three other notations had been made on the poster, presumably by the decedent. Near the poster was a science fiction paperback book that had been taped open to a page revealing an ethereal figure with flowing hair. The text stated, in part, \"'You have made some wise choices. I con- gratulate you from all of us here in_the future...'\" An old, empty bottle of nordiazepam and half-full/ ASPHYXIATION - Downs 539 SUICIDE BY ENVIRONMENTAL HYPOXIA 540 Fig. 1. Poster found on entering the apartment in case 1. Note the warning of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. bottles of amoxicillin and terfenadine (Seldane) were noted elsewhere. The bathroom door was locked from within. The seams around the door edges had been taped shut from within with 2-inch (5-cm)-wide duct tape. Two empty, -12-inch (30.5-cm)-square milk crates were immediately inside the door, between it and the bathtub (Fig. 2). A phone book containing several circled names and numbers was positioned on the toilet seat. The closed tub shower enclosure doors had been taped shut from inside with duct tape. On the ledge within the tub were a partial roll of duct tape, an empty beer bottle, a clock, and a photo- graph (Fig. 3). Tape identical to that elsewhere was used to cover both the floor and overflow drains in the tub (Fig. 3), to seal the edges of a 12-inch- square window just above the top of the shower, and to secure numerous photographs to the side of the shower enclosure (Fig. 4). A partially burned candle and a black plastic wristwatch were on a separate ledge, near the front of the enclosure. An ashtray containing a single cigarette butt was on another ledge at the opposite end of the tub. Within the tub was the fully clothed body of a decomposing white man that was in a semifetal position on its right side. Near the right knee was the body of a calico female cat in a similar state of decomposi- tion. Decomposition fluid had collected in the bot- tom of the tub. No evidence of animal activity was apparent. The volume of the bathroom was -8,156 L (289 ft3). Additional history revealed that the unmarried decedent had had an 8- to 10-year history of ap- parent paranoid ideation with schizoid behavior. Family and friends described him as \"moody,\" \"odd,\" and \"'different.\" He had made a prior su- icide attempt -1 month earlier wherein he super- ficially slashed his wrists. He was not actively engaged in psychotherapy and was on no recently prescribed antidepressant medication. Autopsy revealed a moderately decomposed 68- inch (1.72-m), 180-pound (81-kg) white man with no visible recent external trauma. Healed linear scars were on the flexor aspect of each wrist. The auto~ lyzed and putrefied internal organs had no diag- nostic gross or histologic lesion. Results of toxicologic analysis of urine by thin-layer matography were the bases: caffeine, nicotine, phenethylamine, and doxylamine; acidic and neutral compounds were not detected. The liver ethanol concentration was 46 mg/100 g tissue. The liver doxylamine concentration was 700 ng/g tis- sue. The environmental atmosphere was not sam- pled. Death was determined to be due to asphyxiation resulting from environmental hypoxia caused by exogenous carbon dioxide (dry ice) exposure. The manner was designated suicide. Case 2 The decedent was a 35-year-old white male city police officer who had had no significant past med- ical history except a 1-week course of fluoxetine (Prozac). He had had a 1-year history of marital difficulties, and his wife had moved in with two sailors -2 months prior to his death. She reportedly would call up her husband and ridicule him about his lack of sexual prowess in comparison with that of the sailors. One week prior to his death, the deceased convinced his wife to come to their home to discuss their marital situation. When she arrived, he reportedly handcuffed her, bound her with tape, and threatened her with a gun. She convinced him to free her whereupon she notified the city police. He was dismissed from work and admitted to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. On being dis- charged from the hospital 1 week later, he was ar- rested by county sheriff's deputieson kidnapping charges. He subsequently made bail and was not seen alive again.

Two empty milk crates are immediately in- side of the door. Duct tape was present along the seams of the door. The day after his arrest, he had a noon appoint- ment to see his attorney. When he failed to appear, the lawyer became concerned and called the de- ceased's best friend, who went to investigate. The friend found the house locked and called the city police. At about 1:30 p.m., he and the responding officer entered through an open second-story win- dow. They noted an odor of \"'gas\" in the house and localized it to the decedent's first-floor bed- room, where the body was located. The medical examiner was dispatched to the scene. The supine body was on a waterbed and clothed in shorts and a T-shirt but no shoes or socks (Fig. 5). A half-empty sample box of fluoxetine was on a nightstand to his right. A motorcycle helmet on his head had the visor taped closed with transparent tape. A bath towel encircled the neck, forming a partial seal with the helmet. A rubber hose that passed over the towel and into the helmet (Fig. 6) was connected on the opposite end to an almost empty 20-gallon (76-L) liquid-propane gas tank that sat on the floor to his left.

The headgear was removed at the scene, revealing vomitus in and about the oral cavity, trickling onto the towel. At -2 h postmortem and prior to removing the headgear apparatus, an 18-gauge spinal needle at- tached to a 20-ml syringe was inserted through the right 6th intercostal space and -1.5 ml of trans- lucent pink fluid was aspirated. A repeat puncture yielded -0.5 ml of similar material. Both were placed in appropriately labeled 10-ml red rubber- stoppered glass tubes. A control sample was col- lected from the gas tank. The environmental at- mosphere was not sampled. The body was immediately transported to the morgue and a complete autopsy was commenced -4 h after death. The body was that of a 71-inch (1.8-m), Rigor mortis was moderate and easily broken. Livor mortis was dependent and blanchable. The 405-g heart had focal 20-30% ath- erosclerotic luminal narrowing of the normally dis- tributed coronary arteries. The 410-g right and 395- g left lungs were acutely congested and mildly edematous. The acutely congested 3,020-g liver had a greasy tan-brown parenchyma. The remaining acutely congested internal organs had no grossly significant pathologic abnormality. Toxicologic specimens of blood, bilateral lower- lung lobes, right hepatic lobe, bile, right kidney, urine, and ocular fluid were collected immediately on opening the chest and abdomen. The frontal ce- rebral lobe and cerebellum were collected as soon as possible once the calvarium was opened, -30 min after commencing the autopsy (41/2 h postmor- tem).

The sam- ple collected from the liquid-propane tank served as the analytic standard. Analysis was performed by differential columnar retention times. Of the multiple specimens tested, only the first transtho- racic aspirate (collected on scene) was positive for propane; all other samples were negative for vola- tiles. The cause of death was attributed to suffocation due to environmental hypoxia due to propane gas exposure. Multiple-drug overdose was determined to be contributory. The manner of death was judged suicide. DISCUSSION Asphyxiation may be divided into three broad categories: suffocation, strangulation, and chemical (biochemical) (1). Suicidal asphyxia is most often due to hanging or drowning but may occur by other means, including the use of gaseous agents. Death by the latter compounds may fall into the entrap- ment/environment or the suffocating-gas subdivi- sions of suffocation (1). Entrapment within a confined space for a period of time results in the victim depleting the available environmental oxy- gen by consumption. Atmospheric environmental hypoxia may be indicated by an ambient oxygen level of less than the usual 21%.

Suffocating gases, usually carbon dioxide or methane, decrease the oxygen concentration by displacement and have minimal innate toxicity [1,6(pp. 274, 1,239)]. Car- bon dioxide concentrations > 10% produce uncon- sciousness if breathed for even a short period (6, p. 274). Deaths from exposure to suffocating gases are most frequently accidental; however, suicide has been reported (1-4). The source of accidental con- tact is usually industrial (1-3,7). This may include exposure in sewers, mines, wells, tunnels, silos, and storage tanks. Another possible route of as- phyxiating-gas contact includes inhalation of vola- tile hydrocarbon gases, usually for desired intoxication or less frequently for deliberate (sui- cidal) exposure (4,8-14). Unfortunately, the former is increasing in frequency (8,9). All information available concerning a death from suffocating gas- eous agents should be scrutinized (1-3,8). In their initial confusion and shock, grieving family mem- bers may attempt to obfuscate the cause and manner of death in a suicide or accident by rearranging the scene and/or withholding pertinent information (8,15), particularly if autoerotic activity is in- volved. The typical CO2-related suicide involves enclo- sure within a confined space or \"'chamber\" (3). Reports of suicide actively utilizing carbon dioxide are anecdotal. A single previously reported case (4) described a 24-year-old white man who locked him- self in a subsequently sealed bathroom and appar- Am J Forensic l~fed Pathol, VoL 15, No. 3, 1994 ently induced environmental hypoxia via two carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, likely rendering him un- conscious. He then slipped below the water level in the bathtub, so the immediate cause of death was drowning. The case described herein is the first suicidal exogenous carbon dioxide asphyxiation of which the authors are aware. Carbon dioxide is a nontoxic colorless gas, nor- mally present in air at a concentration of 0.03%, and has its untoward effect as a result of oxygen displacement from the atmosphere (1,3,5). In a conscious individual, clinically threatening hypoxia may result from an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of -30% (1), although adverse ef- fects may be seen at lesser concentrations when combined with gaseous volatiles (16). Lethal CO2 gas concentrations may accumulate in preexisting or created \"'chambers\" as in this case when the decedent sealed himself into the tub enclosure with blocks of dry ice that were allowed to sublimate to the gas phase. Postmortem blood gas values are of no use when dealing with carbon dioxide as an asphyxiant, due to its presence as a normal blood constituent (1-3) and to bacterial generation and degradation. The environmental atmosphere should be sampled if possible (3) and, if not, the maximal expected am- bient chamber concentration should be calculated. Assuming that two blocks of dry ice (45.5 kg total) were allowed to sublimate completely in a closed 8,156-L chamber, the expected gas concentration would be 5.6 g/L (normal, 3.9 x 10 -4 g/L) (17).

The hose from the tank runs over a towel and into the helmet. This apparatus allowed laminar air flow to drive oxygen out of the \"chamber.\" dense than air (ratio of air density, 1.5 and 1.0, respectively) and will therefore collect near the floor or at the lowest available point (11,14). Propane is a volatile hydrocarbon used as a gas fuel and as a propellant. In excess of 22 sudden deaths have been ascribed to its use (7,8-14). Ali- phatic hydrocarbons classified as simple as- phyxiants include acetylene, butane, ethane, ethylene, methane, and propane (5). The toxicities vary: negligible for topical exposure, slight and re- versible for inhalation at low concentrations (18), and narcotic with anesthesia for inha- lation at high concentrations [6(p. 1,239),8,18]. Deaths are usually accidental, resulting from in- dustrial exposure or volitional abuse (1,2,9,15); su- icide has been described (1,2,11,15). The mechanism of death by volatile compounds is disputed but may include sudden cardiac arrhyth- mia or mechanical (rebreathing-induced hypoxia or airway blockage by vomitus) or chronic hepatic dysfunction (2). Of these, arrhythmia occurs most frequently and accounts for over half of all fatalities (2,9). To understand how these agents may induce hypoxia, one should consider that in breathing par- rafinic- or oleic-hydrocarbon-containing air, 80% of the total amount to be absorbed will be within 20 min of exposure (19). Absorption during the first 20 min is proportionate to the number of carbon atoms (more hydrophilic, more rapid absorption). After 20 min of exposure, additional absorption oc- curs very rapidly (19). The molecule is fat soluble to some extent; it has been reported to collect read- ily in tissues based on differential lipid content: brain > liver > blood > kidney (10). In case 2, the propane exposure was presumably brief. The three-carbon propane molecule would have been absorbed at relatively slow rate. Had propane been present in a clinically significant quantity, it should have been detected in the quite fresh post- mortem samples. We believe that because of the very small \"chamber\" created by the combination of helmet and towel, the decedent was able to in- duce environmental hypoxia quite rapidly. The pressurized propane gas would force the oxygen out by laminar air flow and minimal to no oxygen would be allowed to reenter the helmet. Thus, in contrast to a plastic bag-type apparatus where intoxicant and oxygen are rebreathed until both are absorbed to the point of death, this death demonstrates forced depletion of oxygen with minimal absorption of a relatively short-chain hydrocarbon gas and residual oxygen until suffocation occurred. Toxicologic analyses are critical in asphyxial gas deaths, not only to determine the presence or ab- sence of a lethal gas, but also to examine possible impact of any other agent(s) (1,7,15,20). These studies should ideally be performed on the environ- ment in question (1,3,7), preferably prior to ma- nipulation of the scene or the body. In the reported carbon dioxide asphyxia (case 1), decomposition rendered environmental study moot because various gases are generated and metabolized during putre- faction. Regrettably, the environment within the motorcycle helmet in the propane death was not sampled; this might prove useful should one en- counter a similar case. To document further the decedent's injury in case 2, a right 6th intercostal space and thoracic aspi- ration was performed at the scene (twice) 2 h post- mortem with an additional sample obtained just prior to autopsy 2 h later. Of these, only the initial spec- imen was positive for the presence of propane, con- firming that the compound had been inhaled. Tracheal aspirations have been performed at the scene of death or portions of lung collected at autopsy (1,20) for reasons identical to our own. The ab- sence of detectable propane within the multiple specimens in case 2 indicates that a small quantity of propane had been inhaled and/or that the expo- sure time was brief. A critical part of toxicologic studies is proper specimen handling. This would include procure- ASPHYXIATION - Downs Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 15, No. 3, 1994 J. C. U. DOWNS ET AL. ment as rapidly as possible. Ideally, specimens should not be placed in a plastic bottle or syringe, nor should they be placed in a rubber-stoppered tube; they should be deposited in glass containers with aluminum-foil or teflon-lined caps or in nylon bags (21). These containers should be sealed air- tight, stored at -30~ and analyzed as soon as possible. Prolonged storage at 4~ is not recom- mended (11). In the case of liquid-propane expo- sure, toxicologic specimens were obtained as soon as the autopsy commenced, -4 h after death. All of the specimens--liver, blood, lungs, vitreous, fat, and kidneys--were collected immediately on open- ing the thoracoabdominal cavities. The brain sam- ple was gathered -30 min later. A toxicology technologist standing by in the autopsy room im- mediately placed materials in appropriate con- tainers that were then stored overnight in a -30~ freezer prior to analysis the next day. We conclude that the systemic absence of propane at autopsy was real and not artifactual due to improper handling technique. Of at least equal importance to proper toxicologic specimen collection, handling, and analysis is the scene investigation. In the carbon dioxide death, the scene and circumstances clearly pointed to su- icide. Had a cursory analysis been done and/or had the note warning of carbon dioxide not been left, results of toxicologic studies would have been pos- itive only for the antihistamine, doxylamine, in he- patic tissue. There apparently has been only one previous case report with toxicologic results in- volving hepatic doxylamine (22): that idoxine HC1) tablets. 18 h later and had a liver doxylamine level of 14,000 ng/g tissue. Stud- ies on rabbits and mice have shown a median lethal dose of 250 and 470 mg/kg, respectively (23), which, 9 if comparable to humans, would suggest an oral dose of 17.5-32.9 g in a 70-kg individual. In case 1, the liver doxylamine concentration was only 700 ng/g tissue, which would be insufficient to explain death by an overdose of this agent. Had the scene in case 2 been rearranged, the examiner might not have suspected propane and might have concluded that this death was due to a multicompound overdose. The diphenhydramine level was within the toxic range at 2,400 ng/ml (toxic, 2,100 ng/ml; and lethal, >8,000 ng/ml), and the nordiazepam level was therapeutic at 204 ng/ml (therapeutic, 100-260 ng/ml) (24). Far greater significance may have been given to the fluoxetine- norfluoxetine level, which was a combined 2,450 ng/ml [fiuoxetine therapeutic at 90--400 ng/ml (24), Am J Forensic Med Pathol, VoL 15, No. 3, 1994 and combined level toxic at > 2000 ng/ml (Meeker JE, et al., unpublished data, 1992)]. The patient's response is also pertinent as he or she may tolerate levels slightly higher than \"normal.\" These cases reiterate the critical nature of com- plete investigation of the decedent's remains as well as of events and circumstances leading up to and surrounding death (1-3,8). In the case of the pro- pane death, the decedent was clearly alive in that he inhaled the propane gas and expended some ef- fort in arranging his death. The finding of propane within the specimen from the death scene confirms that he did inhale this gas. The autopsy findings were not specific and included the typical acute visceral congestion and fluid blood. Classification of the dry-ice death obviously was based on a \"'negative\" autopsy and circumstantial evidence. Six elements are significant: (1) a note specifically citing carbon dioxide, (2) elaborate preparations to seal the \"chamber,\" (3) a partially burned candle, (4) two empty milk crates within the bathroom, (5) the lethal process affected both subjects in the chamber, and (6) the decedent was a dairy employee. The final element is obscure un- less one is aware that dairy companies use dry ice (frozen CO2) in handling their product. The milk crates were apparently used to carry in two blocks of dry ice that produced the carbon dioxide gas. Common experience is that carbon dioxide vapor (dry ice \"'smoke\") collects toward the ground, and the deceased appears to have made use of this prop- erty. The candle may have been used as a \"'marker'\" to indicate that the oxygen concentration had fallen substantially. The door, tub enclosure, window, and tub drains were sealed to prevent the escape of the vapor. The fact that the cat apparently died at or near the time of this person's death points to an environmental condition that affected both beings-- indeed, the feline may have served as a \"bell weather\" much as a canary in a coal mine. SUMMARY Two cases of suicidal asphyxiation due to suf- focating gases causing environmental hypoxia are described that are particularly significant in light of the recent upward trend in intoxication and deaths from solvent abuse including volatile hydrocar- bons. Case 1 is apparently the first report of pure asphyxiation by smothering with carbon dioxide gas. Suffocating gases usually kill by displacing oxygen from the atmosphere, resulting in cardiac, mechan- ical, or physical derangement. The ~pical victim is a young white man who is alone in the bedroom, with or without evidence of autoerotic activity. The ASPHYXIATION - Downs 545 SUICIDE BY ENVIRONMENTAL HYPOXIA scene should be scrutinized for evidence of a \"'chamber\" or area for the gas to collect. The evi- dence from the scene may be altered by family ac- tion(s). Circumstantial evidence may be helpful in determining the cause and manner of death. The environment should be evaluated with atmospheric sampling if appropriate. Toxicologic evaluation is critical and proper collection, handling, storage, analysis, and interpretation are essential. A tech- nique of transthoracic aspiration at the scene of death is introduced and may yield pertinent results.

Why did their healthy infants die? There is no sickness, trauma, or injury to make the death understandable. The families are shocked and confused. An urgent call for help is made, and you are the first responder. As the first official person on the scene following the discovery of the lifeless baby, your duties in this situation may seem overwhelming. You realize that these parents are clinging to the hope that you can do something to save their infant, though the child is obviously dead. Not only must you try to resuscitate the infant, but you will have to deal with parental reactions ranging from numb silence to violent hysteria. It will soon become obvious to you that there are multiple victims of this tragic disease--the dead infant and the surviving family members. The first responder must be aware of and sensitive to the traumatic condition of the parents. Life-long feelings of guilt, sibling emotional problems, divorce, and even suicide are all too often the results of this tragic event. SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) families must be treated with the same degree of compassion and sympathy as other families who lose a much-loved infant to any other cause. Though you, as the first responder, cannot do anything to alleviate the parents' sorrow, you can provide emotional support and facts about SIDS that may ease their intense guilt feelings. This will be accomplished only when first responders themselves are knowledgeable about SIDS and sensitized to the needs and responses of the SIDS family. WHAT IS SIDS? SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), commonly known as \"crib death\" or \"cot death,\" is the number one cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age. About 6,500 babies die of SIDS every year in the United States (two per 1,000 live births). Statistics show that there has not been an increase in the number SIDS cases in recent years, but there is more publicity about them than in the past. SIDS is an extremely widespread condition, occurring in Europe, Australia, Canada, and throughout the U.S. at similar rates. It occurs in both poor and wealthy neighborhoods, in both urban and rural communities. SIDS is a definite disease that cannot be predicted or prevented, even by a physician. It almost always occurs during periods of sleep. The typical SIDS case involves an apparently healthy infant, usually between the ages of 4 and 7 months, who has suddenly died. No illness has been present; though the baby may have had signs of a slight cold. There is no indication that the infant struggled or cried out while dying. Sometimes, though, the child has obviously changed position at the time of death. 559 There is evidence that SIDS has been with us since antiquity. In Biblical times it was referred to as \"overlaying.\" Then, as occasionally occurs today, mothers slept with their infants. When a mother woke to find her child dead, it was assumed she had rolled over on him and caused his death. There is much confusion about SIDS among both the general public and the medical profession. Not until recently has serious medical research on SIDS been conducted. However, doctors are still not certain of its exact causes. One of the hypotheses generally accepted by physicians is that death in SIDS victims occurs as the result of a complete upper airway obstruction. The death, which takes place suddenly, is not believed to cause pain or suffering. The only way SIDS can be conclusively diagnosed is by an autopsy. Diagnosis is made only after all other causes of death have been ruled out; that is, the autopsy reveals no evidence of a rapidly fatal infectious disease, such as pneumonia or meningitis, or a previously unsuspected abnormality. Knowledge about the cause of death obtained from a thorough autopsy can ease the family's concern and intense guilt feelings. WHAT SIDS IS NOT SIDS is not caused by external suffocation. It is not uncommon for victims to be found wedged into the corner of their cribs or with their heads covered by blankets. Sometimes the face is turned down into the pillow or mattress or is discolored. Under such circumstances, it is natural to assume the baby smothered. However, SIDS also occurs under conditions where there is no possibility of smothering. Investigators have found that even when infants are covered by bedding, the amount of oxygen is not reduced to the point of causing suffocation. SIDS is not caused by vomiting and choking. Sometimes milk or even blood-tinged froth is found around the mouth or in the bedding. This has been shown usually to occur after death. Thus it did not block the internal air passages and cause death. SIDS is not contagious. SIDS is not contagious. One twin may be taken by SIDS, yet the other remains alive. SIDS is less common after the first year of life, so older children and adults are not at risk. The common viruses that appear to be associated with SIDS do not survive outside living bodies. SIDS does not cause pain or suffering to the infant. SIDS can occur within five minutes, and is probably instantaneous. The babies do not cry out and often do not show even the slightest trace of having been disturbed in their sleep. 560 SIDS cannot be predicted. At this time there is no known way to predict its occurrence, even if the baby saw a doctor the day of the event. Nothing the parents did or failed to do could have prevented its occurrence. HOW CAN I TELL IF THE INFANT IS A SIDS VICTIM? Remember that only an autopsy can determine if a death was due to SIDS. You should make no assumptions about the cause of death. You, as a first responder, can only suspect SlDS as the cause of death. Always give the parents the benefit of the doubt and assume SlDS until an autopsy proves otherwise. However, the fact that a healthy infant is suddenly dead may give rise to suspicions. The general appearance of the child in his crib may be misleading. There have been instances, for example, when a case of SIDS has been mistaken for child abuse. Therefore, it is necessary that you, as the first responder, know some of the identifying features characteristic of the SIDS victim as opposed to the abused child. The following table is a list of the general physical characteristics of each. This table will help you to identify the SIDS baby as well as distinguish him or her from the battered child. Table 1 SIDS versus Child Abuse and Neglect SIDS VICTIM 1. Appears to be sleeping. 2. May be twisted in the bed clothing. 3. Purple mottled markings on head and facial area. 4. Blood-tinged froth around nose and mouth areas. ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILD 1. Adult story does not \"sound right\" or account for all injuries on baby. 2. Disfigurements-welts, bums, bruises, etc.- which may be in different stages of healing, or may be scars. 3. Broken bones. 4. Siblings bearing marks of child abuse. 9 5. Physical evidence of general neglect of child (e.g., malnourished). 561 AS A POLICE OFFICER, WHAT IS MY ROLE IN THE SIDS SITUATION? When you, the police officer, are the first to arrive at the scene of a possible SIDS death, several tasks must be performed almost simultaneously. You should first initiate resuscitative efforts if the infant is not obviously dead. You must also conduct an \"investigation\" that will help determine the cause of death. Finally, you must provide leadership and protection to the SIDS family. It is essential that you begin resuscitative efforts if the infant is not obviously dead. You may save a life. These efforts involve beginning infant Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and continuing it during the transport of the baby to the hospital. CPR is a technique requiring special training and, in some cases, state certification. If you are not trained in this technique, do not perform it. You may do more harm than good--you may kill the one you wish to save. If you are responding with a partner, one of you should assume this duty since it requires your complete attention. At times, you will find a child displaying the obvious characteristics of death (e.g., rigor mortis and settling of the blood). Under normal circumstances involving a dead baby, you may be legally obligated to leave the body as is and notify the proper authorities, such as the coroner or the medical examiner. SIDS cases, however, are not \"normal.\" / The extreme emotional condition of the parents makes them completely dependent upon you. They are looking to you for help. The best thing you can do for these parents is to make them feel that something is being done. You must understand that often parents cling to the hope that their infant is not dead and can be resuscitated, even when death is apparent. They have expectation that you can save the baby. By starting CPR on the obviously dead baby, you at least allow the family to have the memory (e.g., \"If they had only tried, maybe...\"). These parents will have enough self-imposed guilt and doubt to deal with as the result of SIDS. This does not mean, however, that you axe to convey an attitude of false hope. Simply begin resuscitative procedures, inform the parents that everything you can do for the child is being done, and transport the infant to the hospital. In addition to beginning first-aid procedures on the baby, it is your job to conduct an \"investigation\" of the scene of the death. This involves observing the scene and making mental notes, which should be written down at the earliest opportunity. Certain questions should be asked of the parents to help clarify matters for you. This should be done as a dialogue, as opposed to an interrogation. Do not pressure the parents for answers. They may really not remember details. At times, certain items should be preserved for further investigation. This can be done by either taking them with the infant to the hospital or by making sure they remain in their original position until the death scene can be thoroughly investigated. It should be emphasized here that a criminal investigation should be conducted only after the autopsy has shown positive evidence of an unnatural death. There is no need to put these families through the ordeal and overriding implications of an investigation if all indicators point to SIDS. However, you should be aware of what to preserve, should the need arise. 562 Evidence to Preserve - Infant's bedding (sheets, blankets, etc.) Objects in crib (toys, bottles, etc.) Unusual or dangerous items found near death scene (plastic bags, sharp objects, paint chips, etc.) Medications - even adult (Note: you may wish to take with you to hospital When the time comes to transport the infant to a hospital, you should take charge of the situation. Make sure you tell the parents where you are taking the child. The parents should be allowed to accompany their baby in the police car. If not, give them clear directions regarding where you are taking their baby. Often the parents are in such a state of emotional shock that they are not capable of driving themselves to the hospital. In this case, make other arrangements to get them to the hospital (e.g., taxicab or neighbor). The parents may also need to be reminded to arrange for the care of the siblings. A member of your police team may volunteer to assist in such details. Once you deliver the baby into the hands of the Emergency Department staff, there is nothing more you can do for him or her. Your attention is now turned to the family of the SIDS victim. The reactions of family members to the SIDS incident will be as individual as they are. Many factors can affect these reactions: situation of child's death, meaning child had to the individual, marriage relationship, cultural background. You must not misinterpret or read into these reactions. And you, as the first responder, will have to be prepared to deal with them all. One of the most common immediate reactions to SIDS is shock and disbelief. This may cause family members to become immobilized; incapable of making decisions. Or this may cause them to act as if nothing has really happened. Externally, it may appear as if the parents are cold and unfeeling. It is not that they do not care, but just that they are having a hard time facing reality. It will be difficult for you to deal with these parents whose reactions are extreme. Some parents may physically act out their emotions, resulting in hysteria, crying or wailing. Parents may be confused and overwhelmed with guilt feelings, unfairly venting their anger and frustration on you. When anger is aimed at you, or perhaps your professional capabilities questioned, your natural tendency is to retaliate with your own angry remarks, which only compounds the problems. How can the police officer help the SIDS survivors in this difficult situation? First, you, as a professional, must be in command of your own feelings and behavior at all times. Act in a calm, efficient manner, exhibiting kind concern. While in the home, make the parents feel that something is being done~ Explain what you are doing and where you 563 are taking the child. Take command of the situation and try to protect the family from any further stress. At the hospital emergency room, try to keep the parents informed of the child's status. Be careful of what you say to your colleagues at the hospital. Causal comments such as \"smothered\" or \"injured\" may be overheard by the family and cause unnecessary emotional distress. Small, often nonverbal, gestures on your part are very important. By simply sitting with the parents, you are showing them that someone cares. Offer to be assistance to them--to make phone calls or to get them coffee. A sympathetic ear may be all these parents need. Be careful not to \"diagnose\" the child's problem or to speculate on the outcome. Let all medical information come from the emergency room physician. If you have any questions or comments, or wish conftrmation that the child is a SIDS victim, discuss these matters privately with emergency room personnel. The interview following a sudden infant death will be difficult for both you and the parents. You may already have much of the information you need to complete your report. If SIDS is indicated by the emergency physician as the cause of death, you should explain to them about the disease. Reassure them that they are in no way responsible for the death. If you need additional information, explain that the questioning is routine and necessary to complete your report. The emotional state of the parents may be such that you may wish to postpone the questioning. The questioning should be done as an interview. Ask open-ended questions such as, \"How was the baby yesterday?\" Do not ask leading questions or suspicious questions (e.g. \"You weren't drunk last night were you?\"). Do not ask questions that show you might doubt their capabilities as parents (e.g., \"How often did you spank the baby?\"). Give your full attention to the parents and listen \"actively\" to what they are saying. You will be able to obtain much information if you let the parents tell their story while you actively listen. Encourage them to continue talking by nodding and saying, \"Um hm\" or \"Yes, go on.\" Try to remain objective--do not express approval/disapproval with any of the actions or facts related. Try not to interrupt except to clarify something they say. If the parents become upset, wait quietly for a minute or two, then encourage them to continue talking by saying something like, \"You were saying...\" At the end of the questioning session, look over your notes to make sure all the necessary information has been obtained. The time you spend with these families may be brief, but it can have a significant positive impact that influences their recovery from this tragic event. 564 this may cause them to act as if nothing has really happened. Externally, it may appear as if the parents are cold and unfeeling. It is not that they do not care, but just that they are having a hard time facing reality. It will be difficult for you to deal with these parents whose reactions are extreme. Some parents may physically act out their emotions, resulting in hysteria, crying or wailing. Parents may be confused and overwhelmed with guilt feelings, unfairly venting their anger and frustration on you. When anger is aimed at you, or perhaps your professional capabilities questioned, your natural tendency is to retaliate with your own angry remarks, which only compounds the problems.

Blackbourne, M.D. Only in the last three decades has the full extent of parental violence upon their children been recognized and medical, social and legal steps been taken to attempt to understand, halt and prevent these tragic events. Prior to 1946 this phenomenon was generally unrecognized aside from infanticide, the killing of a small infant, usually by the mother. IN 1946, Dr. John Caffey l, a Pittsburgh Radiologist reported his observation of a common association of subdural hematoma and fractures of long bones. Silverman 2, in 1953 demonstrated by x-ray that previously demonstrated. In 1955 Woolley 3 noted that in many cases of long bone fractures in infants and small children, the injuries have been willfully inflicted by parents or siblings. This work laid the foundation for Kempe's pape r4 in 1962 in which he proposed the name \"Battered Child Syndrome\". In England the term \"Battered Babe Syndrome\" is commonly used, and elsewhere it is known by the names of the two men who contributed to its recognition \"Caffey-Kempe\" syndrome. The battered child syndrome may be defined as intentionally physical injury inflicted on infants and young children usually by parents or by parents' substitutes. The physical injury is most commonly mechanical force, but may include injury from heat. An associated form of abuse which may or may not accompany battering is emotional or physical neglect. The term \"Battering Child Syndrome\" was immediately successful in gaining attention for this neglected clinical and social problem. Almost over night it became the subject of frequent discussions at medical meetings, in courts, social agencies, the press, and on radio and television. Much has been learned, and much has been written in the intervening 12 years. An apparent increase in the number of cases may actually reflect only an increased awareness among medical, law enforcement, and social welfare professionals. INCIDENCE The true incidence of the battered child is unknown. From clinical experience, it has been estimated 5, however, that 15-25,000 infants are significantly injured each year in the United States under circumstances suggesting intentional parental abuse. Between 1969 and 1971 hospital admissions for battered child syndrome represented almost three percent of all pediatric ward admissions to the San Francisco General Hospital 6. Similarly, variations in death certificate reporting make it difficult to access a nationwide number of fatalities. In 1972 in the District of Columbia, with a population of 750,000, seven battered child deaths were documented, in 1973 five deaths. In a five year study in Philadelphia between 1961 and 1965 Weston 7 reported 36 infants and children who expired as a result of proven physical injury inflicted by a member of their family, paramour or baby sitter. FACTORS LEADING TO CHILD BATrERING Green s has identified three major factors, whose interaction leads to child abuse: the parent's personality characteristics which are incompatible with adequate child 567 rearing and contribute to their abuse proneness; the characteristics of the child that increase the likelihood of his being abused; and immediate environmental stresses which maximize the burden of child rearing. The Parent The family of the battered child frequently falls into the lower socio-economic level. Frequent moving leads to few roots in the community, and separation from other members of their family who may have added significant support to the family and aided in child rearing. It should be stated, however, that the battering parent may be well educated with a stable financial situation and an outwardlystable social background. The battering parent is more often female than male. Lauer 6, in a series of battered children compared with a control series of children admitted to hospital for other medical problems, showed that the parents of the battered children were significantly younger than the other parents. 21% of mothers and 9% of fathers were 19 years of age or younger. He concludes that this supports the popular notion that young parents with little child rearing experience, their own adolescent problems, and often an unplanned baby are predisposed to child abuse. It is repeatedly stated in the literature that many of the battering parents were victims of harsh discipline or of actual physical abuse from their parents during childhood. This pattern of child rearing can thus be carded from one generation to another. Frequently, one of the adults in the household is not the natural father or mother of the child - as for example in common law,' stepfather, stepmother situation or where the boyfriend of the mother resides in the house. Love and compassion for the child may be different, under these circumstances, from that of the natural parent, and the frustration tolerance for the usual childhood annoyances may be less. Another factor which may play a role is a feeling of competition between the abuse and the child for the love of the mother or father of the child. This competitive resentment may develop into real hostile feelings toward the child. Emotional immaturity is frequently observed in the battering parent. Actual mental illness may occur. Caffey 9 concluded that less than 10 percent of battering parents are severely mentally ill. Kempe s reports from his study that in 5 percent of battering families, one parent has a delusional psychosis and in 5 percent one parent appeared to be an aggressive psychopath. One of the many disturbing and difficult to understand features of repeated child abuse is why the other parent does not intervene, forcibly restrain or report the abusing parent to the authorities. The answer is as complicated and as individual as the psychodynamics of child abuse. In the case of a mother whose child is being beaten by her common law husband or boyfriend it may involve fear for her own safety or threats of physical harm to herself or fear that he will leave her if she interfered, economic dependency upon the abuser, or a passive personality which prevents her from standing up for the child. 568 The Child The victim of parental abuse is commonly an infant or small child. Lauer s, in a series of 130 hospitalized battered children found 63 % under two years of age. One child in a family may be the predominant victim of abuse although Lauer found evidence of abuse or neglect of a sibling in 53 % of ca~s where there were siblings. The child may be the product of an unwanted pregnancy, a pregnancy which began before marriage or which for other reasons was extremely inconvenient. An area of problem, not yet adequately studied, was described by Caffey in 19729 as the \"Provocative Infant\". He states that, \"an over reactive, demanding, defiant, and exhausting infant may well paralyze the overburdened mother's self control temporarily and release violent impulses to rid herself of him\". Some estimate the general incidence of provocative infants in the population to be high as 5 to 10 percent. Adelson m in 1961 suggested that, \"nine of 44 infants and children studied were killed by their fathers during an emotional outburst triggered by frustration and aggravation from prolonged and repeated crying episodes, defecating in their clothing, persistent harassment, and other temper abrading and eroding activities which goaded the fathers to a point where they resorted to excessive violence either as a disciplinary measure or as an outlet for their explosive anger and sense of futility. In this was even these very young victims of brutal assault may contribute to their subsequent injury\". The Stress The environmental stress which may precipitate an episode of physical abuse upon a child may not be of profound nature but are rather an accumulation of the frustrations of domestic unhappiness, economic deprivation, social isolation and the 24 hour day care of one or several small children. Elmer n, in a study comparing the families of battered children with a group of control families found that the abusive families lived under constant stress of a kind and degree unknown to the non-abusive (normal) families. EXTERNAL INJURIES Some battered children present with such severe cutaneous bruises, periorbital ecchymoses and old scars from lacerations, abrasions and burns that the diagnosis is never in doubt. Others will show such minor external injury, a scabbed abrasion or a small ill- defined bruise on the abdomen or eyelid, that the examining physician or pathologist is surprised to find the multiple healing fractures on x-ray or the profound internal injuries. Many children have one or two scars from falls, but multiple old or healing scars in a small infant should raise suspicion. Patterned injuries may be recognized by careful examination of cutaneous injuries. Parallel rows of narrow repetitive bruises may indicate blows with a belt. Narrow linear scars or recent abrasions in the shape of a loop may indicate blows with a loop of electrical cord. Small round burns or healing scars may indicate cigarette burns. Larger burns or old burn scars may suggest scalding with hot fluid or contact with a hot object. Deep lacerations are rare and are probably only seen when a blunt object is used to strike the child. Lacerations on the inside of the lips are not 569 uncommon and can be produced by a hard slap or blow over the mouth with the teeth lacerating the inside of the lips. One recognized mechanism of producing a burn is to sit a child on a heating appliance in order to dry his wet pants. This may be done by an angered parent attempting to toilet train the child and may result in burns of the buttocks. A very disturbing mechanism of inflicting trauma is the human bite. In this case, the parent actually bites the child and may leave a circular patter of human teeth marks on the skin. The external examination is also very important to document the child's overall nutrition, height, weight, and state of cleanliness and hydration. These factors all speak to the adequacy of the physical aspects of parental care. INTERNAL INJURIES Three main categories of internal injuries are seen in battered children: head injuries, abdominal injuries, and fractures of extremities and fibs. Head Injury In two series of hospitalized battered children 6,~2, 30% and 25% respectively were admitted for head injury, the majority having either a skull fracture or subdural hematoma or both. Head injury was the most common cause of death in hospitalized battered children seen in a medical examiner's office. The face and scalp may or may not exhibit external evidence of trauma. Extensive hemorrhage may be present beneath the scalp overlying the skull. The skull may exhibit fracture, either a simple straight line fracture or a severe comminuted and depressed skull fracture. Subdural hematomas are relatively common in battered children. They may occur alone or in conjunction with cerebral contusions. All these injuries require moderate to severe mechanical force. The child may be dropped or thrown to the floor, thrown down a flight of stairs, swung by the ankles so the head strikes a wall or other solid object, or repeated blows may be struck to the head by a fist or other blunt object. Caffey ~3 has described another mechanism of injury which may result in subdural hemorrhage and intraocular bleeding in the absence H of any scalp injury to indicate that the child has struck his head. The mechanism he calls \"The Whiplash Shaken Infant Syndrome\" results from grabbing an infant by the arms or the thorax and shaking him. It is suggested that permanent brain damage and mental retardation may result. Abdominal Injury Due to the fact that the abdominal wall is soft, very severe trauma may be inflicted upon the abdominal organs without significant injury to the skin or the abdomen. One indication of such a condition is a markedly swollen abdomen. Exsanguinating hemorrhage from large lacerations of liver, spleen or small bowel mesentery and pertonifis from lacerated pancreas or ruptured duodenum are all seen in blunt force injuries of the abdomen. Gornal114 described a two year old who suffered avulsion of the common bile duct 570 from the duodenum. Any delay in seeking medical attention may contribute greatly to the severity of these injuries or cause death before the chid is brought to the hospital. Abdominal injuries are a common cause of death in battered children seen in a medical examiner's office. Fractures Skeletal injuries are a integral part of the battered child syndrome and were the first injuries to be documented as being the result of parental abuse. 1'2'3. Extremity fractures may result from the child being struck, thrown or being grabbed and shaken or the extremity twisted. Fractures of femur and humerus are most commo# 2. Metaphyseal avulsion and subperiosteal hemorrhages, demonstrated by x-ray in the healing stage, are also induced by shaking an infant 13. Rib fractures, frequently multiple and usually posterior, adjacent to their attachment to the vertebra, and relatively common in the battered child syndrome but distinctly uncommon in other forms of trauma in children including falls from heights and automobile crash trauma. The ribs effectively protect the thoracic organs which are infrequently injured in child battering. Multiple fractures in different stages of healing indicate multiple different episodes of injury. This is a pattern recognized in battered children and thus greatly aids in making the diagnosis. In a series of 110 hospitalized battered children, O'Nei112 reported 28 long bone fractures, 20 of whom had evidence of old fractures in various stages of healing. BATI'ERED CHILD vs. ACCIDENTAL INJURY Once the external injuries, internal injuries and old and recent fractures have been identified a determination must be made as to whether they represent battered child injuries or whether they can be explained by an accidental event. An inappropriate historical explanation for the injuries sustained is often the first clue to a case of child abuse, these discrepancies may be in the age of the injury, the severity of the injury, when compared to the history, or in the mechanism of injury production. In a case of repeated old and recent injury with documented old scars, x-ray evidence of old and healing fractures, hospital records of previous injuries and social service records of previous complaints and investigations the patterns of child abuse is quite clear. On the other hand, one encounters cases where only recent injuries are present. Here, especially, one must test the injuries against the history provided by the family. Some injuries are of such severity as to be completely inconsistent with rolling off the bed or falling from a high chair. This degree of suspicion should stimulate a youth division or social service investigation. NEGLECT A very distressing phenomenon outside the definition of the Battered Child Syndrome, but within the area of child abuse is neglect, the deprivation of adequate nutrition or 571 environmental needs. These children, often infants but some up to several years of age are often brought to the hospital dead or moribund weighing little more than their birth weight. They show marked emaciation from malnutrition and dehydration and such poor hygiene that dirt and fecal material may be dried onto the skin. The homes commonly are filthy. Weston 7 in a study of 24 cases of death form child neglect observed that the neglected child was often the youngest in a large family averaging 3 to 7 children. The average age at death was 5 months. A feature of the investigation is the common dispartly between the appearance of the child and the presenting story of the parent who may say that the child would not take is feeding, has mild diarrhea or for one or two days, or had been sick with an upper respiratory infection. The incidence of death by neglect is not precisely known. Weston reported 24 deaths in Philadelphia between 1961 and 1965. Luke ~5 found two such cases in a two year study of all deaths by homicide under 16 years of age in New York City in 1964 to 1965. In the last two years in Washington, D.C. one death by neglect was identified. Weston concluded from the ages of the victims in his study that in an urban environment if a neglected child survives to 1 year and is able to venture out of the home, neighbors or friends will afford necessary care to enable him to survive. Autopsy examination of these infants must rule out chronic debilitating disease which might explain the childs' failure to thrive. Similarly toxicologic examination must be performed to rule out poisoning, overdose of prescribed medication and to eliminate the possibility of lead poisoning. The fact that these children reach this degree of malnutrition simply by the withholding of food and drink is well shown by those infants who reach the hospital still alive. In the first 24 hours they may gain 5 pounds simply by replacing the fluid their body is lacking from dehydration. In one month in the hospital they may double or triple their admission weight. One such case which was thus rescued from starvation,, but released again to the custody of the mother, returned to the hospital dead on arrival, two months later again weighing essentially birth weight. CONCLUSION As long as parents, reacting to their own frustration, aggravation and poorly controlled aggression, inflict injury on their defenseless infants and small children the battered child syndrome will remain with us. Society's only hope to reduce this senseless suffering and death is 1) to make the public understand the common reasons for this abuse so that parents who know they are susceptible to this can obtain counselling, and 2) to educate the medical and social welfare professions to recognize the early signs of child abuse so that remedial measures can be taken and further injuries and death can be prevented. 572 REFERENCES 1.

Sudden infant death syndrome 9 Scene investigation 9 Circumstances of death Abstract. The diagnosis of SIDS depends on an analysis of information derived from two primary sources: the scene investigation and the autopsy examination. This paper identifies those details that an observer should look for and consider in completing a report of the circumstances of the death. In order to reach a proper conclusion as to the cause of death of a person who dies suddenly and unexpected- ly, a thorough investigation of the circumstances of the death and a complete autopsy examination are neces- sary. Both components, the investigation and the autop- SY, are essential if a reliable conclusion is to be drawn. Omission of one of these elements can place the entire cause of death in question. This fundamental principle of death certification applies to anyone who dies sud- denly and unexpectedly regardless of age. However, only during the past two decades has this criteria been applied to cases of sudden and unexpected infant death. Recent History of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Investigation The new focus of infant death investigation was trig- gered in 1972 by the efforts of concerned professionals, parents and legislators when a joint US Congressional Resolution called upon the National Institute of Child Health and Welfare to make investigations into crib death one of its priorities [I]. Preliminary studies by the Office of Maternal and Child Health (OMCH) identified that the problems lac- ing SIDS parents were multiple. First of all, there was a prevalent attitude of suspicion held by many law en- forcement personnel as well as physicians and the gen- eral public regarding the culpability of the SIDS parents in the death of their infant. Secondly, the OMCH identi- fied that death investigation in this country has histori- cally heen treated as a state and local responsibility and is governed by a set of inconsistent and often parochial state laws that were often inadequately supported. The initial approach of the OMCH to the problems identified was to commission a study of state death investigation laws [2], to publish Nosology Guidelines for Sudden Infant Death Syn, drome [3], to provide uniform guide- lines for infant death investigation [4] and to provide follow-up counseling and education to families and those impacted by the infant's death (in 1975, the Office of Maternal and Child Health of the US Department of Health, Education and Welthre awarded 24 community- based SIDS information and counseling grants). Uniform guidelines tbr int'ant death investigation were developed in 1975 in Sante Fe, N. Mex., at a meet- ing sponsored by OMCH. This meeting was attended by experts in death investigation and infant mortality. A report of the consensus opinion of that group was pub- lished in 1976 [5]. As a reaction to the prevalent belief 575 Smialek/Lambros held by law enforcement and health professionals that many of these deaths were the result of parental neglect, the meeting focused on the importance of the autopsy examination and de-emphasized the role of scene inves- tigation. The consensus of that meeting was that, while an investigation of the circumstances formed an impor- tant component of the determination of the cause of death, the investigation should be conducted a mini- mum of 2 weeks but preferably 1 month after the death by a person 'thoroughly acquainted with all the nuances of SIDS, but not identified with a punitive agency' [5, p. 835]. It was agreed that the appropriate person should be a public health nurse. A reexamination of this approach to death investiga- tion reveals certain inherent defects. Firstly, the gather- ing of critical information is delayed and possibly lost forever due to the fact that many families of SIDS vic- tims move during the early days after death. Secondly, accurate documentation of the scene of the infant death is precluded. Environmental conditions can change and cannot be reproduced. Essential details of the sleeping environment can be omitted due to the discarding of cribs, mattresses, covers or pillows. In addition, if the death investigation takes place at some extended time after the death and such an investigation is considered essential to making a proper certification of death, such certification will obviously need to be delayed. A second inherent defect is that the public health nurse is placed in a conflict of interest situation when she is charged with a dual role of death investigator and grief counselor. What should be the role of the public health nurse when called upon to counsel a family regarding SIDS when she then learns of the existence of a faulty crib in the home and the possible role that it played in the infant's death? A third problem with the 1975 investigative protocol was that it did not seek certain essential information including the identification and interviewing of the per- son who first discovered the infant, documentation of where the infant was found and whether his airway had been compromised or obstructed. Neither was there a provision to identify and interview the treating ph.xsi, cian to ascertain if the familv had a history, of question- able child care practices. There was also no provision to contact protective services to determine if the family had an open case file. While the guidelines were presented as being only the minimum data necessary, to be obtained prior to autopsy, the emphasis on the nonpunitive ap- proach created certain gaps in the information identified as being relevant. The importance of contacting the treating physician is illustrated in the following case, investigated by the authors in Wayne County, Mich. A 4-month-old infant, reported as being in good health, except for prior treatment for a lung infection at 2 months of age, was found dead at home in his crib. The initial investigation revealed that the child had been under the care of a babysitter while the mother worked. There ~ere no external signs of injury. An autopsy was performed and no significant abnormalities were detected except for a slightly reddish-purple zone 1 ~/2 inches in diameter on the surface of the cerebral hemispheres, visible beneath the lepto- meninges. There was also some flattening of the surface of the brain. Following fixation, this zone was found to represent a cerebral con- tusion which had most likely resulted from a blow to the top of the head. A follow-up investigation revealed that the hospitalization of the infant at 2 months of age had been for a superficial skull fracture, rather than a lung infection. The babysitter, when interviewed, revealed that she had not cared for the infant during the several days prior to the initial hospitalization. Neither had she cared for the infant during the 2 weeks prior to his death. The babysitter did state, however, that the infant occasionally would have bruises on his body when he came to her home. Further investigation revealed that the father had been the pri- mary caretaker of the infant prior to death and a child of his from a previous marriage had died of a subdural hemorrhage. The manner of death had been classified as accidental in that prior case. When the father was interviewed by the police, he admitted that he had struck both infants on their heads with the sole of his shoe because they wouldn't stop crying. In the 15 years following the US Senate Resolution calling for research into the SIDS, a wealth of informa- tion has accumulated in the medical literature regarding the possible causes and mechanisms of death in this group of infants [6]. Valdes-Dapena and Huff [7] have published an excellent manual setting out those proce- dures necessary for compiling a proper infant autopsy. However, the role of the investigation in the identifica- tion of SIDS victims was basically ignored by SIDS researchers. In fact. any detailed investigation conducted by medical examiners and law enforcement individuals was regarded as largely unproductive and potentially damaging to the mental health of the SIDS parents. The authors have obscrved over the decade following the Resolution, an increasing tendency amongst medical ex- aminers, pathologtsts and coroners, to accept the au- topsy rcsults as the sole req'uisite of a SIDS diagnosis. The importance of the invcstigatton was largely given lip service. Several dramatic reports in the media of multi- ple murders of infants by suffocation, jarred the medical community and SIDS families into the harsh realization that when investigations are lacking or inadequate, the 576 Investigation of Sudden Infant Deaths validity of a SIDS diagnosis can be easily discredited IM. Over an 8-year period in Wayne County, Mich. (De- troit) from 1974 to 1982, the authors investigated ap- proximately 1,1130 sudden infant deaths. Approximately 75 % of these infants were ultimately classified as SIDS [9]. The remainder were identified as dying as a result of other natural, accidental or homicidal mechanisms. An evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of most of these infants took place in spite of the fact that approximately 50% of the 1,100 had been transported to emergency rooms by either the parents, police or ambu- lance. It is not the purpose of this paper to identify those conditions that may initially appear as a SIDS but are correctly identified at autopsy. These natural disease processes as well as evidence of subtle and obvious signs of child abuse and accidental injury have been ade- quately documented elsewhere [10]. Rather, the remainder of the paper will focus on the criteria that these authors use in reaching a diagnosis in those difficult cases where there are no demonstrable findings at autopsy and questions of a suspicious or sug- gestive nature in,colving the circumstances of the death exist. Indications for Supplemental Testing, Obtaining Samples for Specialized Testing It is important to digress slightly at this point to state that the SIDS diagnosis is most appropriately used when a gross autopsy examination is carried out along with auxiliary examination such as histology. It is not the position of the authors that toxicology, virology or bac- teriology studies should be carried out on all infants. Rather, such studies should be utilized when the infor- mation collected at the scene suggests the presence of a drug or other agent. In a study of 130 consecutive cases of sudden deaths of infants under 1 year of age in Wayne County in 1978. toxicological studies were carried out looking for sub- stances including alcohol, barbiturates, opiates and or- ganic bases [11]. No instances of drugs causing or con- tributing to death were identified in the above study, except in those instances where they had been suggested by evidence collected in the course of the investigation. This led to the policy in Wayne County, of conducting toxicological studies where it was warranted by scene investigation or by a parental history of drug use. On the basis of these criteria, it was determined that at least 1 infant died as a result of methadone intoxica- tion ingested from the breast milk of the mother who was being maintained on methadone. Another infant death caused by methadone intoxication was the result of 2 small siblings feeding their father's weekend bottle of methadone to their infant brother [I 2]. A recent unpub- lished case from Wayne County was related to the authors in which-cocaine intoxication was the cause of death in a breast-fed infant of a cocaine-addicted mother [personal commun, from Dr. Mirchandani, De- puty Chief Medical Examiner, Wayne County, Mich.]. Reports in the literature describe poisonings under 1 year of age from ingestion of a number of noxious agents which include, in part, insecticides by inhalation, oral ingestion of insecticides on nipple of bottle, errors in drop dosage, spider bites and accidental ingestion of drugs, plants and hydrocarbons [13]. This is not to say that large numbers of infants are dying from environ- mental toxins or medication overdoses. Merritt and Valdes-Dapena [10, p. 204] have stated that it is their belief that such deaths do not commonly masquerade as SIDS. It is also the belief of the authors that when a timely and adequate scene investigation is carried out, the investigator should be able to identify such factors which will lead to the appropriate toxicological tests being ordered. Other authors have stated that botulism is an occult cause of at least a small percentage of sudden infant deaths and may not be evident from the autopsy alone [14]. A history of the use of honey as a sweetener for the formula or the pacifier may suggest this as a possible factor to consider. In an unpublished study by the authors, no positive cases of botulism were identified in 130 consecutive cases of sudden infant deaths under 1 year in Wayne County in 1978. Microbiological analysis and toxin studies of samples from these victims were carried out in conjunction with the Michigan Depart- ment of Health. Control samples had provided positive cultures and toxin tests after transportation to the labo- ratory in a variety of weather conditions. Interpretation of Postmortem Chanties and Injuries When infants die in unsanitary environments, the body may be altered by the feeding activity of insects (roaches. ants) or rodents (rats). It is important for inves- tigators to document the presence of such scavengers at 577 Smialek/Lambros the death scene, since the changes they cause on the body can easily be mistaken as evidence of child abuse l15]. A common finding at the scene of death of a SIDS victim is the intense pulmonary edema evidenced by froth exuding from the nostrils and sometimes the mouth. Occasionally, this froth may be bloody, resulting in prominent staining of the bed linen if the child has been lying on his side or face down. The blood can result from the intense pulmonary capillary congestion that may be secondary to the bradycardia experienced by some of these infants prior to death [personal commun. Dorothy Kelly, Pulmonary Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass.]. When circulation ceases, blood will pool by gravity to the lowermost parts of the body. This pooling becomes prominent as a purplish discoloration which can resem- ble bruising. This discoloration is called livor mortis or lividity. Evaluation of the pattern of lividity present on the body can assist the investigator in determining what the position of the body was at the time of and following death. Knowingly or unintentionally, families may pro- vide inaccurate information as to the location of the body when first observed. One example of the impor- tance of this kind of information is illustrated by the following case history. An infant was brought to the emergency room with a history of having been found dead in the crib. On external examinaton, it was observed that the only evidence of lividity present on the body was intense discoloration of both lower legs and feet - similar to that seen in hangmg victims. Investigation of the scene and interviewing the family revealed that the infant had been found with his head trapped in a crevice at the top of a crib which had compromised the circulation of blood to the brain. The parents admitted that they had covered up the circumstances of the death because they felt guilty about not having complied with instructions from the crib manufac- turer. They had been sent a kit that would have eliminated the dan- gerous crevice. The kit had arrived 2 days prior to the death but had not been installed. (An infant investigated by the authors who ini- tially presented as a probable SIDS, Wayne County, Mich.) Another significant scene finding is evidence of regur- gitation of formula from the mouth or nostrils of the deceased infant onto the pillow or bedding. This finding is sometimes misinterpreted as an indication that the victum died of aspiration. However, when a person dies and the muscles of the body become flaccid, the sphinc- ters relax resulting in drainage of fluids from body ori- fices. This represents an agonal or postmortem event. In the case of the infant who dies shortly alter a feeding, relaxation of the esophageal sphincter may result in drainage by gravity of fluid from the stomach into the nose and mouth [l 5, p. 474, 16, 17]. Another physical finding that may mislead the inves- tigator is the postmortem congealing of fat which results in indentations in the skin from tight clothing. When the sleeper is tight at the neck, the resulting mark on the skin can resemble ligature strangulation [15, p. 501]. Identifying Accidental Mechanisms of Death Since the autopsy alone may be insufficient to differ- entiate between SIDS and suffocation, or death due to a compromised airway, it is extremely important for the scene investigator to personally interview the individual who was caring for the infant at the time he died and also to interview the first person who discovered the child [15, p. 475]. The authors investigated 16 accidental deaths of infants which occurred as a result of unsafe sleeping environments in Wayne County in 1974-75 [18]. Such unsafe environments can include defective cribs, defective side rails on beds [19], mattresses that are pushed together, mattresses that are too soft, mat- tresses that are too small for the bed allowing a space between the head or foot boards, and pillows or other objects in the bed that can compromise the infant's abil- ity to maintain an unobstructed airway. All of the above sleeping situations can allow an infant to slip down between mattresses or between the mattress and the side of the bed or a wall and become trapped. Other unsafe sleeping situations include plastic covers in the bed that can become loose and adhere to the face of the infant to block the entrance of air into the nose and mouth, pacif- iers that are manufactured in pieces (rather than molded) [20] can come apart and be aspirated by the infant. Cords around the neck can effectively become a ligature for accidental strangulation [19, p. 88]. Other unsafe environments are created when the infant has access to small objects which can become lodged in his airway. Usually such objects can be identified by autop- sy. However. on occasion, manipulation of the airway during resuscitation procedures can dislodge the foreign body to another site in the pharynx where it can escape detection if the examination is not extremely thorough [personal obs.. 1985]. While it is certainly true that accidental suffocation or strangulation of infants can occur as a result of unsafe sleeping arrangements, it must be emphasized that this information should not be viewed as implying that large numbers of SIDS infants have been dying of suffocation [6, p. 25]. In the experienceofthe authors and others, the investigation of the scene will rcvea[ whether traumatic 578 Investigation of Sudden Infant Deaths asphyxia was a likely mechanism in the death of the infant [21]. In cases of this type described in the literature, the infants who had been accidentally suffocated were in the younger age group (1 month) [21, p. 485]. This is signif- icant because it has been noted that for some reason, there is a sparing of SIDS infants in the first month of life. Thus, 'the age distribution of SIDS is inconsistent with this hypothesis' [6, p. 25]. Another scene finding that may be mistakenly impli- cated in the death of the infant is the presence of bed clothing over the face of the child. It has been deter- mined that ordinary, porous materials such as sheets or blankets are probably not capable of producing suffoca- tion [22]. Identification of Cases of Infanticide Homicidal suffocations are usually perpetrated by a deeply disturbed parent or caretaker. However, the au- thors are aware of at least one instance when an unedu- cated parent made a practice of quieting the infant's cry- ing by placing a pillow over the face and pressing softly until the crying ceased. On one occasion when the pillow was removed, the infant was found to have stopped breathing. Other suffocation deaths that can masquerade as SIDS include drowning or blockage of the mouth and nose by plastic 'baggies' or other soft objects [19, per- sonal obs.]. It has been recognized that infant autopsy findings in cases of suffocation can be the same as those found in the infant who dies of SIDS [23]. However, signs of suffoca- tion can be more visible depending on how much force is used. Signs of homicidal suffocation which may be present in a victim include conjunctival petechial hem- orrhages, abrasions or scratches in the skin of the nose or mouth, bruises or tears of the mucous membrane of the gums and lips and swelling of the brain (cerebral edema). All or none of these findings may be present in a partic- ular case. However, a careful search must be made if such evidence is to be identified. There are a number of red flags to alert the investiga- tor of the need for a more intensive investigation. Par- ents who perpetrate such crimes can sometimes be idcn- tiffed when they give inconsistent stories about the death to other family members, friends, physicians or investi- gators [24]. Severe depression or mental illness of the mother, father or caretaker, more than one unexplained infant death in the family, a prior history, ofchdd abuse or neglect of the deceased infant or a sibling, prior unex- plained collapses of the infant necessitating emergency treat..,ent, or prolonged periods between the collapse and the notification of emergency medical or law en- forcement personnel are additional indicators of a possi- ble unnatural event. A recognized characteristic of abusive parents is their absence from the bedside of their hospitalized child. However, the authors have observed that the immediate grief reactions of parents rarely differed regardless of the final mechanism of death: i.e., parents of abused chil- dren were often just as distraught as parents whose chil- dren died naturally [18]. It has been reported that par- ents who suffocate their infant may even engage in pro- longed efforts to revive the child [241 . It must be emphasized, however, that the existence of one or more of the above factors does not necessarily imply that the death was a homicide. Reports in the lit- erature describe certain families as experiencing multi- ple unexplained deaths of infants [25]. There are even instances when twins have died simultaneously [26]. The authors have investigated the deaths of a number of infants in families that have experienced more than one fatality from SIDS. A family who has lost one infant to SIDS is at a slightly increased risk for losing a second infant the same way [6, pp. 14-16]. The authors have investigated the deaths of several infants in one family who had experienced 5 sudden and unexpected infant deaths. The 2 surviving children underwent extensive medical testing [unpubl. account of 5 sudden infant deaths in one family from the Children's Hospital Med- ical Center, Boston, Mass. and the Michigan Regional SIDS Center]. The surviving 8-year-old girl was identi- fied as having a seizure disorder and the surviving infant had episodes of apnea [30 s). This last infant was main- tained on an apnea monitor for the first year of life. The present status of these children is unknown. In a recent controversial study of death scene investi- gation of sudden infant deaths in new York, Bass et al. [27] alleged that 26 consecutive cases of sudden infant death were misdiagnosed by the New York City Medical Examiner. In 2 cases, Bass ct al. ignored autopsy findings consistent with SIDS and. based on a history of infant shaking, diagnosed 2 deaths as shaken baby syndrome [27, cases No. 13 and 17]..-ks support lor this conclusion. the authors utilized a 1968 article which related spinal injury to SIDS [28]. Th'is article had been refuted in the same journal the following year [29]. The term. shaken baby syndrome, was originally developed to describe \"a clinicopathological entity occurring or absent signs of exter- nal trauma' [30]. At autopsy, these entities are clearly demonstrable and are certainly not consistent with SIDS. Furthermore, the concept that shaking alone can cause the severe head injury of the type described above has come under recent scientific scrutiny and probably has been repudiated [30]. Identification of Environmental Mechanisms of Death When the history of the child reveals that he has been lethargic or has vomited prior to death, it is especially important to rule out environmental or infectious causes of death. A 2-week-old infant in Franklin County, Ohio, was diagnosed as dying as a result of chemical toxicity from the fumes produced by a solvent in the stain on his basket crib. The diagnosis was based on toxicological studies which identified significant levels of hydrocar- bons in the tissues of the infant [30]. Parents often have questions about the role that insec- ticides or paint play in their infant's death, especially if the house had recently been fumigated or painted before the child died. If such questions are identified before the autopsy, special toxicological tests can be performed either locally or in special reference labs. Deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning produce a characteristic cherry red discoloration of the lividity on a body. Such discoloration is readily apparent to a trained investigator. However, if any question exists regarding a possible source of carbon monoxide in the sleeping envi- ronment (such as a portable heater), a small sample of blood can be readily tested to identify the presence or absence of significant levels of carboxyhemoglobin. Excessive heat has been implicated as a cause or con- tributory factor in some infant deaths [6, p. 21 ]. In order for this mechanism to be implicated in the death, proper documentation of the environmental temperature should be obtained. In one case which the authors observed, the intense heat was obvious in the closed room where the infants slept. Both children+exhibited obvious signs of dehydration. Conclusion In order for the diagnosis of SIDS to withstand possi- ble intense scrutiny, the investigation must be thorough and professional. All concerned in the case study must recognize that the investigative data is as important as the information gathered at the autopsy and, in some cases, the investigation alone provides the solution to the question of why an infant suddenly died.

MISCELLANEOUS: 584 MUNCHA USEN SYNDROME B Y PROXY i :!I:~ 9 9 i \u000184184 Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy By KATHRYN A. ARTINGSTALL T he dawn of the 1990s brought widespread rec- ognition of a once-obscure criminal act, Murlchausen Syn- drome by Proxy (MSBP), in which subjects injure or induce illness in children in order to gain attention and sympathy for themselves. Since its recognition by the criminal jus- tice commurlity, MSBP has been identified most closely with mothers who induce in their children breath- ing difficulties that mimic the symp- toms of apnea and sudden infant death syndrome, who poison them, or who fabricate illnesses in their children. These mothers then bask in the attention afforded them by relatives, doctors, and hospital personnel. However, because the child's illness has no medical cause, doctors have difficulty making a diagnosis. As the baffling symptoms con- tinue, doctors or hospital adminis- trators may call on law enforcement to investigate the mysterious cir- cumstances surrounding such cases. In fact, as the medical community becomes increasingly familiar with MSBP and its warning signs, doc- tors and medical staffs seem to be more inclined to request the assist- ance of local law enforcement agencies. The growing list of MSBP cases underscores the need for investigators to understand the various--and often complex-- issues related to MSBP. During the past several years, a number of variations to the normal offender patterns have emerged, accompa- nied by a clearer understanding of how law enforcement should re- spond to cases believed to involve MSBP. The more investigators know about MSBP, the better able they will be to identify perpetrators, clear innocent suspects, and most important, protect children. Research on MSBP Researchers documented the serial nature of MSBP victimiza- tion in a study of 5 families with a total of 18 children. ~ In this study, August 1995 / 5 587 r \"\" Detective Artingstall serves with the Orlando, Flotfda, Police DepartmenL ...a pf ca Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy confirms that this disorder represents a substantial challenge to the criminal justice system. 72 percent of the children were known to be MSBP victims. In each family, only one child was involved at any given time, and a total of five children seemed to be unaffected. Of those children af- fected, 31 percent died. In only one instance was there any other form of abuse present. The characteristics of the mater- nal perpetrators in this study indi- cated the following: 80 percent possessed backgrounds in health professions; 80 percent manifested Munchausen Syndrome (self- inflicted injury) themselves; 80 percent received psychiatric treat- ment prior to diagnosis; and 60 percent of the mothers attempted suicide. Denial persisted in most cases. The research also shows that individuals who initially engaged in Munchausen Syndrome may eventually practice Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. 2 The de- gree to which the offspring of Munchausen offenders become the subjects of abuse may increase proportionately with the number and increased severity of incidents of self-inflicted abuse. MSBP may occur when the per- petrator of Munchausen Syndrome crosses over the threshold of self- inflicted injury into abuse of an un- suspecting child. Oftentimes, the caregivers (offenders) claim that injuries to the child were inflicted by a fictitious bad guy. In some in- stances, offenders injure them- selves in order to substantiate the presence of this unknown perpetra- tor. Cautious, diligent investigation of these allegations often leads to dead ends based on a series of false crime reports. Although there seems to be a multigenerational link between Munchausen Syndrome and MSBP, this connection has not been estab- lished scientifically to the level that most courts require. The level of understanding that members of the criminal justice system possess re- garding Munchausen Syndrome and MSBP makes a crucial dif- ference to the outcome of these cases. The ever-present possibility of continued victimization of chil- dren at the hands of MSBP offend- ers further underscores the impor- tance of handling these cases expediently. Establishing MSBP as a pos- sible extension of Munchausen Syndrome will not be an easy task for investigators and prosecutors if the acts have not advanced to the point of physical abuse. Most courts are unwilling to remove a child from a parent's custody without concrete evidence to support charges of child abuse. Understandably, detectives ex- perience considerable frustration when working on these types of cases. Incidents falsified by offend- ers and seemingly verified by means of self-mutilation only add to the mystery when a perpetrator cannot be identified. Perpetrators In the standard offender-victim relationship, suspicion centers on the biological mother. In fact, the vast majority of MSBP cases re- solved through investigation have implicated the victim' s mother as the sole offender. 3 Investigators should be aware, however, that the MSBP offender profile has widened to include other perpetrators, both within and out- side the victim's family structure. 4 Fathers, grandmothers, aunts, and babysitters have been identified as offenders. Regardless of the rela- tionship to the victim, the offenders all had one thing in common--each acted as the victim's primary caregiver. 6 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 588 In very rare cases, medical pro- fessionals also could be included in the list of potential suspects. While it appears that only immediate fam- ily members would receive the grati- fication from attention, increased self-esteem, and false sense of be- longing afforded by MSBP, similar motivations lead some health-care workers to cross the line of the Hippocratic Oath into the realm of child abuse. By inflicting MSBP, and then \"saving\" the child, these offending medical practitioners hope to excel within their fields and win acceptance by their peers. Fortunately, the frequency of cases involving health-care work- ers has been relatively low thus far. The possibility exists, though, that a medical professional's actions might indicate MSBP in cer- tain circumstances. Investigations of this type are highly sensitive. Often, medical per- sonnel are wrongly accused by ac- tual offenders who perceive that they have come under suspicion. Still, an investigator's decision to suspect or accuse medical profes- sionals of MSB P should be based on the same standard of investigation used for other suspects. However, the primary caregiver status inher- ent in the most common offender profiles continues to place mothers at the height of suspicion. Investigative Guidelines The methods by which investi- gators approach suspected MSBP offenders are the keys to resolv- ing such cases. During interviews, investigators should not express open disbelief in their accounts of criminal incidents. Rather, investi- gators need to convey to the suspect that they are keeping an open mind regarding the case. Investigators can expect sound rationalization on the part of such offenders, as well as a series of open-ended allegations that cannot be substantiated. Investigators should make every effort to segregate other family members from suspects during the interview process because relatives probably will voice support and be- lief in the allegations if the suspect is present. In those cases where ob- vious inconsistencies exist, family members might view facts differ- ently when questioned away from the suspect. With further investigation, iden- tified MSBP offenders might be linked to the deaths of their other Profile of MSBP Offenders 9 Are most often biological mothers of the victims, but potential offenders are not limited to this group; fathers and persons outside the family also have been identified 9 Are often upper class, well-educated persons 9 Remain uncharacteristically calm in view of the victim's perplexing medical symptoms 9 Welcome medical tests that are painful to the child 9 Praise medical staffs excessively 9 Appear to be very knowledgeable about the victim's illness 9 Have some medical education---either formal or through self-initiated study/experience 9 Might have a history of the same illness as the victim 9 Typically shelter victim from outside activities, such as school or play with other children 9 Allow only selected persons close to their children 9 Maintain a high degree of attentiveness to the victim 9 Seem to find emotional satisfaction when the child is hospitalized because of the staff' s praise of their apparent ability to be a superior caregiver. August 1995 / 7 589 children. Often, the original medical examiners incorrectly identified these deaths as resulting from sud- den infant death syndrome. If the deceased child or children have not been cremated, then ex- huming their bodies for forensic testing might be appropriate. When advised of previously identified causes of death within a family, forensic pa- thologists or medical examin- ers might be able to uncover particular toxins or evidence pointing to homicide. Questioning Victims Whether the child actually knows that the offender has in- duced the illness depends on the child' s physical age and the offender's covert skills. Cer- tainly, the longer the abuse continues and the older a 9 child grows, the more likely it becomes that the victim will understand the offender's actions. If the abuse has been present throughout the life of the child, then the victim might believe that whatever action is being done to cause the illness is normal. Because of this misunderstanding of normal behavior and the attention that the offender lavishes, the child might not view the offender as anything less than an ideal caregiver, even if the abuse is blatant. Law enforcement officers gen- erally should refrain from inter- viewing the victim for two reasons. First, even if a victim is old enough to talk, the child probably will not be able to assist officers verbally in the investigation. Second, officers must consider the potentially traumatic consequences should the child be told that a trusted caregiver is in fact an abuser. For these reasons, it would be wise to elicit the help of professionals when dealing with this aspect of the investigation to lessen the possibility of further traumatiz- ing the victim. Victim Safety In MSBP-related cases, investi- gators face additional concerns for the safety of the child involved. Sus- pected offenders might react in a number of ways when confronted by the police. Generally, offenders deny the allegations and blame the child' s ap- parent illness on unknown causes. Often, an upsurge in the severity of the victim's symptoms follows as the offender attempts to prove the presence of the illness. Unfortu- nately, the child might not be able to withstand the escalat- ing abuse or the increased treatments prescribed to ad- dress the symptoms. In order to reduce the pos- sibility of further abuse to the child, investigators must work toward a swift conclusion to the case once they have con- fronted the suspected offender. Accordingly, case parameters and guidelines regarding evi- dence collected should be es- tablished prior to informing the subject of the investiga- tion. Careful planning and caution in this area can be critical; research indicates that from 9 to 31 percent of all MSBP victims die at the hands of their perpetrators? Some confronted offend- ers might react more passively by relocating with the victim and other family members. If the courts do not enact protec- tive measures to preclude a suspect from relocating with the child, the cycle of MSBP probably will continue in a new locale. To avoid this scenario, investi- gators should ensure that adequate measures to protect the victim are in place via social services or judi- cial avenues before informing sub- jects that they are under suspicion. These measures should remain in place until the case is concluded. 8 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 590 If not arrested, offenders who believe they are under suspicion might become more cautious, but only temporarily. The child's ap- parent illness might subside until the offender believes it is safe to resume the abuse. Offenders also may wait until a reasonable time elapses and then re-admit the child into the hospital. In either case, it appears that as offenders continue their abuse, the danger to the child increases. The needs-oriented behavior of such offenders has been compared to that of drug addicts. Through cycles of abuse and nurturing, MSBP offenders seek to satisfy an ever-increasing need for attention and self-validation. However, some experts believe that--unlike most drug addicts--MSBP offenders cannot be rehabilitated. 6 False Allegations Despite seemingly strong cir- cumstantial evidence present in some cases of apparent MSBP abuse, law enforcement officers must make every effort to refrain from making false allegations. Accusations based on insufficient investigation and absent forensic analysis can have disastrous consequences. In one such case, a mother in Missouri was falsely accused of the death of her infant son. The child died as a result of apparent ethylene glycol poisoning. How- ever, upon the birth of a second baby, doctors found that the in- fant had a rare disease, meth- ylmalonic acidemia, which in fact, had caused the death of the first child. The mother subsequently initiated legal action against the State. Such cases reinforce the need for investigators to explore all av- enues when suspicion of MSBP arises. The importance of medical evaluation cannot be overstated. In fact, without properly collected medical documentation to support the thesis of MSBP abuse, it is un- likely that prosecutors can establish probable cause to support custodial arrest. Child Custody Cases The manner in which charges of MSBP originate must be considered in the total course of an investiga- tion. Highly disputed child custody cases often generate charges of child abuse. Sometimes, MSBP offenders accuse the other parent of abuse in order to mask their own wrongdoing and to keep custody of the child. In cases where an estranged par- ent involved in a custody dispute reports illnesses or accuses the other 1 i I : ' } ~ i } ,~-i'\"t \"\"/ i :~ Motivational Factors I One or more of the following motivational factors might be present in MSBP cases: I Most offenders crave the attention gleaned from hospital staffs, doctors, and family members Offenders become more aggressive as time passes Some offenders in theory might receive gratification as they fool the doctors. They derive enjoyment from knowing what is wrong with the child while medical experts remain baffled Some offenders may fear going home or adjusting to a normal daily routine without being the center of attention A relatively minor crisis--such as the fear of being left alone or of the child' s being released from the hospital---could trigger an attack on a victim An offender who is praised as a hero for saving a child might elect to re-create that euphoria by fabricating subsequent incidents of abuse and revival of the victim. !

In cases where reports of abuse emanate from a noncustodial or es- tranged parent, the question of ac- cuser/inflictor role reversal should be considered as an alternate cause of the child's ailments. This type of issue often arises in contested di- vorce situations involving minor children and also might be linked to parental kidnaping by noncustodial parents. When custody has been denied to an offending parent, and the victimized child has been placed with the other parent, the offender might go to great lengths to regain custody. Accusations of sexual abuse, especially if the custodial parent is the father, might be made by offenders as they attempt to dis- guise their responsibility for the child's abuse. The underlying rationalization for the actions of MSBP offenders stems from their desire to regain lost custody through outward expres- sions of love. It appears that the longer offenders are separated from victims, the more desperate and determined they become to re- gain custody. Domestic Violence Shelters Suspected MSBP offenders who believe that they are being watched, have been accused of MSBP abuse, or sense the need for self-vindication might seek assist- ance by accessing public shelters provided for victims of domestic violence. In such cases, offenders rely on their highly developed skills of deception. 10 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 592 Munchausen Syndrome bv Proxv Case Accour By STEPHEN J. C. BRUBAKER H ieronymous Karl Fredrich von Munchausen was an 18th century German baron and mercenary officer in the Russian cavalry. On his return from the Russo-Turkish wars, the baron entertained friends and neighbors with stories of his many exploits. Over time, his stories grew more and more expansive, and finally, quite outlandish. Mun- chausen became somewhat famous after a collection of his tales was published. In 1794, at the age of 74, Munchausen married Bernhardine Brun, then 17 years old. It is said that on their wedding night, the baron retired early, and his bride spent the night dancing with an- other. In 1795, Bernhardine gave birth to a son. Following the birth of this child, it was whispered that \"the life of the Munchausen child will likely be short.\" The boy, named Polle, died at approximately 1 year of age under suspicious cir- cumstances. 2 Almost a century later, an un- usual behavior pattern among young men gained recognition in the writings of Charcot. In 1877, he described adults, who through self- inflicted injuries or bogus medical documents, attempted to gain hospi- talization and treatment. Charcot called this condition \"mania operativa passiva. ''3 Seventy-four years later, in 1951, Asher described a similar pat- tern of self-abuse, where individuals fabricated histories of illness. These fabrications invariably led to com- plex medical investigations, hospi- talizations, and at times, needless surgery. Remembering Baron von Munchausen and his apocryphal tales, Asher named this condition Munchausen's Syndrome. 4 Today, Munchausen's Syn- drome is a recognized psychiatric disorder. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Sta- tistical Manual of Disorders 16 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 593 (DSM III-R) describes it as the \"in- tentional production of physical symptoms.\" MUNCHAUSEN SYNDROME term \"Munchausen Syn- drome by Proxy\" (MSBP) was coined in a 1976 report describing four children who were so severely 9 abused they were dwarfed. 5 In 1977, Meadow described a somewhat less extreme form of child abuse in which mothers deliberately induced or falsely reported illnesses in their children. He also referred to this behavior as MSBP. 6 Over the years, alternate terms, such as \"Polle's syndrome\" and \"Meadow's syndrome,\" have been suggested; however, these terms never gained popularity. In contrast to its adult namesake, the American Psychiatric Association's DSM III-R does not consider Mun- chausen Syndrome by Proxy a psychiatric disorder. Tragically, MSBP victims are usually children, and the perpetra- tors are almost always parents or parent substitutes. If and when vic- tims are hospitalized, they may be subjected to multiple, and at times, dangerous diagnostic procedures that invariably produce negative or confounding results. When the victim and abuser are separated, howevei, the victim's symptoms cease. When confronted, the abuser characteristically denies any knowl- edge of how the child's illness occurred. CASE REPORTS In recent years, medical person- nel at Children's Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, and local law en- Dr. Boros is involved with the Infant Apnea Program at Children's Hospital St. Paul, Minnesota. forcement agencies encountered several MSBP cases, three of which are outlined here. Two of the cases were presented with apnea, a condi- tion where breathing temporarily stops. The third case was presented with recurrent infections masquer- ading as an immune deficiency. Case #1 Victim MA, a 9-month-old boy, was repeatedly admitted to Children's Hospital because of recurrent life- threatening apnea. At 7 weeks of age, he experienced his first apneic event, and his mother administered mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Spon- taneous respiration returned, and MA was hospitalized, treated, and discharged with a home monitor. During the next 9 months, MA experienced 10 similar events and 7 more hospitalizations. Eight of the events required mouth-to-mouth ventilation. All of these episodes occurred while mother and child were alone, and only MA's mother Special Agent Brubaker is assigned to the FBI's Minneapolis Division. witnessed the actual events. Two episodes occurred in the hospital. Unfortunately, despite many tests and surgical procedures, MA' s apnea persisted, and his growth slowed. Because of his persistent apnea and failure to thrive, MA re- ceived home nursing care. During these home visits, several nurses observed that MA would refuse to eat in his mother's presence. If she left the room, however, he would eat. In time, both medical and nurs- ing staffs became increasingly sus- picious that Mrs. A was somehow responsible for her child' s apnea. To better observe mother-child interac- tion, MA was moved to a hospital room equipped for covert audio- visual surveillance. 7 On the sixth day, the video clearly recorded Mrs. A bringing on the apnea by forcing the child into her chest, which caused him to lose consciousness. MA became limp and experienced a falling heart rate. Mrs. A then placed the baby back on the bed, called for June 1992/17 594 help, and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The hospital immediately in- formed child protection services and police authorities, who re- viewed the recording. Shortly thereafter, a team consisting of a physician, nurse, social worker, and police officer confronted the parents. At first, Mrs. A expressed disbelief at the suggestion that she smothered MA, but when she was informed of the video, she made no comment. She was then arrested. Family History Mrs. A was a 36-year-old occu- pational therapist and the mother of three boys. Late into her pregnancy with MA, she worked in an early intervention program for develop- mentally delayed children. During many of MA's hospitalizations, she appeared caring and concerned, but emotionally distant. Clearly, Mrs. A was the dominant parent, who made all decisions regarding medical treatment. Followup Mrs. A subsequently pled guilty to felonious, third-degree assault. At the time, she stated: \"The only time I ever caused MA to stop breathing was in the hospital.\" She received 3 years' probation during ,estigators ~rs assigned to work ~.s of they when confrontec gators should: ; victim's medical rec~ heSS from contact with m ,arent's concerns and ',atment complete history of I Lvolvement with law zilities, and social an~ detailed social histoi nries, and in the hc ........ , and a search warrant for the family's residetic~;~i~fi :>. ollecting evidence of the assaults ~. -.-=~:' r which she was to receive psycho- therapy. If she successfully com- pleted psychotherapy, the felony charge would be reduced to a mis- demeanor. She also had to live apart from her children and could only visit them in the presence of two adults. MA had no further apnea, and at 24 months of age, he appeared vig- orous, healthy, and normal. Eventu- ally, the family was reunited. Case #2 Victim CB, a 10-month-old girl, was admitted to a hospital because of recurrent life-threatening apnea. CB was born in another State and was sexually assaulted at the age of 3 months by an acquaintance of her father. After the assault, local child protection services closely moni- tored the family. At 6 months of age, CB experi- enced her first apneic episode. Her father shook her vigorously, then administered mouth-to-mouth ven- tilation. She was subsequently ad- mitted to a local hospital. After ex- amination and treatment, she was discharged with a home monitor. During the next 2 months, CB expe- rienced six apneic events and three hospitalizations. The family then moved to Minnesota. During her first month in Min- nesota, CB experienced four apneic episodes and three more hospital- izations. All required vigorous stimulations to restore spontaneous breathing. Other family members observed the child immediately fol- lowing the events. However, only CB' s father ever witnessed all of the 18 / FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 595 actual events. CB was eventually referred to Children's Hospital. While in the hospital, CB had no clinical apnea or monitor alarms. And, most of the time, she appeared happy and playful. However, when anyone attempted to touch her face, she became 'hysterical and combat- ive. Over time, both the medical and nursing staffs began to suspect that CB's parents were responsible for her apnea. Local police and child protec- tion services were notified, and CB was placed in a room with covert audio-visual surveillance) On the third day of video monitoring, the video recording clearly showed CB's father producing an apneic event by smothering her. Mr. B was viewed picking up the sleeping child, placing her prone on the bed, and forcing her face into the mat- tress. CB awoke and struggled to escape, wildly kicking her legs. Mr. B continued until CB's struggling stopped and she appeared limp and unconscious. Then, he repositioned her on the bed and called for help. A nurse entered the room, stimulated her, and administered supplemental oxygen. CB's parents were confronted by a physician, nurse, and police officer. Mr. B adamantly denied smothering CB. He was subse- quently arrested and removed from the hospital. Family History Mr. B. was a 27-year-old, un- employed, semi-literate laborer in good health. He was actively in- volved in CB's day-to-day medical care and was clearly the dominant parent. He also became very knowl- edgeable of the mechanics of the various county and hospital welfare systems. Officials described him as \"demanding and manipulative.\" During CB's hospitalizations, the family lived in a hotel adjacent to the hospital with room, board, and radio pagers provided by the hospi- tal. Throughout CB's hospitaliza- tion, Mrs. B was passive and de- ferred all medical decisions to her husband. ...MSBP victims are usually children, and the perpetrators are almost always parents or parent substitutes. 99 When they first arrived in Min- nesota, the family received emer- gency financial assistance and was closely monitored by local social service agencies. Four years earlier, Mrs. B was allegedly assaulted and raped. Two months prior to CB's monitored episode, Mrs. B was evaluated at a local emergency room for a \"hysterical conversion reaction.\" Followup Following the incident at Children's Hospital, Mr. B was taken to the county jail, and upon viewing the video, he admitted to smothering CB. He also was charged with felonious, third-de- gree assault. The judge ordered a psychiatric examination. Mr. B also received a 10-month sentence in a local workhouse and 5 years' proba- tion. Also, he is to have no contact with his daughter or unsupervised contact with any child in the future. 9 Case #3 Victim JC, a 2 1/2-year-old boy suf- fered from asthma, severe pneumo- nia, mysterious infections, and sud- den fevers. He was hospitalized 20 times during an 18-month period. Doctors were even concerned that he may have AIDS. However, they soon began to suspect that the mother may have caused the child's problems. Finally, when the boy complained to his mother's friend that his thigh was sore because \"Mommy gave me shots,\" the au- thorities were called. Upon searching the residence, investigators seized medical charts and information and hypodermic needles. It was also believed that material also entered the boy through a catheter doctors surgi- cally inserted in the arteries near his heart to give him constant medica- tion. Family History JC's mother was a 24-year-old homemaker and part-time fast-food restaurant worker. When the mother was 7 years old, an older sister died of a brain tumor at Children's Hos- pital. During her sister's prolonged illness, JC's mother, by necessity, spent long periods of time at the hospital. Although this occurred long ago, JC's mother remembered the experience vividly. During JC's many hospitaliza- tions, the mother seemed almost June 1992 / 19 596 MSBP ing Signs 9 Unex~[~ed, prolonged illness that is so 9 x extraol~ .~ it prompts medical Pr~ ~ ~e~ that seeli~a~; to remark that they've it before.\" 9 Rep6]a~ ?italizations and medical eval~g~ ~ without definitive diagnosis. 9 Inap ite or incongruous symptoms and/or sig., ~ ~)n't: make medical sense. ~ 9149 Pe ~lure of a child to tolerate or re ~edical therapy without clear that disappear when away [ diagnosis consisting of disorders than MSBP. are not as concerned by their as the medical staff, who are constantly with their ill child in' the hospital, who are at ease on the children's~Ward, and who form unusually close rel~tiOri~hips with the medical staff 9 :~, ~ 9 Families in which sudden, uri~p!~ined infant deaths have occurred and tha~hR~,several members alleged to have 9 ;~edical disorders. ~,!~t i'!;:?f 9 Mothers with prewous medi~ ~penence who give a the child' s. \":\" ' :!-. ~i~i'i~'~ 9 Parent who Parental ..... ~'~ ~,i ~ fft child is more ill than Wtiht i ~nt. hat the obsessively involved in medical matters and hospital routines. She spent hours in the hospital library reading medical texts. She had few friends outside the hospital, and the medical and nursing staff described her as an isolated person. JC's father was a 24-year-old church janitor, afflicted with many health problems--the most notable being severe insulin-dependent dia- betes. During JC's many hospital- izations, his father appeared distant and only marginally involved. JC's 7-year-old sister was in good health and was named after her mother's deceased sister. Followup Since JC was removed from his home, he has been healthy. As in previous cases, only Mrs. C was present when the boy became ill, and until investigators showed evidence linking her to her child's illnesses, she denied any wrong- doing. Assault charges were filed, and Mrs. C's case is pending. CONCLUSION Today, the consensus is that MSBP is not rare, is notoriously resistant to parental psychotherapy, and carries a very grim prognosis. Approximately 10 percent of MSBP victims die. Unfortunately, more police agencies and medical professionals will be confronted with this form of abuse in the future. Hopefully, the information discussed here will alert law enforcement officers, espe- cially those who deal with cases of abuse, to the warning signs of MSBP and will assist them in iden- tifying the perpetrators and helping the victims. 9 Endnotes J.G.

Geberth Investigation of sex-related homicides involves the basic procedures employed in other death investigation cases; however, a number of additional investigative considerations must be explored. These depend upon the circumstances of the incident as well as the type of activities observed at the crime scene. For example in sex-related death investigations, the reason for the killing may not always be as clear as in a robbery case or organized crime \"hit\" type of homicide. Experienced homicide investigators are aware that a sex-related homicide may involve homosexual as well as heterosexual victims, and that children as well as adults may be involved, both as victims and as perpetrators. Also, motives may include a number of possibilities that range from interpersonal violence and rape-murder to sexual perversion and serial murder. A homicide is classified as \"sex-related\" when there is evidence of sexual activity observed in the crime scene or upon the body of the victim. This includes the type of, or lack of, attire on the victim; evidence of seminal fluid on, near, or in the body; evidence of sexual injury; sexualized positioning of the body; evidence of substitute sexual activity, such as masturbation, fantasy, or ritualism. Multiple stabbings and cuttings to the body, as well as slicing wounds across the abdomen of the victim are also suggestive of a sexual motivation. The presence of seminal fluid in the vagina, mouth, or rectum as well as any semen discovered on the outside of the body or upon the clothing is an important consideration in determining the type of sexual activity that has taken place. A careful search should always be conducted within the surrounding area for evidence of sexual activity or sadomasochistic fantasies. Such evidence may appear in the form of pornographic books, videos, magazines, or photographs found at the crime scene depicting the victim involved in sexual activity; or writings or messages left by the perpetrator (either at the scene or upon the body of the victim); bondage paraphernalia, masks, ropes, chains, or tape; sex toys, props, lubricants, and other items that are commonly associated with sexual activity. The homicide could have sexual implications even without an overt sex act or observable sexual activity, as in psychotic killings where the motive is not readily discernable. If the body is that of a female or a young child nude or partially clothed, investigators should consider it as a possible \"sex crime.\" Adapted from: Practicle Homicide Investigation: Tactics, Procedures and Forensic Techniques. Used with permission of author. Third Edition, 1996. 601 Crime Scene Investigation A trained homicide investigator will examine the crime scene with a twofold purpose. The first objective is the complete documentation of events through photographs (both black and white and color), and/or videotape, along with crime scene sketches. The second objective is to assure that there has been a careful and complete search for any other items that may provide a clue to the identity of the murderer, as well as any other items that may provide some information about the crime (see Table 1). Table 1 Evidence Collection Physical Evidence in the form of seminal fluid must be collected as soon as possible before it is lost or destroyed. Bloodstains, spittle and hair (including pubic combings) should be obtained at the scene; properly packaged and forwarded to the lab. Trace evidence found on the victim and/or upon the victim's clothing should be collected. Bruises and marks on the victim, including the presence of sadistic injuries, should be recorded. The body should be examined for the presence of Bite-marks. Collect and record: a) Saliva washing of the Bite-mark area for a blood grouping. Use 100% cotton dampened in distilled water. Important: Get a control sample from another area of the body. b) Photograph the Bite-mark. Use a lxl camera (Fingerprint model) and get black and white photos as well as color. Use a rule of measure in photograph and obtain an anatomical landmark. c) Casting (if possible) using dental materials. The scene should be examined for evidence of a struggle. The presence of torn clothing, missing buttons, ripped textiles, marks on the ground or floor and blood splatters must all be photographed, documented and collected as evidence. The investigator should confer with the Medical Examiner and assure that specimens are taken from the body (e.g. hair from various area of the body). In addition, vaginal washing, as well as anal, nasal, and oral swabs should be requested from the pathologist for serological evaluation and examination. Fingernail scrapings should also be obtained for an analysis of any blood, skin, or hair from the perpetrator. If a suspect has been taken into custody, his or her clothing should be taken and an examination made for any physical evidence. Each piece of evidence should be packaged in a separate container. The suspect's body should be examined for any fingernail scratches, bite marks, or other indications of a violent struggle. In addition, hair an blood samples should be obtained. (Assure that these items are obtained legally.) 602 In sex-related cases, basic evidence collection procedures take on additional importance. Certain human behavior patterns and psychosexual activities become additional factors to consider in determining the reason and motive for the killing. An understanding of human behavior and the nature of human sexuality is an important prerequisite for a homicide investigator to develop. This, in conjunction with practical experiences, ensures that a proper analysis of a sex-related homicide can be intelligently pursued. Components of the sex drive are basically divided into three segments: biological (instinctive), physiological (functional), and emotional (mental). The emotional or mental component is the strongest of the three subdivisions. It would be a logical assumption that \"The mind controls the act,\" in that the mind directs what is and what is not sexually arousing to an individual. This can be an important consideration when analyzing \"What took place?\" in a sex-related crime scene. Sex is also a sensory act, involving the five senses of touch, sight, sound, smell, and taste. Each sense is employed to a different degree by individuals, who attach a sexually significant message to a particular sensor. For example, the sight of a scantily clothed woman might be sexually arousing for some, or smell as it relates to a particularly pleasing perfume might be the stimulus that affects another person's arousal. These are perfectly appropriate responses as they relate human sexuality when the mind is stimulated by significant sensor information. However, when the stimulation is taken to the extreme~and an individual becomes obsessed with the sensory \"turn-on,\" a deviance begins to emerge. This unhealthy attraction may result in an appropriate acting out of a fantasy, including murder. Also, people who are inhibited sexually may develop unconventional forms of sexual expression, which may be harn,ful. These responses are known as paraphilias; an attraction to deviance. Examples of unconventional forms of sexual activity are; voyeurism, exhibitionism, transvestism, and fetishism, which are generally considered harmless. Examples of paraphilias, considered harmful are; sadism, masochism, sadomasochism, pedophilia, and necrophilia. Whether an activity is considered harmless or harmful, substitute sexual activity and activities of a psychosexual nature may evidence themselves in certain sex- related crime scenes and should be considered in determining motivation. Determining Motivation An extremely important aspect of a homicide investigation is to determine the reason for the killing. Sex-related homicides include rape-murder and killings that involve both anal and oral sodomy, as well as other acts of sexual perversion. The victims are usually females and young children, and the killer is usually a male. 603 Homosexual homicides are quite common and may involve male victims killed by other males, or female victims involved in some sort of lesbian relationship and killed by other females. Oftentimes these cas~ involve bizarre and sadistic methodologies. There are certain preliminary questions an investigator should ask when examining a crime scene: \"What took place?\" \"Why did it occur?\" and \"Who could have done it?\" Examining a crime scene with the purpose of identifying and interpreting certain items that may serve as clues to the type of personality involved is an excellent technique of developing a mental picture of the TYPE of person who may have committed the crime. There are certain common denominators between the psychological make-up of the criminal and the psychological clues the crime scene reveals. Research by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit into sex-related homicides has disclosed a remarkable consistency in the type of person who commits certain acts. Although there are a wide range of differences among offenders who commit similar offenses, these offenders also share similarities and common traits. Organized and Disorganized Offenders The organized and disorganized dichotomy devised by the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit is a description of criminal offender typologies. Information presented here as it relates to the phenomena of organized and disorganized offenders is based upon studies and research of the Behavioral Science Unit, personal interviews with Supervisory Special Agent Robert K. Ressler (retired) and others involved in this project, as well as the personal experiences of the author as a homicide practitioner. The Organized Offender The organized offender is usually above average in intelligence. He is methodical, cunning, and his crime is well thought out and carefully planned. He is likely to have his own car, which is likely to be in good condition. The crime is usually committed out of his area of residence or work. He is mobile and travels many more miles than the average person. Fantasy and ritual are important to the organized type personality. The victims are people he considers the \"fight\" type, whom he can control (either through manipulation or strength), usually strangers, and share some common traits. He is considered socially adept and uses his verbal abilities to manipulate his victims and gain control over them. He is fully cognizant of the criminality of his act and takes pride in his ability to thwart the police investigation. He is likely to follow news reports of the event and will oftentimes take a personal item from his victim, which he may use to relive the event or continue the fantasy. 604 The body is most often removed from the crime scene. He may do this to cause the body to be found so he can \"taunt\" the police or to prevent its discovery by transporting it to a location where it will be well hidden. The Disorganized Offender The disorganized offender usually below average intelligence, a loner, who is usually not married, living either alone or with a relative in close proximity to the crime scene. He experiences difficulty in negotiating interpersonal relationships and is described as socially inadequate. He acts impulsively under stress and will usually select a victim from his own geographic area. He doesn't own a vehicle and avoids people in genera/. He is usually described as a sexually incompetent and has no meaningful sexual relationships. The crime scene will be disorganized. He uses a \"blitz\" style of attack, which catches the victim off-guard. This spontaneous action, in which the offender suddenly acts out his fantasy has no specific \"game plan ~ or thought about being detected. The disorganized offender usually depersonalizes the victim by facial destruction or overkill type wounds. Any sexually sadistic acts are performed postmortem. Mutilation to the genitals, rectum, breasts of females, neck, throat and buttocks are performed because these parts contain a strong sexual significance to him. There may be evidence of disembowelment, amputation, and/or vampirism. The death scene and the crime scene are generally in the same location and there is usually no attempt to conceal the body. If the body has been mutilated, he may position it in a special manner that has significance to him. The murder weapon, usually obtained from the scene, is oftentimes left behind. Human behavior, although unpredictable, is oftentimes repetitive. Certain actions engaged in at the crime scene by certain types of personalities will repeat themselves in other homicide investigations. A criminal investigative analysis can prove to be a good investigative strategy in cases that reveal some sort of personality aberration. The National Center For The Analysis Of Violent Crime, based at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, can provide law enforcement authorities such an analysis or other services that can be useful in certain types of crimes. (See Law and Order, January, 1986, Mass, Serial and Sensational Homicide: The Investigative Perspective.) A homicide investigator, through experience and review of similar types of cases, must develop a base of knowledge that he can apply to each investigation. The nature of the act and the type of person who would commit a specific type of act are important considerations in the \"Who Could Have Done It?\" scenario. However, keep in mind that; \"things are not always as they appear to be.\" 605 The motivation behind the act is an important consideration. Was it a lovers' quarrel? Or is the offender psychotic, in which case the crime sometimes appears to be motiveless or bizarre? Or is the homicide the work of a psychopath, with sadistic or impulsive implications? No one acts without motivation. According to the late Dr. James Brussel, a criminal psychiatrist, \"Even the acts of a madman possess a certain type of logic. There is a method to their madness. A logic and even a rationale hidden behind what he does and how he does it, however wildly bizarre and completely without reason it appears to be...\" The investigative challenge is to discover this perverse or seemingly irrational logic and then apply this information to the case. The identification of the victim is a crucial consideration in determining the victimization. \"Who is the deceased? N Investigation into the victim's background, lifestyle, and associations many times will reveal the possible motivation of the killer. An examination of any relationships, acquaintances, and risk factors may provide a clue to the \"Who could have done it?\" scenario. For example: Who does the victim live with? Who was the victim with last? Does it appear that the victim knew the assailant? What is the victim's current social status? Why was this particular victim selected? Does the crime appear to be a \"stranger-homicide\"? Was the deceased in a high-risk occupation (call girl or prostitute)? Was the victim a runaway or hitchhiker? Or, was the victim a late hours worker e.g. waitress, or a service worker, who had to travel alone at night? Any number of similar questions must be asked and answered depending upon the scenario presented in the crime scene. Keep an open mind; don't jump to any conclusions, especially as they relate to human behavior and human sexuality. 606 Table 2 Profile Characteristics of Organized and Disorganized Murders ORGANIZED Average to above-average intelligence Socially competent Skilled work preferred Sexually competent High birth order status Father's work stable Inconsistent childhood discipline Controlled mood during crime Use of alcohol with crime Precipitating situational stress Living with partner Mobility with ear in good cond.

Law Enforcement Bulletin, August, 1985. DISORGANIZED Spontaneous offense Victim/location known Depersonalizes victim Minimal conversation Crime scene random and sloppy Sudden violence to victim Minimal use of restraints Sexual acts after death Body left in view Evidence/weapon often present Body left at death scene 607 Classifications Based upon my experience as a homicide detective, sex-related homicides can be divided into four distinct categories: 9 Interpersonal violence oriented disputes and assaults 9 Rape and/or sodomy oriented assault 9 Deviant oriented assault/the lust murder 9 Serial murder Interpersonal Violence The most common type of sex-related homicide is one that originates from interpersonal violence. These include disputes involving husbands/wives, men/women, boyfriends/girlfriends, girlfriends/girlfriends, boyfriends/boyfriends, and even siblings. may also involve third party relationships such as jilted lovers. They The death may not appear to be sexually motivated, but upon examination into the circumstances, the elements of rage, hate, anger, or revenge may reveal the true motivation. For example, police may be called to a location where a male or female is found fully clothed and shot in the head \"execution-style. ~ At first, this death will appear to be other than sex related. Upon checking into the background and relationships of the victim, a new possibility may present itself. Many times a simple solution or motivation is clouded by what was done to the body or how the crime scene was changed. What may appear to be the work of a sexual psychopath often turns out to be an enraged lover or spouse who under emotional circumstances attempted to destroy the victim by depersonalization of the body, facial destruction, and/or multiple cuttings and stabbings, some of which may be postmortem. Rape and/or Sodomy Assault Such a sex-related homicide may be directed in overcoming the victim and/or furthering the sexual assault. It may be heterosexual or homosexual and the intent may be forcible rape or forcible sodomy. The intent of the perpetrator is sexual assault and not homicide. These cases may be extremely brutal; death usually results from the assailant overcoming the resistance of the victim to rape, sodomy, or homosexual assault. The victim may be choked or strangled into submission or the mouth and nose may be held tightly in order to stifle the victim's screams, causing asphyxia. Blunt force injuries may be present when the killer has attempted to beat the victim into submission. In addition to the brutality of the attack a victim may also die of shock or other trauma. This is especially evident in young children or older persons. 608 In some instances the death may be intentional. This is especially true in cases where the killer is known to the victim. These types of cases usually have been preceded either by some nuisance type offenses (voyeurism, exhibitionism, telephone scatologia) or other sexual offenses including rapes or sodomies where the victim was not killed. The investigative approach should be to first ascertain whether or not other cases involving similar M.O. have taken place. Action should concentrate on this avenue of inquiry and on research of records for similar offenses committed in the past by someone, recently released from prison. Deviant Oriented Assault The lust murderer oriented towards deviant and sadistic assault, is distinguished from other sex-related homicide offenders by the involvement of mutilation. Most such murderers, according to studies conducted by the FBI, will not participate in sexual activity with their victims e.g. penis penetration. Instead, they may masturbate upon their victims and engage in postmortem mutilation, such as displacement of the breasts of females, postmortem attack of the genitalia (male and female); insert objects into the body cavities of their victims; and possibly engage in anthropophagy, which is consumption of human flesh. This killer, who usually acts on the spur of the moment, is obsessed with some sort of perverse fantasy. In his own mind he has planned this event and he has \"complete control.\" However, when the opportunity presents itself, the killer, who is generally a disorganized personality, either panics or becomes so involved in his fantasy that he is totally oblivious to the fact that he is leaving evidence behind. For example, the body is usually left at the location of assault, there may be evidence of blood smearing on the body (which means there might be blood on the killer), evidence of masturbation (which may provide blood type of suspect), tire marks or footprints, personal items of the killer left behind, and maybe even the suspect's fingerprints left at the scene. Many times he will take a \"souvenir\" from his victim, usually some personal item, or even a body part that has some sexual significance to him, such as a breast. Many times he will return to the crime scene, either to relive the event or engage in further mutilation of the corpse. The Serial Murder Serial murder is the killing of separate victims with time breaks, from days to weeks or months, between victims. These time breaks between killings are referred to as \"cooling- off\" periods. There has been much interest in the phenomenon of serial murder, and a number of articles and books on the subject are now available. The recent NBC mini-series \"The Deliberate Stranger\" was based upon the deviant exploits of Ted Bundy, a convicted serial killer, who received a judicial execution by electrocution on January 24, 1989, in the Florida State Prison, Florida. 609 In psychiatric terminology, a serial killer may be classified as either psychotic or psychopathic depending on the information examined as well as the facts of the crime. In the experience of the author, however, serial killers are rarely psychotic. They are usually sexual psychopaths who have a profound criminality and are definitely in touch with reality. In the case of a psychotic killer, one could propose that he killed because his psychosis drove him to kill. In the case of a psychopathic killer, especially a serial murderer, I would suggest, based on the studies of the FBI and personal experience, that he kills because he likes to kill. Serial killers have been described as intelligent, charismatic, street-wise, charming, and generally good looking. They are mobile individuals, capable of traveling miles in search of the \"right\" victim someone who is vulnerable and easy to control. Their victims may be females, children, vagrants, homosexuals, or prostitutes. Serial killers are extremely manipulative and are oftentimes able to \"talk\" their victims into what has been described as a \"comfort zone\": a location where they can control their victims. Many times they use a ruse (cast on arm--Bundy) to get their victims alone. They are continually perfecting their ruse and have an uncanny knack for recognizing potential victims. Many serial killers have a fascination for police procedure; some have even worked as police officers or security guards and use this experience to avoid detection. They have been known to frequent police hangouts and eavesdrop on police conversations during a case. Some have even interjected themselves into the investigation. Some serial killers have returned to the scene of the crime or the location where the body was discovered, either to assess the investigation or to taunt the police with additional clues. A serial killer, despite his outward facade, is a very insecure individual. He is without any power until he has a victim under his control. He feels secure in this temporary superiority. They enjoy the publicity of their crimes for the same reason. They are likely to follow events in the news very closely and gain satisfaction in the knowledge that they have defeated the police. Serial killings are considered by some psychologists to represent the ultimate extension of violence. From a rational standpoint, serial killings are completely senseless acts. However, the serial killer experiences great pleasure in exerting power and control over victims, including the power of life and death. The sex act is secondary. He is excited by the cruelty of his act and will oftentimes torture his victim to death. He may even resort to tape recording his victim's screams of pain, which he can use to enhance his fantasies when he doesn't have a victim to \"play with.\" He may even use this 610 recording to terrorize future victims. Any mutilation of the victim will have been done either to shock the authorities or to render the remains unidentifiable. Although many serial killers were known to engage in normal sexual relations with a primary female in their lives, they really do not have any type of satisfactory relationship with anyone. They are into self-gratification to a point where nothing else matters. Most serial killers report that they were victims of child abuse, usually at the hands of a female parent or parent figure. Many offenders were reportedly under the influence of alcohol or drugs, at the time of their crime, which tended to exacerbate their sadistic fantasies. A serial killer's homicides tend to increase towards the end of their course of conduct. It appears that they have to kill more often in order to enjoy the \"high\" they get from the act. Most serial killers have been caught by accident, as they became bolder in their pursuits and disregarded the risks. This type of killer never stops killing until caught and put in prison or until he dies. There is no known cure for a sadistic sexual psychopath who has become a serial killer. ~ Criminal investigators confronted with a sex-related homicide should first address the basic crime scene techniques of documentation and preservation before delving into the more intricate possibilities that each case presents. Remember, there are four distinct categories of sex related homicides: (1) interpersonal violence related disputes and assaults, (2) rape and/or sodomy oriented assault, (3) lust murderers, and (4) serial murder. Each has specific law enforcement strategies and present a number of investigative practicalities. All four are amenable to standard investigative techniques, including profiles and computer analysis of similar offenses. However, within each of these categories there exists the elements of human sexuality and sexual deviance. The goal is to identify the motivation and then pursue the investigation utilizing every tool available. This could range from a sophisticated criminal investigative analysis provided through the National Center For The Analysis of Violent Crimes or a simple re-canvass of the neighborhood where the crime took place. In any event, there are no simple solutions, nor standard procedures or explanations to account for the reasoning of a person who commits a sex-related homicide. 611 SEXUAL HOMICIDE J. C.

Forensic Psychology: Criminal Personality Profiling Anthony J. Pinizzotto During the decade of the 1950s, New York City was engaged in a massive manhunt. The city was under a constant threat of explosive devices being triggered at any moment. These intermittent detonations were the cause of constant fear and anxiety for citizens, law enforcement personnel, and firefighters. During an 8-year period, 32 devices were triggered by an individual who had become known as \"The Mad - Bomber.\" Conventional investigative techniques had failed to offer substantive leads. Police and fire inves- tigators reached a blind alley. It was at this point that the police requested the aid of a New York City psychiatrist. The services of Dr. James A. Brussel had been engaged in order to con- struct a personality profile of the \"type of person\" who would be capable of performing these \"mad bombings.\" After analyzing the data given to him by authorities, Dr. Brussel determined the following: the \"Mad Bomber,\" when apprehended, will be found to be between the ages of 40 and 50 and of Eastern European stock; he is currently living in Connecticut with either his sister or a maiden aunt; during his childhood, his relationship with his father was negative, though he loved his mother and got along well with her. Diag- nosed as a paranoid personality, the \"Mad Bomber\" would be apt to pay great attention to details: when apprehended Dr. Brussel not only suggested that the \"Mad Bomber\" would be dressed in a double- breasted suit---but that all the buttons would be but- toned (Brussel 1968). Within the same year that Dr. Brussel completed his psychological profile of\"The Mad Bomber,\" the New York City police arrested and charged George Metesky for the bombings. George Metesky, Slavic by birth, at the time of his arrest was in his early 50s, single, living in Connecticut with his two unmarried sisters~ and wearing a double-breasted suit with vir- tually all the buttons buttoned. Was this accuracy coincidental? Was Dr. Brussel's ability a singular act? What was the doctor's process of inference, and can this process become objectified? This investigative procedure is not as singular---or as mystical--as it may at first appear. In fact, psycho- logical profiling has been used in a large number of cases within the last 20 years. Some of the more celebrated cases are: the Boston Strangler, Charles Manson, Son of Sam, Richard Speck, and the York- shire Ripper (Douglas, in press; Marks 1981). The actual origins of criminal profiling are obscure (Ault and Reese 1980; Douglas, in press). For cen- turies there have been attempts to describe physical and/or psychological attributes that would clearly in- dicate potential and actual criminal types. Even such literary works as Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and E. A. Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" exhibit examples of attempts to profile certain behaviors by means of physic~d attributes (McPoyle 1981). A less celebrated, but no doubt important use of psychological profiling took place during World War !I. William Langer, a psychiatrist, was employed by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to profile the personality of Adolph Hitler. The material assembled by Langer included a psychological description of Hitler's personality, a diagnosis of his condition, and a predictive statement suggesting how Hitler would re- act to defeat (Ault and Reese 1980; Langer 1972). How does one develop such a profile? What materi- 637 1984] CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 33 als are the necessary ingredients of profiling? What kinds of crimes are more appropriately profiled? The balance of this paper will deal with answers to these basic questions. Let us begin by defining the process of psychologi- cal profiling. A psychological profile focuses attention on individuals with personality traits that parallel traits of others who have committed very similar offenses (Geberth 1983). It is through close examination of the crime scene that one is able to extrapolate certain relevant psychological material that leads to a profile. A forensic pathologist will allow the corpse to \"tell how it was murdered\" by bruises, marks, and chemi- cal analyses. The forensi c investigator will let the entire crime scene, including the victim, tell \"what KIND of person committed this act.\" Not all crime scenes are appropriate for profiling, however. Only where psychopathology is evidenced will the scene lend itself tO being profiled. Common burglaries, \"smoking-gun\" crimes where a victim is simply shot in the commission of a robbery, and most property ~destruction cases are among the kinds of crimes which are not suitable for profiling (Hazel- wood 1983). Another area of crime not apropos for profiling is the drug induced crime. Because drugs are mind altering substances, the personality is in an al- tered state during the commission of the crime. It becomes increasingly difficult to determine which traits are nondrug induced (personality traits) and which traits are the effect of the drugs (Hazelwood 1983). For any crime where there is some indication of psychological dysfunction, a profile can be attempted. Certain crimes are most appropriate (Douglas, in press): sadistic torture in sexual assaults; evisceration; post mortem slashings and cuttings; post mortem motiveless firesettings; lust and mutilation murders; ritualistic crimes; and rapes. Once it is determined that a crime scene exhibits evidence of a mental or personality aberration and profiling is requested, what steps are required to con- duct such a forensic investigation? This process in- volves five steps (Douglas, in press): 1. a comprehensive study of the nature of the criminal act and the types of persons who have committed this offense 2. a thorough analysis of the specific crime scene involved in the case 3. an in-depth examination of the background and activities of the victim(s) and any known suspect(s) 4. a formulation of the probable motivating factors of all parties involved 5. the development of a description of the per- petrator based upon the overt characteristics associated with his probable psychological make-up. The factors frequently assessed and described in a psychological profile of a perpetrator are: the sex and age range; marital status; education level; general em- ployment; reaction to police questioning; degree of sexual maturity; whether the individual might strike again; the possibility that he has committed a similar offense in the past; and whether he possibly has a police record (Ault and Reese 1980; Geberth 1983). As previously stated, the profile is developed from material collected from the crime scene; hence, the crime scene material must be as complete as possible. Necessary information required in order to develop a complete profile includes (Ault and Reese 1980; Douglas, in press; Geberth 1983): 1. Photographs of the crime scene. This includes color photos of the victim, enlarged photos of the wounds on the vic- tim's body, various angles and positions of the victim, and complete photos of the entire area of the crime. 2. Neighborhood and Complex. This includes racial, ethnic, and social data. 3. Medical Examiner's Report. This includes photos depicting the full ex- tent of damage to the body, toxicology re- ports, report on presence of any semen and post mortem wounds. 4. Map of the victim's travels prior to death. This includes place employed, residence, and where last seen before the crime scene location. 5. Complete investigative report of the inci- dent. This includes standard report of date, time, location, etc.; weapon, if known; investiga- tive officer's reconstruction of the sequence of events; and detailed interview of wit- nesses. 6. Background on the victim. This includes age; sex; race; physical de- scription including dress of the incident; marital status/adjustment; intel- ligence, scholastic achievement, and adjust- ment; life style and recent changes in life style; personality style and characteristics; demeanor; residency, former and present, 638 34 ANTHONYJ. PINIZZOTTO IVol. 12 and its relation to the crime scene; sexual adjustment; occupation, former and pre- sent; reputation at home and at work; medi- cal history, physical and mental; fears; per- sonal habits, such as the use of alcohol or drugs; social habits; hobbies; friends and enemies; and recent court action. Once the above listed material has been collected (referred to as the \"WHAT\" of the crime), the profiler attempts to determine the \"WHY\" of the crime, that is, the motivation to commit such a crime. A'basic premise of profiling (Hazelwood 1983) is that if the WHAT and the WHY of the crime can be determined, the WHO will follow. Let us now view this material in relation to an actual case (Hazelwood 1983). The following incident oc- cured in a white, upper-class neighborhood during the summer months of school recess. The victim was a 12- year-old male. Routinely, the victim would go fishing in a pond (see figure 1) located approximately 3/8 of a mile from his home duriag the afternoon. The victim's father, a physician, knew his son would return from the pond and be ready for dinner by five o'clock in the evening. FIGURE I RELAI'IVE LOCATIONS OF THE B USH AND POND IN CRIME SCENE FIGURE 2 BODY OF VICTIM LOCATED ON BUSH On a particular day the child did not return in time for dinner. After waiting a short time, the father fol- lowed the walking path through the wooded area to the pond. However, before reaching the pond he dis- covered the body of his son lying exposed on the top of a large bush (see figure 2). Realizing his son was dead, he immediately notified the police. The crime scene photographs, police incident re- port, maps of the location, and the coroner's reports afforded the investigators with the necessary WHAT of. the crime--the details of the crime. They can be outlined as follows: 1. Body shot in the back with a .22 caliber firearm from a distance of 18\" from the body. 2. Post mortem stab wound located in the up- per torso of the body. 3. Post mortem anal assault was evidenced. 4. Body was washed in the pond after death was effected. 5. Body was redressed with a new T-shirt. The shirt was the victim's correct size, but it was NOT owned by the victim. 6. Body was moved from the pond where the murder took place and was displayed on the top of a large bush. 7. Boy's pants were up and zipped. Having assembled the facts of the case, the profiler is now able to ask questions concerning motivational intent, that is, the WHY of the crime. Let us examine each of the facts of the crime in an attempt to determine the possible reasons an indi- vidual would commit each of these acts. A word of caution: in attempting to understand the reason for an action, always view the act from the perspective of the perpetrator (Hazelwood 1983); otherwise, any expla- nation falls very short of comprehension. An examination of the crime scene suggests the following. It would appear that the victim and the actor were acquainted. Further, it can be suggested that the actor felt some degree of affinity for the victim. This is neither to suggest the actor was related to the victim nor that they were very close in friendship; however, they did know one another. This acquaintance is suggested for the following reasons. The victim was shot at a close range, only 18\" from the gun muzzle. An even stronger reason to suggest that they knew one another, though distantly, is due to the fact the boy was dressed in a new T-shirt, one that though it was his exact size, was not owned by the boy. The actor must have known the boy be- forehand to have known the correct size. (This appar- 639 1984] CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 35 ent premeditation will tell us more information about the actor later as well.) Having placed the body on a bush in plain view suggests that the actor wanted the body discovered. There are three ways of disposing a body (Hazelwood 1983): dump, conceal, and display. In \"dumping\" a body, there is no concerted effort to conceal the act or the victim. Generally, the actor is disorganized, expe- riencing a panic reaction state, and is only concerned with \"getting rid of the body.\" \"Concealing\" the body suggests some organization and possibly suggests premeditation. The body may be burned, cut up into unrecognizable parts, or buried in a deep grave. \"Displaying\" the body suggests the actor wished that the body be found. There are two reasons to want the body found: (l) concern for the victim and/or the family, and (2) in order to taunt the family, friends, police, and/or the community. The way in which the body is \"displayed\" will indicate whether the desire is to taunt or whether the desire is to have the body found out of concern. In this present case, given the additional facts that the body was washed and dressed subsequent 9 to the killing, it would appear that the perpetrator acted out of a morbid sense of concern for the child and/or his family in displaying the body. \"Undoing\" is a psychological process where an. 9 individual attempts, through some ritualistic behavior, to \"undo\" the event which he caused. In other words, it is an attempt to atone for and so counteract some immoral act or desire (Coleman 1980). A clear exam- ple from literature is Pontius Pilate's washing of his hands in the Bible as an attempt to display his inno- cence of the blood of Jesus. A more poignant example is found in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Lady Macbeth, after her involvement in the death of Duncan, devel- oped a handwashing obsession, a clear, albeit uncon- scious, attempt to wash away her guilt. In the present case, by washing the body of his victim, this actor was seemingly both cleansing the body in preparation for its display as well as attempting to \"undo\" his actions. The post-mortern'anal assault suggests two possible interpretations. The first explanation relates to the same reason for displaying the body in the \"wake- like\" position (cleansed and dressed), namely, out of concern for the victim. By assaulting the child post- mortem, the actor avoided inflicting further physical harm on the victim. (Remember, these explanations and reasons must be seen from the perspective of the actor of the crime.) Second, the post-mortem assault further suggests a tremendous amount of sexual inade- quacy on the part of the offender. The post-mortem stabbing in the upper torso is an example of a psychological perversion called piquer- ism (deRiver 1958; Morneau and Rockwell 1980). Piquerism is a perversion wherein one derives sexual gratification by piercing or stabbing his victim. A typical case of piquer was a young man in his early twenties who operated and performed his perverted sexual aggressive activities only at night or in crowds. He did not wait to see how much destruction his actions reaped, but quickly disappeared into the crowds or into the blackness of the night. All of his victims were of the same age group, all were apparently un- known to him, none of them ever saw his face. He inserted his sharp instrument (an ice pick) into the thigh or breast of his female victim with such rapidity that she hardly knew what had happened. (deRiver 1958, p. 46). Often, when mutilation, maiming, and cutting occur, they are delivered after the assailant murders his vic- tim (deRiver 1950b; Reinhardt 1957). In this present case, perhaps one can again see a morbid sense of concern for the boy, not stabbing him until after he had already delivered the death shot from behind. Analyzing the details (WHAT) of the crime and then suggesting reasons (WHY) for these actions, one can now ask what type (WHO) ofperson is likely tO kill a 12-year-old boy in this manner? Many of the answers listed below are the result of statistics. In other words, given many incidents of a similar nature, the investigators have discovered that the individuals who often committed \"this particular type of offense\" displayed certain specific characteris- tics or traits. Let us begin now to draw apicture, using statistics of similar cases as well as psychological explanations of aberrant behavior. The first and major recognition is that we are deal- ing with a pedophile, an adult individual who chooses a child or an adolescent as one's sexual object (deRiver 1958i Hazeiwood and Douglas 1980; Mohr, Turner, and Jerry 1964). Pedophiles are classified into two groups, with classification made on the following bases (Bartol 1980; Burgess, et al. 1978; deYoung 1982): if the adult has been involved in this kind of activity since adolescence, he is considered a fixated pedophile; if, on the other hand, the individual's in- volvement constitutes a recent change in sexual ac- tivity, he is a regressed pedophile. This is an excep- tionally important point because the regressed pedophile will act and react quite differently from the 640 36 ANTHONY J. PINIZZOTTO [Vol. 12 fixated pedophile, as they are quite distinct types. The resressed pedophile is a persota who originally preferred peers or adult partners for sexual gratifications. How- ever, wheu these adult relationships became conflictual in some important respect, the adult became replaced by the child as the focus of this oerson's sexual interests and desires .... The situational crises may be physical, social, sex- ual, marital, financial, vocational, etc.---or a combination of such factors--but it precipitates the sexual involvement with a child. His of- fense is an impulsive and desperate act that is symptomatic of a failure to cope adaptively with specific life stresses .... Typically this offender is married and a situation develops that threatens tMs relationship.... Quite often he is distressed by this behavior.... At the time of the sexual activity, this offender is usually in a state of depression .... he suspends his usual values, his controls aro weak... (Burgess, et at. 1978, pp. 8-9). This is contrasted with the fixated pedophile who has, from adolescence, been sexually at- tracted primarily or exclusively to significantly younger people, and this attraction has per- sisted throughout his life, regardless of what other sexual experiences he has had. As a teen- ager this offender tends to avoid the usual pat- , tern of socialization with age-mates typical of adolescence, such as dating and competitive sports .... The fixated pedophile may respond to sexual invitations or demands from age- mates, but generally does not initiate or actively pursue them .... For the most part, these ped- ophile desires are not disturbing to the fixated offender; that is, he is comfortable and satisfied with such activity and experiences no intense feelings of guilt, shame, or remorse in this regard .... Sexual thoughts and fantasies about children or young adolescents preoccupy the offender, and interest in them often reaches the level of an obsession. The offender appears sexually \"addicted\" to children .... He ap- pears to be a marginal or inadequate individual who is somewhat overwhelmed by the ordinary demands of life. He feels compelled to interact sexually with children, and he finds or creates opportunities to be in their company (Burgess, et al. 1978, pp. 6-7). Consequently, we can derive the following major differences between the regressed and the fixated ped- ophile: Regressed Pedophile: a. Psychosexual development was normal be- yond the adolescent stage. b. He regresses when feelings of inadequacy intrude. c. The crime scene is disorganized; it evi- dences little or no plan. d. If he kills his victim, it is out of fear and panic. e. Disposal of the body will be accomplished by \"dumping\" it in some fashion. This is a result of his lack of organization as well as a reaction to his fear, guilt, and panic. Fixated Pedophile: a. He has been directed to younger objects sexually since adolescence. b. He has not experienced a \"normal\" sex life, nor has he been married. c. His job and/or recreational activities place him in situations where he must deal with children, d. Statistically (Hazelwood 1983), when a fix- ated pedophile murders, he is in the 45-55 age bracket. There are several other facts that can be drawn from statistical knowledge of crimes of a similar nature> Based on the fact that most pedophiles are caucasian and the fact that this crime occurred in a segregated, white, upper-class neighborhood during the daylight hours, the chances are more than significantly high that the offender will be a 45-55-year-old white male. He is probably of average to better than average intel- ligence. This is both a statistical finding as well as a recognition of the details of the crime and the crime scene. Given his intelligence and abilities, he may well have attended college and is now employed in a white-collar job which brings him in contact with children. Our profile indicates that the offender is single and sexually inadequate (as indicated from the classifica- tion as a fixated pedophile). One can also suggest, given his long standing proclivity toward children, that he has an extensive record for child molesting. It is known from the crime scene that this offender is well organized and does not generally act on impulse. It is then reasonable to suggest that the offender does not live in proximity to the crime. He is too organized to commit such an act \"in his own back yard.\" 641 1984] CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 37 Considering the year .,t tllae :rune (early 1970s) and the probable age of the .,r't'em~r (45-55), it is reason- able, then, to assun~ th~ lae i~ a military veteran.

A review of the material submitted by the various field divisions for analysis revealed that requests had originated with the jurisdictional areas of 54 field offices and 2 local attaches. While the majority of these submissions were from city police (52 percent), requests came from all levels of law enforcement services in- cluding county police or sheriff (32 percent); FBI (8 percent); state police (7 percent); state investigators (5 percent); and state highway pa- trol (1 percent) (see table 1).

Psychological profiling is one investigative tool among many tools 9 It is not a magical solution nor is it a \"substitute for a thorough and well-planned investi- gation\" (Douglas, in press) 9 Rather, it is an attempt to utilize behavioral and psychodynamic principles of psychology in an applied setting 9 Given the above data in regard to the interaction of psychodynamic and behavioral principles with the in- vestigative tools of law enforcement, certain questions remain. What will future applications look like? And what place will research play in establishing validity and reliability? Certainly, in today's age of the computer, a recurrent question that is asked of the FBI is \"Couldn't this entire procedure be placed within a computerized framework?\" In other words, facts from a crime scene can be punched into a terminal and a computerized profile will appear on the screen. Such a system is being developed by the FBI. Eventually, it is hoped that any law enforcement officer from any jurisdiction will have such capabilities at his disposal. The officer will be able to enter data from a crime scene which occurred in this jurisdiction through a computerized cross-reference system which will analyze similar crimes from across the nation. A profile will be drawn as to such characteristics as sex, age; race, and proba- ble residence in relation to the crime scene 9 These characteristics will be weighted numerically, depend- ing on the frequency with which they appear in similar crimes in the past (Porter 1983) 9 The possible short- coming of this computer technology lies in the com- bination of factors that are orchestrated to produce a profile, namely, common sense, logic, intuition, and experience, both street and academic (Hazelwood 1983) 9 Until this process is underway, it remains a question: \"Will the computer programmer be able to factor in such ingredients as common sense, intuition, and street experience?\" Once underway, the \"sign vs. seer\" approach or the \"sign vs. seer plus sign\" ap- proach can be empirically tested in either real or simu- lated ways. Before moving to a specific research question, there is one related area that should be addressed: the \"pro- active\" use of psychological profiling. This proactive use of profiling is applied in two areas: (1) bringing an unknown suspect to reveal himself, and (2) causing a known suspect to \"break down\" and reveal his guilt. Through media presentations one can create anxiety within certain offender types who listen to and read media reports. The degree of anxiety may be enough to cause a precipitous move on his part, thus calling attention to himself (Portdr 1983) 9 The second area where proactive profiling is ap- plicable is within the court proceeding. With a knowl- edge of the emotional and psychological profile of an offender, one is able to assist the prosecutor in court- room examination and cross-examination. This was clearly seen in the case of Wayne Williams, tried and convicted of murder in the Atlanta slayings: 9 . . the problem, from the prosecutor's point of view, was that in the beginning, Williams ap- peared too cool and composed--hardly the pic- ture of a man capable of murderous outbursts. \"We were concerned,\" Douglas recalls, \"that the jury was seeing him as a creditable type of person.\" Douglas therefore advised Mallard (Assistant District Attorney) to keep Williams on the stand as long as possible and to rattle him with detailed questions about the killings 9 \"It's difficult for him here in the courtroom where he's not in controland where all the flaws in his personality are coming out. The longer you can keep him up there, the more he'll become agi- tated and the greater the chance that he'll create an outburst 9 Douglas said (Porter 1983, p. 52). 643 1984] CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 39 An interesting research question also surfaces which deals primarily with regard to the reliability of th e process of psychological profiling. The following research proposals are designed to analyze the vari- ance within groups of profilers and between groups of profilers with reference to their reliability in profiling accuracy. The question can be formed as follows: Are the predictive statements of professional profilers statis- tically higher than chance, and are they statistically higher than the predictive statements of forensic psy- Chologists/psychiatrists-and of the general public? In order to test this question, crime scene data from three actual cases will be presented to each individual of the three groups 9 In each of the presenting cases, the actor of the crime will have been arrested, tried, and con- victed of the crime 9 Consequently, both reliability and validity of the predictions can be tested with reference to the actual offender 9 It is hypothesized that the forensic psychologist/ psychiatrist's accuracy will exceed that of the lay per- son. However, the professional profiler's accuracy will be greater than either of the other two groups 9 One might expect the forensic psychologist/psychi- atrist's ability to exceed the lay person's ability, based upon the psychologist/psychiatrist's educational back- ground in psychopathology 9 However, a major element is missing in the background of the \"typical\" forensic psychologist/psychiatrist: crime scene experience and investigative expertise. One of the major ingredients of profiling is intuition. ~ A large part of intuition results from actually having been involved in processing crime scene investigations. Though some forensic psychologists/psychiatrists do, in fact, \"develop\" this intuition, the incidence of this occurring remains seemingly low. A subsequent study analyzing within group reliabil- ity could then be made with data from the above study. It would be reasonable to expect some variance in the accuracy within each of the three groups. Of greater interest would be the variance within the group of professional profilers. Where differences in ratings are found, several questions would follow. Are the differences a result of unclear directions; ambiguous definitions; profiler's academic background and understanding of principles of psychopathology, especially due to approach (for example, psychoanalytic or behavioral); profiler's ex- perience with actual crime scenes; and profiler's inves- tigative experience. Currently, the Behavioral Science Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is developing a variety of research methods to statistically test for reliability and validity 9 Some of their methods will incorporate parts of the above described techniques; other forms of analyzing the data are presently in the planning stages (Hazelwood 1983b). As Bruce Porter stated in his article \"Mind Hunt- ers\" (1983): 9 . . the day does not seem far off when the police will be able to identify a criminal by the psychic loops and whorls he left at the scene, just as quickly and as surely as if he had covered the wall with fingerprints. But getting to \"that day\" is going to require the em- pirical support that researchers, particularly re- searchers in psychology and the behavioral sciences, can provide 9 ACKNOWLEDGMENT This author wishes to gratefully acknowledge the coopera- tion of the Behavioral Science Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Quantico, Virginia 9 Particular gratitude is ex- pressed to Special Agent Robert R.

Finkelt In this work we examine outcome and process differences in criminal personality profding among groups of profilers, detectives, psychologists, and students, using closed police cases---one sex offense and one homicide. Two major questions guide this research: (1) Are professional profilers more accurate than nonprofilers in generating personality profiles and correctly identifying offender features from crime scene details? and (2) Is the process that the profilers use qualitatively different from that of the nonprof'tlers? In the written profile task, the task that is most representative of what profilers actually do, profilers write richer, more detailed, and more valid profiles than the nonprofilers for both the sex offense case and homicide case. An analysis of correct responses concerning the known offender for the sex offense case revealed that the profilers scored significantly better than the other three groups in a variety of measures; similar results were not revealed for the homicide case. Pro- fliers, however, do not appear to process this material in a way qualitatively different from any other group. Criminal personality profiling--formerly the stock-in-trade of whodunit writers, whose fictional detectives transformed crime scene facts into a portrait of the perpetrator has itself been transformed in the last 20 years from fiction to fact. As the use of criminal personality profiling increases, empirical questions con- * This article is based in part on the doctoral dissertation of the first author.

Already one court has allowed partial reading of a personality profile to be introduced into testimony (Kentucky v. Gowin, 1986). The actual origins of criminal profiling are obscure (Ault & Reese, 1980). During World War II, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) employed William Langer, a psychiatrist, to profile the personality of Adolf Hitler; Langer described Hitler's personality, diagnosed his condition, and accurately predicted how Hitler would react to defeat (Langer, 1972). Psychological profiling was first used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1971 (Ressler, Burgess, Hartman, Douglas, & McCormack, 1986). In relatively short order, the early and isolated efforts have given way to the current era, where \"professional criminal personality profilers\" are trained (typically at the Behavioral Science Unit of the F.B.I. in Quantico, Virginia) and are then called upon with increasing frequency to assist in ongoing criminal investigations. Largely through the F.B.I.'s continued and increasing use of profiling, along with the training of profilers, the topic has become defined, its areas of applica- bility delimited, its procedural steps outlined, and its conceptual underpinnings articulated. A psychological profile (Geberth, 1983) focuses attention on individ- uals with personality traits that parallel traits of others who have committed similar offenses. Through close examination of the crime scene one is able to extrapolate certain relevant psychological material that leads to a profile; said another way, the forensic investigator will let the entire crime scene, including the victim, tell, in effect, what Mnd of person committed this act (Pinizzotto, 1984). Once it is determined that a crime exhibits evidence of a mental or personality aberration and profiling is requested, a five-step procedure typically follows (Ault & Reese, 1980; Douglas & Burgess, 1986; Geberth, 1983; Vorpagel, 1972): (a) a comprehensive study of the nature of the criminal act and the types of persons who have committed this offense; (b) a thorough analysis of the specific crime scene involved in the case; (c) an in-depth examination of the background and activities of the victim(s) and any known suspect(s); (d) a formulation of the probable motivating factors of all parties involved; and (e) the development of a description of the perpetrator based upon the overt characteristics associated with the person's probable psychological make-up. Once the material has been collected, referred to as the \"WHAT\" of the crime, the profiler attempts to determine the \"WHY\" of the crime: that is, the motivation for each crime scene detail and for the crime itself. A basic premise of profiling is that if the WHAT and the WHY of the crime can be determined, the WHO will follow (R. R. Hazelwood, personal communication, January 8, 1983). Thus, using behavioral, correlational, and psychodynamic principles of psychol- ogy, the profiler proceeds from the WHAT to the WHY to the WHO. Factors frequently assessed in a psychological profile of a perpetrator are: sex, age range, marital status, education level, general employment, reaction to police question- ing, degree of sexual maturity, whether the individual might strike again, the possibility that this person has committed a similar offense in the past, and whether the perpetrator has a police record (Ault & Reese, 1980; Geberth, 1983). CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 217 The Conceptual Underpinnings of Profiling The WHAT-to-WHY-to-WHO model, beyond providing a very general con- ceptual-sequential framework, lacks specificity on two counts: for one, it does not tell us precisely how (i.e., by what rules of thumb) the profiler gets from the WHAT to the WHY, or from the WHY to the WHO; and for another, it does not specify which behavioral, correlational, or psychodynamic principles are being invoked for making predictions from which type of crime facts, or how these various principles and predictions are interrelated. Various conceptual models (Dietz, 1985; Douglas, Ressler, Burgess, & Hart- man, 1986; Rossi, 1982) have attempted to describe the theoretical process pro- fliers use, withthe recent attempts focusing on psychological constructs and trait theory (Ellerby, 1986). To mainstream psychologists, the use of trait theory (All- port, 1967) may seem dated, if not questionable, given the situational emphasis (Mischel, 1979) and idiothetic thrust (Lamiell, 1987) of personality researchers and theorists today. However, trait theory has its defenders when it comes to criminal personality profiling, because the \"person variable\" repeatedly shows a greater consistency and weight when we move from normal the realm of applied forensic psychology, criminal person- ality profiling appears to benefit from this trait theory approach particularly when examining scenes that exhibit significant degrees of psychopathology. Rationale for this Study Given the growing use of the personality profile and the fact that this growing use is largely supported by testimonials and accuracy figures that were not ob- tained through controlled studies, this research was undertaken to provide more precise answers to both outcome and process questions. Regarding outcome, is the profiling of the experts accurate, and to what degree? Said another way, can the professional profilers' claim of expertise in criminal personality profiling be substantiated, when compared against control groups of experienced detectives, clinical psychologists, and college students? This outcome question will be tested using a homicide case (Burgess et al., 1986; Ellerby, 1986) and a sex offense case (Ressler et at., 1986; Scolatti, 1986). The second major question concerns the process of criminal personality pro- filing. That is, how do profilers and nonprofilers organize and recall knowledge related to crime scene investigations? Like the master chess player (Chase & Simon, 1973), mathematician (Larkin, McDermott, Simon, & Simon, 1980; Schoenfeld, 1980; Simon & Simon, 1978, 1979), and physicist (Larkin, 1979, 1980), experienced profilers may be able to give meaning to what might appear to the nonprofiler as random, inconsequential, or illogical. It is assumed here that because of this imposed meaning, the expert will organize and recall the details of the crime differently from the novice. In short, both qualitative and quantitative process differences should emerge between profilers and nonprofilers. 649 218 PINIZZOTI'O AND FINKEL The specific research hypotheses include the following: 1. Profilers will write more detailed, informative profiles than any other group. 2. Detectives, who are trained to look at and examine every detail on a crime scene, will recall a greater number of details than any other group. 3. Profilers, who are trained to discriminate relevant from extraneous details, will recall a greater number of details that are necessary and important to writing a profile. Profilers will describe more accurately the suspect in the sex offense than in the homicide offense. In the sex offense case, the profilers are supplied with a victim statement that generally gives a narrative of the crime as it occurred, but in the homicide case, no such witness statement is typically available. In the professional groups (profilers, detectives, and psychologists), (a) profilers will examine each detail of a crime scene, attempting to give reason for each detail--as~well as the motivation for the overall act; (b) detectives will look more to the motivation of the act (crime) itself without looking at the individual reasons for each detail on the crime scene; and (c) psychologists will examine some individual details and attempt to deter- mine motivation, but they will remain unclear as to which details are of significance. . . METHOD Subjects Of the 28 subjects used in this study, four (Group A, Expert/Teacher) were profiling experts who train police detectives in profiling at the F.B.I. Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Each of these subjects is or was an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They share a combined total of 42 years of profiling, with a range of 4-17 years experience. The authors were unable to locate sufficient numbers of expert/teachers who were both actively engaged in profiling and will- ing to cooperate in this study. Two of the four designated expert/teachers used in the study are no longer involved in profiling. Six subjects were police detectives from different police agencies across the country who have been specially trained in personality profiling (Group B, Pro- filer~s). The course of studies involved 1 year at the Behavioral Science Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Quantico. These six profilers have a combined total of 65 years as detectives in law enforcement (range = 7-15), and 14 years of combined experience in profiling (range = 1-6). Six detectives (Group C, Detectives) from a large metropolitan city police department made up another subject group. Though these detectives have no training in personality profiling, they are experienced police investigators in both homicide and sex offenses. They share a combined total of 93 years in the police 650 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 219 department and a combined total of 57 years experience in criminal investigations (range = 6-15). Six clinical psychologists (Group D, Psychologists), naive to both criminal profiling and criminal investigations, were used. The psychologists share a com- bined total of 85 years as practicing clinicians (range = 7-24). For all of the subjects in Groups A, B, C, and D, participation was voluntary and no remuner- ation was received. Six undergraduate students (Group E, Students) from a large metropolitan university naive to both personality profiling and criminal investigations were used. These students were drawn from several general psychology classes. The average age of the students was 19. For the students, participation in this study was voluntary, and each was given $10 for participation in this study. All of the subjects were treated in accordance with APA's Ethical Standards. Materials Two crime scene investigations of \"closed cases\" were used: these cases involve actual crimes that have been solved (an individual has been arrested, charged, and convicted of the crime). One case involved a homicide and the other involved a sex offense. The materials in the homicide case included: 1. Fourteen black-and-white crime scene photographs. 2. Information concerning the victim of the crime (victimology report). This material was compiled from statements given by relatives and friends as found in the police reports. The victim data included race, age, education, residence, physical disabilities, drug and alcohol use, and reputation, ac- cording to friends. 3. Autopsy and toxicology reports. These reports were provided by the med- ical examiner's office, and included the cause, manner, and mode of death. The toxicological examination of body fluids and organs is per- formed in order to determine if any chemical agents were present in the victim's system that would be related to his or her death. 4. Crime scene reports. These included the report of the first uniformed officer on the scene, the detectives' reports, and the follow-up investiga- tive reports as provided by the police department. These reports included date and time the body was discovered, and by whom, the area where the body was found, and the condition and arrangement of the body. The materials in the sex offense case included: 1. Detailed victim statement. The victim's statement of what happened and what the offender did and said, as she relayed it to the investigative de- tectives, was combined with the crime scene reports. The crime scene reports included the reports of the first uniformed officer on the scene, the detectives' reports, and the follow-up investigative reports as provided by the police department. Included in the report were the date and area of the 651 220 PINIZZOTrO AND FINKEL . i sexual offense, the race, age, and occupation of the victim, as well as the events that led up to the rape, the rape itself, and the events that followed the rape. Victimology. This comprised information concerning the victim of the crime. This material was offered by the victim herself as found in the initial police report. This information included the race, age, and occupation of the victim. Her physical appearance and personality as described by her friends as well as by the detectives who interviewed her were also given. A history of the victim's alcohol and drug use was included. For both cases, the materials were sanitized to protect the identities of both parties involved in the crime, as well as the police agencies. This unavoidable necessity meant that some material ordinarily available to profilers (e.g., maps of geographical area and neighborhood) was absent here. Prior to final selection of the cases, a search of newspaper and magazines from the areas in which the subjects resided was made. This search revealed no major news coverage of either case. As a check on \"prior familiarity,\" all subjects were instructed (on the Information Sheet each completed) as follows: \"During any part of this experi- ment, if you feel you are at all familiar with either of these cases, please inform the experimenter immediately.\" Procedure The study was administered in six stages. 1. All members of each group (A, B, C, D, E) were given either the homicide or the sex offense case to read. The cases were given in a balanced order. The subjects were told to read all the information concerning the particular case before them, and that after they completed the reading, they would be asked some questions concerning the materials. 2. Next, each subject was asked to cover all the material and to write down as many details of the case as the subject was able to recall. 3. At the completion of the recall of details task, the subjects were asked to follow a two-step procedure. Using the list of details that the subject recalled and wrote in Stage 2, the subject was asked to (a) write down all those details from the crime scene that you feel are necessary and impor- tant to be used in writing a profile concerning the characteristics and traits of the kind or type of person who would commit such an act as the one about which you just read, and (b) write down the reason why you feel these details are important, that is, what these details tell you about the person who committed this particular crime. 4. Each subject was then given the case jacket again and was asked to write a profile of the type of person who committed the crime they had just read and to give as much detail as possible. This step was recorded on audio tape. 5. Next, each subject was given a multiple choice question sheet which con- sisted of 20 questions about the suspect. These questions asked about the suspect's gender, age, race, and residence in relation to the occurrence of 652 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 221 . the crime; employment data regarding type of occupation and work habits; suspect's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; vehicle; victim--offender rela- tionship; likelihood that the offender committed similar crimes in the past as well as the likelihood that this particular offender will commit a similar act in the future. Five of these 20 questions were not scored because there were no correct answers to these questions (e.g., level of confidence in the subject's own prediction that the offender had a police record). For the remaining 15 questions that were scorable, the gender question had only two choices, whereas the other questions had 4--8 choices, with a total of 69 possible choices for the 15 questions. The last step was a lineup task. Five written descriptions of possible suspects were given to each subject. From the five descriptions, the sub- jects were asked to order each of them, ranging from one to five, with number one being the suspect whom the subject thinks committed the crime, and number five being the person the subject thinks is least likely to have committed the crime. These descriptions of possible suspects varied in the number of correct and incorrect items. Having completed Step 6 for the first case, each subject was asked to follow the same procedure---this time, analyzing the second crime. The only procedural differences occurred with Group A, the expert/teacher profilers. Specifically, they were not asked to complete Sections 2 and 3 of the procedure, as the purpose of using these expert/teacher profilers was only to determine a base line for a comparison of the responses of the expert profilers with the other groups. One section was performed by the expert/teacher profilers alone. At the completion of the Response Questionnaire Concerning Offender form for both the homicide and sex offense cases, the expert/teacher profilers were asked to com- plete the Probability Rating form in two different ways. First, these subjects were asked to rate their answers to the Response Questionnaire Concerning Offender form along an 11-point continuum. The weight given to each response was des- ignated as: 0 = impossible; 5 = uncertain; 10 = certain. The subjects were informed that their responses could be placed at any point along the 11-point continuum. The expert/teacher prof'ders rated their answers to the questionnaire first, then they were asked to rate the remaining possible answers in that same question. In the second step, the expert/teacher profilers were supplied with the correct answer to each of the questions of the Response Questionnaire Concern- ing Offender form. The subjects were informed that the correct answer was to be regarded as a 10 on the same 0-10 scale, with 10 being regarded as certain. Knowing the correct answer to each of these 15 questions, the subjects were to score each of the other possible choices in its relative reasonableness as correct answers. The Profile as an Investigative Aid After all subjects in all groups had completed these procedures, five repre- sentative profiles, one from each of the five groups (expert/teachers, profilers, 653 222 PINIZZOTTO AND FINKEL detectives, psychologists, and students), were selected in the following manner: The longest and the shortest profiles were eliminated, and then one was randomly selected from the remaining profiles. The profiles contained no information that would link the author to a particular group (i.e., expert/teacher, profiler, detec- tive, psychologist, student). Five detectives from a large, Eastern, metropolitan police department, who were not involved in any other part of this study, were given these representative profiles and the following instructions: Looking at the following five profiles, which profile might provide you with some assis- tance if you were investigating this homicide? Please rank order these profiles from one to five, with number one being the profde you feel might best assist you and number five being the proffie which you feel would be of least assistance in your investigation. RESULTS Outcome Analysis The Written Profile If expertise differs between the proffer group and the nonprofiler groups of detectives, psychologists, and students, the written profiles, of all the outcome and process measures, should reflect such differences. It is, after all, the written profile task which is most representative of what profilers actually do in their work. It was hypothesized that the profilers would write richer (i.e., more de- tailed) and more accurate profiles than subjects in the nonproffer groups. The profiles that were written by each subject in each of the four groups were analyzed for (a) the time spent doing the report, (b) the length of the report, (c) the number of predictions made concerning the offender, the number of those predictions that were (d) general or (e) specific in nature, the number of those predictions which were (f) confirmable and nonconfirmable (i.e., able to be determined by the police reports as a correct statement), and the number of (g) accurate predictions where the predictions were confirmable (see Table 1). For both the homicide and the sex offense cases, the profiles written by the professional profilers were indeed richer than the nonprofiler groups of detec- tives, psychologists, and students. An analysis of the subjects' responses using both multivariate (MANOVA) and univariate (ANOVA) measures (a 4 x 2 design, 4 groups of subjects, 2 cases) showed a significant main effect difference for the groups variable across all seven dependent measures, F(3,37) values ranged from 9.32 to 20.91, all at p < .001. In addition, Scheffe (Hays, 1963) post hoc analyses revealed significant differences between profiler versus nonproffer groups, law enforcement versus non-law-enforcement groups, and between professional ver- sus nonprofessional groups for all seven dependent measures. For the cases variable, there were significant main effects for five of the dependent measures (p < .05), with only the \"time spent writing the report\" and the \"length of the report\" variables failing to reach significance. Subjects in all groups recalled more details and made more predictions concerning the sex of- 654 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 223 Table 1.

Looking at the detectives' rankings of which profile might best assist in an investigation, 80% of these independent detectives ranked the expert/teacher pro- file as the one they felt would assist their investigation the most; 80% ranked the profile written by the professional profilers as their second choice. This was followed by 80% selecting the detective's profile as their third choice, and 80% selecting the psychologist's profile as their fourth choice. There was 100% agree- ment that the student profile ranked fifth of the five choices. Correct Responses Accuracy measures for the Response Questionnaire Concerning Offender were computed on the basis of 15 possible correct answers, and all groups were significantly above chance performance in terms of the number of correct re- sponses. A chi-square test found significant difference among the groups for the sex offense case, X 2 (3, N = 24) = 10.85, p < .05; such difference was not found for the homicide case. Further analyses for the sex offense case showed that profilers scored significantly better than the other three groups combined, \u008d (1, N = 24) = 5.69, p < .05; that the law enforcement groups of profilers and detectives did better than nonlaw enforcement groups of psychologists and students, \u008d (1, N = 24) = 8.2, p < .05; and that the professional groups of profilers, detectives, and psychologists did better than the nonprofessional group of students, \u008d (1, N, = 24) = 4.90, p < .05. An analysis of the specific questions for each case shows that profilers achieved higher group scores for the sex offense case in questions dealing with the age of the offender, the education of the offender, age, and condition of the 655 224 PINIZZOq\"ro AND FINKEL offender's automobile, and the victim--offender relationship. The prof'ders did not achieve higher scores than subjects in the other groups in these same categories for the homicide case, however. It was the detective group that scored higher in the homicide questions dealing with the offender's employment and the offender's residence in relation to the crime scene. Table 2 shows the number of correct responses by group and case. While there was some variability within groups, there were no examples of any extreme ranges. ,, Accuracy Scores The subjects' responses on the Response Questionnaire Concerning Offender form were analyzed in a different way by first deriving two sets of \"accuracy\" scores for each subject. The argument for this type of analysis is that all \"incorrect\" answers are not equally incorrect: Some incorrect answers are closer to the mark; others are far afield. Hence, the subjects' responses were converted into accuracy scores using weighted values for each of their 15 responses to the 15 scorable questions. These weighted values were derived from scores obtained from expert/ teachers (see Method section). A \"judgment\" score and a \"reality\" score were then computed for each subject, where the score for both judgment and reality could range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 150. An analysis of variance of judgment (4) Group \u008d (2) Case and reality, (4) Group \u008d (2) Case scores was computed, and a significant group effect resulted only for the reality scores, F(3,40) = 3.28, p < .05, for the sex offense case only. Only the profiler versus student group comparison was significant, F(3,40) = 2.84, p < .05. Lineup Rankings The question here was this: Would profilers be more apt to identify the correct offender from the lineup than would the other groups? In the sex offense case, the expert/teachers were accurate in picking out the offender 100% of the time, and the prof'ders were accurate 83% of the time. As for the other groups, Table 2.

If subjects were responding randomly, by chance they would get approximately 3.3 questions correct for each case. b Maximum possible score = 15. c Maximum possible score = 30. 656 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 225 accuracy is lower, and declines as we move from detectives (67%) to psycholo- gists (50%) to students (16%). Results varied between the sex offense and the homicide case in group ability to recognize the correct offender from the lineup. First, the percentages of cor- rectly recognizing the homicide offender from a lineup were lower than the sex offense case for all the groups. And second, although the expert/teachers and profilers were more accurate than the other groups for the sex offense case lineup, these results were not reproduced for the homicide case lineup. Process Analysis Recall of Details Given that the profilers scored better than the other three groups for the sex offense case, the question can be asked as to what accounts for these differences. Are the profilers processing the information given to them in ways that are dif- ferent from the other three groups? The first process area examined is the recall of details concerning the Crime. From the lengthy list of details recalled by each subject, the number of correct details was tabulated for each case (see Table 3). In the sex offense case, there was no significant difference among the groups, although a significant difference did result for the homicide case, with profilers recalling more details than the nonprofiler groups of detectives, psychologists, and students. As to the hypoth- esis that detectives, of all the groups, would recall the greatest number of details, this was not confirmed. It is profilers who recall the most details. Details as Necessary and Important The questions that arise here are these: (a) Do profilers, as opposed to the nonprofiler groups (detectives, psychologists, students), cite more details as nec- essary and important, and (b) do they make different types of attributions, and Table 3. Recall of Details by Group and Case Number of details recalled Homicide Sex offense Group ~ Mean SD Mean SD Profiler 54 25.6 51 2.4 Detective 44 16.6 54 21.3 Psychologist 38 10.4 48 2.4 Student 35 5.2 47 2.4 o The n's for each group = 6. The profiler vs. nonprofiler (detective + psychologist + student) comparison, X2 (1, n = 24) = 24, p < .01. The law enforcement (profiler + detective) vs. nonlaw enforcement (psychologist + student) comparison, \u008d (1 ~ n = 24) = 22.8, p < .01. The professional (profiler + detective + psychologist) vs. nonprofessional comparison, \u008d (1, n = 24) = 12.10, p < .01. 657 226 PINIZZOTrO AND FINKEL come up with different kinds of correlations or implications from these details? As it turns out, profilers do cite significantly more details as necessary and important than nonprofilers for the sex offense, \u008d (1, N = 24) = 8.0, p < .005, and the homicide cases, \u008d (1, N = 24) = 14.7, p < .005 (see Table 4). To answer the second question, the subjects' answers to why they thought these details were necessary and important and what types of attributions they made from these details were evaluated and placed in one of three categories: (1) specific psychological attributions given to a specific detail of the crime scene (specific-specific); (2) broad, global, and general attributions given to a specific detail of the crime scene (specific-global); (3) broad, global, and general psycho- logical attributes given to the general crime scene, without regard to specific details of the crime (global-global). To check the reliability of assigning these responses to one of the three categories, a second rater conducted an independent evaluation of these re- sponses. The rater's results were consistent with the first author's, as a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of r = .94 (Edwards, 1976, p. 35) was obtained. Profilers, it can be argued, would attend to more specific details of the crime scene and make more specific attributions about the offender. The results do not support this hypothesis. For the sex offense case, profilers used the specific- specific category 42% of the time, whereas detectives used it 49% and psychol- ogists 52% of the time; for the homicide case, the percentages were 6 I%, 57%, and 56% for the three groups, respectively. In both cases, the profilers, detectives, and psychologists most frequently used the specific-specific category (see Table 4). Although the profilers are not processing the data in qualitatively different ways from the nonprofilers, as the numbers show, they are doing more of it. Table 4.

There were, however, significant outcome differences between profiler and nonprofiler groups for the homicide case in all the analyses of the written profile. While the overall outcome superiority of the profilers is most likely indicative of greater expertise, it must be kept in mind that an \"investment\" factor could also be invoked to explain these results. Psychologists and students may see this task as an interesting exercise, whereas profilers, and detectives, perhaps, see it as the \"blood and guts\" of their professions, and therefore generate lengthier profiles and spend more time on the task. What accounts for the fact that profilers do better than nonprofilers for the sex offense case, and the fact that the outcome advantage is muted for the hom- icide case? One possibility that cannot be overlooked is the effect of sanitizing the crime reports. In compliance with the requests of the police agencies that offered these criminal cases, the cases had to be sanitized to the extent that no one reading them could identify the polic/e agencies, the victims, or the offenders. Consequently, some of the very detailed information concerning the victims had to bedeleted from the case file. All of the profilers spontaneously mentioned that data were missing, whereas none of the other subjects mentioned it. Perhaps the absence of a very detailed and extensive report affected the profilers more, and particularly for the homicide case. A second possibility is that there was more information, and more accurate information, for the profder to work with in the sex offense case than in the homicide case. In sex offense crimes, the victim is available to offer details con- cerning the crime. The victim can relate what the offender did prior to the actual assault, during the assault, and following the assault. The very approach that the sex offender uses on his victim will tell the investigator a great deal about the offender (Groth, Burgess, & Holmstrom, 1977; Hazelwood, \"Through an analysis of the offend- er's verbal, sexual, and physical behavior, it may be possible to determine what needs were being served and to project personality characteristics of the individ- ual having such needs\" (p. 25). This information is lost when the victim is not able to relate to the investigator just exactly what happened, as in a homicide case. For the homicide case, the profiler must reconstruct the crime with no verbal help from the victim, and this increases the probability of inaccuracies. One area of future research might examine the possible differences among profilers' offender profiles for homicide cases that have no witness to the crime and homicide cases where a witness to the homicide is available. A third possibility as to why the profilers completed a more accurate profile on the sex offense case than they did on the homicide case relates to the pecu- 659 228 PINIZZOTrO AND FINKEL liarities of this particular homicide case: That is, in a few but significant ways, the offender did not fit the base-rates. Two common base-rates that are frequently used are the victim's age and the victim's race in order to suggest the age and race of the offender. It has been found that violent crimes are generally perpetrated upon members of one's own age group and are intraracial in nature (U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, 1987). Thus, where a white victim, approximately 25 years of age, is found murdered, the investigators might begin by narrowing the possible field of suspects to a Caucasian between the ages of 18 and 28. Because most violent crimes are committed by males, the profile might also suggest thatmif there is no specific reason to think the crime was committed by a female---the offender will be a male. From these base-rates that suggest age, gender, and race, further assumptions and attributions are made. For example, if the offender is a white male between the ages of 18 and 22, some assumptions concerning his education, employment, marital status, and military record can be suggested. What is problematic in this homicide case is that the offender did not fall within those age base-rates. Though he was a white male, his actual age was much higher than the victim's age. If the offender had been the same age as the victim, given the type of murder and defilement of the body, it would be most unlikely for this offender to have been married. Falling outside the base-rates again, this offender was, in fact, married. The errors of the expert/teacher profilers and the errors of the professional profilers were errors generally involving these base- rates. Their responses were within the distribution of the base-rates for such crimes. This same base-rate explanation might also be applied to the homicide lineup exercise. Most groups chose Profile D as their first choice (i.e., the profile that ranked fourth in correctness) because this profde fit the general and accepted base-rates in certain major categories for this kind of crime better than any of the other profiles. It may seem surprising that the accuracy scores for the nonprofiler groups of detectives and psychologists came as close to the profilers as they did. Why were not greater differences observed between profilers and the nonprofiler groups? Two answers to this question are offered. The first is found in the very instru- ments used to test these differences. The use of a multiple choice questionnaire to determine measures of accuracy favors the nonprofiler groups because it gives the subjects cues as to what the possible answers are: It gives the subjects \"categories\" (i.e., the focal area of the question) that they might not ordinarily think about, and it gives a set number of possible choices. The correct responses of the nonprofiler groups may be artificially raised so that the true differences between profilers and the two nonprofilers groups of detectives and psychologists may be somewhat muted. This possibility seems to be borne out when a close examination of the written profile is made. It is in the written profile task when a blank page was given to the subjects and they were required to write a profile without the assistance of cues--where significant outcome differences emerged. In the written profile, the more representative task of criminal personality profil- ing, the profiler group was clearly superior. A final point on why the differences in outcome are not significantly higher for the profiler group than the nonprofiler groups: the small number of subjects. 660 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 229 With a larger sample, the differences ate more easily and more accurately mea- sured (Freedman, Pisani, & Purves, 1978). Concerning the process issue, in general, profilers do not appear to process the material in qualitatively different ways from nonprofilers in their construction of profiles. There are, however, numerous quantitative process differences that favor the profiler over all nonprofiler groups for both cases. It was hypothesized that the detectives would recall a greater number of details than any other group, given their training and orientation. A second hy- pothesis was that the profilers would recall more details that were necessary and important to profiling. The first hypothesis was not confirmed: Detectives did not recall more details overall; rather, both law enforcement groups (profilers and detectives) recalled significantly more details than the non-law-enforcement groups of psychologists and students. Perhaps, as the expert/novice literature suggests, it is the law en- forcement agents' familiarity with these kinds of cases and crime scenes that allows them to organize the information in ways that facilitate recall. The second hypothesis was confirmed: As expected, the profilers did recall more details considered to be necessary and important to profiling for both cases. Combining these two findings suggests that recall per se is not the crucial factor in explaining why profilers generate more accurate predictions than detectives; rather, it is the profiler's greater ability to extract and designate more details as necessary and important than the detectives that makes the difference. Said an- other way, it is not a memory difference, but a higher-order extracting difference that is primarily associated with outcome accuracy. It has been suggested that the process profilers use in deriving their profile follows a WHAT to WHY to WHO pattern. This is to say that once the details of the crime have been collected (WHAT) and the motivations for those particular details have been determined (WHY), the type of offender (WHO) can be sug- gested. Because we asked all the subjects to tell us their reasons for why a detail was important, the processes profilers and other groups used were clearly iden- tifiable. Our analysis confirms that this motivational process is used for examining some details of the crime, but it is not the only process that is engaged. Two others have been identified in this work. Where the WHAT-WHY-WHO process is motivational (i.e., seeking the motivation for a crime scene detail) the second process can be described as correlational, a WHAT to WHO process. The third process is also correlational, but it involves a second-order correlation: It can be described as a WHAT to WHO followed by further assumptions (i.e., correla- tions) based on the first WHO prediction. In other words, this third process can be seen as a WHAT to WHO with a correlation/attribution loop. The second of these processes, the WHAT to WHO, basically involves the profilers' use of correlations and crime base-rates. In knowing, for example, such a specific detail (WHAT) of a crime as the race of the victim, the profilers skip the motivational aspect (WHY) and suggest the same race for the offender (WHO). Psychological reasons or motivational causes (WHY) are not considered in this type of decision on the part of the profilers. Likewise, in the third of these processes, the WHAT to WHO loop, correlations and base-rates continue to be 661 230 PINIZZOTI'O AND FINKEL used. For example, given that a first-level prediction has been made based on base-rates for an offender's age, then a second-level prediction based on base- rates for marital status is made. Again, these assumptions are based not on mo- tivational causes (WHY), but move in an \"if-then, if-then\" correlational sequence from specific details of the crime (WHAT) toward a more specific portrait of the offender (WHO). From the results obtained in this work, four suggestions are offered to im- prove accuracy. The first is to improve the base-rates by increasing the number of details available concerning offenders. The more offenders there are that contrib- ute to the sample population of \"homicide offenders\" or \"sex offenders,\" the more detailed and specific information is available about these individuals. Per- haps when larger samples are examined; the predictions that are made on these base-rates may increase in validity and in reliability. The second suggestion is to develop a system of matrices of specific details for crime scenes in order to create convergent and discriminative lines for certain predictors. For example, on a particular kind of crime scene, do certain details (independent lines) tend to converge on a more youthful offender---even when the age of the victim generally might lead one to predict an older offender? And, third, while the offender's motivation to commit the crime might remain a mystery-- even to the offender (Dietz, 1985), one area of research that would be of assistance to profiling would examine means by which offender motivation (WHY) can sup- port or confirm the crime base-rates that are used in profding---or, indeed, direct the prof'der's line of thought about a particular offender. A fourth suggestion derives from the observation that certain profilers were more accurate and more keenly perceptive with certain tasks than they were with others. For example, one profiler studied the medical examiner's report twice as long as any other profiler and incorporated more of this material into that partic- ular written profile. Another profiler spent a greater amount of time studying and reviewing the crime scene photographs. Close examination with a magnifying glass revealed details others missed. A third profiler spent more time discussing the victimology report. Since individual profilers appear to enjoy certain areas of expertise within the general field of profiling, it seems plausible that more accu- rate and richer profiles would result from \"group profiling\" than from individual profiling. Empirical testing could determine whether too many cooks (profilers) spoil or enrich the broth. From the results found here, a more elaborated conceptualization of the process of profiling needs to be developed. It has been shown in this work, as it has been theorized elsewhere (Dietz, 1985), that profiling is a complex process. It involves more than a simple, one-level analysis of crime scene details (i.e., the WHAT to WHY to WHO). The WHAT to WHO and the WHAT to WHO loop are two additional levels of analysis that are used. Thus, a criminal personality profile appears to be the result of a complex, multilevel series of attributions, correla- tions, and predictions. In conceptualizing this process, the theory of profiling-- yet to be fully developed----ought to reflect these complexities. In this regard, conceptual and theoretical development, consistent with emerging empirical re- sults, is needed. 662 CRIMINAL PERSONALITY PROFILING 231 The clinician, long familiar with the clinical versus actuarial might well wonder whether this is the theoretical context for situating profiling, rather than the context of personality theory. And at the empirical level, when well-developed computer, actuarial-based profiling does come on-line in the near future, a new test of the seer versus sign controversy (i.e., Will profilers generate more accurate predictions than the actuarial-based computer program?) will be possible. Given that profilers use both motivational and correlational processes to generate predictions, perhaps such empirical tests in the future will reveal that profiling is an area where clinical predictions exceed actuarial. But at this stage in the development of profiling, the first evaluative step is to demonstrate that pro- filers do better than nonprofilers and to elucidate the processes they use. In a field still in its nascent stage, the population of \"experts\" is limited. The sample size of experts was small (i.e., there were only 6 profders and 4 expert profilers used in this study). The small sample may have limited the significance of the results (i.e., some results failing to reach significance, or reaching only moderate significance) where larger sample sizes might reveal even greater dif- ferences. The limited sample size also raises questions of the representativeness of the sample and the generalizability of the results; cautions are thus warranted. A replication of this study, using more subjects is another recommendation. Though significant results were obtained for the sex offense case, not all results reached significance for the homicide case. Part of the explanation offered for this variance in results was the atypical nature of the homicide case. Specif- ically, many personal aspects of this particular offender in the homicide case were not consistent with existing crime base-rates. This explanation, though plausible, remains untested to date. Future research in criminal personality profiling should address this issue by using greater numbers of homicide and sex offense cases, as well as cases where profilers neither claim expertise nor typically proffie. In the absence, yet, of such studies, generalizations to all sex offense or all homicide cases are not warranted. REFERENCES Alker, H. (1972).

Drowning by Arthur E. Westveer, Behavioral Science Unit, FBI A person drowns as the result of submersion, partial submersion, or immersion in a fluid. Drowning is usually accidental. Very few cases are suicides. Sometimes death in the water is due to natural causes, such as a heart attack or cerebral hemorrhage that occurred while the victim was swimming. A. Mechanism . Recently, the mechanism of drowning has been recognized as something more complex than simple mechanical obstruction Of the air passage by fluid. . The inhalation of water can and does result in its absorption by the circulating blood; the changes caused by this absorption contribute materially to death by drowning. . The victim must have inhaled enough fluid and survived long enough for absorption and electrolyte exchange to take place. This can occur within a few minutes following total submersion. B. Fresh Water . Low-salt (.5 %) precipitous absorption into the circulation takes place. This results in hemolysis and dilution of the blood constituents associated with an abrupt, violent increase in blood volume. The heart is rapidly overburdened by this increased load, and pulmonary edema is evident. . Arrhythmias of the heartbeat, which culminate in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, lead to death within three to fwe minutes of submersion. An adult may inhale and absorb six pints or more of liquid. C. Sea Water . In contrast to fresh water, sea water is extremely salty (3.0% sodium chloride). When a body absorbs sea water, the high salinity of the water draws fluids from the blood into the lung tissue, causing severe pulmonary edema. Generally speaking, a salt water drowning resembles an asphyxial type of death more closely than a fresh water drowning does. A salt water drowning takes longer than a fresh water one, and a person drowning in salt water is likely to be more responsive to resuscitation than a person drowning in fresh water. 687 II. Signs of Drowning There are consistent signs peculiar to drowning. The special difficulty in interpretation is to distinguish between accidental, suicidal, and homicidal drowning. For this reason, all available information concerning the death must be given to the pathologist prior to autopsy. A. External signs of drowning . As cooling in water occurs at about twice the rate of cooling in air, most bodies are cool or cold when recovered from water. Body temperature falls at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. The body will reach the temperature of its surroundings in 5 or 6 hours; always within 12 hours of submersion. Exposure and oxygenation will frequently cause the head, neck, and front of the chest to turn a bright pink color. . Putrefaction is often present and the skin may be green or bronze or it may be exceptionally dark. The presence of foam (pulmonary edema) at the mouth or nostrils, or both, is an important, although in no way a conclusive, sign of drowning. Pulmonary edema is also caused by strangulation or epileptic seizure. Putrefaction will destroy foam. This foam is caused when fluid enters the air passages and provokes them to form mucus, which, when mixed with air, forms a foam from the violent respiratory efforts of the victim. . A bruised or bitten tongue may indicate that the victim struggled or had an epileptic seizure. Instantaneous rigor, which is rare, is sometimes a result of submersion. Weeds or sand may be held in the hands or feet, evidence that there was life at the time of submersion. . It is necessary to distinguish between changes due to drowning and those that are solely the result of submersion in water. For instance, a person may inhale a thick suspension of sand in sea water. This could happen if the person were knocked down by a wave or hit his or her abdomen on a surfboard. Death occurs with appalling suddenness in these circumstances. , Chemicals in water may not contribute to the cause of death, but their detection in the body of the victim can confirm the fact of drowning in that fluid. 688 B. Internal signs of drowning . Putrefaction will abolish the internal signs of drowning. Foam is present in varying amounts in the air passages. The passages may be completely or just partially filled. Water will also be present in the air passages. This may be abundant and escape from the mouth when the body is turned. . The larynx may be congested. The lungs will be bulky or ballooned, often to the degree of overlapping the pericardium. There may be rib marking on the lungs. . Obstruction of the pulmonary circulation due to the inhalation of water results in distention of the right side of the heart and the great veins, which are filled with dark red blood, the blood also is likely to remain fluid and free from clots. Dilution of the blood by inhaled water is responsible for the prevention of coagulation. The blood often has a watery consistency and does not adhere to the examiner's hands. III. The Time it Takes to Drown A. The amount of time it takes for a person to drown varies within somewhat wide limits and is affected by: . 2. 3. 4. circumstances of submersion kind of victim reactions to submersion volume of water inhaled B. The amount of time is reduced when submersion is unexpected and when the victim is out of shape or unable to swim C. Death may be immediate when due to cardiac inhibition. Those who panic will succumb more quickly than those who try to remain calm. Cramps and other injuries sustained at the time of submersion will also play a part. D. Sudden submersion into cold water can cause death-from cardiac failure. The uncontrollable respiratory distress during cold immersion causes the victim to inhale water. E. Ordinarily, unconsciousness, if not death, ensues in two to ten minutes after submersion. Before death there may be a period of suspended animation during which it is still possible to resuscitate the victim. This is possible even if the victim has been submerged for as long as 30 minutes. F. The popular belief that a person sinks and rises three times before drowning is a misconception. There is wide variation in the number of times a person may sink before remaining submerged. G. There is usually a brief convulsive phase, followed by coma or suspended animation and death. H. The body eventually sinks and remains on the bottom until putrefaction sets in, causing the formation of gas, which in turn causes the body to float. This occurs in 7 to 14 days. IV. Phases of Drowning A. Between 7,000 and 8,000 deaths by drowning occur in the U.S. each year. Drowning is the fourth leading cause of accidental death. B. Submersion is usually followed by a panicky struggle to reach the surface. When energy reserves are exhausted, the struggle subsides and actual drowning begins. The phases could be described as follows: 1. Breath holding . Swallowing of water, coughing, vomiting, and progressive loss of consciousness . Profound unconsciousness and convulsions associated with gasping precede respiratory standstill, which is followed by failure of the heart. Irreversible changes in the brain and death occur within a very short time. C. When drowning is interrupted before terminal grasping has set in, spontaneous recovery sometimes occurs. D. Asphyxia occurs in only 10 or 12 percent of all drowning deaths. Spastic closure of the airway is not detectable during an autopsy. MISCELLANEOUS S IXTEEN years old and fresh ou~t~ of high school, Edward C. Stermer went to work for the Mudge Paper Company. Except for the . war years, when Uncle Sam employed him as a flight instructor in York and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, ~it was the only job he ever had: And he was suc- cessful at it, tool When-he was gunned down outside_his Seuth Baltimore, Maryland, o ilce at S:16 on the chill Thursday evening of December 16, ._ 1976, he was the firm's president, a pos- ition he had held since 1960. Less than 20minutes after five slugs were pumped into his body from a 9-ram. automatic, the 62-year-old Stermer was at the emergency room door of University Hospital. It was al- ready too late. Docters had only to take a look at the han4some, gray-haird businessman to see that he was beyond the efforts of medical science. They pro- nounced him dead en arrival at 5:32 p.m. At the crime scene on the 1400 block of Russell Street, meanwhile, homicide 9 detectives recovered three spent shells evidently fired from the death weapon. While some investigators examined the victim's rented, 1974 Mercury in the Mudge parking lot, others grilled wit- by JOSEPH L. KO~'NIG Business tycoon Edward Stermer was shot down outside his office, and police could find no apparent motive--until they began checking a certain person's stock holdings nesses who told them that just before he was slain Stermer had left his office in\" the rear of the building to go to a com- pany Christmas party at a nearby motel. \"We spoke with a paper company employe who\" told us that he heard gun- shots, looked out a window and saw Stermer lying fac~ up on the sidewalk near the lot,\" a detective wouldreport. \"Some other workers rushed out of the building and found hini bleeding heav- ily from chest woundsjusttwo feet from the-building. \" \" \"We also interviewed a passerby who said that at the time of the Shooting he saw a man running down Russell Street. ' There were also some uncon- firmed reports that the gunman was spotted getting into a Sun taxi, and we're trying to verify that right now.\" In the first moments of the murder investigation, flak-jacketed officers from the Baltimore Police Department's Quick Response Team were sent into the area. Armed with high-p0wered shotguns, they combed a tunnel, run- ning under Russell Street close to the shooting scene, but found nothing. Other investigators reported better luck, coming up with a witness .to the shooting in the person of Hassan R. For the paper company president, Baltimore detectives discovered, wealth and success became a mixed blessing they got him killed 693 Probe suddenly focused on Charles Brent (l.).and- Hassam Erman, comptroller- treasurer.for Stermer'spaper company, who was over the firm Erman, Mudge Paper's 53-year-old treasurer. Erman reportedly stated that he had left the office about two mi- nutes before Stermer and was about a block away when he heard the shots and ran back toward the building. \"What did you see?\" a detective had asked. Hassan seemed apologetic as he re- plied that he had seen only \"a shadow.\" He explained that he had glaucoma and was not wearing his glasses, so he was not even certain that the shadow was that of a person. When~ne left the office, he added, he had noticed nothing out of the ordinary. In the homicide bureau at Baltimore police headquarters, that evening, de- tectives went over the meager evidence they had collected in the first few hours of the probe. \"It appears that Stermer had left the building and was walking toward the company parking lot when someone shot him five times in the chest,\" a de- tective said. \"Was it robbery?\" a uniformed officer asked. \"That's what we thought at first,\" the detective answered. \"Stermer was a rich man, with an income well into six fi- gures. His wife told us that he usually cashed his paycheck on Thursday and carried between $100 and $200 in his wallet at all times. The wallet was gone, but the killer didn't trouble to go through his pockets, or take his keys,or lift an expensive camera he was wear- ing around his neck. \"Not only that, but minutes before Stermer left the building another com- pany executive went out the same door. He was just as prosperous-looking as Stermer, but no one tried to rob or shoot him. From the evidence we have SO far, it seems as though whoever shot Stermer Was gunning for him.\" \"If robbery wasn't the motive,\" the uniformed officer asked, \"what do you suppose it could be--a personal thing, a business rivalry, an enemy of long- standing?\" \"It's too soon to tell,\" the detective replied. ,\"But I can promise you we're going to find out.\" In succeeding weeks and even years, the detective would learn that such a promise was much easier to make than to keep. Edward C. Stermer had been an unusually private man, and although the basic facts of his life were a matter of publi c record, it was not an easy task to delve beneath the surface. It was no secret that the slain businessman had made his home in suburban Timoniurn, Maryland. A Bal- timore native, he had graduated from high school in 1931 and gone to work immediately for Mudge. In the 1930s, he had opened the firm's York, Pennsylvania, office and after a stint as a World War II flight instructor had re- turned to his old job. In 1960, he had been made president of the company. According to one close acquaintance he was a man with \"a six- figttre income, a successful man who was going to continue to be successful.\" His hobbies were golf and sailing. But Stermer's business career was not without its setbacks. Perhaps its darkest hour had come just a month be- fore his death, when, following plea- bargaining in state court, he had been fined $5,000 and his firm assessed $22,500 for allegedly substituting an in- ferior grade of paper than specified in contracts Mudge Paper Co. held with the cityof Baltimore and state of Mary- land. The charges to which Stermer had pleaded no contest indicated that he had been aware of an untrue statement in a $61,000 contract which his firm had signed with the stote in March, 1976. According to the statement of facts agreed to when: Stermer and Mudge en- tered their pleas, the Mudge Company evidently was low bidder on city and state contracts by submittinga price for the specified top gradepaper that was an average between top grade and the next lowest grade. Butwhen deliveries were made the lower-grade paper was substituted. \"Even though we went through our court problems a while ago,\" a company official said, \"I still think most people in the industry hold us in high regard. Mr. Stermer was a smart, highly respected businessman.\" \"Ai~r- the indictments came through, the people at Mudge were plenty em- barrassed,\" an industry spokesman ag- reed. \"They weren't crooks. It was just one of those things that sometimes hap- pens. They were still highly regarded by their fellow tradesmen.\" The next day, homicide investigators told newsmen that they had turned up disappointingly few clues in the murder case, but were eagerly awaiting the re- sults of the autopsy on the victim. \"We still haven't determined the mo- tive behind the killing,\" a detective said. \"Right now, we're interested in speaking with anyone who was driving by the scene of the slaying about a quar- ter past five yesterday and we urge them to call the homicide department.\" Later in the day, a medical examiner told police that fatal bullets had struck Edward Stermer in the heart, both lungs, the liver and stomach. Although the shots had been fired at such close range that powder burns were found on the victim's stomach, the report stated that the \"chest wounds had the appear- ance of distant wounds.\" The brutal slaying of Edward Stermer remained front page news for (Continued on page 58) 694 Murder Stalked Executive Suite (Continued from page 16) just two days before vanishing entirely from the Baltimore newspapers. This did not mean that it had been forgotten, as well, by homicide probers. On the contrary, detectives were working re- lentlessly to come up with the badly needed clue that would solve the mys- tery. But their efforts remained a secret outside the department until February 21, 1977, when two sketches of the pos- sible triggerman appeared below head- lines that a $10,000 reward was being offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The first drawing was that of a well- dressed, clean-shaven man in his med- 40s wearing a gray top coat and short- brimmed hat. He had been spotted by a truck driver who told detectives that he had noticed an \"important-looking man\" standing on the corner two blocks from the paper company's offices about an hour before the slaying. The driver explained that he had glanced twice at the man because he \"looked strange\" and out of place standing on the littered street while a black and white taxi was waiting nearby. Lieutenant Arthur E. Westveer, the Baltimore homicide prober in charge of the case, said that the police artist's sketch was the only description his men had been able to obtain of someone who might have been hired to kill Stermer. \"Ifl were a hit man,\" he said, \"I'd take a cab and pay a guy twenty bucks not to record where he took me,\" he said. Although detectives had interviewed businessmen and construction workers in the area, he added, no one was able to explain why a man of such description would have been \"hanging around.\" Neither had police been able to trace the cab. The second drawing 'was that of a young man between the ages of 21 and 25 with long blond hair parted down the middle. He had been spotted by a night watchman at the construction site a- cro~s the street as be tried to open the doors at the paper company on the night before and two days prior to the murder. Lieutenant Westveer said his men be- lieved the chances were \"slim\" that rob- bery had been behind the killing. He said the \"execution-type\" murder inc'i- cated that Stermer was slain by som.,- one who knew whom he was after, knew how to kill and wanted his victim dead. Westveer refused to completely rule out robbery as a motive, but insisted that three facts leaned toward the pro- fessional killing theory. The first, he said, was that Hassan Erman, the trea- surer of Mudge Paper, who was well- dressed and as likely a target for a rob- bery as Stermer, had left the building only minutes before the doomed execu- tive, yet he was not attacked. The sec- ond was that the 9 ram. automatic be- lieved to be the death weapon was a sophisticated gun, costing about $200, whlch a common bandit would not buy for a robbery. The final fact was tbat Stermer's pockets were not rifled by the slayer and that his valuable camera was left hanging from his neck. Since both gun and Stermer's wal- let were missing, the lieutenant went on, detectives were being hindered in their efforts. In fact, his men had not even been able to prove that Stermer was carrying his wallet the day he was shot. Reportedly they had spoken with a man who had lunched with the businessman three hours before the shooting and who told them that Stermer had paid the check with money he took from his pocket, rather than the wallet he normally carried. Lt. Westveer said that although de- tectives had questioned at least 300 per- sons who knew the victim and also had probed every facet of his private life, they had yet to find a single person who did not like Edward Stermer. \"He had so many friends and so many people liked the guy,\" Westveer said. \"It's nice to hear he was a nice guy, but it's depressing. We want to find some- one who didn't like him enough to kill him.\" Another\" stumbling block, he pointed out, was the lack of a detailed descrip- tion of the gunman. \"Whoever shot him could have disap- peared in a matter of seconds,\" he said. The most likely escape route, probers agreed, would have been through the poorly lighted construction area near the death scene. Detectives long ago had concluded it was highly improbable Stermer's legal problems bad had anything to do with his death. Late in December they had spoken with one of his sons who told them that his father had decided to ap- peal for a reduction in the penalties, particularly a year-long prohibition on bidding for city and state contracts, \"be- cause he was convinced he had~'~ done anything wrong.\" The victim's widow had said that one of the reasons her late husband had pleaded no contest to the charges was that if he had fought the case \"a lot of city and state people could lose their jobs. \" 'A lot of people could lose a lot of things,' \"she quoted him as having said. \"'Why do I have to plead no contest to a lie?' \" \"I know my husband wanted to clear his name,\" the distraught woman told investigators. In the days immediately preceding his death, she adcied, Edward Stermer had been making the rounds of city and state agencies that were his long-time customers \"as the first step in his appeal bid.\" His son explained that prior to enter- ing the no contest plea, Stermer had been led by prosecutors to believe that legal costs and Ix :ble maximum fines, in the event of coneiction, could bank- rupt the 141-year-old paper company. He said that his father was worried about financial hardship, not only for himself, but for all the firm's employes. Before the indictment was made pub- lic on October 28, 1976, he went on, his father already had told the family that charges were pending. He also had explained how substitute products sometimes were furnished to city and state agencies in a sort of\"gentleman's agreement.\" His father told him that a city or state purchasing employe might forget to re- cord a transaction, promptly or else might need in a hurry a certain grade of paper which Mudge did not have in stock. In such a case, Stermer said, the firm often was told: \"Send us what you've got.\" \"It was a matter of deadlines, not fraud,\" the younger Stermer said. In criminal court, defense counsel had explained that Mudge occasionally lost money in handling such emergencies, but he was willing to do so to protect the company's reputation for speedy deliv- ery. Ofthe $469,000 in sales involved in the charges, only $5,300 could be counted as profit to the company, Stermer's son said. The victim's widow recalled that she and her husband had gone over the company's records for substitutions of higher rather than lower quality paper and found the $5,300 figure reduced to \"$1,600 or $.1,800.\" Homicide detectives told newsmen that they had been unable to link Sterrner's death to the criminal charges. Lieutenant Westveer said they had found that the person who tipped offthe state's attorney's office to questionable business practices by the paper firm was not involved in the killing. However, Westveer did acknowledge that the scandal had distressed Stermer. \"He was very proud of his company, and it hurt him,\" he said. \"Morally, he felt he didn't do anything wrong.\" Stermer evidently had good reason to feel that way. An executive of the corn- pany told reporters that Mudge Paper \"is still functioning as it did before the killing because ofthe way he set up the company.\" He added that the firm and its remaining stockholders were in the process of purchasing the 51 per cent of the Mudge stock held by the Stermer estate. The public's response to publication of the sketches of the suspects was a bitter disappointment to the homicide inves- tigators. When the trickle of leads dried up altogether, they had no choice but to turn their attention to newer, more pressing cases. This time, when the Stermer murder faded from the news- papers it did not return for nearly two years. But police never forgot the cas, e nd periodically reviewed the files the hope of finding some crucial clue they had overlooked. In June of 1978, a Maryland state police undercover agent assigned to the contract murder squad elicited from one of his informants a few details concern- ing an \"unsolved murder in South Bal. timore.\" Certain that they would be in- terested in'what he had found out, the trooper called his colleagues on the Bal- timore Police Department and passed along the few leads he had uncovered. The city homicide probers were able to fit the new information into the par. tially developed picture of the Stermer csse. Because the state policeman had re- ceived his information third.hand, a city police source would report, Balti- more detectives had to work back to the source of the detai[~. In time, they com- pleted gathering their facts and late in the autumn they took their information to the state's attorney. After examining it carefully, he presented it to a grand jury. As a result, on Friday, December 15, Baltimore homicide detectives obtained a warrant charging 27-year-old Charles E. Brent of BrookburT Drive in Reis- terstown, Maryland, a community of 13,000 in Baltimore's \"northwest sub- urbs, with murder, armed robbery and handgun violations stemming from the murder of Edward C. Stermer. As soon as. they were in possession of the long- awaited document, police went looking for the suspect, who also went under the name of Anthony Edward Perro. Detectives Bryn Joyce and Benjamin Brannock of the state's attorney's office were unable to find him, and the as- sumption was that he had fled the state. Almost at once, Lieutenant Westveer issued a photograph of the wanted man to the news media. Howard Gersh, head of the violent crimes unit of the state's attorney's of. flee, and his assistant, Peter Semel, told reporters that they would not discuss any aspect of the probe. However, newsmen already had learned that while the police investigation was pro- eeeding, the grand jury had spent abou~ a month listening to witnesses who were acquainted with various aspects of the case. Reportedly, the investigative panel was seeking accomplices in the killing. Newsmen believed that much of the renewed work on the case had come as the result of the impending expiration of the statute of limitations on some of the charges. Becau~ the investigation had lasted for nearly two years, repor- ters felt that it would have to be brought to a halt in the near future, perhaps as soon as the next week. Three days later, on Monday, De- cember 18, 1978, employes of the Mudge Paper Company were stunned to learn that 55-year-old Hassan R. Erman, the firm's comptroller-treasurer, had be~n arranging the murder- for-hire of Edward Stermer. Erman, who made his home on Garrison Forest Road in Owings Mills, Maryland, was taken into custody at his Russell Street office about 10:30 that morning on charges of first degree murder, assault, robbery and handgun violations. One source close to the probe said that Erman was believed to have arranged Stermer's slaying purely for financial gain. Under an agreement, he noted, the stock of a deceased Mudge official was to be retired, and because there would then be fewer shares of outstand- ing stock, the value of all the remaining shares would increase. At the time ofhis death, Stermer was believed to have owned some 51 per cent of company stock. Hassan R ~. Erman, newsmen learned, was a University of Baltimore graduate who had received his MBA degree frorfi Loyola College in 1976. A Turkish na- tive of the troubled island nation of Cyprus, Erman had been a Mudge empioye for about 20 years. Hired as comptroller, he also had become a vice president in 1972 and reportedly owned about five per cent of the company's stock when Stermer died. Booked on the charges on Monday af- ternoon, Erman was freed from custody that evening after posting bond of $150,000. The hunt for Charles E. Brent con- tinued until Friday, December 22nd. when the accused triggerman was ar- rested in California and jailed pending an extradition request from Maryland. That same day, a Baltimore grand jury. indicted him on charges of murder, rob- bery and conspiracy in the Stermer case and cited Hassan Erman on charges of murder, robbery, conspiracy and acces- sort before the fact of murder. Questioned by newsmen about the de- tails of Brent's arrest, Baltimore State's Attorney William A. Swisher said that the exact location where the suspect was being held would not be revealed pending further investigation into the murder. According to Assistant State's Attorney Semel, the probe was still underway and additional matters might be taken before the grand jury. It was reported that police still were eager to develop information about the mis- sing death weapon. At a pre-trial hearing on Friday, May 18, 1979, Assistant State's Attorney Harvey E. Greenberg said that Erman and Brent attempted to\"cover up\" their involvement in the case by lying to the 697 698 police for over a year, and that because the conspiracy continued for so long after the slaying, the charges were not subject to the one-year limitation on conspiracy. Greenberg went on to say that he would show, at the trial, that after Stermer was dead the defendants schemed to stalk and kill another officer of the paper company. Prosecutor Greenberg said that the state would produce evidence showing that in 1977 and 1978 Charles Brent voluntarily made statements to Anne Arundel County and Baltimore police that were \"'false and misleading.\" There was a total of seven statements, he added, all of which was an effort to con- ceal the nature of the conspiracy and show that Hassan Erman was the in- tended victim of a scheme. An attorney for Brent, who had been lodged in theBaltimore City Jail upon his return to Maryland, said that he was withdrawing a plea of not guilty by rea- son of insanity for his client and enter- ing, instead, a general plea of innocent. Brent, it was noted, had been found_- competent to Stand trial on the charges following mental examinations, in April, in Clifton T. Perkins State Hospi- tal. Four months later, at a Monday, Sep- tember 24th, suppression of evidence hearing, Judge Marshall A. Lovin bar- red press and public from his court- room at the request of defense attor- neys. State prosecutors offered no objec- tion to the ruling. [t was reported, nevertheless, that the matter under consideration by the court was the ex- tent of Hassan Erman's financial in- volvement with Mudge Paper and whether or not the details of his hold- ings were to be excluded frbm trial tes- timony. The murder trial got underway in the first week of October in Judge Levin's Baltimore Criminal Courtroom. In his opening remarks to the jury, Prosecutor Greenberg said that in addition to the murder of Edward Stermer, Hassan Erman had plotted the death of a vice- president of Mudge Paper as part of his plan to take over the company. At Er- man's urging, he said, Charles Brent stalked the executive druing a 1976 business trip to West Virginia, but the plan fizzled when the driver Brent had enlisted to help him became sick and \"chickened out.\" Brent, he said, \"wor- shipped, adored and was linked\" to Erman. and was even wearing some of his clothes at the time of his arrest in California. On Thursday, October 1 lth. the state called to the stand a friend of Charles Brent who testified that the suspected hit man had told her that he was going to do a \"'big job\" that would make him wealthy \"around Christmas time\" in 1976. \"\"When I get all thesejobs done.'\" she quoted him as having said, \"' 'I'll never have to worry about money again.' \" On another occasion, the woman said, her daughter \"had a broken heart\" and to cheer her up Brent brought her to Hassan Erman's house on Owings Mills to play tennis. On Monday, October 15th, a Mudge Paper clerk told the court that Hasaan Erman \"surprised\" the office sta ffon the afternoon of the slaying by allowing everyone to go home early. Mudge Paper's secretary, the next day, testified that if both Edward Stermer and the firm's vice-president had died, the value of Hassan Erman's company stock would have increased almost tenfold, from $47,700 to $462,900. The company, the witness said, planned to use the proceeds from a life insurance policy taken out on Stermer to buy back and then retire his 51 per cent of the stock and the 35 per cent controlled by the vice-president. On Wednesday, one ofthe three direc- tors of the company at the time of the murder said that Hassan Erman would have been \"best qualified\" to take over Mudge Paper if both its top officers died. He added that earlier in 1976 Erman had recommended that the company buy an increased amount of insurance on Stermer's life, so that they would be in a position to redeem his stock in the event of his death. On Thursday, October 18th, a senior clerk at the Baltimore Gas & Electric - Company told the jury that in 1975 Erman had fallen so far behind in his payments that he owed the utility more than $1,300. A Baltimore Federal Sav- ings and Loan Association officer said that in 1975 and 1976, Erman paid late charges on 16 occasions when mortgage payments fell due on his home. On Monday, October \"22nd, a 26- year-old Reisterstown, Maryland, man testified that Charles Brent had paid him to drive his truck to and from the Mudge offices on Russell Street on the day of the slaying. Although he heard gunfire, he said, he did not actually wit- ness the murder. Later, however, Brent reportedly told him that he had slain Edward Stermer. On Wednesday, a former roommate of Brent's told the court that a week before the slaying the defendant asked his ad- vice on how he would go about killing a \"man in his sixties.\" The witness said he had told Brent he would shoot him in the torso, that \"if he's in his sixties it probably wouldn't take much to kill him.\" Taking the stand in his own defense on Friday, November 2nd, Brent admit- ted talking about killing Edward Stermer, but he denied having anything to do with his death or with suggesting that Mudge Paper's vice-president be slain. He told the court that it was the Reisterstown man who had testified earliei\" who actually was the trigger- man. Back on the witness stand on Mon- day, November 5th, Brent said that he had expected to collect $20,000 for \"working out the details\" of the murder of Mudge Paper's two top executives at Hassan Erman's urging. However, be- cause things \"kept getting screwed up,\" he said, he \"called the whole thing ofF' and Erman never gave him any part of his fee. He was shocked, he said, to learn that Stermer had been murdered any- way. Following the slaying, he said, the real killer harassed him for money and demanded that he speak with the detec- tives probing the murder. \"'Go down there and get the police off my back,'\" he quoted the man as saying. In his closing arguments to the jury on Thursday, November 15th, Char]ps Brent's attorney said that his client was a \"little silly and acted like a squirrel, but he just didn't have the guts\" to kill Edward Stermer. Hassan Erman's lawyer told the panel that his client \"does not even be- long\" in court. Erman, he said, did not take the stand in his own defense be- cause he did not need to and because Brent trapped himself in \"lies\" as he tried to implicate his client. The attorney went on to say that the trial was \"all about Mr. Brent,\" who was \"trying to protect himself' when he made statements implicating his client while the police were \"closing in on him\" (Brent). He added that Brent was also trying to obtain the \"$I0,000 re- ward\" offered for a solution to the case and that when the police failed to be- lieve some of his stories be went further and talked about \"contract murders.\" \"There were no conversations and therefore no contact between Mr. Erman and Mr. Brent,\" the attorney said. Another defense attorney said that the jury should acquit Erman because he was a family man, a hard-working businessman who had started out in life as a poor immigrant from Cyprus. On Wednesday, November 14, Pros- ecutor Greenberg had told the jury that \"there is an in exorable connection bet- ween Mr. Brent and Mr. Erman\" and that Brent\"had the motive, opportunity and means to pull the trigger.\" Erman, he charged, was a man earning $30,000 who was trying to keep up with the life- style of his firm's $200,000-a-year salesmen. The prosecutor went on to tell the jury that Erman had furnished Brent with the license number and West Virginia itinerary Of Mudge Paper's vice. president. When Erman heard that Brent had failed to kill the vice- president, he said, he brought Brent to a Morton Street, Baltimore, apartmeat used by Stermer, so that he could mur- der the company president there. The plan failed, he said, when Brent evi- dently was bitten by a rat while waitin~ in ambush for Stermer and Erman hag urged him to try again, on Russell Street, on December 16, 1976. After three hours of deliberation on Friday, November 16th, theBaltimore Criminal Court jury returned quilty verdicts against both men. Judge Levin set sentencing for December 20th. un- less new trials were granted. 9 9 9 pROPERTY OF National Criminal Justice l sIor n 8 NGJRS) Box 6000 Rockville, MD 20849-6000 699 NOTES 700 "}
