Although the clinical application of acupuncture is very popular, its mechanisms of action are still unclear. Beginning in the middle ofthe 20th century, a boost of research on acupuncture emerged in China, and I was one of theresearchers involved in this episode. With the help of modern neuroscience, the mechanisms ofacupuncture for pain management have been unraveled at least partly. This article describes mydecision as a young medical graduate to devote my life to research on acupuncture and painmedicine; it has since been my life's journey\u2014one full of challenges and happiness, pitfalls andachievements. Key W ords. Acupuncture; Pain; Drug Addiction Introduction Acupuncture has been used in China for more than 3,000 years. Although the 53 years I have spent working in this eld amount to only one-sixtieth of this span of time, they constitute themajority of my life. My experience in this eldaffords me the opportunity to share stories thatmay be of interest to scientists in pain research. My First Encounters with the Western World (1979) The 1979 International Narcotics Research Con-ference (INRC) took place in Cape Cod nearBoston. At age 51, it was my rst trip abroad toattend the conference in place of Professor C.Y.Song who was invited by his former PhD advisorDr. Eddy Liang Way. Professor Song asked meto attend the conference because he knew that Iwas involved in endorphin research to study themechanism of acupuncture. At the time, which wasonly a few years after the rst United States Presi-dent Nixon's visit to China, it was a rare opportu- nity for a Chinese scientist to come abroad forscientic exchange. Before heading to Cape Cod, I made a stop in Washington, DC to visit Dr. Emino Costa whothen worked for the National Institute of MentalHealth on neuropharmacology of various kindsof classical neurotransmitters. Dr. Costa wasdelighted with my talk as he had never heard ofany research on acupuncture with a neurochemicalapproach. For the rest of the day, he gave me histop treatment by showing me around Washington,DC, and nishing with a dinner in the Cosmosclub. The weather in July was hot and I had only ashirt on without a tie. I was surprised to learn thatDr. Costa had to borrow a jacket for me in order todine in the club. I thought I was misled to thinkthat \"Americans are casual in clothing.\" The nextmorning, I was in Cape Cod wearing my suit forbreakfast only to nd that everyone else was inT-shirt and even in shorts. Having had an unexpected success for my pre- sentation (chaired by Dr. Eric Simon of NYU)and having made so many new friends, I was lledwith satisfaction when I started my return trip.However, I found myself stranded in San Fran-cisco (SF) for a week because I did not reconrm Reprint requests to: Ji-Sheng Han, MD, Neuroscience 8610-8280-1109; Academy of Pain Medicine 1526-2375/09/$15.00/611 611-618 doi:10. 1111 /j.1526-4637.2009.00633.xmy flight in advance. This was a hard reality for me to take as I had only $100 in my pocket thatwould not be enough for me to survive more thana couple of days in SF . Luckily, when I called theCounselor of the Chinese embassy, they were sokind to introduce me to an overseas Chinese, Mr.Xie, who agreed to take care of me while waitingfor my next flight. Staying in Mr. Xie's house withfree accommodation and meal, I grew anxious toknow if there was anything that I could do for himin return for his kindness. Immediately, a chancecame up. When Mr. Xie got to know that I came tothe United States for an international conferenceto present my research on the mechanisms of acu-puncture, he was overwhelmingly delighted. Heasked if I could give a talk about my work to theChinese acupuncturists in the SF area. I said \"Ofcourse!\" and thought that this was perhaps theeasiest thing I could do in the situation. However, I soon found out that the task was not as easy as I thought it would be because of thelanguage barrier the early Chinese immigrantshad. Most of the overseas Chinese in SF areaspoke Cantonese, not Mandarin and English,whereas I spoke Mandarin and not-so-fluentEnglish, but not Cantonese. Luckily, Mr. Xieinvited a medical doctor who was able to translatebetween English and Cantonese. I wondered, butnever asked, how the interpreter translated thosetechnical terms such as endorphins and catechola-mines into Cantonese. Nonetheless, the lecturewas so well received that many of the audiencescame up to shake my hands with tears on theirfaces. Many said that they would display my articlein their clinic to show that acupuncture does haveits scientic basis. For losing 1 week of time, Igained such an experience that the memory wouldlast for the rest of my life. Stepping into the Field of Acupuncture Research (1965) I dreamed of becoming a surgeon when I was a medical student around the time when the com-munist party took over power. But being a citizenin the new China, one's destiny had everything todo with what the country needed at the time,rather than the individual's wish. I never hadproblem accepting my assignments even whenthey were not in my best interest, trusting thatthey were the best for the country. In the 1950s,the country was in desperate need for educatorsin basic medical sciences. I was assigned to teachphysiology in one medical institution afteranother, for years before I settled in Beijing Medical College (now Peking University HealthScience Center). One day in 1965, the dean of Beijing Medical College called me to his ofce. He said to me,\"Something new is happening in the medical eld,called Acupuncture Anesthesia. Believe it or not,by inserting needles into the acupuncture pointsand twisting them, you do not need to use anes-thetics for surgical operations!\" He encouragedme to nd out why it works. My rst reaction was\"It can't be true!\" The next day I was brought to a hospital spe- cializing in chest surgery. In front of my eyes wasa young lady lying on the operating table, aboutto undergo pulmonary lobectomy (to surgicallyremove one lobe of her lung). She had 10 acupunc-ture needles inserted in each limb, with four acu-puncturists each working on one of her limbs.After 30 minutes of needle manipulation (the\"induction period\"), the surgeon started to makethe skin incision. I was so surprised to nd no signof suffering on her face! I approached the patientwho was drinking juice from a straw to verify myobservation. \"Do you feel any pain?\" I asked.\"No\", she answered.\"Is there any uncomfortable feelings?\" I asked, still nding it hard to believe. \"I feel something happened on my skin, but not painful,\" she answered. I was advised by the anesthesiologist not to ask too many questions at the moment, because thepatient needed to perform abdominal respirationin order to best cooperate with the open chestsurgery. Upon witnessing the miracle, I was determined to take on the challenge of unraveling the mysteryof acupuncture anesthesia, which is now moreadequately called acupuncture analgesia (AA). Insights From the Study on Human Volunteers (1965) Working together with me was a small group of graduate students and young researchers in theDepartment of Physiology to explore the mecha-nisms of AA. Among them were T ang Jian, FanShao-Guang and Zhou Zhong-Fu. In practice, acupuncture is used to treat pain that already exists, whereas in the case of acupunc-ture anesthesia, acupuncture is used to preventpain caused by the upcoming surgical procedures.If this is true, then normal volunteers can be usedto test whether acupuncture is able to increase theHan 612pain threshold by a standard procedure such as pinprick or heat contact. After an exhausting exploration we decided to use potassium iontophoresis method, which is tointroduce an anode current to the skin through asponge of 5 mm diameter saturated with potas-sium chloride solution. Several interesting nd-ings emerged from this experiment. While the average minimal current to induce a pain sensation is around 1 mA, it increased to2 mA after the volunteers received an acupuncturetreatment. That was a 100% increase in the painthreshold! In addition, the effect did not happenimmediately after the acupuncture started. It tookabout 20 minutes of needling to reach its maximallevel. This agrees with the clinical experience thatit needs a 30-minute induction to reach a fullexpression of the analgesic effect. Once the anal-gesic effect is established, it sustains as long as theneedles are being twisted continuously. When theneedles are withdrawn, the analgesic effect startsto decline exponentially with a half-life of about 16minutes. We found that, whether the analgesiceffect was strong or relatively weak by stimulatingdifferent points, the characteristic of the decliningpain-threshold after the needle withdrawal wasthe same, with a half-life of 15-17 minutes. Thisnding inspired us to think that there might be aneurochemical factor involved in mediating theeffect of AA [1]. According to T raditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory, there are three Yin and three Yangmeridian channels passing through the arm andhand, there is no meridian channel passingthrough the point between the second and thethird metacarpus. What would happen if a needlewas inserted in this \"nonacupoint\"? The resultsshowed that stimulation of the \"nonacupoint\" canalso produce a deep sensation called \"deqi,\" as wellas an analgesic effect similar to that produced bystimulating the adjacent \"HeGu\" acupoint locatedbetween the rst and the second metacarpus. Boththe \"deqi\" sensation and the analgesic effect can beabolished by local anesthetics injected deep intothe point. It seemed that the correct manipulationof the needle in order to induce strong deqi sen-sation was more important than the accurate inser-tion of a needle into a specic point. The Rabbit Cerebrospinal Fluid Transfusion Study (1972) How to validate the idea of neurochemical involvement in mediating AA? We performed acerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transfusion experiment to test the hypothesis. We perfused the brain ven-tricle of a donor rabbit while performing acupunc-ture. The perfusate was infused into the brain of arecipient rabbit. As was expected, the recipientrabbit showed a signicant increase in pain thresh-old as measured by the heat-induced head avoid-ance response. On the other hand, the perfusateobtained from the donor rabbit without acupunc-ture did not induce such effect [2]. We performed this experiment in 1972, 3 years ahead of the discovery of endorphins. Without theslightest idea that the brain would be able to makeits own morphine-like substance, we started oursearch among the known substances with painkilling activities. We rst studied the possibleinvolvement of the serotonergic and catechola-minergic transmission in mediating acupuncturemechanisms. Dr. Li, then the vice secretary of theWorld Health Organization who watched ourCSF transfusion experiment during his visit toBeijing, was so kind to help us to obtain the chemi-cals necessary for our neurochemical exploration. The identication of serotonin (5-HT) both in the brain and spinal cord as one of the key neu-rotransmitters in mediating AA provided us with ahuge sense of success. With a bigger effort, wesubsequently discovered that while noradrenalinin the spinal cord mediates AA, in the brain it playsan opposite role. These results constituted the main part of my talk presented in Dr. Costa's lab in DC and in theINRC conference in Cape Cod [3]. However,despite our excitement about these results, theywere dwarfed by the ndings of the possibleinvolvement of opioid peptides in mediating AA. From Monoamines to Opioid Peptides (1975) The Science article of John Hughes et al. on thediscovery of enkephalins in pig brain injected amega dose of excitement to the neuroscience eld.Everyone seemed to be able to nd some connec-tion between enkephalins and their own work. Itwas so in particular for the research on the mecha-nisms of AA. A rational thing to do was to check whether AA can be blocked by naloxone, the opioid receptorantagonist. While the result on rabbits was aclearcut success with 50% reduction in AA bynaloxone, the result for rats was not as obvious atrst glance. From a methodological point of view,the traditional manual needling used in humansand rabbits can hardly be used in rats. The delicateAcupuncture Research 613extremities of rats rendered needle manipulation a source of trauma. We custom designed an acu-puncture treatment for rat by xing to the leg athin needle that is connected to an electronicstimulator generating electrical pulses of selectedfrequency, intensity, and pulse-width. This wasnamed electro-acupuncture (EA) to be distin-guished from manual acupuncture. Among the three EA parameters mentioned above, frequency has the widest range of variations(from 1 Hz up to 100 Hz). We discovered in therat that while the analgesic effect induced by2 Hz EA could be blocked by 50% using naloxoneat 0.5 mg/kg, the effect induced by 100 Hz EAseemed resistant to naloxone, with a 50% blockadedose as high as 20 mg/kg. Considering the nd-ings of Avram Goldstein's group in Palo Alto, CA,that the dose of naloxone needed for blocking k opioid receptors can be 10-20 folds higher thanthat for mreceptors, could it be that low- and high-frequency EA-induced analgesia was medi-ated by m- and k-opioid receptors, respectively? Our nding that the 50% blockade doses of nalox-one for 2, 15, and 100 Hz EA were found to be0.5, 1.0, and 20 mg/kg, respectively, supported thehypotheses [4]. This result agrees with the fact that in tradi- tional acupuncture practice, different types ofneedle manipulation at the same acupuncturepoint can result in different therapeutic effect. Inour studies using various kinds of animal modelsand clinical observations, we found that neuro-pathic pain responded preferably to 2 Hz EA(mediated by enkephalin) than that of 100 Hz,whereas the pain caused by muscle spasm inpatients suffered from spinal cord injuryresponded preferably to 100 Hz EA (mediated bydynorphin) but not to 2 Hz EA As acupuncture induces the release of endog- enous opioids, can it be used in treating the with-drawal syndrome (physical dependence) andcraving (mental dependence) for narcotics? It wasalready established that the k-receptor agonists are more effective for treating the narcotic withdrawalsyndrome, whereas the m-receptor agonists are more effective in treating the craving for narcotics.If this is the case, one may expect that 100 Hz EAshould be more effective for the treatment of with-drawal syndrome upon the abstinence of mor-phine or heroin, and 2 Hz EA should be moreeffective in suppressing the opiate craving. Thesewere demonstrated on animal models usingjumping and writhing for acute withdrawal syn-drome [8] and conditioned place preference forcraving. Results obtained in animal experiments were also veried in humans. In a study using heartrate as one of the indices for withdrawal syndrome,it was found that the 100 Hz EA was signicantlymore effective than the 2 Hz EA in normalizingthe heart rate. Another study was conducted ondetoxied heroin addicts. A visual analog scale(VAS) was used as the subjective index for craving.The results showed that it was the 2 Hz EA,not the 100 Hz EA that produced a signicantdecrease in VAS score for craving [9]. The Design for a \"Needle-Free Acupuncture\" Device (1980) The traditional acupuncture treatment has certain obvious limitations such as lack of reproducibilityand accessibility. We wanted to design an electricacupuncture device based on the scientic nd-ings, to standardize the treatments and to makethe treatment readily available for more patients.Our idea of an EA device would have the followingfeatures: 1. Able to induce the release of neurotransmitters in a predictable manner. 2. Provide needled (percutaneous) or needle-free (tanscutaneous) options. 3. Easy to operate by patients following doctor's instructions. 4. Portable in size, which is especially advanta- geous for chronic pain patients for controllingincidental pain attack and to drug addicts inmanaging occasional craving and withdrawsymptoms. In collaboration with Liu Yi-Ming, an aero- space engineer, a device was constructed namedHan's Acupoint Nerve Stimulator (HANS). Incontrast to a constant voltage output designed forconventional nerve stimulators, HANS has a con-stant current output. This way, the users do nothave to adjust the voltage in order to compensatefor the gradual fading of the stimulation intensity. The small size is especially convenient for drug addicts. In a study conducted in Shanghai, thesuccess rate for 1-year drug-free among thedetoxied former drug addicts was 32% comparedwith 0-5% in those without a HANS in theirpocket. As the release of neurotransmitters is frequency-dependent, we decided to use alternat-ing frequencies shifting between 2 Hz and 100 Hzwith an optimal cycle of 3 seconds each. Thiswas termed dense-and-disperse (D/D) mode. WeHan 614found that the D/D mode produced a much more potent analgesic effect than that produced by asingle frequency of either 2 Hz or 100 Hz. Thisalternating frequency is especially ideal for treat-ing narcotic addiction. While 100 Hz is best fortreating withdrawal syndrome and 2 Hz forcraving, the D/D mode works well for both. Dr.Paul White at the Department of anesthesiology,Washington University in St. Louis, MO in theUnited States, conducted a serious of clinical trialswith HANS. In 5-year period, Dr. White and hiscolleagues published ve articles to show that D/Dmode of EA was indeed signicantly more effec-tive in analgesic efcacy than either low or highfrequency stimulation, tested in various painmodalities such as postoperation pain, low backpain, and diabetic neuropathic pain. How does the needle-free EA compare with the needled EA? My post-doc John Q. Wang con-ducted a series of experiments on rats to comparethe analgesic effect of EA either via needlesinserted into the leg (percutaneous) or via elec-trodes applied on the skin (transcutaneous). Theresults indicate that the transcutaneous deliverywas at least as good as the percutaneous delivery, ifnot stronger. The underlying mechanisms for theneedled and needle-free EA seem to be the same,as evidenced by cross tolerance study and receptoranalyzing study [6]. HANS has also been used forresearch on the treatment of inflammatory pain[10], neuropathic pain abuse [15], and obesity [16] with considerablesuccess. Validated by Brain Imaging Study (1998) Up to this point, all of the neurochemical experi-ments were done on lab animals, mostly rats. Howwould the ndings on rats translate into humans? Since 1998, we started to perform brain imaging studies in humans to show changes of thebrain activity as a result of acupuncture stimula-tion. In the rst brain imaging study, we usedfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)scanning to compare high responders with lowresponders of AA for their brain activity. EA of2 Hz or 100 Hz was applied to pointduring the fMRI scanning. Within 1-3 days, thesame subject was given an EA session for 30minutes and the thermal pain threshold was mea-sured before and after the EA session. The percentchange of the pain threshold after the EA wastaken as the index for AA. The extent of the fMRIsignal change was then correlated with the analge- sic effect of EA. A positive correlation was found ineight brain areas and a negative correlation wasfound in two brain areas. AA responders showed astronger activation or inhibition in the 10 brainregions of interest, as compared with that of thenonresponders, indicating certain functional basisunderlying the efcacy of AA. In addition, thechanges induced by 2 Hz and 100 Hz were par-tially overlapping but not identical, which indi-cates a separate but related mechanisms [17]. Sorry, I am a Nonresponder for Acupuncture Analgesia Over the years of my lecturing in 26 different countries and areas, one of the most frequentlyasked questions has been \"Does acupuncture workfor everyone?\" My answer is always \"No. Forexample, it doesn't work for me\". While theanswer always triggers a burst of laughter, it issincere. In mid-1980s, I had a severe low backpain. HANS provided little help. The same is truefor rats. In about 10-15% of the rat population, astandard 30-minutes EA produces no analgesiceffect. In the same year of 1975 when the discovery of enkephalin was reported, an article was publisheddiscussing the possible existence of antiopioid sub-stance (AOS) in the brain. The result from one ofour rat experiments done in 1978 agreed with thishypothesis. In the experiment, a 30-minute EAwas administered followed by a 30-minute break,and the pattern was repeated for six sessions. Wefound that the analgesic effect went down gradu-ally over the 6-hour course. We termed thephenomenon acupuncture tolerance (AT). Asubsequent recovery of the analgesic effect wasdetected after 8-12 hours; and a complete recov-ery was reached within 24 hours. During the period of AT , there is a concomitant reduction of the analgesic effect in response tomorphine, suggesting a cross tolerance to mor-phine. From the brain extracts of the tolerant ratswe found a component that had an anti-opioidactivity. It has a molecular weight of approximately1,000 Da. Unfortunately, we were unable to com-pletely purify and characterize this component dueto our lack of adequate technology in the 1970s.Since then, we followed closely the advancementin AOS research, and conrmed that cholecysto-kinin octapeptide (CCK-8) is most likely theAOS responsible for the development of AT .Indeed, AT can be reversed by CCK receptorsAcupuncture Research 615antagonist proglumide and by the antiserum against CCK-8 administered intrathecally orintracerebroventricularly. Thus, a nonresponder to acupuncture can be converted to a responder by central administrationof 1) CCK-B regulate the gene expressionof CCK [18]. On the other hand, a good responderto acupuncture can be converted to a nonre-sponder by central administration of a CCK vectorresulting in an over expression of CCK in theCNS. CCK seems to play a role in a negativefeedback system against excessive opioid activity.This feedback control is achieved by multiplemechanisms, 1) high levels of opioids (whetherexogenous or endogenous) promote geneexpression, 2) CCK-8, to CCKreceptor induces allosteric changes in the nearbyopioid receptors, and 3) CCK mobilizes intracel-lular calcium storage that cancels out the ability ofopioids to lower calcium influx. Could the relationship between opioids and CCK be an example of what the TCM theorydescribed as Yin and Yang? How do we restore thehomeostasis when it is out of balance? From apractical point of view, a CCK antagonist, pro-vided it is nontoxic to humans, would serve as agood supplement for acupuncture therapy for painand drug addiction. This thought constituted themain body of the plenary lecture \"MolecularEvents Underlying the Anti-Opioid Effect ofCCK-8 in the CNS\" that I presented in the 12thCongress of the International Union of Pharma-cological Sciences (IUPHAR) held in Montreal,Canada in 1994 [19]. Three pharmacologists frommy family\u2014my wife, son, and daughter-in-law\u2014were also on the floor. My Unforgettable First Visit to Taiwan of China (1990) At the 9th IUPHAR Congress held in London in 1984, I chaired a symposium on Neuropharmacol-ogy and gave a talk at the symposium on acupunc-ture mechanisms. Also present at the symposiumwas Dr. C.Y. Lee from T aiwan, the pharmacologistwho puried and characterized the snake venomabungarotoxin. During a tea brake, Dr. Lee approached me very politely. After a pleasant chat,we both expressed a wish that someday we wouldvisit each other across the T aiwan Channel. The 10th IUPHAR Congress was held in Sydney in 1988. Dr. Lee and I met again. I intro-duced my wife to him. A year later, in 1989, C.Y. Lee came to Beijing with his wife to meet with us.During the home dinner, he made a bold proposal:\"My wife and I wish to invite both of you to visitT aiwan. If you agree, we have a fund already inplace to support your trip.\" This was unbelievable,no less unbelievable to me than 10 years ago whenProfessor C.Y. Song asked me to visit the UnitedStates. Despite the fact that the relationshipbetween T aiwan and mainland China was almostfrozen at the time, my wife and I looked at eachother for a full second, and burst out in unison:\"Y es, of course!\" Dr. Lee's invitation was soon sent to the Chinese Ministry of Health. If this were approved,it would be the rst time in 40 years that a scientistfrom Mainland China was ofcially permitted byboth sides to visit T aiwan. It was entirely out of ourexpectation that this ice-breaking-visit proposalwas approved within a week! In May 1990, my wife and I were at the T aoyuan Airport of T aipei. Under the flash lights from thepress, we were received by Dr. C.Y. Lee andProfessor J.F . Chen, the director of the Instituteof Chinese medicine and Pharmacy, who wouldaccompany us for our week-long visit in T aiwan.The press conference held at the airport wasimmersed with a friendly atmosphere. As my wifeDr. X.Y. Zhu is a pharmacologist studying theanti-inflammatory ingredients of Musk, and I wasin acupuncture research, the headlines of theT aiwan newspapers in those days were \"Han andZhu, a Couple of T raditional Chinese Medicine,\"\"Revitalize T raditional Chinese Medicine byModern Research on Physiology and Pharmacol-ogy,\" etc. One of the most touching moments was the meeting with one of my high school classmates,Dr. B.N. Jiang, director of the central VA hospitalin T aiwan. He recognized me from the news andinsisted on having dinner with us. As all thedinners were pre-arranged for the whole week, wehad breakfast together instead. The reunion ofhigh school classmates after 43 years (1947-1990)of separation across the T aiwan channel felt trulyhistorical. We embraced each other without asingle word uttered. The memory of that momentcan never be erased from our heart. One week of time passed by too quickly. An ofcer at the airport customs recognized us andsaid: \"We have been seeing you every day on TVand newspaper. We wish to see you again!\" Wesaid, \"Surely, we will come again!\" Indeed, my wifeand I paid three more visits to T aiwan in the 5Han 616years to follow. Professor J.F . Chen came to Beijing even more often. The Best \"Present\" for My 79th Birthday (2007) The night before my 79th Birthday when I was ina sabbatical leave in Harvard University, I wasinformed that the Ministry of Health of the Peo-ple's Republic of China has approved our proposaland issued a document to have major hospitals inChina establishing a Pain Management Depart-ment. It was indeed the best \"birthday present\" Ihave ever had. In 1989, I founded the Chinese Association for the Study of Pain (CASP) with 164 foundingmembers. The organization has since developedtremendously with an ofcial magazine \"ChineseJournal of Pain Medicine\" inaugulated in 1995.Being in the center of pain study, and from myyears of direct contact with patients, I saw thedesperate need for having a Pain Department tospecialize in pain management. Acute pain can bea common manifestation of many diseases. Butchronic pain lasting for more than 3-6 months hasoften been regarded as a disease entity. Physiciansspecialized in certain disease discipline may nothave the adequate skill to treat various kinds ofchronic pain. As a result, patients often have tovisit one doctor after another in one hospital afteranother but nd no end for their suffering due tolack of proper treatment. Therefore, to establish aspecialty in pain management has long been on mywish list. After years and years of efforts, thisdream has nally come true. On the 2007 Globalday against pain, a press conference of the CASPwas held in Beijing, where Drs. J.P . Wu and Q.D.Han, the leaders of the People's Republic of Chinaas well as the leaders of the Ministry of Healthofcially announced the inauguration of Depart-ment of pain management in major hospitals ofChina. Over 500 pain researchers and physicianswitnessed the historical event, which would mark aturning point for the development of pain medi-cine in China. In a letter to CASP , Dr. T .S. Jensen,the president of the International Association forthe Study of Pain wrote: \"In this respect Chinamay be a leading example for other countries tofollow to advance pain treatment throughout theworld.\" What Else on My Wish List? (2008 and Beyond) When I close my eyes and allow my dreams tofly, I can see many targets in front of me. Beinga chief scientist of a central grant issued jointly by the Ministry of Science and T echnology andthe Bureau of T raditional Chinese Medicine, Ihave made the commitment to answer the ques-tions of \"What is the real benet of using AA inclinical practice?\" \"What are the for a full expression of AA?\" \"What arethe mechanisms of AA at genetic and cognitivelevels?\" I would also like to extend the use of HANS for the treatment of stress related disorders such asinsomnia, anxiety, and depression, which are suf-fered by hundreds of millions of people. Thesedisorders often reflect a failure in the excitation-inhibition balance of brain functions. T o thebottom line, restoring natural homeostasis (theyin-yang balance) is the ultimate goal of acupunc-ture therapy. At this moment when I am about to close this review, I feel a deep sense of gratitude to many,many people in my life. I would like to thank myparents and teachers who taught me how to dealwith challenges in life, to my family and friends fortheir years of nurturing, support, and sharing ofhappiness with me. I would like to thank mypatients, students, colleagues, fellow scientists inthe eld and grant providers who worked togetherin nding better ways to ght against pain andsuffering [20].
