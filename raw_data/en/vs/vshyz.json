This vaccine is being delivered using Inovio's electroporation-based DNA delivery system. In the third and highest dose cohort of the study, two of three subjects demonstrated reductions in viral load of 93% and 99.7%. Previously reported middle dose cohort results demonstrated an 87% and 98% reduction in HCV in two of three subjects, while no anti-viral effect was observed in the low dose cohort. No safety issues have been noted to date in the trial. These data suggest a potential dose response of the vaccine and support the inclusion of three additional subjects in the high dose cohort. "}
