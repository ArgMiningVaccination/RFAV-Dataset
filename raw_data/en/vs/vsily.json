Price at time of publication: Starting at $24 How We Selected Mother's Day Gifts Our commerce editors shop for a living\u2014plus, many are parents themselves\u2014so we asked them about the gifts they're giving (and what they hope to get) this Mother's Day. We also spoke with Amira Martin, LCSW-R, the owner of the private practice Amira for Her, and an adjunct lecturer at the Columbia University School of Social Work. When picking gifts, we thoroughly reviewed dozens of products, looking for gifts that are useful, well-designed, and meaningful. Using these criteria, we selected our list of top-notch, thoughtful Mother's Day gifts that fit a range of budgets, lifestyles, and interests. What to Look for in a Mother's Day Gift Budget You don't have to spend a fortune to give the moms in your life a special present. After all, a Mother's Day gift isn't about the amount you spend, but a way of expressing love and sharing a moment of joy with an important figure in your life, Martin says. While there are plenty of splurge-worthy gifts on our list like the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer, there are plenty of budget-friendly picks that she's sure to love too, like the Loop Quiet Earplugs. Whatever price tag your gift has, it's always a nice idea to include a handwritten card for Mom or some artwork from her kids\u2014now that is truly priceless. Personalization No matter what gift you end up choosing, most moms will agree that personalizing it makes it that much more special. A gift that's tailored to the recipient is a meaningful way to show the recipient you've taken the time to think about them, Martin tells Verywell Family. The Little Words Project Cool Mom bracelet allows you to add your own message or choose one from their cute pre-made options, and the Homesick Thank You, Mom Candle lets you add a customized message to the back of the label. Even if you choose a gift that isn't customizable on its own, adding a sweet little note is a special touch. Lifestyle and Hobbies When picking a Mother's Day gift, you're likely shopping for a very important person in your life, so it's important to consider what they'll actually like and enjoy, says Martin. While the Parachute Waffle Robe may be perfect for the mom who loves a little extra comfort when lounging around the house, the Theragun Mini could be a better pick for the athletic mom who would like to soothe her muscles post-workout. And for any busy mom, a gift that offers her comfort, self-care, and love is sure to be appreciated. Ultimately, it's about showing the moms in your life how much you value and care about their feelings and preferences, Martin says.
