STAR Rate Cells are: (1) Under Age 1 Child ; (2) Age 1 -5 Child; (3) Age 6 -14 Child; (4) Age 15 -18 Child ; (5) Age 19 -20 Child; (6) TANF adults ; and (7) Pregnant wom en. These Rate Cells are subject to change. (b) STAR+PLUS Rate Cells. STAR+PLUS Capitation Rates are defined on a per Member per month basis by Rate Cells. STAR+PLUS Rate Cells are based on client category as follows: (1) Medicaid Only Standard Rate (2) Medicaid On ly HCBS STAR+PLUS Waiver Rate - Above Floor (3) Medicaid Only HCBS STAR+PLUS Waiver Rate - Below Floor (4) Dual Eligible Standard Rate (5) Dual Eligible HCBS STAR+PLUS Waiver Rate - Above Floor (6) Dual Eligible HCBS STAR+PLUS Waiver Rate - Below Floor (7) Nursing Facility - Medicaid onl y (8) Nursing Facility - Dual Eligible (9) Individuals with Developmental Disabilities (IDD) - under age 21 (10) Individuals with Developmental Disabilities (IDD) - age 21 and older These Rate Cells are subject to change. (c) STAR and STAR+PLUS Capitatio n Rate development: (1) Capitation Rates for Service Areas with historical Medicaid MCO Program participation. For Service Areas where HHSC operated a Medicaid MCO Program prior to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will develop base Capitation R ates by analyzing the Medicaid MCO Program's historical Encounter Data and financial data for the Service Area (e.g., Capitation Rates for the STAR Program will be based on STAR Program historical Encounter Data and financial data for the Service Area). T his analysis will apply to all MCOs in the Service Area, including MCOs that have no historical participation in the Medicaid MCO Program in Service Area. The analysis will include a review of historical enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered Services and covered populations; rate changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other relevant information. If the MCO participated in the Medicaid MCO Program in the Service Area prior to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC may modify the Service Area base Capitation Rates using diagnosis -based risk adjusters to yield the final Capitation Rates. (2) Capitation Rates for Rate Periods 1 and 2 for Service Areas with no historical STAR Program participation. For Service Area s where HHSC has not operated a Medicaid MCO Program prior to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will establish base Capitation Rates for Rate Periods 1 and 2 by analyzing Fee -for-Service claims data for the Medicaid MCO Program and Service Area (e. g., Capitation Rates for the STAR Program will be based fee -for-service data in the Service Area). This analysis will include a review of historical enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered Services and covered populations; rat e changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other relevant information. (3) Capitation Rates for subsequent Rate Periods for Service Areas with no historical STAR Program participation. For Service Areas where HHSC has not operated a Medicaid M CO Program prior to the Effective Date of this Contract, HHSC will establish base Capitation Rates for the Rate Periods following Rate Period 2 by analyzing the Medicaid MCO Program's historical Encounter Data and financial data for the Service Area. This analysis will include a review of historical enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered Services and covered populations; rate changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other relevant information. (d) Acuity adjustmen t. HHSC may evaluate and implement an acuity adjustment methodology, or alternative reasonable methodology, that appropriately reimburses the MCO for acuity and cost differences that deviate from that of the community average, if HHSC in its sole discretio n determines that such a methodology is reasonable and appropriate. The community average is a uniform rate for all MCOs in a Service Area and is determined by combining all the experience for all MCOs in a Service Area to get an average rate for the Service Area. (e) Value -added Services. Value -added Services will not be included in the rate - setting process. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 43 of 70 (f) Case -by-case services. Case -by-case services will not be included in the rate setting process . (g) Delay in Increased STAR+PLUS Capitation Level for Certain Members Receiving Waiver Services Once a current STAR+PLUS MCO Member has been certified to receive STAR+PLUS Waiver (SPW) services, there is a two (2) month delay before the MCO will begin receiving the higher capitation payme nt. Non-Waiver Members who qualify for STAR+PLUS based on eligibility for SPW services and Waiver recipients who transfer from another region will not be subject to this two (2) month delay in the increased capitation payment. All SPW recipients will b e registered into Service Authorization System Online (SASO). The Premium Payment System (PPS) will process data from the SASO system in establishing a Member's correct capitation payment. Section 10.06 CHIP Capitation Rates Structure. (a) CHIP Rate Cells. CHIP Capit ation Rates are defined on a per Member per month basis by the Rate Cells applicable to a Service Area. CHIP Rate Cells are based on the Member's age group as follows: (1) under age 1; (2) ages 1 through 5; (3) ages 6 through 14; and (4) ages 15 through 18. (b) CHIP Perinatal Program Rate Cells. CHIP Perinatal Capitation Rates are defined on a per Member per month basis by the Rate Cells applicable to a Service Area. CHIP Perinatal Rate Cells are based on the Member's birth status and household income as follows: (1) CHIP Perinate at or Below Medicaid Eligibility Threshold (an unborn child who will qualify for Medicaid once born); (2) CHIP Perinate Above Medicaid Eligibility Threshold (an unborn child who will not qualify for Medicaid once born); and (3) CHIP Perinate Newborn Above Medicaid Eligibility Threshold (newborn that does not qualify for Medicaid). (c) CHIP and CHIP Perinatal Program Capitation Rate development: HHSC will establish base Capitation Rates by analyzing Encounter Data and financial data for each Service Area. This analysis will include a review of historical enrollment and claims experience information; any changes to Covered Services and covered populations; rate changes specified by the Texas Legislature; and any other relevant i nformation. HHSC may modify the Service Area base Capitation Rate using diagnosis based risk adjusters to yield the final Capitation Rates. (d) Acuity adjustment. HHSC may evaluate and implement an acuity adjustment methodology, or alternative reasonabl e methodology, that appropriately reimburses the MCO for acuity and cost differences that deviate from that of the community average, if HHSC in its sole discretion determines that such a methodology is reasonable and appropriate. The community average is a uniform rate for all MCOs in a Service Area and is determined by combining all the experience for all MCOs in a Service Area to get an average rate for the Service Area. (e) Value -added Services. Value -added Services will not be included in the rate - setting process. (f) Case -by-case services. Case -by-case services will not be included in the rate setting process . Section 10.07 MCO input during rate setting process. (a) In Service Areas with historical STAR or STAR+PLUS Program participation, MCO must provide certified Encounter Data and financial data as prescribed in UMCM Chapter 5 . Such information may include, without limitation: claims lag information by Rate Cell, capitation expenses, and stop loss reinsurance expenses. HHSC may request clarification or for additional financial information from the MCO. HHSC will notify the MCO of the deadline for submitting a response, which will include a reasonable amount of time for response. (b) HHSC will allow the MCO to review and comment on data used by HHSC to determine base Capitation Rates. In Service Areas with no historical STAR o r STAR+PLUS Program participation, this will include Fee -for-Service data for Rate Periods 1 and 2. HHSC will notify the MCO of deadline for submitting comments, which will include a reasonable amount of time for response. HHSC will not consider comments received after the deadline in its rate analysis. (c) During the rate setting process, HHSC will conduct at least two (2) meetings with the MCOs. HHSC may conduct the meetings InPerson, via teleconference, or by another method deemed appropriate by HHSC. Prior to the first meeting, HHSC will provide the MCO with proposed Capitation Rates. During the first meeting, HHSC will describe Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 44 of 70 the process used to generate the proposed Capitation Rates, discuss major changes in the rate setting process, and receive input from the MCO. HHSC will notify the MCO of the deadline for submitting comments, which will include a reasonable amount of time to review and comment on the proposed Capitation Rates and rate setting process. After reviewing such comments, HHSC wil l conduct a second meeting to discuss the final Capitation Rates and changes resulting from MCO comments, if any. Section 10.08 Adjustments to Capitation Payments. (a) Adjustment. HHSC may adjust a payment made to the MCO for a Member if: (1) a Member's eligibility stat us or program type is changed, corrected as a result of error, or is retroactively adjusted; (2) the Member is enrolled into the MCO in error; (3) the Member mov es outside the United States; (4) the Member dies before the first Day of the month for which t he payment was made; or (5) payment has been denied by the CMS in accordance with the requi rements in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.730. (b) Appeal of adjustment. The MCO may appeal the adjustment of capitations in the above circumstances using the HHS C dispute resoluti on process set forth in Section 12.13 , \"Dispute Resolution.\" Section 10.09 Delivery Supplemental Payment for CHIP, CHIP Perinatal and STAR MCOs. (a) The Delivery Supplemental Payment (DSP) is a function of the average delivery cost in each Service Area. Delivery costs include facility and professional charges. (b) CHIP and STAR MCOs will receive a Delivery Supplemental Payment (DSP) from HHSC for each live or stillbirth by a Member. CHIP Perinatal MCOs will receive a DSP from HHSC for each live or stillbirth of a CHIP Perinate above the Medicaid eligibility threshold (i.e., a Perinate who does not qualify for Medicaid once born, measured at the time of enrollment in the CHIP Perinatal subprogram). CHIP Perinatal MCOs will not receive a DSP from HHSC for a live or stillbirth of a CHIP Perinate at or below the Medicaid eligibility threshold (i.e., a Perinate who qualifies for Medicaid once born). For STAR and CHIP and CHIP Perinatal Program MCOs, the one -time DSP payment is made in the amount identified in the HHSC Managed Care Contract document regardless of whether there is a single birth or there are multiple births at time of delivery. A delivery is the birth of a live born infant, regardless of the duration of the pregnancy, or a stillborn (fetal death) infant of 20 weeks or more of gestation. A delivery does not include a spontaneous or induced abortion, regardless of the duration of the pregnancy. (c) MCO must submit a monthly DSP Report in the format prescribed in UMCM Chapter 5. (d) HHSC will pay the Deli very Supplemental Payment within 20 Business Days after receipt of a complete and accurate report from the MCO. (e) The MCO will not be entitled to Delivery Supplemental Payments for deliveries that are not reported to HHSC within 300 Days after the date of delivery, or within 30 Days from the date of discharge from the Hospital for the stay related to the delivery, whichever is later. (f) MCO must maintain complete claims and adjudication disposition documentation, including paid and denied amounts for e ach delivery. The MCO must submit the documentation to HHSC within five Business Days after receiving a request for such information from HHSC. Section 10.10 Experience Rebate (a) MCO's duty to pay. (1) General. At the end of each FSR Reporting Period beginning with FSR Reporting Period 12/13, the MCO must pay an Experience Rebate if the MCO's Net Income Before Taxes is greater than the percentage set forth below of the total Revenue for the period. The Experience Rebate is calculated in accorda nce with the tiered rebate method set forth below . The Net Income Before Taxes and the total Revenues are as measured by the FSR, as reviewed and confirmed by HHSC. The final amount used in the calculation of the percentage may be impacted by various factors herein, including the Loss Carry Forward, the Admin Cap, and/or the Reinsurance Cap. (2) Basis of Consolidation. With the exception of the Dual Demonstration, the percentages are calculated on a Conso lidated Basis, and include the consolidated Net Income Before Taxes for all of the MCO's and its Affiliates' Texas HHSC Programs and Service Areas. (b) Graduated Experience Rebate Sharing Method. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 45 of 70 For the limited period beginning September 1, 2021, through August 31, 2023, the following Graduated Experience Rebate Sharing Method will be utilized to calculate the Experience Rebate: Pre-tax Income as a % of Revenues MCO Share HHSC Share 3% HHSC and the MCO will share the consolidated Net Income Before Taxes for its HHSC Programs as follows: (1) The MCO will retain all the Net Income Before Taxes that is equal to or less than 3% of the total Revenues received by the MCO; (2) HHSC and the MCO will share that portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that is over 3% and less than or equal to 5% of the total Revenues received, with 80% to the MCO and 20% to HHSC. (3) HHSC will be paid the ent ire portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that exceeds 5% of the total Revenues. Beginning September 1, 2023, the Graduated Experience Rebate Sharing Method will revert to the following : Pre-tax Income as a % of Revenues MCO Share HHSC Share 3% HHSC the MCO will share the consolidated Net Income Bef ore Taxes for its HHSC Programs as follows: (1) The MCO will retain all the Net Income Before Taxes that is equal to or less than 3% of the total Revenues received by the MCO; (2) HHSC and t he MCO will share that portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that is over 3% and less than or equal to 5% of the total Revenues received, with 80% to the MCO and 20% to HHSC. (3) HHSC and the MCO will share that portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that is over 5% and less than or equal to 7% of the total Revenues received, with 60% to the MCO and 40% to HHSC. (4) HHSC and the MCO will share that portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that is over 7% and less than or equal to 9% of the total Revenues received, with 40% to the MCO and 60% to HHSC. (5) HHSC and the MCO will share that portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that is over 9% and less than or equal to 12% of the total Revenues received, with 20% to the MCO and 80% to HHSC. (6) HHSC will be paid the entire portion of the Net Income Before Taxes that exceeds 12% of the total Revenues. (c) Net income Before taxes. (1) The MCO must compute the Net Income Before Taxes in accordance with applicable federal regulations , UMCM Chapter s 5 and 6, and similar such instructions for other HHSC Programs . The Net Income Before Taxes will be confirmed by HHSC or its agent for the FSR Reporting Period relating to all Revenues and Allowable Expenses incurred pursuant to the Contract. HHSC reserves the right to modify the \"Cost Principles for Expenses\" and \"FSR Instructions for Completion\" found in the UMCM in accordance with Section 8.05 , \"Modification of the Uniform Managed Care Manual.\" (2) For purposes of calculating Net Income Before Taxes certa in items are omitted from the calculation, as they are not Allowable Expenses; these include: (i) the payment of an Experience Rebate; (ii) any interest expense associated with late or underpayment of the Experience Rebate; (iii) financial incentives, including without limitation any incentives described in Attachment B-1, Section 6.3.2; and (iv) financial disincentives, including without limitation: the Performance -based Capitation Rate Program described in Attachment B -1, Section 6.3.2.2; and (v) liquidated damages, and any interest expense associated, as described in Attachment B -3. See UMCM Chapter 6. (3) Financial incentives will not be reduced by potential increased Experience Rebate payments. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 46 of 70 Financial disincentives will not be offset in whole or part by potential decreases in Experience Rebate payments. (4) For FSR reporting p urposes, financial incentives incurred must not be reported as an increase in Revenues or as an offset to costs, and any award of such will not increase reported income. Financial disincentives incurred must not be included as reported expenses and must n ot reduce reported income. The reporting or recording of any of these incurred items will be done on a memo basis, which is below the income line, and will be listed as separate items. (d) Carry forward of prior FSR Reporting Period losses. (1) General. Losses incurred on a Consolidated Basis for a given FSR Reporting Period may be carried forward to the next FSR Reporting Period and applied as an offset against consolidated pre -tax net income for determination of any Experience Rebate due. Any such prior losses may be carried forward for the next two contiguous FSR Reporting Periods . In the case when a loss in a given FSR Reporting Period is carried forward and applied against profits in either or both of the next two FSR Reporting Periods , the loss must f irst be applied against the first subsequent FSR Reporting Period such that the profit in the first subsequent FSR Reporting Period is reduced to a zero pre - tax income; any additional loss then remaining unapplied may be carried forward to any profit in the next subsequent FSR Reporting Period. In such case, the revised income in the third FSR Reporting Period would be equal to the cumulative income of the three contiguous FSR Reporting Periods . In no case could the loss be carried forward to the fourth FSR Reporting Period or beyond. Carrying forward of losses may be impacted by the Admin Cap; see Section 10.10.2 (f) below. Losses incurred in the last or next -to-last FSR Reporting Period of a prior contiguous contract with HHSC may be carried forward up to two FSR Reporting Periods into the first or potentially second FSR Reporting Period of this Contract, if such losses meet all other requirements of both the prior and current contracts. (2) Basis of consolidation. In order for a loss to be eligible fo r potential carry forward as an offset against future income, the MCO must have a negative Net Income Before Taxes for an FSR Reporting Period on a Consolidated Basis. (e) Settlements for payment. (1) There may be one or more MCO payment(s) of the State share of the Experience Rebate on income generated for a given FSR Reporting Period under the applicable Programs. The first scheduled payment (the \"Primary Settlement\") will equal 100% of the State share of the Experience Rebate as derived from the FSR and will be paid on the same Day the 90 -Day FS R Report is submitted to HHSC. The \"Primary Settlement,\" as utilized herein, refers strictly to what should be paid with the 90 -Day FSR, and does not refer to the first instance in which an MCO may tender a payment . For example, an MCO may submit a 90 -Day FSR indicating no Experience Rebate is due, but then submit a 334 -Day FSR with a higher income and a corresponding Experience Rebate payment. In such case, this initial payment would be subsequent to the Primary Settlement. (2) The next scheduled payment will be an adjustment to the Primary Settlement, if required, and will be paid on the same Day that the 334 - Day FSR Report is submitted to HHSC if the adjustment is a payment from the MCO to HHSC. Section 10.10(f ) describes the interest expenses associated with any payment after the Primary Settlement. An MCO may make non -scheduled payments at any time to reduce the accumulation of interest under Section 10.10(f). For any nonscheduled payments prior to the 334-Day FSR, the MCO is not required to submit a revised FSR, but is required to submit an Experience Rebate calculation form and an adjusted summary page of the FSR. The FSR summary page is labeled \"Summary Income Statements (Dollars), All Coverage Group s Combined (FSR, Part I).\" (3) HHSC or its agent may audit or review the FSRs. If HHSC determines that corrections to the FSRs are required, based on an HHSC audit/review or other documentation acceptable to HHSC, then HHSC will make final adjustments. Any payment resulting from an audit or final adjustment will be due from the MCO within 30 Days of the earlier of: (i) the date of the management representation letter resulting from the audit; or (ii) the date of any invoice issued by HHSC. Payment within this 30 -Day timeframe will not relieve the MCO of any interest payment obligation that may exist under Section 10.10(f). Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 47 of 70 (4) In the event that any Experience Rebates and/or corresponding interest payments owed to the State are not paid by the required d ue dates, then HHSC may offset such amounts from any future Capitation Payments or collect such sums directly from the MCO. HHSC may adjust the Experience Rebate if HHSC determines the MCO has paid amounts for goods or services that are not reasonable, nec essary, or allowable in accordance with UMCM Chapter 6 , UMCM Chapter 5 , and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), or other applicable federal or state regulations. HHSC has final authority in auditing and determining the amount of the Experience Rebate. (f) Interest on Experience Rebate. (1) Interest on any Experience Rebate owed to HHSC will be charged beginning 35 Days after the due date of the Primary Settlement, as described in Section 10.10(e)(1). Thus, any Experience Rebate due o r paid on or after the Primary Settlement will accrue interest starting at 35 Days after the due date for the 90 -Day FSR Report. For example, any Experience Rebate payment (s) made in conjunction with the 334 -Day FSR, or as a result of audit findings, wil l accrue interest back to 35 Days after the due -date for submission of the 90 -Day FSR. The MCO has the option of preparing an additional FSR based on 120 Days of claims run - out (a \"120 - Day FSR\"). If a 120 -Day FSR, and an Experience Rebate payment based on it, are received by HHSC before the interest commencement date above, then such a payment would be counted as part of the Primary Settlement. (2) If an audit or adjustment determines a downward revision of income after an interest payment has previousl y been required for the same State Fiscal Year, then HHSC will recalculate the interest and, if necessary, issue a full or partial refund or credit to the MCO. (3) Any interest obligations that are incurred pursuant to Section 10.10 that are not timely pa id will be subject to accumulation of interest as well, at the same rate as applicable to the underlying Experience Rebate. (4) All interest assessed pursuant to Section 10.10 will continue to accrue until such point as a payment is received by HHSC, at wh ich point interest on the amount received will stop accruing. If a balance remains at that point that is subject to interest, then the balance will continue to accrue interest. If interim payments are made, then any interest that may be due will only be charged on amounts for the time period during which they remained unpaid. By way of example only, if $100,000 is subject to interest commencing on a given Day, and a payment is received for $75,000 45 Days after the start of interest, then the $75,000 wil l be subject to 45 Days of interest, and the $25,000 balance will continue to accrue interest until paid. The accrual of interest as defined under Section 10.10(f) will not stop during any period of dispute. If a dispute is resolved in the MCO's favor, t hen interest will only be assessed on the revised unpaid amount. (5) If the MCO incurs an interest obligation pursuant to Section 10.10 for an Experience Rebate payment HHSC will assess such interest at 12% per annum, compounded daily. If any interest rat e stipulated hereunder is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be outside the range deemed legal and enforceable, then the rate hereunder will be adjusted as little as possible so as to be deemed legal and enforceable. (6) Any such interest expens e incurred pursuant to Section 10.10 is not an Allowable Expense for reporting purposes on the FSR. Section 10.10.1 This Section Intentionally Left Blank Section 10.10.2 Administrative Expense Cap. (a) General requirement. The calculation methodology of Experience Rebates described in Section 10.10 will be adjusted by an Administrative Expense Cap (\"Admin Cap.\") The Admin Cap is a calculated maximum amount of administrative expense dollars that can be deducted from Revenues for purposes of determining income subject to the Experience Rebate. While Administrative Expenses may be limited by the Admin Cap to determine Experience Rebates, all valid Allowable Expenses will continue to be reported on the Financial Statistical Rep orts (FSRs). Thus, the Admin Cap does not impact FSR reporting, but may impact any associated Experience Rebate calculation. The calculation of any corresponding Experience Rebate due will be subject to limitations on total deductible administrative expen ses. Such limitations will be calculated as follows: (b) Calculation methodology. HHSC will determine the administrative expense component of the applicable Capitation Rate structure for each Program prior to each applicable Rate Period. At the conclusion of an FSR Reporting Period, HHSC will apply that predetermined administrative expense component against the MCO's actually Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 48 of 70 incurred number of Member Months and aggregate premiums received (monthly Capitation Payments plus any Delivery Supplemental Payment s, which excludes any investment income or interest earned ), to determine the specific Admin Cap, in aggregate dollars, for a given MCO. If rates are changed during the FSR Reporting Period, HHSC will use this same methodology of multiplying the predeterm ined HHSC rates for a given month against the ultimate actual number of Member Months or Revenues that occurred during that month, such that HHSC will apply each month's actual results against the rates that were in effect for that month. (c) Data sources. In determining the amount of Experience Rebate payment to include in the Primary Settlement (or in conjunction with any subsequent payment or settlement), the MCO will need to make the appropriate calculation, in order to assess the impact, if any , of the Admin Cap. (1) The total premiums paid by HHSC (received by the MCO), and corresponding Member Months, will be taken from the relevant FSR (or audit report) for the FSR Reporting Period . (2) There are three components of the administrative exp ense portion of the Capitation Rate structure: (i) the percentage rate to apply against the total premiums paid (the \"percentage of premium\" within the administrative expenses), (ii) the dollar rate per Member Month (the \"fixed amount\" within the administrative expenses) ; and (iii) the portion incorporated into the pharmacy (prescription expense) rate that pertains to prescription administrative expenses . These will be taken from the supporting details associated with the official notification of f inal Capitation Rates, as supplied by HHSC. This notification is sent to the MCOs during the annual rate setting process via email, labeled as \"the final rate exhibits for your health plan.\" The email has one (1) or more spreadsheet files attached, whic h are particular to the given MCO. The spreadsheet(s) show the fixed amount and percentage of premium components for the administrative component of the Capitation Rate. The components of the administrative expense portion of the Capitation Rate can als o be found on HHSC's Medicaid website, under \"Rate Analysis for Managed Care Services.\" Under each Program, there is a separate Rate Setting document for each Rate Period that describes the development of the Capitation Rates. Within each such document, there is a section entitled \"Administrative Fees,\" where it refers to \"the amount allocated for administrative expenses.\" (3) In cases where the administrative expense portion of the Capitation Rate refers to \"the greater of (a) [one (1) set of factors], a nd (b) [another set of factors],\" then the Admin Cap will be calculated each way, and the larger of the two (2) results will be the Admin Cap utilized for the determination of any Experience Rebates due. (d) Example of calculation. By way of example only , HHSC will calculate the Admin Cap for an FSR Reporting Period as follows: (1) Multiply the predetermined administrative expense rate structure \"fixed amount ,\" or dollar rate per Member Month (for example, $8.00 ), by the actual number of Member Months for a given Program during the FSR Reporting Period (for example, 70,000): $8.00 x 70,000 = $560,000 . (2) Multiply the predetermined percent of premiums in the administrative expense rate structure (for example, 5.75%), by the actual aggregate premiums earned for the Program during the FSR Reporting Period (for example, $6,000,000). 5.75% x $6,000,000 = $345,000. (3) Multiply the predetermined pharmacy administrative expense rate (for example, $1.80), by the actual number of Member Months for the Program durin g the FSR Reporting Period (for example, 70,000): $1.80 x 70,000 = $126,000. (4) Add the totals of items 1, 2, and 3, plus applicable premium taxes and maintenance taxes (for example, $112,000), to determine the Admin Cap for the Program: ($560,000 + $345,000 + $126,000) + $112,000 = $1,143,000 . In this example, $1,143,000 would be the Admin Cap for a single Program for an MCO in a particular FSR Reporting Period. (e) Consolidation and offsets. The Admin Cap will be first calculated indi vidually by Program, and then totaled and applied on a Consolidated Basis. There will be one aggregate amount of dollars determined as the Admin Cap for each MCO, which will cover all of an MCO's and its Affiliates' Programs and Service Areas excluding the Dual Demonstration . The Dual Demonstration will have its own separate Admin Cap calculated. This consolidated Admin Cap will be applied to the Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 49 of 70 adminis trative expenses of the MCO on a Consolidated Basis. The net impact of the Admin Cap wil l be applied to the Experience Rebate calculation. Calculation details are provided in the applicable FSR Templates and FSR Instructions in the UMCM . (f) Impact on Loss carry -forward. For Experience Rebate calculation purposes, the calculation of any loss carry -forward, as described in Section 10.10(d), will be based on the allowable pre - tax loss as determined under the Admin Cap. (g) MCOs entering a Service Delivery Area or Program. If an MCO enters a new Service Area or offers a Program that it did not offer under a previous contract, it may be exempt from the Admin Cap for those Service Areas and Programs for a period of time to be determined by HHSC, up through the first FSR Reporting Period or portion thereof. (h) Service Delivery Areas with only o ne (1) MCO in a Program. In Service Areas operating with only one (1) MCO for a Program, HHSC may, at its sole discretion, revise the Admin Cap if its application would create an undue hardship on the MCO. (i) Unforeseen events. If, in HHSC's sole discreti on, it determines that unforeseen events have created significant hardships for one (1) or more MCOs, HHSC may revise or temporarily suspend the Admin Cap as it deems necessary. Section 10.10.3 Reinsurance Cap Beginning with FSR Reporting Period 12/13, th e MCO is subject to the Reinsurance Cap. Reinsurance is reported on HHSC's FSR report format as: 1) gross reinsurance premiums paid, and 2) reinsurance recoveries received. The premiums paid are treated as a part of medical expenses, and the recoveries received are treated as an offset to those medical expenses (also known as a contra - cost). The net of the gross premiums paid minus the recoveries received is called the net reinsurance cost. The net reinsurance cost, as measured in aggregate dollars over the FSR Reporting Period , divided by the number of Member Months for that same period, is referred to as the net reinsurance cost per -member - per-month (PMPM). The MCO will be limited to a maximum amount of net reinsurance cost PMPM for purposes of calculating the pre-tax net income that is subjec t to the Experience Rebate . This limitation does not impact an MCO's ability to purchase or arrange for reinsurance . It only impacts what is factored into the Experience Rebate calculation.

Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 51 of 70 Section 10.19 Payment/Adjustment to Capitation in Consideration of the ACA Section 9010 Health Insurance Providers Fee The following applies only to MCOs that are covered entities under Section 9010 of the PPACA, and thus required to pay the Health Insurance Providers Fee (\"HIP Fee\") for United States health risks. Beginning in calendar year 2014, the PPACA requires the MCO to pay the HIP Fee no later than September 30th (as applicable to each relevant year, the \"HIP Fee Year\") with respect to premiums paid to the MCO in the preceding calendar year (as applicable to each relevant year, the \"HIP Data Year\"), and continuing similarly in each successive year. In order to satisfy the requirement for actuarial soundness set forth in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.6(c) with respect to amounts paid by HHSC under this Agreement, the parties agree that HHSC will make a retroactive adjustment to capita tion to the MCO for the full amount of the HIP Fee allocable to this Agreement, as follows: Amount and method of payment: For each HIP Fee Year, HHSC will make an adjustment to capitation to the MCO for that portion of the HIP Fee that is attributable to t he Capitation Payments paid by HHSC to the MCO for risks in the applicable HIP Data Year under the Agreement, less any applicable exclusions and appropriate credit offsets. This capitation adjustment will be determined by HHSC and will include the followin g: The amount of the HIP Fee attributable to this Agreement; The federal income tax liability, if any, that the MCO incurs as a result of receiving HHSC's payment for the amount of the HIP Fee attributable to this Agreement; and Any Texas state premium tax attributable to the capitation adjustment. The amount of the HIP Fee will not be determinable until after HHSC establishes the regular Capitation Rates for a rate period. HHSC therefore will perform an actuarial calculation to account for the HIP Fee within actua rially sound Capitation Rates each year and apply this Capitation Rate adjustment to the regular Capitation Rates already paid to the MCO. The MCO's federal income tax rate will not be known prior to the end of the tax year. As a resul t, HHSC will make a tax rate assumption for purposes of developing the capitation adjustment. If the tax rate assumption later proves to be higher than the actual tax rate for one or more MCOs, HHSC may re - determine the capitation adjustment for those MCO s using the lower tax rate and reconcile the capitation amount paid. Documentation Requirements: HHSC will pay the MCO after it receives sufficient documentation, as determined by HHSC, detailing the MCO's Texas Medicaid and CHIP -specific liability for the HIP Fee. The MCO will provide documentation that includes the following: The preliminary and final versions of the IRS Form 8963; Texas Medicaid/CHIP -specific premiums included in the premiums reported on Form 8963; and The preliminary and final versions of the Fee statement provided by the IRS. Payment by HHSC is intended to put the MCO in the same position as the MCO would have been had no HIP Fee been imposed upon the MCO. This provision will survive the termination of the Agreement. Section 10.20 Non-Risk Payments for Certain Autism Services Capitation Rates do not include the costs of delivering applied behavior analysis (ABA) services to Medicaid Members age 20 and under or the costs of interdisciplinary team meetings to identify needed services and formulate ind ividualized trea tment plans for these eligible Medicaid Members, as described in the TMPPM. For providing these services to eligible Medicaid Members, HHSC will make non -risk payments to the MCO based on Encounter Data received by HHSC's Administrative Se rvices Contractor during an Encounter reporting period. HHSC will reimburse for services provided to eligible Medicaid Members as documented in both the invoice and Encounter Data on a non -risk basis subject to the non -risk upper payment limit in 42 CFR \u00a7 447.362. Non-risk payments will cover quarterly Encounter reporting periods. HHSC will make non -risk payments within a reasonable amount of time after the Encounter reporting period, generally no later than 95 Days after HHSC's Administrative Services Contractor has processed the Encounter Data. Non - risk payments for these services require MCO adherence to all applicable requirements, including those specifie d in the TMPPM. Non-risk payments will be limited to the actual amounts MCOs paid to providers for these services up to the Fee -for-Service reimbursement amount. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment A - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions Version 2.38 Page 52 of 70 The non-risk payments will cover only the cost of the covered ABA service s and interdiscipli nary team meetings to identify needed services and formulate individualized treatment plans for these eligible Medicaid Members .

In order to ensure that recipients have a choice of health plans in all MCO Programs, HHSC will select at least two (2) managed care organizations (MCOs) per MCO Program and Service Area. Through this Request for Proposals (RFP), HHSC is expanding both the scope of services and the geographical areas covered by its current managed care programs. New features include: Expansion of STAR into two (2) new regions, the Hidalgo Service Area and Medicaid Rural Service Area (MRSA). Expansion of STAR+PLUS into the El Paso and Lubbock Service Areas, as well as the new Hidalgo Service Area. Adjustments to the Service Area boundaries for STAR, STAR+PLUS and CHIP Service Areas, so that the Service Areas are consistent for all Programs. The addition of prescription drug benefits to the managed care structure. The prescription drug benefit will no longer be carved- out of managed care and paid through HHSC's Vendor Drug Program. Medicaid and CHIP MCOs wil l be responsible for recruiting and maintaining pharmacy providers and paying for pharmacy benefits. The addition of inpatient facility services to the managed care structure for STAR+PLUS. For Dual Eligible Members in the STAR+PLUS Program, the additi on of Medicaid Wrap Services to the scope of Covered Services at a date to be determined by HHSC . Attachments B -5, 5.1, and 5.2 include maps of the planned STAR, STAR+PLUS and CHIP Service Areas. 1.4 Mission Statement HHSC's mission is to create a customer -focused, innovative, and adaptable managed care system that provides the highest quality of care to clients while at the same time ensures access to services. Through this procurement, HHSC seeks to accomplish its mi ssion by contracting Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-12 for measurable results that improve Member access and satisfaction; maximize program efficiency, effectiveness, and responsiveness; and limit operational costs. 1.5 Mission Objectives To accomplish the HHSC's mission, HHSC will prioritize desired outcomes and benefits for the managed care programs, and will focus its monitoring efforts on the MCOs' ability to provide satisfactory results in the following areas. 1. Network adequacy and access to care All Members must have timely access to quality of care through a Network of Providers designed to meet the needs of the population served. The MCO will be held accountable for creating and maintaining a Network capable of delivering all Covered Services to Members. The MCO must provide Members w ith access to qualified Network Providers within the travel distance and waiting time for appointment standards defined in this RFP. 2. Quality HHSC is accountable to Texans for ensuring that all Members receive quality services in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Accordingly, the MCO will be responsible for providing high quality services in a professional and ethical manner. HHSC expects the MCO to implement new and creative approaches that ensure quality services, cost -effective service delivery, and careful stewardship of public resources. 3. Timeliness of claim payment The MCO's ability to ensure that Network Providers receive timely and fair payment for services rendered is a key component of their success in the STAR, STAR+PLUS, and CHIP programs. The MCO must have the ability to timely comply with HHSC's claims adjudication requirements, as set forth in the Uniform Managed Care Manual (UMCM) . Therefore, HHSC will require strict adherence to claims adjudication standards during the term of the Contract. HHSC also encourages MCOs to provide a no- cost alternative for providers to allow billing without the use of a clearinghouse, and to include attendant care payments as part of the regular claims payment process. 4. Timeline ss with which prenatal care is initiated STAR Program data has revealed that 83% of pregnant women received prenatal care in the first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment. While this rate approximates the Medicaid managed care national average, HHSC believes that the high prevalence of births in the STAR population warrants efforts to improve timeliness of prenatal care initiation. 5. Behavioral health services Members must have timely access to Medically Necessary Behavioral Health Services, such as mental health counseling and treatment, as well as timely and appropriate follow -up care. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-13 6. Delivery of health care to diverse populations Member populations in Texas are as diverse as those of any state in the nation. Health Care Services must be delivered without regard to racial or ethnic factors. HHSC expects the MCO to implement intervention strategies to avoid disparities in the delivery of Health Care Services to diverse populations and provide services in a culturally competent manner as described in Section 8.1.5.8 of the RFP. 7. Disease management requirements The MCO must provide a comprehensive disease management program or coverage for Disease Management (DM) services for asthma, diabetes, and other chronic diseases identified by the MCO, based upon an evaluation of the prevalence of the diseases within the MCO's membership. Please refer to the UMCM Chapter 9for additional DM requirements. 8. Service Coordination The integration of Acute Care services and Community -based Long -Term Services and Supports is an essential feature of STAR+PLUS. A STAR+PLUS MCO must demonstrate that there are sufficient levels of qualified and competent personnel devoted to Service Coordination to meet the everyday needs of STAR+PLUS Members, including Dual Eligibles. 9. Continuity Of Care HHSC expects that established Member/Provider relationships, existing treatment protocols, and ongoing care plans will not be impacted significantly by this procurement. Transition to the MCO must be as seamless as possible for Members and their Providers. 1.6 Overview of the HHSC MCO Programs House Bill 7 from the 72nd Regular Session of the Texas Legislature mandated the establishment of Medicaid managed care pilot projects that utilized proven approaches for delivering comprehensive health care. In 1991, the Texas Department of Health created the Bureau of Managed Care. Since that time, Texas has administered a comprehensive set of managed care programs to serve low income Texans. These programs, as presently constituted and administered by HHSC, include the STAR, STAR+PLUS, and CHIP Programs as described in this section. 1.6.1 STAR STAR is currently HHSC's primary managed care program for Medicaid Eligibles and operates under the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program (THTQIP) 1115 Waiver. It gr ew out of a pilot project in Travis County in 1993. STAR is currently available in Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Harris, Nueces, Jefferson, Lubbock, Tarrant, and Travis regions. Total STAR enrollment as of August 1, 2010 was 1,452,531. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-14 All non -STAR counties in Texas (primarily rural areas) are currently served by the Medicaid Primary Care Case Management Program (PCCM). Total PCCM enrollment as of August 1, 2010 was 840,172. As a result of this procurement, PCCM will be replaced by STAR in the Hidalgo Service Area and the Medicaid Rural Service Area (MRSA). Note, however, that in the Hidalgo Service Area, HHSC will secure legislative direction before including Cameron, Hidalgo, and Maverick Counties in the STAR Program. Refer to the Procurement Library for current and projected STAR enrollment by Service Area. 1.6.2 STAR+PLUS STAR+PLUS is a Texas Medicaid program integrating the delivery of Acute Care services and Community -based Long- Term Services and Supports to aged, blind, and disabled (ABD) Medicaid recipients through a managed care sy stem. STAR+PLUS began as a Medicaid pilot project in Harris County in 1998. The STAR+PLUS program operates under the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program (THTQIP) 1115 Waiver. The waivers allow the state to provide home and comm unity -based services for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) eligible and SSI -related Medicaid clients, and to mandate managed care participation for SSI/SSI -related eligible clients who are 21 years of age and older. Enrollment in STAR+PLUS is voluntary for clients who are 20 years of age and younger. As of August 1, 2010, STAR+PLUS MCOs served 169,873 Members in the Bexar, Harris, Nueces, and Travis Service Areas. Through this procurement, HHSC intends to expand STAR+PLUS to the El Paso, Hidalgo, and Lubbock Service Areas (see Attachment B -5.2 \"STAR+PLUS Service Area Map\"). As in STAR, HHSC will seek legislative direction before including Cameron, Hidalgo, and Maverick Counties in the STAR+PLUS Hidalgo Service Area. Refer to the Procurement Library for current and projected STAR+PLUS enrollment by Service Area. 1.6.3 CHIP CHIP is HHSC's program to help Texas families obtain affordable coverage for their uninsured children (from birth through the month of their 19th birthday). In 1999, the 76th Texas Legislature authorized the state's participation in the federal CHIP program. The principal objective of the state legislation was to provide primary and preventative health care to low -income, uninsured children of Texas, including children with special health car e needs who were not served by or eligible for other state- assisted health insurance programs. HHSC began operating CHIP in 2000. CHIP Members are currently covered through two (2) types of managed care entities - health maintenance organizations (HMOs) l icensed by the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) and exclusive provider organizations (EPOs) with TDI - approved exclusive provider benefit plans (EPBPs). HMOs serve CHIP Members in eight (8), primarily urban Service Areas. EPOs serve the remaining CHIP Members, who reside primarily in the 174 -county rural service area (the CHIP RSA). As of September 1, 2010, 523,895 children were enrolled in CHIP. Of these, 400,243 were enrolled in HMOs. The balance of the CHIP enrollment is in the EPOs serving the CHI P RSA. Refer to the Procurement Library for current and projected CHIP enrollment by Service Area. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-15 The CHIP Perinatal Program, a subprogram of CHIP, is for unborn children of women who are not eligible for Medicaid. The 2006 -07 General Appropriations Act (Article II, Health and Human Services Commission, Rider 70, S.B. 1, 79th Legislature, Regular Session, 2005) authorized HHSC to expend funds to provide unborn children with health benefit coverage under CHIP. The result was the CHIP Perinatal Program, which began in January 2007. This benefit allows pregnant women who are ineligible for Medicaid due to income (whose income is greater than the Medicaid eligibility threshold) or immigration status (and whose income is also below the Medicaid eligibility threshold) to receive prenatal care for their unborn children. Upon delivery, newborns in families with income at or below the Medicaid eligibility threshold move from the CHIP Perinatal Program to Medicaid, where they receive 12 -months of c ontinuous Medicaid coverage. CHIP Perinatal newborns in families with incomes above the Medicaid eligibility threshold remain in the CHIP Perinatal Program and receive CHIP benefits for a 12- month coverage period, beginning on the date of enrollment as an unborn child. CHIP Perinatal Program Members are exempt from the 90 -day waiting period, the asset test, and all cost - sharing that applies to traditional CHIP Members, including enrollment fees and co -pays, for the duration of their coverage period. As of September 1, 2010, 33,860 CHIP Perinates (unborn children) and 19,076 CHIP Perinate Newborns were enrolled in this subprogram. Throughout this RFP, references to \"CHIP\" apply to both the traditional CHIP Program and the CHIP Perinatal subprogram unless the context indicates otherwise. 1.7 Other HHSC Managed Care Programs The following managed care options are not included in the scope of this procurement: CHIP Rural Service Area (RSA): 174 primarily -rural counties. Medicaid and CHIP Dental Programs: The Medicaid State Plan encourages eligible individuals to improve and maintain good oral health by providing access to comprehensive dental care. The CHIP Dental Program is a statewide program that provides services such as routine check -ups, cleanings, X -rays, sealants, fillings, tooth removal, crowns/caps and root canals for all CHIP children. HHSC has issued a managed care procurement with an anticipated operational start date of March 1, 2012 for both the Medicaid and CHIP Dental Programs. STAR+PLUS Program in the Dallas and Tarrant Service Areas: Effective February 1, 2011, STAR+PLUS began serve approximately 78,000 Medicaid clients in the Dallas and Tarrant Service Areas. STAR Health Program: On April 1, 2008, HHSC launched the STAR Health program as the first comprehensive health and medical network for children who are in the state's foster care system. The goal is to give children health care services that are coordinated, comprehensive, easy to find, and uninterrupted when the child moves. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-16 1.8 Eligible Populations for HHSC MCO Programs The Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program (THTQIP) 1115 Waiver and HHSC's administrative rules identify the populations that are eligible for STAR and STAR+PLUS, and the CHIP State Plan identifies the populations eligible for CHIP. Federal law requires a choice of Medicaid managed care health plans in any given Service Area. For the STAR Program, during the period after which the Medicaid eligibility determination has been made, but prior to enrollment in the MCO, Medicaid Eligibles, with the exception of certain newborns and pregnant women will be enrolled under the traditional fee- for- service Medicaid program (see Article 5 of Attachment A , \"Uniform Man aged Care Contract Terms and Conditions\" of the RFP ). All such Medicaid Eligibles will remain in the fee- for-service Medicaid program until enrolled in or assigned to a STAR or STAR+PLUS MCO, as applicable. For the CHIP MCO Program, there is no benefit cov erage for CHIP -eligible children prior to enrollment in a CHIP MCO. 1.9 Authorization The Texas Legislature has designated HHSC as the single state agency to administer the Medicaid and CHIP Programs in the State of Texas. HHSC has authority to contract with MCOs to carry out the duties and functions of the Medicaid Managed Care Program under Title XIX of the Social Security Act; \u00a712.011 and \u00a712.02, Texas Health and Safety Code; and Chapter 533, Texas Government Code. HHSC has the authority to contract with MCOs to carry out the duties of the CHIP Managed Care Program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, and Chapter 62, Texas Health and Safety Code. Contracts awarded under this RFP are subject to all necessary federal and state approvals, including, but not limited to, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approval. 1.10 Eligible Respondents Except as provided herein, eligible Respondents include insurers that are licensed by the TDI as HMOs in accordance with Chapter 843 of the Texas Insurance Code, or a certified Approved Non-Profit Health Corporation (ANHC), formed in compliance with Chapter 844 of the Texas Insurance Code. For the STAR and STAR+PLUS Hidalgo Service Area, eligible respondents include HMOs, ANHCs, and EPOs with TDI -approved E PBPs. Note that under current state law, HHSC is precluded from providing services to Medicaid recipients through an HMO model in the following three (3) counties in the Hidalgo Service Area: Cameron, Hidalgo, and Maverick. HHSC will not implement any f orm of capitated managed care in these three (3) counties in the Hidalgo Service Area without guidance from the Texas Legislature. Respondents who are interested in bidding on the Hidalgo Service Area should nevertheless pursue one or more forms of TDI approval appropriate to these counties. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-17 For the Medicaid Rural Service Area for STAR, eligible respondents include HMOs, ANHCs, EPOs with TDI -approved EPBPs. Note that, for purposes of bidding, HHSC has subdivided the Medicaid Rural Service Area into three (3) areas - West, Central, and Northeast Texas. Respondents may seek TDI approval in one (1) or more of these areas, but should note that HHSC will more favorably evaluate responses that propose to serve all three (3) areas. Should HHSC determine that it is in the state's best interest to su bdivide the Medicaid Rural Service Area for purposes of award, the Medicaid Rural Service Area will still be treated as one (1) Service Area for rate -setting purposes. Throughout this RFP, the term \"MCO\" is used to refer to HMOs, ANHCs, and EPOs. A Respondent that has submitted its application for licensure as an HMO, for certification as an ANHC, or for approval of an EPBP prior to the Proposal due date is also eligibl e to respond to this RFP ; however, the Respondent must receive TDI approval no later than 60 days after HHSC executes the Contract (see Section 1.2 , \"Procurement Schedule\"). Failure to receive the required approval within 60 days after HHSC executes the C ontract will result in the cancellation of the award. For more information on the reasons for HHSC's disqualification of Respondents, see Section 3.3.2 , \"Conflicts of Interest,\" and Section 3.3.3 , \"Former Employees of a State Agency.\" 1.11 Term of Contract The Initial Contract Period will begin on the Contract's Effective Date (generally the date HHSC signs the contract) and will continue through August 31, 2015 (the \"Initial Contract Period\"). HHSC may, at its option, extend the Contract for an additional peri od or periods, not to exceed a total of eight (8) operational years. All reserved Contract extensions beyond the Initial Contract Period will be subject to good faith negotiation between the parties. 1.12 Development of Contracts HHSC intends to execute one (1) Contract per MCO, which will include all awarded MCO Programs and Service Areas. For reference only, HHSC has included a copy of the standard Managed Care Contract in the Procurement Library. The Managed Care Contract identifies an MCO's awarded MCO Pr ograms and Service Areas, and identifies all documents that will become part of the agreement, including Attachment A , \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions.\" 1.13 Medicaid and CHIP Service Areas In this RFP, HHSC distinguishes areas of Texas by MCO Program Service Areas. If a Respondent proposes to participate in an HHSC MCO Program Service Area, the Respondent must propose to serve all counties in the HHSC -defined Service Area, with the following exception. As described above, Respondents may chose to serve all or part of the STAR Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 1-18 Medicaid Rural Service Area. Maps and tables depicting the Service Area configuration for each of the MCO Programs can be found in Attachments B -5, 5.1, and 5.2. The tables indicate the counties included in each of the designated Service Areas. The following chart summarizes the MCO Program options included in the scope of this procurement, by Service Area. Service Areas STAR STAR+PLUS CHIP MCO Bexar Dallas El Paso Harris Hidalgo Jefferson Lubbock Medicaid RSA (Entire Service Area) West Texas Central Texas Northeast Texas Nueces Tarrant Travis As described above, HHSC intends to expand the STAR Program to include the Hidalgo Service Area and Medicaid RSA, and the STAR+PLUS MCO Program to include the El Paso, Hidalgo, and Lubbock Service Areas. HHSC reserves the right to change the boundaries fo r, or otherwise modify, the Service Areas if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the State. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 2-19 2. Procurement Strategy and Approach HHSC seeks to contract with at least two (2) MCOs for each MCO Program and Service Areas to provide for client choice. It is possible that a Service Area could have more than two (2) MCOs. HHSC reserves the right to enter into Contracts with more than two (2) MCOs in any Service Area based on: the number of managed care Eligibles in the Service Area compar ed to the combined capacity of qualified MCO Respondents, and statutory requirements, such as HHSC's consideration of Proposals from an MCO owned or operated by a hospital district. Section 2155.144, Texas Government Code obligates HHSC to purchase goods and services on the basis of best value. HHSC rules define \"best value\" as the optimum combination of economy and quality that is the result of fair, efficient, and practical procurement decision- making and that achieves health and human services procurement objectives (see 1 TAC \u00a7391.31 ). HHSC will evaluate proposals using the best value criteria set forth in Section 5 of this RFP. 2.1 HHSC Model Management Strategy HHSC will use two Performance Indicator Dashboards ( one for administrative and financial measures and another for quality measures). The Performance Indicator Dashboards are included in the UMCM . The Performance Indicat or Dashboards are not all-inclusive sets of performance measures; HHSC will measure other aspects of the MCO's performance as well. Rather, the Performance Indicator Dashboards assemble performance indicators that assess many of the most important dimensions of the MCO's performance, and includes measures that, when publicly shared, will also serve to incentivize excellence. As described in Section 8.1.1.1 , \"Performance Evaluation,\" after Rate Year 1 HHSC will also collaborate with each MCO to establish performance improvement projects. The MCO will be committed to making its best efforts to achieve the established projects . HHSC may establish some or all of the performance improvement projects. HHSC and each MCO will negotiate any remaining projects. These projects will be highly specified and measurable. The projects will reflect areas that present significant opportunities for performance improvement. Once finalized and approved by HHSC, the projects will become part of each MCO's annual plan for its Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program, as defined in Section 8.1.7 , \"Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement,\" and will be incorporated by reference into the Contract. As described in Section 8.1.1.1.1, HHSC will develop MCO report cards to help STAR, STAR+PLUS, and CHIP enrollees to identify and select an MCO. HHSC recognizes the importance of applying a variety of financial and non- financial incentives and disincentives for demonstrated MCO performance. It is HHSC's objective to recognize and Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 2-20 reward both excellence in performance and improvement in performance within existing state and federal financial constraints. It is likely that this approach will be modified over time based on several variables, including accumulated experience by HHSC and the MCO, changes in the status of state finances, and changes in each MCO's performance levels. Section 6.3 , \"Performance Incentives and Disincentives,\" describes the incentive and disincentive approach in additional detail. The incentives and disincentives will be linked to some of the measures in the Performance Indicator Dashboard . The MCO's performance relative to the performance improvement projects may be used by HHSC to identify and reward excellence and improvement by the MCO in subsequent years. Finally, HHSC plans to improve methods for sharing information regarding the Texas Medicaid and CHIP Programs with all of the MCOs through HHSC -sponsored workgroups and other initiatives. 2.2 Performance Measures and Associated Remedies The MCO must provide all services and deliverables under the Contract at an acceptable quality level and in a manner c onsistent with acceptable industry standard, custom, and practice. Failure to do so may result in HHSC's assessment of contractual remedies, including liquidated damages, as set forth in Attachment B -3, \"Deliverables/Liquidated Damages Matrix.\" Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-21 3. Gener al Instructions and Requirements 3.1 Strategic Elements 3.1.1 Contract Elements The term \"Contract\" means the contract awarded as a result of this RFP and all exhibits thereto. At a minimum, the following documents will be incorporated into the contract: this RFP and all attachments and exhibits; any modifications, addendum or amendm ents issued in conjunction with this RFP; HHSC's \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions;\" and the MCO's Proposal. Respondents are responsible for reviewing all parts of the Contract, including the \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions,\" and noting any exceptions, reservations, and limitations on the Respondent Information and Disclosures Form. 3.1.2 HHSC's Basic Philosophy: Contracting for Results HHSC's fundamental commitment is to contract for results. HHSC defines a successful result as the generation of defined, measurable, and beneficial outcomes that satisfy the Contract requirements and support HHSC's missions and objectives. This RFP describes what is required of the MCO in terms of services, deliverables, performance meas ures, and outcomes, and unless otherwise noted in the RFP, places the responsibility for how they are accomplished on the MCO. 3.2 External Factors External factors may affect the project, including budgetary and resource constraints. Any contract resulting from the RFP is subject to the availability of state and federal funds. As of the issuance of this RFP, HHSC anticipates that budgeted funds will be available to reasonably fulfill the project requirements. If, however, funds are not available, HHSC reserves the right to withdraw the RFP or terminate the resulting contract without penalty. 3.3 Legal and Regulatory Constraints 3.3.1 Delegation of Authority State and federal laws generally limit HHSC's ability to delegate certain decisions and functions to a vendor, including, but not limited to: (1) policy -making authority, and (2) final decision- making authority on the acceptance or rejection of contracted services. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-22 3.3.2 Conflicts of Interest A conflict of interest is a set of facts or circumstances in which either a Respondent or anyone acting on its behalf in connection with this procurement has past, present, or currently planned personal, professional, or financial interests or obligations that, in HHSC's determination, would actually or apparently conflict or interfere with the Respondent's contractual obligations to HHSC. A conflict of interest would include circumstances in which a party's personal, professional, or financial interests or obligations may directly or indirectly: make it difficult or imp ossible to fulfill its contractual obligations to HHSC in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the State of Texas; impair, diminish, or interfere with that party's ability to render impartial or objective assistance or advice to HHSC; and/or provide the party with an unfair competitive advantage in future HHSC procurements. Neither the Respondent nor any other person or entity acting on its behalf, including, but not limited to subcontractors, employees, agents, and representatives, may have a conflict of interest with respect to this procurement. Before submitting a proposal, Respondents should carefully review Attachment A , \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions,\" for additional information concerning conflicts of interes ts. A Respondent must certify that it does not have personal or business interests that present a conflict of interest with respect to this RFP and resulting contract (see the Required Certifications form ). Additionally, if applicable, the Respondent must disclose all potential conflicts of interest. The Respondent must describe the measures it will take to ensure that there will be no actual conflict of interest and that its fairness, independence, and objectivity will be maintained (see the Respondent Information and Disclosures Form ). HHSC will determine to what extent, if any, a potential conflict of interest can be mitigated and managed during the term of the Contract. Failure to identify potential conflicts of interest may result in HHSC's disqualification of a proposal or termination of the Contract. 3.3.3 Former Emplo yees of a State Agency Respondents must comply with Texas and federal laws and regulations relating to the hiring of former state employees (see e.g., Texas Government Code \u00a7572.054 and 45 C.F.R. \u00a774.43 ). Such \"revolving door\" provisions generally restrict former agency heads from communicating with or appearing before the agency on certain matters for two (2) years after leaving the agency. The revolving door provisions also restrict some former employees from representing clients on matters that the employee participated in during state service or matters that were in the employees' official responsibility. As a result of such laws and regulations, a Respondent must certify that it has com plied with all applicable laws and regulations regarding former state employees (see the Required Certifications Form). Furthermore, a Respondent must disclose any relevant past state employment of the Respondent's or its subcontractors' employees and agents in the Respondent Information and Disclosure Form. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-23 3.4 HHSC Amendments and Announcements Regarding this RFP HHSC will post all official communication regarding this RFP on its website, including the notice of tentative award. HHSC reserves the right to revise the RFP at any time. Any changes, amendments, or clarifications will be made in the form of written responses to Respondents' questions, amendments, or addendum issued by HHSC on its website. Respondents should check the website frequently for notice of matters affecting the RFP. To access the website, go to the \" HHSC Contracting Opportunities \" page and enter a search for this procurement. 3.5 RFP Cancellation/Partia l Award/Non-Award HHSC reserves the right to cancel this RFP, to make a partial award, or to make no award if it determines that such action is in the best interest of the State of Texas. 3.6 Right to Reject Proposals or Portions of Proposals HHSC may, in its discretion, reject any and all proposals or portions thereof. 3.7 Costs Incurred Respondents understand that issuance of this RFP in no way constitutes a commitment by HHSC to award a contract or to pay any costs incurred by a Respondent in the preparation of a response to this RFP. HHSC is not liable for any costs incurred by a Respondent prior to issuance of or entering into a formal agreement, contract, or purchase order. Costs of developing proposals, preparing for or participating in oral presentations and site visits, or any other similar expenses incurred by a Respondent are entirely the responsibility of the Respondent, and will not be reimbursed in any manner by the State of Texas. 3.8 Protest Procedures Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, Part 15, Chapter 392, Subchapter C outlines HHSC's Respondent protest procedures. 3.9 Vendor Conference HHSC will hold a vendor conference according to the time and date in Section 1.2 , \"Procurement Schedule\" in the Lone Star Conference Room located at 11209 Metric Blvd, Building H, Austin, Texas. Vendor conference attendance is strongly recommended, but is not required. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-24 Respondents may email questions for the conference to the HHSC Point of Contact (see Section 1.1) no later than five (5) days before the conference. HHSC will also give Respondents the opportunity to submit written questions at the conference. All questions should reference the appropriate RFP page and section number. HHSC will attempt to respond to questions at the vendor conference, but responses are not official until posted in final form on the HHSC website. HHSC reserves the right to amend answers prior to the proposal sub mission deadline. 3.10 Questions and Comments All questions and comments regarding this RFP should be sent to the HHSC Point of Contact (see Section 1.1 ). Questions should reference the appropriate RFP page and section number, and must be submitted by the deadline set forth in Section 1.2. HHSC will not respond to questions received after the deadline. HHSC's responses to Respondent questions will be posted to the HHSC website. HHSC reserves the right to amend answers prior to the proposal submission deadline. Respondents must notify HHSC of any ambiguity, conflict, discrepancy, exclusionary specification, omission, or other error in the RFP by the deadline for submitting questions and comments. If a Respondent fails to notify HHSC of these issues, it will submit a proposal at its own risk, and if awarded a contract: (1) must have waived any claim of error or ambiguity in the RFP or resulting contr act; (2) must not contest HHSC's interpretation of such provision(s); and (3) must not be entitled to additional compensation, relief, or time by reason of the ambiguity, error, or its later correction. 3.11 Modification or Withdrawal of Proposal Prior to the proposal submission deadline set forth in Section 1.2, a Respondent may: (1) withdraw its proposal by submitting a written request to the HHSC Point of Contact, or (2) modify its proposal by submitting a written amendment to the HHSC Point of Contact. HH SC may request proposal modifications at any time. HHSC reserves the right to waive minor informalities in a proposal and award a contract that is in the best interest of the State of Texas. A \"minor informality\" is an omission or error that, in HHSC's d etermination, if waived or modified when evaluating proposals, would not give a Respondent an unfair advantage over other Respondents or result in a material change in the proposal or RFP requirements. When HHSC determines that a proposal contains a minor informality, it may at its discretion provide the Respondent with the opportunity to correct. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-25 3.12 News Releases Prior to tentative award, a Respondent may not issue a press release or provide any information for public consumption regarding its participation in the procurement. After tentative award, a Respondent must receive prior written approval from HHSC before issuing a press release or providing information for public consumption regarding its participation in the procurement. Requests should be dire cted to the HHSC Point of Contact identified in Section 1.1 . Section 3.12 does not preclude business communications necessary for a Respondent to develop a proposal, or required reporting to shareholders or governmental authorities. 3.13 Incomplete Proposals HHSC may reject without further consideration a proposal that does not include a complete, comprehensive, or total solution as requested by this RFP. 3.14 State Use of Proposal Information HHSC reserves the right to use any and all ideas and information present ed in a proposal. A Respondent may not object to HHSC's use of such information. 3.15 Property of HHSC Except as otherwise provided in this RFP or the resulting Contract, all products produced by a Respondent, including without limitations the proposal, all plans, designs, software, and other contract deliverables, become the sole property of HHSC. See Attachment A , \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions,\" Article 15 for additional information concerning intellectual property rights. 3.16 Copyright Re striction HHSC will not consider any proposal that is copyrighted by the Respondent, in whole or part. 3.17 Additional Information By submitting a proposal, the Respondent grants HHSC the right to obtain information from any lawful source regarding the Respondent's and its directors', officers', and employees': (1) past business history, practices, and conduct; (2) ability to supply the goods and services; and (3) ability to comply with Contract requirements. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-26 By submitting a proposal, a Respondent generally releases from liability and waives all claims against any party providing HHSC information about the Respondent. HHSC may take such information into consideration in evaluating proposals. 3.18 Multiple Responses A Respondent may only submit one (1) proposal as a prime contractor. If a Respondent submits more than one (1) proposal, HHSC may reject one or more of the submissions. This requirement does not limit a subcontractor's ability to collaborate with one (1) or more Respondents submitting proposals. A Respondent may not entice or require a subcontractor to enter into an exclusive subcontract for the purpose of this procurement. Any subcontract entered into by a Respondent with a third party to meet a requirement of this RFP must not include any provision that would prevent or bar that subcontractor from entering into a comparable contractual relationship with another Respondent submitting a proposal under this procurement. This prohibition against exclusive subcontracts does not apply to professional services that solely pertain to development of the proposal, including gathering of competitive intelligence. 3.19 No Joint Proposals HHSC will not consider joint or collaborative proposals that require it to contract with more than one (1) Respondent. 3.20 Use of Subcontractors Subcontractors providing services under the Contract must meet the same requirements and level of experience as required of the Respondent. N o subcontract under the Contract must relieve the Respondent of the responsibility for ensuring the requested services are provided. Respondents planning to subcontract all or a portion of the work to be performed must identify the proposed subcontractors and describe the subcontracted functions in their proposals. 3.21 Texas Public Information Act Proposals will be subject to the Texas Public Information Act (the Act), located in Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code , and may be disclosed to the public upon request. By submitting a proposal, the Respondent acknowledges that all information and ideas presented in the proposal are public information and subject to disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act, with the limited exception of Social Security Numbers and certain non- public financial reports or information submitted in response to RFP Sections 4.2.3.3 and 4.2.3.4 . Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 3-27 If the Respondent asserts that financial reports or information provided in response to RFP Sections 4.2.3.3 and 4.2.3.4 contains trade secret or other confidential information, it must be clearly marked such information in boldface type and include the words \"confidential\" or \"trade secret\" at top of the page. Furthermore, the Respondent must identify the financial reports or information, and provide an explanation of why the reports or information are excepted from public disclosure, on the Respondent Information and Disclosures form. HHSC will process any request from a member of the public in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Act. Respondents should consult the Texas Attorney General's website (www.oag.state.tx.us ) for information concerning the Act's application to applications and potential exceptions to disclosure. 3.22 Inducements HHSC submits this RFP setting forth certain information regarding the objectives of the Contract and HHSC's desire to mitigate risk throughout the life of the Contract by use of expert MCO services. Therefore, HHSC will consider all representations contained in a Respondent's proposal, oral or written presentations, correspondence, discussions, and negotiations as representations of the Respondent's expertise. HHSC accepts these representations as inducements to contract. 3.23 Definition of Terms Defined terms must have the meaning stated as described in the Attachment A , \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions,\" unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Defined terms are capitalized throughout this RFP. For example, the word \"Provider,\" when capitalized, refers to Network provider. When the word \"provider\" is not capitalized, the connotation is all providers, whether Network or Out -of-Network. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-28 4. Submission Requirements To be considered for award, the Respondent must address all applicable RFP specifications to HHSC's satisfaction. If requested by HHSC, the Respondent must provide HHSC with information necessary to validate any statements made in its Proposal. This includes, but may not be limited to, granting permission or access for HHSC to verify information with third parties, whether identified by the Respondent or HHSC. If any requested information is not provided within the timeframe allotted, HHSC may reject the Proposal. Respondents must prepare and submit proposals in accordance with the provisions of this section. Proposals received that do not follow these instructions may be evaluated as non- responsive and may not be considered for award. 4.1 General Instructions For Respondents bidding on more than one MCO Program, i.e., STAR, STAR+PLUS, or CHIP Program, HHSC has attempted to minimize the need for Respondents to submit multiple copies of the same information. Each bid for participation in the STAR Program, the STAR+PLUS Program , and/or the CHIP Program must include the following two (2) components: 1. Business Specifications; and 2. General Programmatic Proposal. Respondents proposing to participate in multiple MCO Programs do not need to submit multiple copies of the Business Specifications or the General Programmatic Proposal. However, these Respondents will need to carefully read each submission r equirement to ensure that they provide specific information for each MCO Program bid and Service Area, as applicable, when completing any element of their Proposals. All Proposal information must be submitted on 8 \u00bd x 11 inch, white bond paper, three (3) -hole punched, and placed in sturdy three (3) ring binders. Text must be no smaller than 11- point font, single -spaced. Figures may not incorporate text smaller than 8 -pt font. All pages must have one-inch margins and page numbering must be sequential per section. Where practical, pages should be double- sided. Each binder must be clearly labeled with the title of this RFP, the Respondent's legal name, and the title of the document contained in the binder, e.g., Business Proposal or Programmatic Proposal. Proposals must be organized and numbered in a manner that facilitates reference to this RFP and its requirements. Respondents must respond to each item in the order it appears in the RFP. The response must include headings and numbering to match the corresponding section of the RFP. Respondents may place attachments and appendices in a separate section if the RFP provides that such attachments are not included in the section's specified page limits. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-29 4.1.1 Economy of Presentation Unnecessarily elaborate Proposals bey ond those sufficient to provide a complete and effective response to this RFP are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the Respondent's lack of ability to provide efficient work products. The Respondent must adhere to page limits where specified. Page limits are listed in parentheses at the end of the title of the section. A three (3) page limit, for example, means that the response should not be in excess of three (3) one- sided pages that meet the size, font, and margin requirements specif ied in the General Instructions in Section 4.1 above. Some page limits are identical regardless of the number of MCO Programs in which a Respondent is proposing to participate. If a page limit is listed but does not include the phrase \"per MCO Program,\" t he page limit applies to the entire response regardless of the number of MCO Programs bid. In these cases, the page limit will be indicated as a set number, e.g., \"3 pages.\" In some cases, additional pages are provided for Respondents proposing to serve m ore than one MCO Program. For example, \"3 pages plus 1 additional page per additional MCO Program\" indicates that a Respondent proposing to serve one (1) MCO Program has a three (3) page limit, a Respondent proposing to serve two (2) MCO Programs has a four (4) page limit, and a Respondent proposing to serve all three (3) MCO Programs has a five (5) page limit. This page limit ap proach is designed to give Respondents submitting a Proposal for multiple MCO Programs sufficient space to respond to the submission requirement when submission responses differ across MCO Programs. Respondents proposing to serve multiple programs should have similar or identical approaches across MCO Programs where administrative efficiencies are possible and appropriate. Respondents must clearly indicate differences, if any, in their response to each submission requirement for each applicable MCO Program. In other cases, additional pages may be provided based on certain aspects of the Respondent's Proposal or organization, such as the number of organizational charts submitted reflecting arrangements with Material Subcontractors, or the number of Key Contract Personnel included in the Proposal for Respondent s proposing to serve more than one MCO Program . Finally, some page limits are by MCO Program, e.g., two (2) pages per MCO Program means that a Respondent proposing to serve all three (3) MCO Programs woul d have a six (6) page limit for that requirement. If the Respondent chooses to repeat the RFP question in its Proposal, the question text will be included in the page limit. In responding to questions in Section 4.2 (\"Business Proposal\") and Section 4.3 (\"Programmatic Proposal \") for which the Respondent includes information about a Material Subcontractor or Action Plans, up to one (1) page may be used to describe each Material Subcontractor arrangement, and up to one (1) page may be used to describe each Action Plan. These pages are outside of the page limit instructions for the specific submission requirement. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-30 HHSC reserves the right not to review information provided in excess of the page limits. Respondents need not feel compelled to submit unnecessary text in order to reach the page limits. Attachments required by the RFP, such as certain policies and procedures, are not counted in calculating the Respondent's page limits. Respondents must not submit information or attachments that are not explicitly r equested in the RFP. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper and bindings, and expensive visual or other presentation aids are neither necessary nor desired. 4.1.2 Number of Copies and Packaging Respondents must submit one (1) hardbound original and eight (8) hardbo und copies of the Proposal. The original must be clearly labeled \"Original\" on the outside of the binder. In addition to the hardbound original and copies, Respondents must submit 22 electronic copies of each Proposal component. At the Respondent's option, it may produce only electronic copies of certain attachments and appendices. This exception applies to attachments and appendices that exceed ten (10) pages, such as GeoAccess tables, Significant Traditional Provider (STP) files, TDI filings, and other financial documents. The exception does not apply to the attachments referenced in Section 4.2, Section 5, \"HUB Subcontracting Plan,\" or Section 6, \"Certifications and Other Required Forms,\" which must be included in both the hardbound and electronic copies of the Proposal. If the Respondent produces only an electronic copy of an attachment or appendix, the hardbound Proposals should refer the reader to the electronic Proposal for the required information. For the electronic copies, the Proposal, a ttachments, financial documents, signed forms, pamphlets, and all other documents included in the proposal hardcopy must be submitted on CDs compatible with Microsoft Office 2000 files. PDF files should be prepared in a format that allows for OCR text rec ognition. HHSC will not accept Proposals by facsimile or e- mail. 4.1.3 Due Date, Time, and Location Submit all copies of the Proposal to HHSC's Enterprise Contracts and Procurement Services (ECPS) no later than 2 :00 p.m . Central Time (CT) according to the timeli ne in Section 1.2, \"Procurement Schedule.\" All submissions will be date and time stamped when received by ECPS.

In addition, if HHSC determines that the HSP was not developed in good faith, it w ill reject the proposal for failing to comply with material RFP specifications. 4.2.5.1 Introduction HHSC is committed to promoting full and equal business opportunities for businesses in state contracting in accordance with the goals specified in the State of Tex as Disparity Study. HHSC encourages the use of HUBs through race, ethnic and gender -neutral means. HHSC has adopted administrative rules relating to HUBs, and a policy on the Utilization of HUBs , which is located on HHSC's website. Pursuant to Texas Government Code \u00a72161.181 and \u00a72161.182 , and HHSC's HUB policy and rules, HHSC is required to make a good faith effort to increase HUB participation in its contracts. HHSC may accomplish the goal of increased HUB participation by contracting directly with HUBs or indirectly thro ugh subcontracting opportunities. 4.2.5.2 HHSC's Administrative Rules HHSC has adopted the Comptroller of Public Accounts' (CPA) HUB rules as its own. HHSC's rules are located in Title 1, Part 15, Chapter 392, Subchapter J of the Texas Administrative Code, and the CPA rules are located in Title 34, Part 1, Chapter 20, Subchapter C . If there are any discrepancies between HHSC's administrative rules and this RFP, the rules will take priority. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-42 4.2.5.3 HUB Participation Goal The CPA has established statewide HUB participation goals for different categories of contracts in 34 T.A.C. \u00a720.13. In order to meet or exceed the HUB participation goals, HHSC encourages outreach to certified HUBs. Contractors must make a good faith effort to include certified HUBs in the procurement process. This contract is classified as an \" All Other Services\" contract under the CPA rule, and therefore has a HUB Annual Procurement Utilization Goal of 33% per fiscal year. This goal applies to MCO Administrative Services, as defined below. 4.2.5.4 Required HUB Subcontracting Plan HHSC has determined that subcontracting opportunities are probable for this RFP for MCO Administrative Services. MCO Administrative Services are those services or functions other than the direct delivery of medical Covered Services necessary to manage the delivery of and payment for such services. MCO Administrative Servic es include but are not limited to Network, utilization, clinical and/or quality management, service authorization, claims processing, Management Information System (MIS) operation and reporting. The Respondent must submit an HSP (see the Procurement Libra ry) with its proposal for such MCO Administrative Services. The HSP is required whether or not a Respondent intends to subcontract. HSP requirements will not apply to Subcontracts with Network Providers (providers who contract directly with the MCO to deliver medical Covered Services to Members). A Respondent therefore should not include Network Providers' participation in its HSP submissions. In conjunction with the HSP, a Respondent must indicate whether it is a Texas certified HUB. Being a certified HUB does not exempt a respondent from completing the HSP requirement. During the good faith effort evaluation, HHSC may, at its discretion, allow clarifications or request additional information to support the Respondent's good faith effort development of the HSP. 4.2.5.5 CPA Centralized Master Bidders List Respondents may search for HUB subcontractors in the CPA's Centralized Master Bidders List (CMBL) HUB Directory, which is located on the CPA's website at http://www2.cpa.state.tx.us/cmbl/cmblhub.html . For this procurement, HHSC has identified the following class and item codes for potential subcontracting opportunities: NIGP Commodity Codes: 948-07: Administration Services, Health 958-56: Health Care Management Services (Including Managed Care Ser vices) Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-43 915-49: High Volume, Telephone Call Answering Services (See 915- 05 for Low Volume Services) Respondents are not required to use, nor limited to using, the class and item codes identified above, and may identify other areas for subcontracting. HHSC d oes not endorse, recommend nor attest to the capabilities of any company or individual listed on the CPA's CMBL. The list of certified HUBs is subject to change, so Respondents are encouraged to refer to the CMBL often to find the most current listing of HUBs. 4.2.5.6 HUB Subcontracting Procedures - If a Respondent Intends to Subcontract An HSP must demonstrate that the Respondent made a good faith effort to comply with HHSC's HUB policies and procedures. The following subparts outline the items that HHSC will review in determining whether an HSP meets the good faith effort standard. A Respondent that intends to subcontract must complete the HSP to document its good faith efforts. For step- by-step audio/video instructions on how to complete the HSP, you may also visit the CPA's website at: http://www.cpa.state.tx.us/procurement/prog/hub/hub- subcontracting- plan /. 1. Identify Subcontracting Areas and Divide Them into Reasonable Lots A Respondent should first identify each area of the MCO Administrative Service work it intends to subcontract. Then, to maximize HUB participation, it should divide the MCO Administrative Service work into reasonable lots or portions, to the extent consistent with prudent industry practices. 2. Notify Potential HUB Subcontractors Respondents must notify three (3) or more certified HUBs of each subcontracting opportunity. For example, if a Respondent intends to subcontract two (2) areas of MCO Administrative Service work, then for each class/item code, the Respondent must notify at least three (3) vendors who provide that type of work. Respondents must provide written notice to potential HUB subcontractors prior to submitting proposals. The notice must include: 1. a description of the scope of work to be subcontracted; 2. information regarding the location to review project plans or specifications; 3. information about bonding and insurance requirements; 4. required qualifications and other contract requirements; and 5. a description of how the subcontractor can contact the Respondent. Respondents must give potential HUB subcontractors a reasonable amount of time to respond to the notice, generally no less than five (5) working days from receipt. In rare situations, HHSC will allow a shorter notification period if the Respondent demonstrates: (1) circumstances Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-44 warranting a shorter notification period, and (2) potential subcontractors still had sufficient time to complete their responses. Respondents must use the CMBL, the HUB Directory, and Internet resources when searching for HUB subcontractors. Respondents may rely on the services of contractor groups; local, state and federal business assistance offices; and other organizations that provide assistance in identifying qualified applicants for the HUB program. Respondents also must provide written notice to minority or women trade organizations or development centers, which can disseminate notice of subcontracting opportunities to their members/participants. A list of minority and women trade organizations is located on HHSC's website under the Minority and Women Organization lin k. 3. Written Justification of the Selection Process A Respondent must provide written justification of its selection process if it chooses a non- HUB subcontractor. The justification should demonstrate that the Respondent negotiated in good faith with qualified HUB bidders, and did not reject qualified HUBs who were the best value responsive bidders. 4.2.5.7 Alternatives to Good Faith Effort Requirements (Applies Only to Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and Professional Services Contracts) HHSC will accept a Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Agreement that has been entered into by a Respondent (mentor) and a certified HUB (prot\u00e9g\u00e9) in accordance with Texas Government Code \u00a72161.065 . Participation in the Mentor Prot \u00e9g\u00e9 Program, along with the submission of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as a subcontractor in an HSP, constitutes a good faith effort for the particular area subcontracted to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. If a Respondent proposes to subcontract with a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, it does not need to provide notice to three (3) vendors for that subcontracted area. To demonstrate that a Respondent meets the good faith requirement for mentor/prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangements, the HSP should: 1. include a fully executed copy of the Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Agreement, which must be registered with the CPA prior to submission to HHSC; and 2. identify areas of the HSP that will be performed by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9. 4.2.5.8 HUB Subcontracting Procedures - If a Respondent Does Not Intend to Subcontract If the Respondent plans to complete all MCO Administrative Service requirements with its own equipment, supplies, materials and/or employees, it is still required to complete an HSP. The Respondent must complete the \"Self Performance Justification\" portion of the HSP, and attest that it does not intend to subcontract for any administrative goods or services, including the class and item codes identified in Section 4.2.5.5 . In addition, the Respondent must identify the sections of the proposal that describe how it will complete the Scope of Work using its own resources or provide a statement explaining how it will complete the Scope of Work using its own resources. The Respondent must provide the following information regarding self - performance if requested by HHSC: Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid/CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Sections 1-5 Version 2. 38 4-45 1. evidence of sufficient Respondent staffing to meet the RFP requirements; 2. monthly payroll records showing the Respondent staff fully dedicated to the contract; and 3. documentation proving employment of qualified personnel holding the necessary licenses and certificates required to perform the Scope of W ork. 4.2.5.9 Post -award HSP Requirements After contract award, HHSC will coordinate a post -award meeting with the successful Respondents to discuss HSP reporting requirements. The MCO must maintain business records documenting compliance with the HSP, and must submit monthly reports to HHSC by completing the HUB \" Prime Contractor Progress Assessment Report .\" This monthly report is required as a condition for payment. In addit ion, the MCO must allow periodic onsite reviews of the MCO's headquarters or work site where services are to be performed if requested by HHSC. Once accepted, the finalized HSP will become part of the Contract with the successful Respondents. The UMCM outlines the procedures for changing the HSP, as well as the HSP compliance and reporting requirements. All changes to the approved HSP require prior HHSC approval. In general, if the MCO decides to subcontract any part of the Contract after the award, it must follow the good faith effort procedures outlined in Section 4.2.5.6 (e.g., divide work into reasonable lots, notify at least three (3) vendors per subcontracted area, provide written justification of the selection process, participate in the Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, or for professional services contracts meet the 20% goal). For this reason, HHSC encourages Respondents to identify, as part of their HSP, multiple subcontractors who are able to perform the work in each area the Respondent plans to subcontract. Selecting additional subcontractors may help the selected MCO make changes to its original HSP, when needed, and will allow HHSC to approve any necessary changes expeditiously. Failure to meet the HSP and post -award requirements will constitute a breach of contract and will be subject to remedial actions. HHSC may also report noncompliance to the CPA in accordance with the CPA's respondent performance ( see 34 T.A.C. \u00a720.108 4.2.6 Section 6 - Certifications and Other Required Forms Respondents must submit the following required forms with their proposals: 1. Child Support Certification; 2. Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility, and Voluntary Exclusion of Covered Contr acts; 3. Federal Lobbying Certification; 4. Nondisclosure Statement; 5. Required Certifications; and 6. Respondent Information and Disclosures. The required forms are located on HHSC's website, under the \"Business Opportunities\" link.

(See Texas Government Code \u00a7 531.073(h).) This process must automatically evaluate whether a submitted pharmacy claim meets Prior Aut horization Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-173 criteria for both PDL and Clinical PAs . (See UMCM, Chapter 2.2, Section V for the definition of an A utomated Prior Authorization Request.) The MCO's PA system must accept PA requests from prescribers that are sent electronically, by phone, fax, or mail. The MCO may not charge pharmacies for PA transaction, software, or related costs for processing PA requests. If the MCO or its PBM operates a separate call center for PA requests, the PA call center must meet the provider hotline performance standards set forth in Section 8.1.4.7 , \"Provider Hotline.\" The MCO must train all PA, provider hotline, and pharmacy call center staff on the requirements for dispensing 72- hour emergency supplies of medication. The MCO may not require a PA for any drug exempted from PA requirements by federal law. For drug products purchased by a pharmacy through the Health Resources Servic es Administration (HRSA) 340B discount drug program, the MCO may impose Clinical PA requirements only. These drugs must be exempted from all PDL PA requirements. A provider may appeal PA denials on a Member's behalf, in accordance with Sections 8.2.6 (Medicaid) and 8.4.2 (CHIP) . If a Member changes Medicaid or CHIP health plans, the MCO must provide the new health plan information about the Member' s PA and medication history at no cost and upon request. The MCO, in consultation with HHSC, will develop a standard process and timeline for implementing a standard format for sharing Member medication and PA history. HHSC expects the former MCO to respond with the requested information within 72-hours of the new MCO's request. 8.1.21.3 Coverage Exclusions In accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r -8, the MCO must exclude coverage for any drug marketed by a drug company (or labeler) that does not participate in the federal drug rebate program. The MCO is not permitted to provide coverage for any drug product, brand name or generic, legend or non- legend, sold or distributed by a company that did not sign an agreement with the federal government to provide Medicaid re bates for that product. A list of participating drug companies can be found on the Medicaid website, under \"Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,\" \"Contact Information. \" An MCO may restrict some compounded medications available through the pharmacy benefit. MCOs' cover age of compounded medications must follow the same requirements as outlined in this section and must be listed on the Texas Medicaid or CHIP formulary.

Compounded medications if the FDA -approved product is not available or in short supply, but not because the drug has been withdrawn or removed fr om the market for safety reasons. Compounded medication s, if the specific M ember has a medical need for a different dosage, form, or strength than is commercially available. The MCO may reject claims for compounded medications for which the MCO, based on the MCO's determination, finds no evidence that the compounded medication is safe and effective. The MCO may reject a claim for a compounded medication if the MCO determines the drug is included in one or more of the classes as defined in 1 Tex . Admin . Code \u00a7354.1923 (c). The MCO may reject a claim for a compounded medication if the active ingredients and the use of the compound prescriptions do not have a medically accept ed use supported by the compendia or peer review literature . The MCO may select from and use the following compendia: Thomson Micromedex, American Hospital Formulary Service, clinical pharmacology, physician supported guidelines, or current primary literature when available. The MCO must have a process in place to allow a prescriber or pha rmacy to dispute a rejected claim for compounded medications. The MCO may pend a claim for compounded medication for $200 or more for further review to determine if the product is safe and effective. 8.1.21.5 Pharmacy Rebate Program Under the provisions of, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396r -8, drug companies that wish to have their products covered through the Texas Medicaid Program must sign an agreement with the federal government to provide the pharmacy claims information that is necessary to return federal rebates to the sta te. Under Texas Government Code \u00a7 533.005 (a)(23)(D)(i), the MCO may not negotiate rebates with drug companies for pharmaceutical products. HHSC or its designee will negotiate rebate agreements. If the MCO or its PBM has an existing rebate agreement with a manufacturer, all Medicaid and CHIP outpatient drug claims, including provider - administered drugs, must be exempt from such rebate agreements . The MCO must include rebatable National Drug Codes ( NDCs ) on all encounters for outpatient drugs and biological products, including clinician -administered drugs .

Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-175 The MCO must allow HHSC or its designee to contact Network pharmacy Providers to verify information submitted on claims, and upon HHSC's request, assist with this process. The MCO must establish a single point of contact where HHSC's designee can send information or request clarification. HHSC will notify the MCO of claims submitted with incorrect inform ation. The MCO must correct this information on the next scheduled pharmacy encounter data transmission and respond in writing to the original request with the outcome of the correction. 8.1.21.6 Drug Utilization Review Program The MCO must have a drug utilization review program (DUR) process in place to conduct prospective and retrospective utilization review of prescriptions . The MCO's DUR program must comply with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r -8 and 42 C .F.R. part 456, subpart K. The MCO must submit an annual report to HHSC Vendor Drug Program (VDP) that provides a detailed description of its DUR program activities, as provided for under 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.3(s). Prospective review should take place at the dispensin g pharmacy's point -of-sale (POS). The prospective review at the POS must include screening to identify potential drug therapy problems such as drug -disease contraindication, therapeutic duplication, adverse drug- drug interaction, incorrect drug dosage, in correct duration of drug treatment, drug -allergy interactions, and clinical abuse/misuse. The MCO's retrospective review must monitor prescriber and contracted pharmacies for outlier activities. Retrospective reviews must also determine whether services were delivered as prescribed and consistent with the MCO's payment policies and procedures. The MCO's Drug Utilization Review should specifically assess prescribing patterns for psychotropic medications as defined by Texas Family Code \u00a7 266.001(7) , for a ll Members . If the MCO identifies patterns outside of the MCO's parameters for psychotropic medications, or if HHSC notifies the MCO of outlier prescribing patterns, then the MCO must conduct a review and, if necessary, an intervention, su ch as a letter or phone call to the prescriber or a peer -to-peer review between the prescriber and the MCO. For children, the MCO must model its parameters on DFPS's \"Psychotropic Medication Utilization Parameters for Foster Children.\" For adults, the MCO must base its parameters for psychotropic medicati ons on a peer - reviewed, industry standard. The MCO must submit a Psychotropic Medication Utilization Review Plan and Report on an annual basis as specified in UMCM Chapter 5. 8.1.21.7 Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) The MCO must use a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to process prescription claims. The MCO must identify the proposed PBM and the ownership of the proposed PBM. If the PBM is owned wholly or in part by a retail pharmacy provider, chain drug store or pharmaceutical manufacturer, the MCO will submit a written description of the Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-176 assurances and procedures that must be put in place under the proposed PBM Subcontract, such as an independent audit, to ensure no conflicts of interest exist and ensur e the confidentiality of proprietary information. The MCO must provide a plan documenting how it will monitor these Subcontractors. These assurances and procedures must be submitted for HHSC's review during Readiness Review (see Section 7, \"Transition Phas e Requirements\") then prior to initiating any PBM Subcontract after the Operational Start Date. The MCO must ensure its subcontracted PBM follows all pharmacy -related Contract, UMCM, state, and federal law requirements related to the provision of pharmacy services. The MCO must ensure its Material Subcontract with a PBM does not include language that permits: pharmacy provider rate reductions without HHSC notification of approval as required under Section 8.1.4.8; reconciliation methodologies that include Medicaid or CHIP claims ; mechanisms that facilitate \"spread pricing, \" including pharmacy provider reimburs ement clawbacks or discounts, which is described below in this section ; or PBM restrictions that are greater than those required by HHSC for Medicaid/CHIP participation. Further, the MCO's reimbursement methodology for the PBM must be based on the actual amount paid by the PBM to a pharmacy for dispensing and ingredient costs. However, this prohibition on the industry practice known as \"spread pricing\" is not intended to prohibit the MCO from pay ing the PBM reasonable administrative and transactional costs for services, as described in UMCM Chapter 6. Unless directed by HHSC, the MCO and its PBM are prohibited from implementing an aggregate reconciliation process after the point -of-sale transaction such that the final cost of drugs for payors is changed or the price paid to pharmacy providers is changed. Such prohibition includes aggregate reconciliation processes for additional fees, contracted effective rate agreements, payment reductions , and the recoupments of funds based on financial performance measures. This prohibitive language does not apply to audit -related claim reviews, approved Alternative Payment Models, or Fraud, Waste, and Abuse investigations. The MCO must ensure its subcontracted PBM does not directly or indirectly charge or hold a pharmacist or pharmacy responsible for a fee for any step of or component or mechanism related to the claim adjudication process, including the development or management of a claim processing or adjudication network, or participation in a claim processing or adjudication network . Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-177 8.1.21.8 Financial Disclosures for Pharmacy Services The MCO must disclose all financial terms and arrangements for remuneration of any kind that apply between the MCO or the MCO's PBM and any provider of outpatient drugs, any prescription drug manufacturer, or labeler, including formulary management, drug- switch programs, educational support, claims processing, payments, payment adjustments, overpayments, recoupments, pharmacy network fees, data sales fees, and any other fees. Article 9 of Attachment A , \" Audit & Financial Compliance and Litigation Hold,\" provides HHSC with the right to request and timely receive such information from the MCO and its Subcontractors at any time. HHSC agrees to maintain the confidentiality of information disclosed by the MCO pursuant to this section, to the extent that the information is confidential under state or federal law. 8.1.21.9 Limitations Regarding Registered Sex Offenders HHSC's Medicaid and CHIP formularies do not include sexual performance enhancing medications. If these medications are added to the Medicaid or CHIP formulary, then the MCO must comply with the requirements of Texas Government Code \u00a7531.089 prohibiting the provision of sexual performance enhancing medication to persons required to register as sex offenders under Chapter 62, Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. 8.1.21.10 Specialty Drugs The MCO must adhere to the HHSC Speci alty Drug List for specialty drugs provided through selective specialty pharmacy contracts.

To place an outpatient drug on a MAC list, the MCO must ensure that: the drug is listed as \"A\" or \"B\" rated in the most recent version of the United States Food and Drug Administration's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book, has an \"NR\" or \"NA\" rating or similar rating by a nationally recognized reference; and the drug is generally available for purchase by pharmacies in Texas from national or regional wholesalers and is not obsolete. In for mulating the MAC price for a \"mark et basket\" of drugs ( a group of therapeutically related drugs that will be assigned the same price), MCOs and PBMs must use only the prices of the drugs listed as therapeutically equivalent in the most recent version of the Orange Book . Drugs listed as therapeutically equivalent are A -rated drugs. Therefore, MCOs and PBMs can only use A -rated drugs to set MAC prices. B -rated drugs cannot Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-178 be used in MAC pricing calculation. MCOs and PBMs can include B -rated drugs in the same market basket, but those B -rated drugs must be assigned the same price as the A - rated drugs. The MCO cannot set a MAC on a drug that is both preferred on HHSC's PDL and a brand name drug. The MCO must provide a Network pharmacy the sources used to determine the MAC pricing at contract execution, renewal, and upon request. MCOs may not use as a pricing source provider performance standards, provider network performance standards , or effective rate agreements. The MCO must review and update MAC prices at least once every seven Days to reflect any modifications of MAC pricing and establish a process for eliminating products from the MAC list or modifying MAC prices in a timely manner to remain consistent with pricing changes and product availability in the Service Area. The MCO must provide HHSC a report regarding MAC price review and updates upon request in the manner and format specified by HHSC no later than 30 Days after the MCO receives the request . The MCO m ust have a process for allowing Network pharmacies to challenge a drug price on the MAC list, including Network pharmacies tha t are contracted with a Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization (PSAO) . The MCO must submit the process for HHSC's review and approval prior to implementation and modification. The MCO must respond and resolve a challenge by the 15th D ay after it is received by the MCO . If the challenge is successful, the MCO must adjust the drug price on the MAC list , effective on the date the challenge is resolved, and apply the new price to all similarly situated Network pharmacies, as appropriate and determined by the MCO. If the challenge is denied, the MCO must provide the pharmacy the reasons for the denial. The MCO must provide a quarterly report regarding MAC price challenges in the manner and format specified in the UMCM. The MCOs or PBMs, as applicable, must provide a process for each of its Network pharmacies to readily access the M AC list specific to that pharmacy directly from the MCO or PBM, even if the pharmacy is contracted with a PSAO . At a minim um, MCOs and PBMs must allow a N etwork pharmacy to download a searchable file of the MAC list specific to that pharmacy from the MCO o r PBM website. Alternatively, MCOs or PBMs may allow a Network pharmacy to view and search the MAC list specific to that pharmacy on the website. The list provided on the website must be searchable by drug name. The MCO must provide HHSC with access to MAC lists upon request as outlined in Article 9 of Attachment A, \"Uniform Managed Care Contract Terms and Conditions\" and sources used to determine the MAC pricing no later than 10 Days after the MCO receives the request. The MCO must submit the process for HHSC's review and approval prior to implementation and modification. As described in Texas Government Code \u00a7 533.005(a- 2), a MAC price list that is specific to a Network pharmacy is confidential for all other purposes. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-179 The MCO must inform HHSC no later than 21 D ays after implementing a MAC price list for drugs dispensed at retail pharmacies but not by mail. 8.1.21.12 Mail-Order and Delivery The MCO may include mail -order pharmacies in its pharmacy Network, but cannot require Members to use a mail -order pharmacy except in its specialty pharmacy network when a drug is available only from a mail -order pharmacy . The MCO cannot charge a Member who opts to use a mail order pharmacy any fees for using this service, including postage or handling for standard or expedited deliveries. In Medicaid fee -for-service, the Vendor Drug Program pays qualified community retail pharmacies for pharmaceutical delivery s ervices. The MCO must implement a process to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP Members receive free outpatient pharmaceutical deliveries from community retail pharmacies in their Service Areas, or through other methods approved by HHSC. Mail order delivery is n ot an appropriate substitute for delivery from a qualified community retail pharmacy unless requested by the Member. The MCO's process must be approved by HHSC, submitted using HHSC's template, and include all qualified community retail pharmacies identifi ed by HHSC. In Medicaid fee -for-service, the Vendor Drug Program pays qualified community retai l pharmacies for pharmaceutical delivery services. The MCO must implement a process to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP Members receive free outpatient pharmaceutic al deliveries from community retail pharmacies in their Service Areas, or through other methods approved by HHSC. Mail order delivery is not an appropriate substitute for delivery from a qualified community retail pharmacy unless requested by the Member. The MCO's process must be approved by HHSC, submitted using HHSC's template, and include all qualified community retail pharmacies identified by HHSC. 8.1.21.13 Health Resources and Services Administration 340B Discount Drug Program The MCO must use a shared- savings approach for reimbursing Network Providers that participate in the federal Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA's) 340B discount drug program. The MCO through its Provider Contract must require a 340B -covered entity seeking to use 340B stock to contract with the MCO as a 340B pharmacy and accept the payment terms of the MCO's shared- savings model. If the 340B covered entity does not accept the terms of the MCO's shared savings model for the reimbursement of 340B -purchased drugs, then the MCO may contract with the covered entity as a retail pharmacy. If the covered entity contracts with the MCO as a retail pharmacy, the MCO must prohibit the entity from using 340B -purchased drugs. The MCO cannot require a Network Provider to submit its actual acquisition cost (AAC) on outpatient drugs and biological products purchased through the 340B program, consistent with UMCM Chapter 2. In addition, the MCO cannot impose PA requirements based on non -preferred status (\"PDL PAs\") for these drugs and products.

In addi tion, the MCO must comply with Sections 8.2.1 (Medicaid) and 8.4.3 (CHIP) regarding payment of out-of-network pharmacy claims. HHSC will provide the MCO or its designee with pharmacy interface files, including formulary, PDL, third party liability, master provider, and drug exception files. Due to the point -of-sale nature of outpatient pharmacy benefits, the MCO must ensure all applicable MIS systems (including phar macy claims adjudication systems) are updated to include the data provided in the pharmacy interface files. The MCO must update MIS systems within two B usiness Days of the pharmacy interface files becoming available through HHSC's file transfer process, unless clarification is needed or data/file exceptions are identified. The MCO must notify HHSC within the same two Business Days if clarification or data/file exceptions are needed. Additionally, the MCO must be able to perform off - cycle formulary and PDL updates at HHSC's request. The MCO must ensure that all daily enrollment and eligibility files in the Joint Interface Plan are loaded into the pharmacy claims adjudication system within two D ays of receipt. 8.1.21.15 Pharmacy Audits The MCO and its PBM are prohibited from using extrapolation in pharmacy audits. 8.1.21.16 E-Prescribing The MCO must provide the appropriate data to the national e- prescribing network, which at a minimum will support: el igibility confirmation, PDL benefit confirmation, identification of preferred drugs that can be used in place of non- preferred drugs (\"alternati ve drugs\"), medication history, and prescription routing. 8.1.21.17 This Section Intentionally Left Blank Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) The MCO must make reasonable efforts to include FQHCs and RHCs (freestanding and Hospital -based) in its Provider Network. The MCO must pay full encounter rates to RHCs for Medically Necessary Covered Services using the prospective payment methodology described in Sections 1902(bb) and 2107(e)(1) of the Social Security Act. Because the MCO is responsible for the full payment amount in effect on the date of service for RHCs, cost settl ements (or \"wrap payments\") will not apply. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-181 When the MCO negotiates payment amounts with FQHCs for Medically Necessary Covered Services provided to its Members, the amounts must be greater than or equal to the average of the MCO's payment terms for other Providers providing the same or similar services. Because the MCO may negotiate payment amounts with FQHCs, wrap payments apply. MCOs may elect to pay the FQHC wrap payment at the time of claim adjudication bu t no later than the 15th D ay of the following month for claims paid in the prior month. After the MCO pays a wrap payment, HHSC will make a supplemental payment to the MCO in the amount of the wrap payment by the last Day of the following month . If a Membe r visits an FQHC, RHC, or a Municipal Health Department's public clinic (public clinic) for Health Care Services at a time that is outside of regular business hours, the MCO must reimburse the FQHC, RHC, or public clinic for Medically Necessary Covered Services. The MCO must do so at a rate that is equal to the allowable rate for those servi ces as determined under Tex. Hum. Res. Code \u00a732.028. The MCO must not require a referral from the Member's PCP. In this context, regular business hours has the meaning given to it in 1 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7353.2, as required by 1 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7353.407. If a Member visits an Out -of-Network Indian Health Care Provider (IHCP) enrolled as an FQHC, for Medically Necessary Covered Services , the MCO must reimburse the OON IHCP a full encounter rate as if the P rovider were a Network Provider . This encounter rate is paid entirely as a wrap payment no later than the 15th D ay of the following month for services provided in the prior month. After the MCO pays a wrap payment, HHSC will make a supplemental payment to the MCO in the amount of the wrap payment by the last Day of the following month. An FQHC's Out -of-Network claim is subject to the same claim standards requirements as the MCO's N etwork Providers. Payment by Members. Except as provided in Section 8.1.23.1 , MCOs, Network Providers, and Out -of-Network Providers are prohibited from billing or collecting any amount from a Member for Covered Services. However, the STAR+PLUS MCO will work with Members or their representatives to help facilities collect applied income where applicable. MCOs must also inform Members of their responsibility to pay the costs for non -covered services, and must require its Network Prov iders to: 1. inform Members of costs for non -covered services prior to rendering such services; and 2. obtain a signed private pay form from such Members. 8.1.23.1 Cost Sharing CHIP Network Providers and Out -of-Network Providers may collect copayments authorized in the CHIP State Plan from CHIP Members. Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-182 CHIP families that meet the enrollment period cost share limit requirement must report it to the HHSC Adm inistrative Services Contractor. The HHSC Administ rative Service Contractor notifies the MCO that a family's cost share limit has been reached. Upon notification from the HHSC Administrative Services Contractor that a family has reached its cost -sharing li mit for the term of coverage, the MCO will generat e and mail to the CHIP Member a new Member ID card within five Days, showing that the CHIP Member's cost-sharing obligation for that term of coverage has been met. No cost -sharing may be collected from the se CHIP Members for the balance of their term of coverage. Providers are responsible for collecting all Member copayments at the time of service. Copayments that families must pay vary according to their income level. Copayments do not apply, at any incom e level, to Covered Services that qualify as well- baby and well -child care services, preventive services, or pregnancy -related services as defined by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7457.520 and S ocial Security Act \u00a7 2103(e)(2) . Except for costs associated with unauthorized non- emergency services provided to a Member by Out -of-Network providers and for non -covered services, the copayments outlined in the CHIP Cost Sharing Table in UMCM Chapter 6 are the only amounts that an MCO may impose and a provider may collect from a CHIP -eligible family. If the cost of a Covered Service is less than the Member's CHIP copayment for that Covered Service, the copayment amount the Member pays will be capped at t he cost of the Covered Service. As required by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 457.515, this includes, without limitation, Emergenc y Services that are provided at an Out -of-Network facility. Cost sharing for such Emergency Services is limited to the copayment amounts set for th in the CHIP Cost Sharing Table. If the MCO would have paid a lesser amount than the CHIP copayment in the absence of a CHIP copayment, then the copayment amount will be capped at the lesser amount. Federal law prohibits charging premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or any other cost -sharing to Members of Native Americans or Alaskan Natives. The HHS C Administrative Services Contractor will notify the MCO of Members who are not subject to cost sharing requirements. The MCO is responsible for educating Providers regarding the cost sharing waiver for this population. An MCO's monthly Capitation Payment will not be adjusted for a family's failure to make its CHIP premium payment. There is no relationship between HHSC's Capitation Payment to the M CO for coverage provided during a month and the family's payment of its CHIP premium obligation for that month. Cost sharing does not apply to CHIP Perinatal Program Members. The exemption from cost sharing applies through the end of the enrollment period. As of the Effective Date of the Contract, cost sharing does not apply to Medicaid Members. If HHSC imp lements cost -sharing for Medicaid Members after the Effective Date of this Contract, the requirements of this section will apply, and H HSC will amend Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-183 the UMCM to include Medicaid Cost Sharing Tables. Except for costs associated with unauthorized non -emerg ency services provided to a Member by Out -of-Network providers and for non- covered services, the Medicaid copayments outlined in the UMC M will be the only amounts that an MCO may impose and a provider may collect from a Medicaid- eligible family. Immunizations The MCO must educate Providers on the Immunization Standard Requirements set forth in Tex. Health and Safety Code, Chapter 161 ; the standards in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Immunization Schedule; the AAP Periodicity Schedule for CHIP Members; and the ACIP Immunization Schedule for Medicaid Members. The MCO must educate Providers that Medicaid Members bir th through age 20 must be immunized during the Texas Health Steps checkup according to the ACIP routine immunizat ion schedule.

The MCO must educate Providers about the importance of including documentation for immunizations in the Member's medical record, and the necessity of the Provider's documentation to support a qualification for reimbursement for appropriate provision of immunizations to eligible Members. The MCO must educate Providers about, and require Providers to comply with, the requirements of Tex . Health and Safety Code Chapter 161, relating to the Texas Immunization Registry (ImmTrac 2), to include parental consent on the Vaccine Information Statemen t. The MCO must notify Medicaid and CHIP Providers that they may enroll, as applicable, as Texas Vaccines for C hildren Providers. In addition, the MCO must work with HHSC and Providers to improve the reporting of immunizations to the statewide ImmTrac 2 registry. Dental Coverage The MCO is not responsible for reimbursing dental providers for preventive and therapeutic dental services obtained by Medicaid or CHIP Members, with the exception of the dental services available to STAR+PLUS Members in the enrol led in the HCBS STAR+PLUS Waiver. However, medical and/or Hospital charges, such as anesthesia, that are necessary in order for Medicaid or CHIP Members to access standard therapeutic dental services, are Covered Services for Medicaid or CHIP Members. The MCO must provide access to facilities and physician services that are necessary to support the dentist who is providing dental services to a Medicaid or CHIP Member under general anes thesia or intravenous (IV) sedation. Medicaid medical benefits also prov ide for coverage of some dental related emergency service s including but not limited to dislocated jaw, traumatic damage to teeth and Contractual Document (CD) Subject: Attachment B -1 - Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Services RFP, Section 8 Version 2.38 8-184 supporting structures, removal of cysts, treatment of oral abscess of tooth or gum origin, treatment and devices for correction of craniofacial anomalies, and drugs. NEMT Services necessary for a Member to access Medicaid dental services are coordinated by the MCO. The CHIP medi cal benefit provides limited emergency dental coverage for dislocated jaw, traumatic damage to teet h, and removal of cysts; treatment of oral abscess of tooth or gum origin; treatment and devices for craniofacial anomalies; and drugs. The MCO must inform Network facilities, anesthesiologists, and PCPs what authorization procedures are required, and how Providers are to be reimbursed for the preoperative evaluations by the PCP and/or anesthesiologist and for the facility services.
