Assessment of the relationship betweenatypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increasedbackground risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetesmellitus in the general population. Given this confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychoticuse and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiologicalstudies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patientstreated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events inpatients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factor for diabetes mellitus(e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsyhotics shouldundergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Anypatient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia includingpolydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia duringtreatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases,hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however some patientsrequired continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. PBKD 161 \"Use of Thiomersal Test Drug Control Authority' seperti Kingdom Children and Adolescents Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of an antidepressant in a child or adolescent for any clinical use must balance the risk of increased suicidality with the clinical need. Patients who are started on therapy should be observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Famillies and caregivers should be advised to closely observe the patient and to communicate with the prescriber. A statement regarding whether the particular drug is approved for any pediatric indication(s) and, if emerging information, including preliminary reports from one of several long term National Institutes of Health (NIH) prevention studies, the risk of cardiovascular events (composite endpointincluding MI, CVA and death) may be increased in patients receiving Celebrex. Subsequently, the DCAwill be analyzing all available information from these studies to determine whether additional regulatoryaction is needed. are currently taking naproxen products should be advised to carefully follow the instructions on the label and not to exceed the recommended doses for naproxen (220 milligrams twicedaily).

Restructuring of the organisation of NPCB was carried out in June 2004with the objective of strengtheningand streamlining the managementsystem to ensure that the workprocess is more focussed andefficient, thus leading towardsexcellent delivery of services to ourclients. New sections and units wereestablished to reflect the specificduties and processes of regulatorysystem practised in NPCB. In line with the directive for implementation of e-government,NPCB launched an online registrationsystem (Quest 2) in the year 2002 forregistration of cosmetics and this wasextended for registration of traditionalmedicines in January 2004. NPCBpractised an open door policy duringthe implementation of the onlineregistration system wherebydialogues were held with the relevantindustries and a taskforce committeewas established together with thevarious sectors of the industry toobtain valuable feedback in which toimprove the Quest 2 system. I wouldlike to express my heartfeltappreciation to the industryrepresentatives for their cooperationand assistance in making the Quest 2 online registration system a reality. One of the achievements of NPCB that I treasure most is the successfulcertification of MS ISO 9001 version2000 Quality Management since 13thAugust 2003. In the reassessmentaudit conducted by SIRIM QAS Sdn.Bhd. in August 2004, no non-conformance reports (NCRs) wereissued by the auditors. This successreflects the total commitment by thetop management and staff towardsimplementing the philosophy andrequirements of the MS ISO 9001version 2000 in their managementsystem. NPCB will continue to play an active role both regionally and globally in allfields of regulatory control, includingthose organised by WHO and otherbodies such as the EC-ASEANEconomic Cooperation. NPCB has played a leading role in activities involving harmonisationrequirements of regulatory controlamongst ASEAN countries forpharmaceuticals, traditionalmedicines & health supplements andcosmetics. As a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme(PIC/S), NPCB was honoured to beinvited to participate in GoodManufacturing Practice jointinspections as this also indicates therecognition of the GMP inspection system practised in Malaysia.Furthermore, as a WHO CollaboratingCentre for pharmaceutical regulatorycontrol, NPCB participated in severalprogrammes organised by the WHOand also conducted training for WHOfellows in 2004 from variouscountries. Although we have had many successful achievements in the past,NPCB will not rest on its laurels butwill continue to strive towards furtherimprovements in the future. I wouldlike to express my heartfeltappreciation and gratitude to all thestaff of NPCB for their dedication andhard work in 2004. I am positive thatthey will continue in their quest forgreater heights in excellence in theyears ahead and to propel NPCB inachieving its goals of excellent serviceto both the nation and mankind. Lastbut not least I wish to thank the topmanagement of the Ministry of HealthMalaysia especially the Director ofPharmaceutical Services for theirguidance and support given to NPCBthroughout 2004.

In2004, a total of 42,311 products hadbeen registered compared to theprevious year (2003), which was atotal of 6,669 products. Thissignificant increase is due to theincrease in applications received forregistration of cosmetics at the end of2003, and the shorter evaluationprocess. Breakdown of productsregistered between 2000 and 2004 isshown in Table 3. Status of Applications Rejected In the last 5 years, from 2000 to 2004 a total of 824 applications wererejected, with an increase in thenumber for 2004 (446) compared tothe previous year. This increase is due to the increase in the number ofapplications for cosmetics (298) thathad been rejected because of noncompliance to the registrationrequirements.

This consist of 414(17.8%) prescription drugs; 516(22.3%) OTC products and 1387 (59.9%) traditional medicines (Table5). The cancellation of productregistration is mainly due to safetyissues and non compliance to theregistration requirements. Appeal The number of appeals received in 2004 was 69 compared to 29 in theprevious year. This increase is in linewith the increased number ofapplications being rejected. New Drugs (previously known as New Chemical Entity) From the year 2000 to 2004, the total number of applications received fornew drugs (previously known as newchemical entity) was 415 (Figure 1) ofwhich 348 (83.9%) were approved,35 (8.4%) rejected and 28 (6.7%)deferred as additional information wasrequired.

The vast difference in thenumber reported in the year 2003when compared with 2004 was dueto the fact that each laboratoryreported the number of analyticalprotocols they evaluated which wasthen totalled. This practice gaveartificially inflated figures as there wasduplication, one protocol might becounted more than once. Thismethod of reporting was corrected in2004 when the laboratory servicesunit was given the task ofcoordinating the evaluation ofprotocol analysis in CQC. Thus, thereis no duplication in the number ofevaluations reported as happened inthe year 2003. The number of analytical protocols evaluated within the targeted NPCB'sQuality Assurance Program (QAP)indicator (of not less than 90% withina month) decreased from 95.3%(2003) to 73.9% in the year 2004. Themain factor contributing to the declinein the performance of this indicator isthe implementation of the onlineregistration system (Quest 2) in 2004.With this system, all evaluations of analytical protocols have to be donevia the online system which gave riseto a few problems such as:- a. The evaluator has to adapt to reading documents on the computer screen and this prolonged time needed to dothe evaluation. b. Evaluation can only be done during office hours c. Breakdown in the QUEST 2 system which was quitecommon in 2004 due to teething problems with thenew system. Reference Standards One hundred and thirty-seven (137) vials of ASEAN reference standardsworth RM20,550 and 380 vials ofNPCB reference standards worth RM38,000 were sold to localpharmaceutical industries andabroad. Each vial of NPCB referencestandard was charged at RM100 andASEAN reference standard at RM150.

Assessment of the relationship betweenatypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increasedbackground risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetesmellitus in the general population. Given this confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychoticuse and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiologicalstudies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patientstreated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events inpatients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factor for diabetes mellitus(e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsyhotics shouldundergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Anypatient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia includingpolydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia duringtreatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases,hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however some patientsrequired continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. DCA 161 \"Use of Thiomersal in Vaccines - An Update\" 5.8.2004 The DCA has taken into account that the latest epidemiological research showed no relation of thiomersal-containing-vaccine causing specific neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, the DCA has decided the following: (i) Thiomersal can be considered in being used as a preservative in vaccines.(ii) Vaccines registration application, which has thiomersal content, will be evaluated case by case while taking into account product efficacy and general health needs. (iii) Products with thiomersal content have to be accompanied with a label and warning stating 'risk of sensitization in relation to thiomersal and other preservatives'. (iv) In accordance with the global aim of reducing exposure to mercury, vaccine preparations without thiomersal or minimum thiomersal content is encouraged. Product Authentication : the use of \"security label (Meditag)\" - Syarikat Mediharta Sdn Bhd. The DCA acknowledged the decision of Our Honorary Health Minister to approve the proposal to usehologram labels on registered products.This is due to the concern of the Government in respect of counterfeit, imitation and unregistered productsbeing manufactured or imported and sold, and in an effort to streamline the manufacture, import and saleof genuine products. The requirement for the affixation of this security device (called the MeditagTM) to product labels, is only applicable to pharmaceuticals, including OTC external personal care products, traditional products and health supplements. Cosmetics are currently excluded from the excercise. Implementation on the use of the hologram label will be carried out in 2 phases. 1. Phase 1 beginning 1st January 2005 for products which are non-parenterals (postponed to 1st May 2005 as decided in 164th meeting which was held on 4th November 2004) 2. Phase 2 from 1st July 2005 for parenterals/injectables However, products like vaccines and biologicals which are temperature sensitive and require cold chain maintenance are exempted from the requirement.Mediharta is responsible to conduct awareness programme on the hologram label for the Ministry of Healthpersonnel, the industries concerned and the consumers.86Annual Report .04Summary of Policies of the Drug Control Authority (DCA) Table 17 : Important decisions of the DCA in 2004 (continued) DCA MEETING POLICY DCA 161 Cadmium (Cd) in the Toxic Metal Tests for Traditional Products 5.8.2004 The DCA agreed on the following:(i) Cadmium test is included in the testing of traditional products whereby the limit for the test is 0.3mg/kg. This rule will come into effect from 1st January 2005. (ii) To accept the limit stated in Appendix 1 as the latest specification for Quality Control of Traditional Medicine Products. DCA 165 Proposal to take out `Hexylresorcinol' from the list of ingredients (active) not allowed to be 23.12.2004 registered by the Drug Control Authority'. The DCA decided that hexylresorcinol will be taken out from the List of Active ingredients Not Alllowed to be registered with the Drug Control Authority as stated in the Drug Registration Guidance Document. It wasdecided that the use of hexylresorcinol is permitted in all pharmaceutical preparations based on thefollowing reasons: (i) The documented reference (Martindale) no longer states that the substance causes irritation on the skin or oral mucosa EXCEPT at high concentrations. (ii) Hexylresorcinol Lozenges is a preparation that is included in the official monograph of the latest edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). (iii) Preparation containing hexylresorcinol had been registered and marketed in a number of countries such as Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States of America. (iv) Lozenges containing active substances from the same chemical group (PHENOLIC ANTISEPTICS) such as Amylmetacresol have already been registered in Malaysia. Additional Warnings : \"Suicidality in Children and Adolescents Treated with Antidepressants\". The DCA decided that i) Warning regarding \"Suicidality in Children and Adolescents Treated with Antidepressants\" should be included in the package inserts of all antidepressants products. The warnings are: Suicidality in Children and Adolescents Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of an antidepressant in a child or adolescent for any clinical use must balance the risk of increased suicidality with the clinical need. Patients who are started on therapy should be observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Famillies and caregivers should be advised to closely observe the patient and to communicate with the prescriber. A statement regarding whether the particular drug is approved for any pediatric indication(s) and, if so, which one(s). ii) The registration holder needs to study the suitability of the medicines guides (MedGuides) as practised by the United States. The purpose of MedGuides is to provide information to the patient and caregiverson the suicidality adverse effects and this information should be given during treatment. MedGuidesmust be amended to suit its uses in Malaysia and should be revised by the DCA before beingdistributed.87National Pharmaceutical Control BureauSummary of Policies of the Drug Control Authority (DCA) Table 17 : Important decisions of the DCA in 2004 (continued) DCA MEETING POLICY DCA 165 New information regarding cardiovascular safety Celebrex (Celecoxib), Bextra (Valdecoxib) 23.12.2004 and Naproxen The DCA decided the following information for the above mentioned products;(i) CELEBREX:Based on emerging information, including preliminary reports from one of several long term National Institutes of Health (NIH) prevention studies, the risk of cardiovascular events (composite endpoint includingMI, CVA and death) may be increased in patients receiving Celebrex. Subsequently, the DCA will be analysing all available information from these studies to determine whether additional regulatory action isneeded. (ii) NAPROXEN: Patients who are currently taking naproxen products should be advised to carefully follow the instructions on the label and not to exceed the recommended doses for naproxen (220 milligrams twice daily). Naproxenshould not be taken for longer than ten days unless a physician directs otherwise. (iii) BEXTRA: Based on action taken by US FDA, the DCA has instructed the product registration holder to include a 'boxed warning' in the package insert about the risk of life-threatening skin reactions 'Steven-JohnsonSyndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis' & Cardiovascular Risks. Iressa: New finding from ISEL studyThe registration application of IRESSA was approved in the 150th DCA meeting but the findings of the ISEL Clinical Study showed that the efficacy could be doubted. Based on that study, it has been decided in the DCA meeting, these actions must be taken:a. To obtain the complete results of the clinical studies regarding the product. b. To obtain the relevant information and additional data due to the absence of the data regarding Caucasian or Oriental Patients. c.
