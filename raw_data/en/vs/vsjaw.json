WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515Notes Numbers in the tables may not sum to totals because of rounding. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing committee, and by appropriation act (which follows the structure of the enacted appropriation laws for 2006).Preface T his report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) satisfies the requirements of section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, as amended. The report, required on or before January 15 of each year, is intended to assist the Congress in determining the authorizing legislation that should be in place before it considers the regular appropriation bills for fiscal year 2007, which begins on October 1, 2006.

Authorizations of Appropriat ions Expiring on or Before September 30, 2006, by Appropriation Act 7Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations Overview Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is re- quired to report to the Congress: BAll programs and activities funded for the current fis-cal year for which authorizations for appropriations have expired and BAll programs and activities for which authorizations for appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year. That requirement is specified in section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The purpose of that provision is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legisla-tion that must be in place before the regular appropria-tion bills can be considered.\" 1 The Role of Authorizations The term \"authorization\" is used to describe two types of law. The first describes an \"organic\" or \"enabling\" statute, which creates a federal agency, establishes a federal pro- gram, prescribes a federal function, or sanctions a partic- ular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may continue the federal agency, program, or function indefinitely, or it may con- tinue it for only a specific period of time. Such an autho- rization may provide direct spending authority because it enables the agency to draw money from the Treasury to implement the statute, or it may simply specify a purpose for which a subsequent appropriation is made available. Although organic or enabling statutes, particularly those whose implementation depends on future appropriation action, are necessary for programs to operate, that type of authorization is not the focus of this report. Instead, this report focuses on the second type of law de- scribed by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision of law that authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the program or function established in the enabling statute. Such a provision constitutes guidance to the Con-gress regarding the amount of funding that will be neces-sary to implement an enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be cont ained in the enabling stat- ute or may be provided in a separate law. Such an autho-rization of appropriations ma y be for a specific dollar amount (definite authorization) or for \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefinite authorization) and may be per-manent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this re-port, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's au- thorization of appropriations has expired. This report does not address appropriations that have never been au- thorized. House and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19th cen- tury\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appropriations that are unauthorized. In both the House and the Senate, legislation containing unauthorized appropriations is subject to a point of order upon its con-sideration by either body. 2 However, House and Senate 1. From House Report 99-433, at 114 (1985), the conference report accompanying the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Con- trol Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report.2. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under it. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Senate.2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS rules are not self-enforcing. An individual Representative or Senator must raise a point of order for the rules to be enforced. If no Member raises a point of order, an unau- thorized appropriation may proceed through the legisla- tive process. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriations that have expired or will expire, it should not be considered definitive regarding the application of House or Senate rules. What constitutes an \"unauthorized appropriation\" under such rules is determined by the precedents ofthe House or Senate, and the applicability of those rules is determined by the respective Office of the Parliamen- tarian. In 2005, lawmakers enacted several multiyear authoriza- tions, including those for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA (through 2008), the De-partment of Justice (through 2009), and ground trans- portation programs (through 2009). In addition, law- makers enacted a number of statutes that extended authorizations through 2006, including those for the De- partment of Defense and intelligence activities. Lawmak- ers also enacted a temporary authorization for higher ed-ucation programs (through March 31, 2006). Listings of Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations This report covers all programs funded through the an- nual appropriation process th at at one time had an ex- plicit authorization of appropriations that has expired or will expire this year. Appendix A lists programs that have received an appropriation for fiscal year 2006 but whose applicable authorization has expired. Appendix B lists programs whose authorization expires at or before the end of fiscal year 2006. The appendixes show the number and name of the public law containing the last authoriza-tion, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount authorized in that year. If the authorization was for \"such sums as may be necessary,\" the report shows the amount authorized as \"i ndefinite.\" In separate ver- sions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House autho- rizing committee, by Senate authorizing committee, and by appropriation act (which follows the structure of the enacted appropriation laws for 2006). 3The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Leg- islative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonp ermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the first session of the 109th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropria- tions committees, in their reports on general appropria-tion bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never been enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit au-thorization that either has expired or will expire. As men-tioned earlier, many laws establish programs with an au-thorization of appropriations that does not expire. Both the reports of the appropriations committees and this re-port exclude programs with that type of authorization be-cause its effect is permanent. Programs Funded in Fiscal Year 2006 with Expired Authorizations ofAppropriations Appendix A lists programs and activities funded by an ap- propriation for fiscal year 2006 whose authorization has expired. If the applicable 2006 appropriation law (or its legislative history) provides an explicit amount of funding for the program, that sum is shown under \"Unauthorized FY 2006 Appropriations.\" If no specific amount is pro- vided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account, or a program that is funded in several appropriation ac-counts), CBO determines whether the program is still be-ing funded and, if so, how much is allocated for it. If that amount cannot be determined, the appendix notes that the specific dollar amount of unauthorized 2006 appro-priations is not available (meaning that it is not specifi-cally identifiable). The Congress has appropriated about $159 billion for fis- cal year 2006 for programs and activities whose authori-zations of appropriations have expired (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). Several large authorizations of appropriations ex-pired at the end of 2005, including those for the Coast 3. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees adopted dif- ferent subcommittee structures for 2006. This report follows the structures used for the enacted appropriations.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 Guard (with 2006 appropriations of about $8 billion), Ryan White CARE grant programs ($2 billion), the Millennium Challenge Fund ($2 billion), and the Administration on Aging ($1.5 billion). The largest sin- gle unauthorized appropriation for 2006 is for veterans' medical care ($28.7 billion); that appropriation was last authorized for 1998.4 Other sizable programs with expired authorizations of appropriations include the Section 8 tenant-based housing assistance program (which was last authorized for 2003 and has funding for 2006 of $15.6 billion), foreign relations programs (last authorized in 2003 and funded in 2006 at $9.5 billion), and Head Start (last authorized in 2003 and funded in 2006 at $7.6 billion). Authorizations of Appropriations That Expire on or Before September 30, 2006 Appendix B lists programs and activities with authoriza- tions of appropriations that expire by the end of fiscal year 2006. It indicates the amounts authorized to be ap- propriated in 2006 for the expiring programs and activi- ties, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year. Definite authorizations contained in laws under the juris- diction of House and Senate authorizing committees that will expire by the end of this fiscal year total about $509 billion (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). Most of that amount (about $492 billion) is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Public Law 109-163), which also includes an authoriza- tion of funding for military activities in Iraq and Afghan- istan. Typically, authorizations for defense funding are re-newed annually. Authorizations for intelligence activities are also usually renewed each year. However, the Intelli- gence Authorization Act, 2006, has not yet been enacted. In the interim, lawmakers enacted section 8092 of the Defense Appropriations Act, 2006 (P .L. 109-148), which deems as authorized its appropriations for intelligence activities until the enactment of this year's intelligence authorization act. Thus, as in recent years, the total amount of expiring def- inite authorizations of appropriations this year is concen- trated in only a few laws. Of the 45 laws with authoriza-tions that expire this year, four account for over 99 percent of the year's expiring definite authorizations. Conversely, 19 laws have definite authorizations of $50 million or less; together, they make up less than 1 percent of the total amount of expiring definite authorizations. Several laws with indefinite authorizations expiring in 2006 involve public health matters, including the Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2002 and 2003 (Public Laws 107-251 and 108-163), the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P .L. 107-188), and some programs authorized by the Project Bioshield Act of 2004 (P .L.107-276). 4. Staff of the veterans' affairs committees and the Department of Veterans Affairs characterize the relevant authorizations\u2014in section 105 of Public Law 104-262\u2014as intended to be a cap on spending for veterans' medical care for 1997 and 1998 only. However, the medical care account is treated in this report as subject to an expired authorization of appropriations.4 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS Table 1.
