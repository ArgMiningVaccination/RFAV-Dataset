With the advent of pesticides, petroleum products, heavy metals and chemicals we are exposed to toxins our bodies can't easily metabolize or excrete. Instead our bodies store those into our fat cells for protection. As a result more people are becoming increasingly sick from exposure. Multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), cancers, autoimmune disease, and things as common as seasonal or animal allergies are all secondary to our under responsive overloaded bodies. Our bodies neurological, immune and endocrine function are what is primarily affected. The ability to detoxify our bodies is increasingly becoming a critical part of maintaining our health in this world, and no surprise it takes a bit of work from you to keep your body's channels clear. If our detoxification pathways are overloaded, then toxic metabolites accumulate, causing us to have increased sensitivity to our environment and poorer functioning of our body systems. The liver, kidneys, colon, lungs and skin are our organs of elimination. These are what we nurture when we do a detox program. The Program The goal of a detox is to optimize the excretion pathways while minimizing new exposures and ingestion of toxins. You can't control the air you breathe, but you can control the food you eat and improve the way you eliminate! This gives your body the best chance in this short period of time to eliminate as many toxins stored as possible! The basics: - Food - to minimize toxins in and maximize toxins out - Exercise - to promote lung function - Sweating - to promote skin function - Herbs - to promote liver function - Fiber - to promote colon function - Water - to promote kidney function How do you know this is right for you? A detox program can benefit anyone living in this toxic world. A yearly detoxification protocol is beneficial for anyone, and something I recommend for many of my ailing patients. A few indications for detoxification are: - allergies - arthritis - fibromyalgia - headaches - fatigue - autoimmune diseases - chronic conditions (sinus, skin, yeast infections) - constipation - obesity - depression/anxiety Heavy Metal Testing is also available for those who think they have had exposure in their past or recent past. Additional chelation protocols can be added to the detox to help bind and eliminate new and newly mobilized heavy metals in the body. "}
