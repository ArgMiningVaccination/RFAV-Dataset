How Do We Calculate the 96%? There is no official regulatory definition of \"natural\". So when defining our standard of natural, we follow the International Organization for Standardization (ISO*)'s guidelines and definitions. According to them, \"natural origin\" refers to ingredients that are more than 50% from natural sources (i.e., plants or minerals). Based on this definition, on average, our washes, lotions, and shampoo formulas are 96% of natural origin. *as per ISO 16128-1:2016 based on average cumulative volume including water Why Not 100%? Natural ingredients aren't always safe for your baby or child in their purest, most natural form. So before we add them to our products, we put them through a series of steps in order to: - Remove Impurities - Improve Touch & Feel - Enhance Performance & Safety - Reduce Malodor or Discoloration What About the Other 4%? We may choose to use synthetic ingredients in our products for their specific benefits, including: To Prevent Mold and Bacteria Growth Preservatives are added to produce safe and high-quality formulas for use on your baby's delicate skin. To Balance pH Levels Citric acid and sodium hydroxide balance the pH levels of our products with the pH of your baby's skin and hair \u2014critical for functioning skin enzymes, skin repair processes and protection against infection. To moisturize skin and condition hair Skin conditioning agents help to nourish skin, while hair conditioning and antistatic agents help to keep hair hydrated and healthy. To Prevent Oxidation & the Creation of Free Radicals Vitamins and antioxidants help to keep your baby's skin and hair safe. To Help Sensorial Development (and Make Bath Time Fun) Fresh, gentle scents are incorporated. While there may be natural alternatives to the above, each comes with a trade-off. For example, some plant-based ingredients like essential oils often introduce higher levels of allergens.
