To catch up on these lags, the government launched the National Child Immunisation Month (BIAN) under the world immunisation week framework.Around 800,000 children across Indonesia are at higher risks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, measles, rubella, and polio. Latest data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health (MoH) show significant decline in primary immunisation coverage since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 84.2% in early 2020 to 79.5% in 2021.Various factors result in this decline, including disruptions to supply chain, activities restrictions, and overstretched health workers, causing suspension of some vaccination services at the peak of the pandemic.A 2020 survey by MoH and UNICEF also found around half of parents and caregivers surveyed would be reluctant to take their children to health care facilities over concerns of COVID-19 infection or low compliance with health protocols.Now the government is trying to improve this situation. To complete their immunisation series, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin urges parents and caregivers to take their children to primary health care clinics (puskesmas), integrated service posts (posyandu), and other health care facilities during the BIAN.\"We hope the momentum of the world immunisation raise the spirit of health workers, the public and regional governments, and development partners in implementing immunisation programmes for the sake of healthy and quality Indonesian families,\" he said in Jakarta, Saturday (16/4).Phase I of BIAN will commence in May 2022 in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Papua. Phase II will take place in August 2022 in Java and Bali.During the BIAN period, one dose of measles-rubella immunisation will be offered to target recipients as recommended locally, regardless of immunisation history. One or more immunisations will be offered to complete immunisation in children under 5.UNICEF representative Robert Gass said a set of health and safety guidelines were available and health workers had been trained in ensuring families would be able to take their children safely to health care facilities to receive immunisation.\"We urge all parents to check their children's immunization cards to ensure they are up to date with all their vaccines. No child should suffer from serious illness that can be prevented by vaccines,\" he said.Globally, vaccination saves more than five lives every minute and prevents up to three million deaths every year. This puts vaccination among the most significant advancements in global health and development.WHO Representative to Indonesia, Dr. N. Paranietharan added that vaccinated children were not only healthier but also better placed for stronger academic achievements as well as for contributing to the economic life of the public.\"Vaccines approved by WHO are safe and scientifically proven to be effective in preventing diseases such as measles, rubella, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus. Without all these vaccines, your children may unnecessarily suffer these dangerous diseases, and some may die\", he said.This press release has been published in the Ministry of Health news channel:https://sehatnegeriku.kemkes.go.id/baca/rilis-media/20220418/0639676/cakupan-imunisasi-anak-rendah-akibat-covid-19-pemerintah-atasi-dengan-bulan-imunisasi-anak-nasional/", "sitename": "World Health Organization: WHO", "date": "2022-04-19", "cleaned_text": "Around 800,000 children across Indonesia are at higher risks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, measles, rubella, and polio.
