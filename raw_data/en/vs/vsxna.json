SUMMARY The Livingston County Community Health-Needs Assessment is a collaborative undertaking by OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center to highlight the health needs and well being of residents in Livingston County. Through this needs assessment, collaborative community partners have identified numerous health issues impacting individuals and families in the Livingston County region. Several themes are prevalent in this health-needs assessment - the demographic composition of the Livingston County region, the predictors and prevalence for diseases, leading causes of mortality, accessibility to health services and healthy behaviors. Results from this study can be used for strategic decision -making purposes as they directly relate to the health needs of the community. The study was designed to assess issues and trends impacting the communities served by hospitals, as well as perceptions of targeted stakeholder groups. Specifically, this assessment provides a detailed analysis of: (1) Livingston County area community health needs using secondary data; and (2) an asse ssment of perceptions and behaviors regarding health-related challenges in the community, including accessibility to needed health care. PHASE I - USE OF SECONDARY DATA TO IDENTIFY NEEDS Chapters 1-5 include a detailed analysis of secondary data to assess information regarding the health status of the community. In order to perform these analyses, information was collected from numerous secondary sources, including publically available sources as well as private sources of data. Strategic implications are discussed at the end of eac h chapter. Specifically, Phase I of the study highlights several critical areas of community needs: Demographics - With the changing demographics, forecasts indicate increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and obesity. Three specific demographic trends in the region will have a significant impact on health issues, including: Elderly Population - Individuals aged 60-64 increased from 4.8% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2010 and individuals aged 65-74 increased from 6.8% to 7.6% between 2007 and 2010. Overall, individuals aged 62 and over increased from 15.0% to 15.6% in Livingston County. Poverty - Families living in poverty increased moderately between 2007 (8.1%) and 2010 (9.1%). For 2010, the Livingston County median household income ($51,336) is slightly less than the State of Illinois median household income ($52,972). Accessibility to Health Care - The lack of insurance coverage is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups that are often at high risk for d isease and illness. Thus, a vicious cycle results where individuals who are at the highest risk for diseases are unable to receive screenings, thus perpetuating a cycle of disease. This is compounded b y unhealthy lifestyles. Obesity - There was a 16% growth in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (34.6%) and 2009 (40.2%). For comparison, there was a 11 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 9% growth in the percentage of Illinois residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (24.7%) and 2009 (26.8%). Risky Behavior - Youth substance usage in Livingston County exceeds the State of Illinois averages for 12th graders (alcohol and tobacco usage). Mental Health -- Approximately 20% of residents in Livingston County reported they had experienced 1-7 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was below the state average for the same time frame. Women's Health - While the percentage of women who report the time since their last mammogram was more than one year ago is lower in Livingston County than in the State of Illinois (33.8% vs. 43.6%), growth rates for this category are higher in Livingston County. There was a 48% growth in the percentage of Livingston County female residents reporting the time since their last pap smear was more than one year between 2006 (20.9%) and 2009 (30.9%). For comparison, there was a 27% growth in the percentage of Illinois res idents reporting the time since their last pap smear was more than one year between 2006 (20.7%) and 2009 (26.2%). Rates in Livingston County now exceed the State of Illinois average. According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), 86.8% of Livingston County female residents report they have ever had a clinical breast exam. This figure is lower than the State of Illinois average (89.9%). Men's Health - There was a 4% decrease in the percentage growth of Livingston County male residents over age 40 reporting they had ever had PSA test between 2006 (62.0%) and 2009 (59.5%). For comparison, there was an 8% growth in the percentage of Illinois male residents over age 40 reporting they had ever had a PSA test between 2006 (57.7%) and 200 9 (62.4%). Rates in Livingston County are now below the State of Illinois average. Morbidity Issues - Several different diseases have seen significant growth between 2008 -2011. Asthma - Asthma rates in Livingston County now exceed the State of Illinois. Moreover, growth rates for asthma are higher in Livingston County (14% increase between 2006 and 2009) than in the State of Illinois (2% increase between 2006 and 2009). Diabetes - There was an increase in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were informed they had Type II diabetes between 2006 (7.9%) and 2009 (10.2%). Diabetes in Livingston County exceeds the State of Illinois. Hypertension - There was a significant increase in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were informed they had high cholesterol between 2006 (23.3%) and 2009 (29.8%). 12 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Cardiovascular Disease - The number of cases of other cardiovascular diseases at hospitals from the Livingston County region has increased nearly 27%, however absolute numbers are small. Mortality - The leading causes of death include diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasm and coronary heart disease. PHASE II - COLLECTION, ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF PRIMARY DATA A comprehensive understanding of targeted stakeholders was completed in Chapters 6-9. Specifically, it was important to understand how \"at risk\" or economically disadvantaged people perceived: (1) relative importance of health issues; (2) relative importance of unhealthy behaviors; (3) access to health care, dental care, counseling and prescription medications. Through this type of research, opportunities were identified for improving how community health needs are addressed; and insights into how perceptions are affected by demographic characteristics. Critical findings include: Misperceptions of community health issues - Inconsistencies exist between people's perception of health issues and actual data. Based on results from the survey, respondents incorrectly perceived \"diabetes ,\" \"heart disease,\" \"teen pregnancy,\" and \"dental\" as being relatively less important health concerns to the community. These results conflict with: morbidity data that suggest diabetes growth rates in Livingston County are higher than growth rates across the State of Illi nois; mortality data that indicates heart disease is the leading cause of death in Livingston County; teen pregnancy rates in Livingston County (11.9%) that exceed the State of Illinois rate (9.6%) for 2009; and the aforementioned dental data suggesting nearly 22.3% of Livingston County residents have not seen a dentist in two or more years. Perceptions of the importance of access to health services - Access to health services is rated as one of the highest determinants to quality of life across all categ ories. Access to Medical Services - Several issues relating to health service access were identified. Choice of Medical Care - Only 54% of people living in deep poverty seek medical services at a clinic or doctor's office. For this segment of the populat ion, it is very common to seek medical services from an emergency department, or even more concerning is that 9% of this segment of the population will not seek any medical services at all. Access to Medical Care and Prescription Medications - Over 40% of the population living in deep poverty indicated there was a time in the last year when they were not able to get medical care when needed. The leading causes were lack of insurance and inability to afford a copayment or deductible. Similar results were f ound for access to prescription medication. 13 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Access to Dental Care - While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous diseases, including heart disease, less than 50% of the aggregate Livingston County population had a checkup in the last year. Specifically, younger respondents, Black ethnicity, less educated people and the homeless were less likely to visit a dentist. Access to Counseling -- Approximately 30% of people living in deep poverty indicated they were not able to get counseling when they needed it over the last 12 months. Leading indicators are younger people, Black ethnicity and homelessness. While affordability and insurance were the leading reasons, fear and embarrassment were also significant. Access to Information - Across categories, residents of the Livingston County area get most of their medical information from doctors and the next most prevalent is the Internet. Type of Insurance -The most prevalent type of insurance in Livingston County is private or commercial; however, those living in poverty and Livingston County residents are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid. Also for those living in poverty, 40% do not have any type of insurance at all. Healthy Behaviors - Several issues relating to healthy behaviors were identified. Physical Exercise -Younger people and educated people are more likely to engage in physical exercise, while homeless residents are not. Although only 10% of the population engages in exercise at least 5 times a week. Healthy Eating - Only 7% of the population consumes at least the minimum recommended servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Those that are more likely to have healthy eating habits include people with higher education and more income. Decrease Smoking - Smoking is on the decline, however, 35% of Livingston County residents living in poverty smoke 5 or more cigarettes per day Self-Perceptions of Health - In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, over 91% of the population indicated that they were in a verage or good physical health. Similar results were found for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. PHASE III - PRIO RITIZATION OF HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES The identification and prioritization of the most important health-related issues in the Livingston County region are identified in Chapter 10. After summarizing all of the issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which health-related issues were being addressed. Finally, a collaborative team of leaders in the healthcare community used an importance/urgency methodology to identify the most critical issues in the area, including: o Obesity o Risky Behavior-Substance Abuse o Healthy Behavior/Nutrition o Mental Health 14 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment o Community Health Misperceptions o Dental Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude to the community; (2) strategic importance to the community; (3) existing community resources; (4) potential for impact; and (5) trends and future forecasts. 15 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment I. INTRODUCTION Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), enacted March 23, 2010 adds new requirements on tax-exempt hospitals to conduct community health -needs assessments and to adopt implementation strategies to meet the community health needs identified through the assessments. This community health-needs assessment (CHNA) takes into account input from specific individuals who represent the broad interest of the community served by OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. For this study, a community health-needs assessment is defined as a systematic process involving the community, to identify and analyze community health needs and assets in order to prioritize these needs, and to plan and act upon unmet community health needs. Results from this assessment will be made widely available to the public. The structure of the CHNA is based on standards used by the Internal Revenue Service to develop Form 990, Schedule H-Hospitals, designated solely for tax-exempt hospitals. The fundamental areas of the community needs assessment are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1. Community Needs Assessment Framework 16 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment The community health-needs assessment is divided into three distinct phases. Phase I focuses on collection of existing secondary data relating to a comprehensive health profile and drawing strategic inferences. Phase II focuses on primary data collection to assess perspectives of key stakeholders, including those with special knowledge of the health community. Primary data collection includes a concerted effort to target the at-risk population in the region. Phase III focuses on the prioritization of needs within the community. Design of the Collaborative Team: Community Engagement, Broad Representation and Special Knowledge In order to engage the entire community in the CHNA process, a collaborative team of health-professional experts and key community advocates was created. Members for the Collaborative team were carefully selected to ensure representation of the broad interests of the community. Specifically, team members included representatives from OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center, administrators from the County Health Department and Mental Health Services, a physician from a clinic serving the at-risk population, and a community advisory-board member. Note that numerous partner and agency organizations also participated in this study. Specific discussion of these organizations can be found in the METHODS section. Engagement occurred throughout the entire process, resulting in shared ownership of the assessment. The entire collaborative team met in November of 2012 and in February 2013.

Definition of the Community In order to determine the geographic boundaries for OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center, analyses were completed to identify what percentage of inpatient and outpatient activity was represented from Livingston County. Data show that Livingston County represents 78.5% of all patients for the hospital. In terms of patient categories for this CHNA, in addition to defining the community by geographic boundaries, this study will target the at-risk populations as an area of potential opportunity to improve the health of this population. Purpose of the Community Health-Needs Assessment In the initial meeting, the collaborative committee identified the purpose of this stu dy. Specifically, this study has been designed to provide necessary information to health -care organizations, including hospitals, clinics and the health departments, in order to create strategic plans in program design, access and delivery. Results of this study will act as the platform to allow health-care organizations to orchestrate limited resources to improve management of high- priority challenges. By working together, the hospitals, clinics and health departments will use this CHNA to help improve the quality of health care in the defined community. When feasible, data are assessed longitudinally to assess changes and patterns and benchmarked with state averages. 20 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment II. METHODS To complete the comprehensive community health-needs assessment, multiple sources were examined. Secondary statistical data were used for the first phase of the project. Additionally, based on a sample of 967 survey respondents from Livingston County, phase two focused on assessing perceptions of the community health issues, unhealthy behaviors, issues with quality of life, healthy behaviors and access to health care . Data were collected to as sess the importance of specific issues, as well as access to health care. Phase I. Secondary Data for Community Health Needs Assessme nt We first used existing secondary statistical data to develop an overall assessment of the health-related issues in the community. Note that several tables were aggregated from numerous data sources. For example, educational report-card tables were compiled by collecting information from numerous individual school report cards and combining aggregated data into these tables. Five chapters were completed based on assessment of secondary data. Each chapter contains numerous categories. Within each catego ry, there are specific sections , including definitions, importance of categories, data and interpretations. At the end of each chapter there is a section on the key strategic implications that can be drawn from the data. Note that most of the data used for this phase was acquired via publically available data sets. However, for specific sections of Chapter 2 and the majority of Chapter 4, the most recent data available were from 2009. Given a purpose of this assessment is to measure subsequent improvements to community health over time, using data that are three years old is not sufficient. Theref ore we used COMPdata from 2008-2012 for all of our disease categories. This required manual aggregation of data from the hospitals serving the Livingston County area. Based on several retreats , a separate OSF Collaborative Team identified six primary categories of diseases, including: age related, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, type 2 diabetes and infections. We also identified secondary causes of diseas es as well as intentional and unintentional injuries. In order to define each disease category, we used modified definitions developed by Sg2. Sg2 specializes in consulting for health care organizations. Their team of experts includes MDs, PhDs, RNs and health care leaders with extensive strategic, operational, clinical, academic, technological and financial experience. Phase II. Primary Data Collection This section describes the research methods used to collect, code, verify and analyze primary data. Three specific areas include the research design used for this study: survey design, data collection and data integrity. A. Survey Instrument Design Initially, all surveys used in previous health -needs assessments in the U.S. that we were able to identify were assessed to identify common themes and approaches to collecting community health-needs data. In all, 15 surveys were identified. By leveraging best practices from these surveys, we created our own pilot survey. To ensure that all critical areas w ere being addressed, the entire OSF collaborative team was involved in survey design/approval through 21 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment several fact-finding sessions. Specifically, for the community health need assessment, five specific areas were included: Ratings of health problems in the community - to assess the importance of various community health concerns. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as cancer, diabetes and obesity. In all, there were 20 choices provided for survey respondents. Ratings of unhealthy behaviors in the community - to assess the importance of various unhealthy behaviors. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as violence, drug abuse and smoking. In all, there were 14 choices provided for survey respondents. Ratings of issues with quality of life - to assess the importance of various issues relating to quality of life in the community. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as access to health care, safer neighborhoods and effective public transportation. In all, there were nine choices provided for survey respondents. Accessibility to health care - to assess the degree to which residents could have access to health care when needed. Survey items included areas assessing topics such as access to medical, dental and mental care, as well as access to prescription drugs. Healthy behaviors - to assess the degree to which residents exhibited healthy behaviors. The survey focused on areas such as exercise, healthy eating habits and smoking. Finally, demographic information was collected to assess background information necessary to segment markets in terms of the five categories discussed above. After the initial survey was designed, a pilot study was created to test the psychometric properties and statistical validity of the survey instrument. The pilot study was conducted at the Heartland Community Health Clinic's three facilities. The Heartland Clinic was chosen as it serves the at-risk population and also has a facility that serves a large percentage of the Hispanic population. A total of 130 surveys were collected. Results from the pilot survey revealed specific items to be included/excluded in the final survey instrument. Selection criteria for the final survey included validity, reliability and frequency measures based on responses from the pilot sample. Note that these surveys were not included in the final sample. A copy of the final survey is included in Appendix 1. B. Sample Size In order to identify our potential population, we first identified the percentage of the Livingston County population that was living in poverty. Specifically, we multiplied the population of the county by its respective poverty rate to identify the minimum sample size to study the at-risk population. Poverty rate for Livingston County was 11.0 percent. The populations used for the calculation was 38,885, yielding a total of 4,278 residents living in poverty in the Livingston County area. We assumed a normal approximation to the hypergeometric given the targeted sample size. n = (Nz2pq)/(E2 (N-1) + z2 pq 22 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment where: n = the required sample size N = the population size pq = population proportions (set at .05) z = the value that specified the confidence interval (use 95% CI) E =desired accuracy of sample proportions (set at +/- .05) For the total Livingston County area, the minimum sample size for those living in poverty was 353. Note that for aggregated analyses, an additional 269 random surveys were needed from those not living in poverty in order to identify and analyze general perspectives. In order to satisfy sampling requirements for both those living in poverty as well as aggregate perspectives, the data collection effort for this CHNA yielded a total of 967 usable responses. This met the threshold of the desired confidence interval. Final results for data collection yielded a total of 429 respondents living in poverty for this CHNA and data for the total aggregate population yielded a total of 967 usable responses. This met the threshold of the desired 95% confidence interval. Specifically, t hese numbers met the 99% confidence interval threshold for both the at-risk population and the aggregate population. C. Data Collection To collect data in this study, two techniques were used. First, an online version of the survey was created. Second, a paper version of the survey was distributed. In order to be sensitive to the needs of respondents, surveys stressed assurance of confidentiality and anonymity. Data for the survey was completed through collaborative efforts with the following organizations to target both the general populations, as well as the at -risk population: Pontiac Chamber of Commerce Pontiac Proud Pontiac Rotary Pontiac Kiwanis Dwight Rotary Fairbury Rotary Livingston Family Care Center Farm Bureau Livingston County Health Department Institute of Human Resources Futures Unlimited Mid-Central Community Action Showbus OSF Saint James Advisory Board and Foundation Council 23 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment LCSSU Livingston Co. area Nursing Homes PATH Livingston County Schools-thru regional superintendent Daily Leader WJEZ GLCEDC Dwight Main Street Pontiac Recreational Center Family Eye Care Livingston County Housing Authority Area Churches: St Mary Catholic Church 1st Methodist 1st Baptist 1st Lutheran Bible Church Food Pantries: St Vincent DePaul Food Pantry First Baptist Church Food Pantry Livingston County Food Pantry Christian Fellowship Food Pantry Cullom Food Pantry Salvation Army Note that since we specifically targeted the at -risk population as part of the data collection effort, this became a stratified sample, as we did not specifically target other groups based on their socio-economic status. However, when using convenience-sampling techniques, we made a concerted effort to assure randomness in order to mitigate potential bias in the sample. D. Data Int egrity Comprehensive analyses were performed to verify the integrity of the data for this research. Without proper validation of the raw data, any interpretation of results could be inaccurate and misleading if used for decision making. Therefore, severa l tests were performed to ensure that the data were valid. These tests were performed before any analyses were undertaken. Data were checked for coding accuracy, using descriptive frequency statistics to verify that all data items were coded correctly. This was followed by analyses of means and standard deviations and comparison of primary data statistics to existing secondary data. Additionally , for regression models, residual analyses were performed to ensure that the data met assumptions of the underlying models. Specifically, residuals were analyzed to make sure (1) the data were normally distributed, (2) no patterns existed among residuals (e.g., heteroscedasticity) and (3) no significant outliers biased the outputs. 24 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment E. Analytic Techniques In order to ensure statistical validity, we used several different analytic techniques to assess data. Specifically, frequencies and descriptive statistics were used for identifying patterns in residents' rating of various health concerns. Additionally appropr iate statistical techniques were used for identification of existing relationships between perceptions, behaviors and demographic data. Specifically, we used Pearson correlations, x 2 tests and tetrachoric correlations when appropriate, given characteristi cs of the specific data being analyzed. 25 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment PHASE I - SECONDARY DATA RESEARCH FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS In this section of the community health needs assessment, there are five chapters that assess different aspects of the general community as well as specific health-related issues. All of the information in this section is taken from secondary data sources. As described in the METHODS section, some data sources are publically available and other data sources are comprised of aggregated hospital data from 2012. The chapters are as follows: C HAPTER 1. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE CHAPTER 2. PREVENTION CHAPTER 3. SYMPTOMS /PREDICTORS CHAPTER 4. DISEASES /MORBIDITY CHAPTER 5. MORTALITY 26 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment CHAPTER 1. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE 1.1 Population Importance of the measure: Population data characterizes the individuals residing within the jurisdictional boundaries Livingston County. Population data provides an overview of population growth trends and builds a foundation for additional analysis of these data. 1.1.1 Population by Municipality The 2010 census of Livingston County indicated a population of 38,950 residents. Compared to the 2000 census of the Livingston County population, the 2010 census of the Livingston County population shows a decrease of 728 residents. The vast majority of residents departing from Livingston County in the last decade left Fairbury (-211), Streator (-141), and Dwight (-102).

Understanding the cultural diversity of communities is essential when considering health care infrastructure and service delivery systems. 1.2.1 Age As indicated in Table 1.2-1, individuals 65 to 74 years of age is the age group experiencing the strongest growth in Livingston County between 2007 and 2010, as this population increased from 6.8% of the population in 2007 to 7.6% of the population in 2010. Table 1.2-1 Age Distribution of Livingston County Region Residents, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 US Census; 2007 10 -\u00ad 14 15 -\u00ad 19 20 -\u00ad 24 25 -\u00ad 34 35 -\u00ad 44 45 -\u00ad 54 55 -\u00ad 59 60 -\u00ad 64 65 -\u00ad 74 75 -\u00ad 84 85 yrs and over Age Distribution of Livingston County Region Residents, 2010 vs. 2007 2010 2007 31 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment With the increase in the population of older individuals in Livingston County, the median age of residents has also increased. The median age of residents in Livingston County in 2010 was 39.9 compared to 39.5 in 2007. Table 1.2-2 Median Age of Residents in Livingston County Region, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 US Census; 2007 American Community Survey 39.9 39.5 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Median age (years) Median Age of Residents in Livingston County Region, 2010 vs. 2007 2010 2007 32 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Data from 2010 suggest an increase in the populations of youths and older adults. In Livingston County, the under 18 population increased sli ghtly from 22.2% to 22.5%. Table 1.2-6 Population of Livingston County Under 18 Years of Age, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 US Census; 2007 of Livingston County Under 18 Years of Age, 2010 vs. 2007 33 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment The national trend concerning the aging of the baby-boomer population is reflected in the 2010 data for the Livingston County Region, as nearly 20% of the Livingston County population is over 62 years of age. Between 2007 and 2010, the percentage of old er adults, age 62 and over, decreased slightly from 18.1% of the population in 2007 to 17.9% of the population in 2010.

While data indicates that there were more women than men in 2007, data from 2010 suggests men slightly outnumber women. Table 1.2.2-1 Gender Distribution of Livingston County Region Residents, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 US Census; 2007 Gender Distribution of Livingston County Region Residents, 2010 vs. 2007 Female population Male population 35 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.2.3 Race With regard to race and ethnic background, the Livingston County Region is largely homogenous, yet in recent years is becoming more diverse. Data from 2010 suggest that Whites comprise upwards of 90% of the population in Livingston County. However, the non-White population of the Livingston County Region has been slowly increasing since 2007, with individuals identifying with Black or African American ethnicity comprising 4.5% of the population and individuals identifying with Hispanic ethnicity comprising nearly 4% of the population.

As indicated in Table 1.3-1, the number of family households within Livingston County decreased between 2007 and 2010. Table 1.3-1 Number of Family Households in Livingston County Region, 2007-2010 Source: 2010 US Family Households in Livingston County Region, 2007-\u00ad2010 37 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.3.1 /1.3.2 Single and Related Family In Livingston County, data from 2010 suggest a 2.2% increase from 2007 in the number of male households with no wife present. Between 2007 and 2010, the percentage of husband- wife families decreased in Livingston County by 0.4%. When children under the age of 18 are considered, there has been a decrease in the percentage of children living in a family comprised of a female householder only, with no husband present from 6.3% in 2007 to 5.8% in 2010.

Table 1.3.4-1: Births to Teenage Mothers in Livingston County Region vs. State of Illinois, 2009 vs. 2006 Source: Illinois Department of Illinois Births to Teenage Mothers in Livingston County Region vs. State of Illinois, 2009 vs. 2006 2009 2006 40 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.4 Economic information Importance of the measure: Median income divides households into two segments with one half of households earning more than the median income and the other half earning less. Because median income is not significantly impacted by unusually high or low-income values, it is considered to be a more reliable indicator than average income. To live in poverty means to not have enough income to meet one's basic needs. Accordingly, poverty is associated with numerous chronic social, health, education, and employment conditions. 1.4.1 Median income level For 2007 and 2010, the median household income in Livingston County lagged behind the State of Illinois median household income. Table 1.4.1-1: Median Household Income for Livingston County Region, 2007 vs. 2010 Source: 2007 & 2010 Illinois Median Household Income for Livingston County Region, 2007 vs. 2010 2010 2007 41 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.4.2 Unemployment For 2009 and 2010, the Livingston County Region unemployment rate was higher than the State of Illinois unemployment rate. Between 2007 and 2010, the unemployment steadily increased from 4.7% in 2007 to a peak of 10.6% in 2010. Data from 2011 suggests the unemployment rate in Livingston County was 8.9% compared to the overall State of Illinois unemployment rate of 9.8%. Table 1.4.2-1: Average Annual Unemployment Rate for Livingston County Region, 2007- 2011 Source: 2008 2007 Average Annual Unemployment Rate for Livingston County Region, 2007-\u00ad2011 Livingston County State of Illinois 42 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.4.3 Families in poverty Poverty has a significant impact on the development of children and youth. Poverty r ates are significantly higher for single-mother led households compared to married -couple f amilies and all families. In Livingston County, the percentage of all families living in poverty increased between 2007 and 2010. Table 1.4.3-1: Percentage of Families Living in Poverty in Livingston County, 2010 vs. 2007 Source: 2010 and 2007 of Families Living in Poverty in Livingston County Region, 2010 vs. 2007 All families Married-\u00adcouple families Female householder, no husband present 43 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 1.5 Education Importance of the measure: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, \"the better educated a person is, the more likely that person is to report being in 'excellent' or 'very good' health, regardless of income\" (NCES, 2005). Educational attainment and reading/math scores are well researched, with findings strongly related to an individual's propensity to earn a higher salary, gain better employment, and foster multifaceted success in life. As such, research suggests that the higher the level of educational attainment and the more successful children are in school, the better one's heath will be and the greater likelihood of one selecting healthy lifestyle choices. 1.5.1 3 rd/8th grade reading and math In 2012, most of the school districts in Livingston County had higher averages than the State of Illinois averages. However, four districts (Flanagan-Cornell, Pontiac, Tri-Point, and Woodland) scored lower than the State of Illinois 3rd grade reading average (76.1%). Table 1.5.1-1 Grade 3 Student Achievement in Livingston County 2012 Source: Illinois State Boar d of Education, School Year 2012 District Report Card Dist 74 Odell CCSD 435 Pontiac CCSD 429 Prairie CUSD 438 Tri Point CCSD 6-\u00adJ Woodland CUSD 5 Grade 3 Student Achievement in Livingston County 2012 2012 Reading 2012 Math 44 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Similar to the 3rd grade scores, most of the school districts in Livingston County had higher averages than the State of Illinois averages for 8th grade students. However, two districts (Odell and Tri-Point) scored lower than the State of Illinois 8th grade math average (85.0%) and three districts (Odell, Saunemin, and Woodland) scored lower than the State of Illinois 8th grade reading average (86.2%).

The causes of truancy vary considerably for young children; however, truancy of middle - and high-school students is more likely a result of the inappropriate beha vior and decisions of individual students. Primary school truancy often results from decisions and actions of the parents or caregivers of the children rather than the students. Zero school districts in Livingston County exceed the State of Illinois aver age truancy rate for 2012.

This condition can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being independent, from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or business. This condition can also impact a person's ability to achieve an education and can influence a person's ability to access appropriate health care. 1.6.1 Physical Approximately 22% of residents in Livingston County reported they had experienced 1 -7 days with poor physical health per month between 2007 and 2009. This percentage grew 15% since 2004-2006. With regard to residents experiencing 8 -30 days with poor physical health per month, Livingston County residents were slightly above below the state average for the same time frame, as 15.4% of residents reported poor physical health.

For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was below the state average for the same time frame. Table 1.6.1-2 Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Days of Mental Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: Livingston County State of Illinois Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Days of Mental Health Rated \"Not Good\" Per Month, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 49 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Demographic Profile: Strategic Implications Changing demographics and health care: Recent data in May 2012 from the Kaiser Family Foundation1 and Congressional Budget Office2 suggest that the number of individuals 65 years and older in the United States will increase by one-third between 2012 and 2022. With the changing demographics, it is anticipated an increase in chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, and obesity will contribute to the growing cost of health care3. In addition, advances in medical technology and medicine may enable individuals to live longer, thus requiring extensive med ical care. These national trends are prevalent in the State of Illinois and Livingston County Region as seen in Chapter 1. Of particular note, individuals aged 60-64 increased from 4.8% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2010 and individuals aged 65-74 increased from 6.8% to 7.6% between 2007 and 2010. Additionally, the median age of individuals in Livingston County increased from 39.5 years to 39.9 years between 2007 and 2010 and individuals aged 65 and over increased from 15.0% to 15.6% of the population. As individuals age and live with disabilities, it greatly impacts the degree of self - sufficiency and medical care required to maintain satisfactory well -being. With the changing demographics resulting from the aging of baby boomers, it is anticipated the Livingston County Region will experience an increase in the number of elderly individuals living with disabilities and chronic conditions. Educational attainment and health care: For over two decades, empirical research strongly suggests a positive rel ationship between education and health 4,5,6,7 (Adams, 2002; House et. al, 1990; Ross & Wu, 1995; Sander, 1999). The predominant way education impacts better health is through enhancing the decision - making capabilities of an individual. In this way, when an individual is better educated, he or she tends to have a better understanding of symptoms, be better equipped to explain symptoms to a doctor, and make better choices with regard to individual health inputs. Accordingly, more effective treatments and positive outcomes result later in life. A symbiotic relationship exists between health and education. Consider that healthier children miss fewer days of school and are more \"ready to learn.\" Success in school begins prior to kindergarten as new research on cognitive development shows the importance of health, nutrition, and intellectual stimulation during the first years of life. To be prepared to learn in kindergarten, children need pre-literacy skills. They must also be able to make and keep friend s, develop positive relationships with adults, and feel a sense of opportunity and excitement for the world around them. As their child's first teacher, much of this responsibility falls upon parents. Research tells us the most reliable predictor of educat ional success for children is whether they are reading at grade level by the end of 3rd grade. Note that according to data presented in Chapter 1, while most school districts are above the State of Illinois averages, certain school districts (e.g., Flanagan-Cornell, Pontiac, Tri-Point, and Woodland) scored lower than the State of Illinois 3 rd grade reading average. 50 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment According to research, a child from a low -income family who completes algebra has virtually the same chance of going to college as a child from an upper-income family who passes the course. Thus, it is not about the math, it's about learning to problem solve. Economic well-being and health care: Educational attainment also impacts economic well -being. Research suggests that the more education obtained by individuals, the better jobs these individuals earn8. Better jobs yield greater earning and benefits, including health insurance. Furthermore, if educated individuals are unemployed, research suggests that these individuals are unemployed fo r shorter durations than less educated individuals9. For many individuals, insurance coverage is a primary consideration when evaluating whether or not to seek medical treatment. Using health care appropriately, instead of the ER in non-emergencies, is better for patients and lowers cost of health care to society. Accordingly, the uninsured are less likely to access preventive care or seek early treatment of illness and therefore may miss more time at work. Similarly, it is difficult to hold a job when a person is not healthy. Unemployment leads to poverty and has far-reaching impacts within society. Poverty disproportionately impacts families and children. The percentage of families living in poverty has grown by 12% between 2007 (8.1%) and 2010 (9.1%). Additionally, in 2010 the Livingston County median household income ($51,336) was slightly less than the State of Illinois median household income ($52,972). This is compounded by data suggesting 34.5% of Livingston County families with a female head -of-household and no husband are living in poverty. This statistic is 6% percentage points higher than the State of Illinois average (28.5%) . Finally, early sexual activity can contribute to child poverty. The rates for births to teenage mothers in Livingston County are still significantly higher than the State average. 51 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Endnotes for Chapter 1 1 Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Health Care Costs: Key Information on Health Care Costs and Their Impact,\" May 2012. 2 Congressional Budget Office, CBO's 2011 Long-Term Budget Outlook, June 2011, p.ix, http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/122xx/doc12212/06-21-Long-Term_Budget_Outlook.pdf 3 Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Health Care Costs: Key Information on Health Care Costs and Their Impact,\" May 2012. 4 Adams, S.J.

PREVENTION 2.1 Accessibility Importance of the measure: It is critical for health care services to be accessible to the constituencies who will take advantage of its benefits. Therefore, accessibility to health care must address both the financial costs associated with health care and the supply and demand of medical services. 2.1.1 Insurance Coverage With regard to medical insurance coverage, data gathered from the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System suggest that residents in the Livingston County Region possess health care coverage at a higher percentage than the State of Illinois average. Table 2.1.1-1 Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Health Care Coverage, 2004-2006 vs. 2007-2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral Illinois Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Health Care Coverage, 2004-\u00ad2006 vs. 2007-\u00ad2009 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 53 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment With regard to dental insurance, the most recent data from the Illinois BRFSS indicate 59.1% of Livingston County residents possessed dental insurance coverage in 2007 -2009 compared to 57.0% of Livingston County residents in 2004-2006.

Table 2.1.1-3 Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Medicare Coverage, 2007-2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 25.9% 74.1% Percentage of Livingston County Region Respondents with Medicare Coverage, 2007-\u00ad2009 Covered by Medicare Not Covered by Medicare 55 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 2.1.2 Access and utilization Physician capacity can be measured using various metrics. One commonly utilized method is to evaluate the percentage of individuals who have a usual health care provider. A usual health care provider signifies that these individuals are more likely to partake in well ness check-ups and less likely to utilize emergency room visits as their primary healt h care service. Tables 2.1.2-1 and 2.1.2-2 reflect the number of emergency room visits by condition. Of particular note, the number of emergency room visits for cardiovascular conditions has increased for the Pontiac-area hospital (defined as OSF/ Saint James Medical Center) by 13% between 2009 and 2012. Emergency room visits attributed to cancer have decreased from a high of 52 in 2010 to 9 in 2012. Note however that as of 2010, Prompt Care was no longer counted as ER visits. It now falls under physician office visits. This may impact year-to-year changes, so growth rates should be interpreted with caution .

Between 2004-2006 and 2007-2009, the percentage of residents in Livingston County reporting a usual health care provider decreased by 5.0%. On the contrary, the percentage of State of Illinois residents increased by 3.0% during the same time frame.

With regard to the capacity of dentists in the Livingston County lags significantly behind the State of Illinois average for 2007-2009. Furthermore, Livingston County denoted positive growth in the percentage of respondents who have not visited a dentist in two or more years, as 22.3% of Livingston County residents have not visited a dentist in 2 or more years.

Therefore regularly scheduled routine checkups can be very important. According to the latest data from the Illinois BRFSS, approximately 70.1% of residents in the Livingston County Region report having had a routine checkup within the last year. In addition, 29.9% of Livingston County residents report that it has been more than one year since their last check -up or they have never had one. Table 2.2.1-1: Prevalence of Last Routine Checkup by Livingston County Residents, 2007- 2009 Source: Illinois Behavioral Illinois Prevalence of Last Routine Checkup by Livingston County Residents, 2007-\u00ad2009 More than one year/never 60 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 2.2.2 Early detection Residents in the Livingston County Region report varying prevalence of high cholesterol. The percentage of residents who report they have high cholesterol is higher in Livingston County (39.1%) than the State of Illinois average of 37.3%. Accordingly, there was a 27% growth in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were informed they had high cholesterol between 2006 (30.8%) and 2009 (39.1%). For comparison, there was a 3% growth in the percentage of Illinois residents reporting they were informed they had high cholesterol between 2006 (36.2%) and 2009 (37.3%). In addition, 67.7% of residents in the Livingston County Region report having had a cholesterol screening within the last year. These data for 2007 -2009 are lower than the State of Illinois average of 68.4%. Table 2.2.2-1: Percentage of Livingston County Region Residents with High Cholesterol Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Illinois Percentage of Livingston County Region Residents with High Cholesterol 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 61 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 2.2.2-2: Time Since Last Cholesterol Screening by Livingston County Region Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Cholesterol Screening by Livingston County Region Residents 62 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment With regard to high blood pressure, the residents in Livingston County report a higher percentage of individuals with high blood pressure than residents in the State of Illinois as a whole for 2007-2009 and 2004-2006.

With regard to mammograms, 89.8% of individuals over the age of 40 in Livingston County report that they have had a mammogram at some point in their life. These data are significantly lower that the State of Illinois average of 92.1%. With regard to the time elapsed since one's last mammogram, nearly 66% of residents from Livingston County reported they had had a mammogram within one year or less. This statistic is significantly better than the State of Illinois average.

Data from the 2007-2009 Illinois BRFSS indicate that 93.1% of Livingston County residents have ever had a pap smear. These percentages are greater than the State of Illinois average (92.6%). Between 2004-2006 and 2007-2009, the percentage of Livingston County residents who had ever had a pap smear saw negative percentage growth of 4.4%.

The percenta ge of people who have had a flu shot in the past year is approximately 35% for both Livingston County as well as the State of Illinois, although the state average is higher than the Livingston County average. The percentage of residents in Livingston County who obtained a flu shot (31.5%) is lower than the state average (34.6%). While the State of Illinois experienced positive percentage growth of 24% between 2004-2006 and 2007-2009, Livingston County and experienced only slight positive percentage growth in the percentage of residents who obtained a flu shot.

Residents in the Livingston County Region adhere to regular sustained physical activity guidelines at a higher propensity than the State of Illinois average (37.7%). The most recent data from 2007-2009 indicate that 55.2% of Livingston County residents meet or exceed the regular and sustained physical activity guidelines. With regard to work-related activity, upwards of 36% of Livingston County residents mostly sit or stand to execute their job tasks. The specific percentage in 2007-2009 for Livingston County (35.5%) is significantly lower than the State of Illinois average of 65.2% .

Table 2.2.4-3 illustrates the intentions toward exer cise held by residents in the Livingston County region. According to recent data, approximately 10% of the residents in Livingston County have the intent to exercise but do not actually follow through with exercising. The percentages of individuals in Livingston County who do not exercise and do not have any desire to exercise have decreased or remained constant between the periods of 2004-2006 and 2007-2009. Table 2.2.4-3 Regular Exercise and Intent to Exercise by Livingston County Region Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk months Regular exercise for <6 months Some exercise No exercise with intent to exercise No exercise, no intent Regular Exercise and Intent to Exercise by Livingston County Region Residents 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 72 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment When evaluating physical activity, the intensity and duration of the exercise is important. Residents in the Livingston County Region report approximately 42% of individuals meet the moderate activity standard compared to 22.6% of individuals in the State of Illinois as a whole. The moderate activity standard (based on heart-rate level) is defined as five, 30-minute sessions per week. With regard to the vigorous activity standard, defined as thr ee intense 20-minute sessions per week, Livingston County residents exceed the state average. Table 2.2.4-4 Percentage of Livingston County Residents Who Meet Moderate Activity Standard (5x per week for 30 minutes per day) Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Illinois Percentage of Livingston County Residents Who Meet Moderate Activity Standard (5x per week for 30 minutes per day) 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 73 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 2.2.4-5 Percentage of Livingston County Residents Who Meet Vigorous Activity Standard (3x per week for 20 minutes per day) Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Illinois Percentage of Livingston County Residents Who Meet Vigorous Activity Standard (3x per week for 20 minutes per day) 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 74 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Nutrition and diet are critical to preventative care. Nearly half (49.5%) of Livingston County Region residents report low consumption (0-2 servings per day) of fruits and vegetables. This percentage is higher than the State of Illinois average of 44.9% for the same measure. Note however that the percentage of Livingston County residents who consume 5 or more servings per day is lower (15.8%) than the State of Illinois percentage (22.6%). Table 2.2.4-6 Total Servings of Fruits/Vegetables Consumed by Livingston County Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Consumed by Livingston County Residents 0-\u00ad2 servings/day 3-\u00ad4 servings/day 5 or more servings/day 75 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 2.2.5 Oral Health Research suggests that poor oral hygiene leads to more serious medical concerns. For the 2007-2009 time frame, 62.2% of Livingston County Region residents had their teeth cleaned within the last year. The percentages for Livingston County are worse than that of the State of Illinois average (66.3%). Table 2.2.5-1 Time Since Last Teeth Cleaning by Livingston County Region Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Illinois Time Since Last Teeth Cleaning by Livingston County Region Residents, 2007-\u00ad2009 More than one year/never 76 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Prevention: Strategic Implications Increase health care insurance coverage: Research suggests that private health insurance companies cover nearly 1/3 of the national health expenditures. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, private health insurance companies comprised 32.7% of the health expenditures in the United States for 2010. 1 While this percentage has held constant around 32% since 1990, it marks an increase of approximately 11% since 1960. Medicare covered approxima tely 20.2% of national health expenditures in 2010, up nearly 4% since 2000. In addition, data suggest the out -of-pocket expenses incurred by individuals has steadily decreased, from a high of 33.4% of national health care expenditures in 1970 to 14.7% in 2000, and now 11.6% in 2010. The data are clear: Americans are paying less for out-of-pocket health care expenditures and relying more and more on private or public insurance policies to shoulder the financial burdens of health care. Private funds provided approximately 55% of health care payments in 2010 compared to 45% from federal and local government funds. 2 The rising cost of health care services has resulted in a significant number of families cutting back on care and electing to postpone or ca ncel treatments. A 2011 Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found that 50% of Americans have cut back on medical treatments in the past 12 months based on cost concerns. 3 Furthermore, 40% reported being \"very worried\" about having to shoulder more of the financial burden for their health care. Data seem to reinforce this concern, as health insurance premiums have consistently outpaced inflation and the growth in worker earnings. In Livingston County, nearly 26% of residents rely on Medicare coverage as their primary insurance coverage. Recent data suggest nearly 91% of Livingston County residents possess medical health care coverage. This percentage is well above the 86% response rate for the State of Illinois. Dental insurance coverage is less broad ac ross the Livingston County Region, as only 59.1% of Livingston County residents possess dental insurance coverage. Increase the prevalence of preventative health care screens: There appears to be a relationship between individuals who have health ins urance and individuals who take advantage of preventative health care screenings. Research for over twenty years suggests that the strongest predictors of failure to receive screening tests was lack of insurance coverage. 4 Furthermore, research suggests that lack of insurance coverage is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups that are often at high risk for disease and illness. 5 Thus, a vicious cycle results where individuals who are at the highest risk for diseases are unable to receiving screening, thus perpetuating a cycle of disease and high health care expenditures. Screening guidelines from the United States Preventative Services Task Force offer insight on appropriate preventative care and screenings for youth, adults, and older individuals. 6 Adherence to these guidelines provides data-driven benchmarks from physicians in the fields of primary care and preventative medicine. Above all, it is critical for physicians and patients to 77 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment engage in thorough evaluation of treatment options and engage in high-quality shared decision- making regarding treatment options. 7 Routine physicals are essential to detecting adverse medical conditions. Residents in Livingston County lag the state average when considering those individuals whose last routine checkup was more than one year ago or never. Research suggests many rural communities have dramatic medical professional shortages.8 With regard to women's health issues, while the percentage of women who report the time since their last mammogram was more than one year ago is lower in Livingston County than in the State of Illinois (33.8% vs. 43.6%), growth rates for this category are dramatically higher in Livingston County (134% growth between 2006 and 2009) than in the State of Ill inois (15% growth between 2006 and 2009). Additionally, there was a 48% growth in the percentage of Livingston County female residents reporting the time since their last pap smear was more than one year between 2006 (20.9%) and 2009 (30.9%). For comparison, there was a 27% growth in the percentage of Illinois residents reporting the time since their last pap smear was more than one year between 2006 (20.7%) and 2009 (26.2%). Rates in Livingston County now exceed the State of Illinois average. With regard to immunizations, the Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends everyone 6 months and older receive a flu vaccination every year. 9 In Livingston County, the percentage of residents who obtained a flu shot is lower than the state average and considerably lower than the recommendations from the CDC. 78 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Endnotes for Chapter 2 1 Kaiser Family Foundation, \"Health Care Costs: Key Information on Health Care Costs and Their Impact,\" May 2012. 2 Ibid. 3 Kaiser Family Foundation, Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, Toplines, August 10-15, 2011, pp.16- 18, http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/8217.cfm. 4 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Healthcare Disparities Report, 2005. 5 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2010.

SYMPTOMS AND PREDICTORS 3.1 Tobacco Use Importance of the measure: In order to appropriately allocate health care resources, a thorough analysis of the leading indicators regarding morbidity and disease must be conducted. In this way, health care services and personnel can target affected populations more effectively. Research suggests tobacco use facilitates a wide variety of adverse medical conditions. Smoking significantly impacts the health status of individuals. Smoking rates have increased in Livingston County and smoking rates still exceed the State of Illinois averages. There was an 18% growth in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (24.3%) and 2009 (28.7%). For comparison, there was an 8% decrease in the percentage growth of Illinois residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (20.5%) and 2009 (18.8%). Over half of residents within Livingston County classify themselves as non-smokers, whereas approximately a quarter of residents are former smokers. Table 3.1-1: Smoking Status of Residents in Livingston County Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Illinois Smoking Status of Residents in Livingston County smoker former smoker non-\u00adsmoker 80 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Many individuals begin smoking tobacco as teenagers. Over half of Livingston County residents began smoking regularly before the age of 18. Table 3.1-2: Reported Age that Livingston County Region Residents Began Smoking Regularly Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 56.5% 43.5% Reported Age that Livingston County Region Residents Began Smoking Regularly, 2007-\u00ad2009 Under age 18 Age 18 or older 81 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Workplaces have different policies regarding smoking in public areas. 74% of Livingston County residents report that they are not allowed to smoke in any public areas. This is a percentage growth of 91% between 2007 and 2010. Table 3.1-3: Smoking Policy for Work Areas of Livingston County Region Residents Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk in any public areas Allowed in some public areas No of\\icial policy Smoking Policy for Work Areas of Livingston County Region Residents 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 82 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Attitudes toward smoking in restaurants have changed in the past six years. In 2004- 2006, 42.3% of Livingston County residents believed that smoking should be allowed in some areas within restaurants. However, by 2007-2009, the percentage of respondents who agreed with that statement had dropped slightly to 38.8%. Table 3.1-4: Livingston County Region Resident Options Regarding Smoking in Restaurants Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor areas Not allowed at all Livingston County Region Resident Options Regarding Smoking in Restaurants 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 83 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 3.2 Drug and Alcohol Abuse Importance of the measure: Alcohol and drugs impair decision-making, often leading to adverse consequences and outcomes. Research suggests that alcohol is a gateway drug for youths, leading to increased usage of substances in adult years. Accordingly, the values and behaviors toward substance usage by high school students is a leading indicator of adult substance abuse in later years. Compared to the State of Illinois average (17.5%), Livingston County has a higher percentage of residents at risk for acute or binge drinking. Table 3.2-1: Percent of Livingston County Region Residents at Risk for Acute/Binge Drinking Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data from the 2008 Illinois Youth Survey, which measures illegal substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs - mainly marijuana) among adolescents, suggest emerging trends for adult substance usage. In Livingston County among 8 th graders, the average age at first use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana is 12.7, 11.8 and 12.5 years respectively. The same average age for 12th graders is 16.1, 14.5 and 15.7 years respectively. In Livingston County, the past 30-day use is higher for tobacco use (12th graders) and tobacco use (12th graders) when compared to State of Illinois of Illinois Percent of Livingston County Region Residents at Risk for Acute/Binge Drinking 2007-\u00ad2009 2004-\u00ad2006 84 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 3.2-2: Reported Substance Abuse Usage of Livingston County 8th Graders, 2008 Source: http://iys.cprd.illinois.edu/PDFs/2008_CountyCharts_Full_Report.pdf Table 3.2-3: Reported Substance Abuse Usage of Livingston County 12th Graders, 2008 Source: http://iys.cprd.illinois.edu/PDFs/2008_CountyCharts_Full_Report.pdf 85 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 3.3 Overweight and Obesity Importance of the measure: Individuals who are overweight and obese place greater stress on internal organs, thus increasing the propensity to utilize health services. In terms of obesity and being overweight, Table 3.3 -1 shows that in Livingston County, the number of people who have trouble with their weight has increased over the five years from 2004 to 2009. Note specifically that while the number of obese people has decreased, the percentage of overweight people experienced a significant increase. Table 3.3-1: Percentage of People Diagnosed with Overweight or Obesity in Livingston County and Illinois Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk of Illinois Percentage of People Diagnosed with Overweight or Obesity in Livingston County and Illinois underweight/normal overweight obese 86 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment With regard to those individuals advised by a medical professional abo ut their weight, nearly 15% of residents in Livingston County have been advised about their weight during the 2007-2009 time frame. In Table 3.3-3, over half of Livingston County residents are attempting to lose weight and Table 3.3-4 illustrates the percentage of Livingston County residents attempting to maintain their current weight . Table 3.3-2: Percent of Livingston County Region Residents Advised About Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Table 3.3-3: Percent of Livingston County Region Residents Now Trying to Lose Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor County Region Residents Now Trying to Lose Weight 87 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 3.3-4: Percent of Livingston County Region Residents Now Trying to Maintain Current Weight Source: Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor County Region Residents Now Trying to Maintain Current Weight 88 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Symptoms/Predictors: Strategic Implications Effectively combating youth obesity: Research strongly suggests that obesity is a significant problem facing youth and adults nationally, in Illinois, and within the Livingston County Region. The US Surgeon General has characterized obesity as \"the fastest-growing, most threatening disease in America today.\" 1 According to the Obesity Prevention Initiative from the Illinois General Assembly, 20% of Illinois children are obese 2. Data from 2010 indicate 62% of Illinois adults are obese or overweight, with a disproportionate number of obese or overweight individuals living in rural areas. The financial burden of overweight and obese individuals is staggering, as the estimated annual medical costs attributed to obesity in Illinois for 1998 -2000 exceeded 3.4 billion dollars, ranking Illinois 6 th in the nation for obesity-attributed medical costs3. With children, research has linked obesity to numerous chronic diseases including Type II diabetes4, hypertension, high blood pressure, and asthma. Adverse physical health side effects of obesity include orthopedic problems with weakened joints and lower bone density5. Detrimental mental health side effects include low self -esteem, poor body image, symptoms of depression and suicide ideation6. Obesity impacts educational performance as studies suggest that overweight students miss one day of school per month on average and school absenteeism of obese children is six times higher that of non-obese children7. With adults, obesity has far-reaching consequences. Testimony to the Illinois General Assembly indicated that obesity-related illnesses contribute to worker absenteeism, slow workflow, and high worker compensation rates.8 A Duke University study on the effects of obesity in the workforce noted 13 times more missed work days by obese employees than non - obese employees. Nationwide, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition contribute to an estimated 300,000 preventable deaths per y ear. Within Livingston County, leading indicators suggest obesity is a growing concern. With regard to nutrition, evidence suggests residents in the Livingston County region are not eating enough fruits and vegetables. Table 2.2.4-6 indicates that between 2007 and 2009, only 15.8% of Livingston County residents consumed 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. These figures are considerably less than the 22.6% of Illinois residents who eat more than 5 servings per day. Furthermore, approximately 50% of Livingston County residents consume 0-2 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Research indicates physical activity helps to prevent illness and obesity9. Data regarding the values toward exercise and the actual time spent exercis ing may contribute to obesity in Livingston County. For example, data from the Center for Disease Control indicate that 66% of children walked or biked to school in 1973. By 2000, that figure had decreased to only 13%.10 As seen in Table 2.2.4-4, residents in the Livingston County Region report approximately 42 % of individuals meet the moderate activity standard compared to 22.6% of individuals in the State of Illinois as a whole. However, this means 58% of residents do not meet the moderate activity standard. 89 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Aggressively addressing youth substance abuse: The use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs is a significant contributor to the escalating costs of health care service delivery. According to the Center for Disease Control, tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. 11 On a societal level, alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use leads to accidents, violent behavior, emotional trauma, and assaults. It is estimated that drug-induced related risky behavior needlessly drains community resources such as police intervention, emergency services, and criminal justice costs. The Surgeon General contends that \"alcohol remains the most heavily abused substance by America's youth.\" 12 Dr. Peter Monti, Director of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University notes that alcohol disrupts the continued growth of an adolescent's brain and \"impacts the brain's ability to learn life skills.\" 13 Studies show that an adolescent needs to only drink half as much alcohol as an adult to suffer similar adverse brain effects. 14 Research shows that cigarette smoking as a teenager leads to higher risks for lung cancer as an adult, reduces the rates of lung growth, and the maximum level of lung function that could be achieved. 15 Financially, underage drinking is estimated to cost the nation upwards of $62 billion dollars annually in deaths, injuries, and other economic losses.16 A Columbia University study examining the impacts of substance abuse in mid -sized cities and rural America suggested that tobacco use was more prevalent in mid -sized cities and rural areas than large metropolitan areas; specifically, young adults in mid-sized cities and rural areas were 30% more likely than adults in larger cities to have smoked a cigarette in the last month. 17 In Livingston County, smoking rates have increased since 2004-2006 and are now significantly higher than the state of Illinois average. In addition, youth substance usage in Livingston County exceeds the State of Illinois averages for 12th graders (alcohol and tobacco usage) and a higher proportion of residents engage in binge drinking (22.7%) versus 17.5% overall in the State of Illinois.

DISEASES /MORBIDITY Note in this chapter, given the lack of recent disease/morbidity data from existing secondary data sources, much of the data used in this chapter was manually gathered from OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center. 4.1 Age related Importance of the measure: Age related statistics regarding morbidity gain insight into the prevalence of disease within two vulnerable populations - the very young and the very old. Health care services designed to meet the needs of these populations are very expensive and therefore, a thorough understanding of the leading indicators for these populations helps with managing service delivery costs. 4.1.1 Low birth weight rates Low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds. Very low birth weight rate is defined as the percentage of infants born below 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds. In contrast, the average newborn weighs about 7 pounds. The percentage of babies born with low, very low, and preterm birth weights in Livingston County was less than the State of Illinois averages. Table 4.1.1-1: Percentage of Babies Born Preterm or with Low Birth Weight in Livingston County, 2009 Source: Illinois Department Illinois Percentage of Babies Born Preterm or with Low Birth Weight in Livingston County, 2009 Low Birth Weight (<2500 grams) Very Low Birth Weight (<1500 grams) Preterm (<37 weeks) 92 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 4.1.2 Initiation of prenatal care Prenatal care is comprehensive medical care provided for the mother and fetus, which includes screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with adverse birth outcomes. Kotelchuck Index Scores are used to determine the quantity of prenatal visits received between initiation of services and delivery. Adequate (80%-109% of expected visits) and Adequate Plus (receiving 110% of recommended services) of received services is compared to the number of expected visits for the period when care began and the delivery date. Of the babies born in 2009 in Livingston County, 84.4% were born with \"Adequate\" or \"Adequate Plus\" prenatal care. This figure is significantly better than the State of Illinois average of 80.2% of babies born with similar prenatal care.

An average of one cases of hypertension per year is reported at OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center. Cases of hypertension complication peaked in FY 2012 when 3 instances were reported overall. The most recent data indicate 4 cases of hypertension and 6 case of hypertension complication between FY 2009 and FY 2012.

These conditions are characterized by breathlessness, wheezing, chronic coughing, frequent respiratory infections, and chest tightness. Many respiratory conditions can be successfully controlled with medical supervision and treatment. However, children and adults who do not have acces s to adequate medical care are likely to experience repeated serious episodes, trips to the emergency room and absences from school and work. Hospitalization rates illustrate the worst episodes of respiratory diseases and are a proxy measure for inadequate treatment. 4.3.1 Asthma Treated cases of asthma at OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center have increased by 81% between FY 2009 and FY 2012 for inpatient admissions. Of particular interest, cases of asthma in individuals 65 years of age and older have increased 450% for inpatient admissions (11 cases in FY 2012 vs. 2 cases in FY 2009). According to the Illinois BRFSS, asthma rates in the Livingston County Region are higher than the average rate for the State of Illinois and have grown at a faster rate.

It is estimated that 90 -95% of individuals with diabetes have Type II diabetes (previously known as adult-onset diabetes). Only 10-15% of individuals with diabetes have Type I diabetes ( previously known as juvenile diabetes). Cases of Type II diabetes at OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center have increased by 60% between FY 2009 and FY 2012 for inpatient admissions. Cases of Type I diabetes at OSF Saint James - John W. Albrecht Medical Center have increased by 33.3% between FY 2009 and FY 2012 for inpatient admissions. Data from the Illinois BRFSS indicate that 10.2% of Livingston County Region residents have diabetes. Compared to data from the State of Illinois, the pr evalence of diabetes is increasing at a faster rate in Livingston County than in the state as a whole and now exceeds the state average.

These diseases may complicate treatment efforts aimed at alleviating the primary diagnosis and exacerbate health care costs. Tables 4.7.1-1 and 4.7.1-2 identify the top 20 secondary diagnoses in Livingston County. Hypertension is the most prevalent secondary diagnosis. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of cases categorized as \"addiction/chemical dependency - OB fetal\" increased 235%. It should be noted that the same patient may have multiple secondary diagnoses.

In many cases, these types of injuries \u2014and the deaths resulting from them\u2014are preventable. Suicide is intentional self -harm resulting in death. These injuries are often indicative of serious mental health problems requiring the treatment of other trauma-inducing issues. 4.8.1 Intentional - suicide For Livingston County in 2009, the percentage of deaths attributed to suicide i s 1% and less than the State of Illinois average.

Research suggests that infants born at low birth weight are at greater risk for life - threatening complications including infections, bre athing problems, neurological problems and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).1 Other studies suggest that low birth weight babies are also at a higher risk for developmental disabilities, such as learning disabilities and attention deficits, than babies with normal birth weights. Cognitive function of low birth weight babies may also be diminished leading to higher rates of sub -average IQ (< 85) than normal birth weight babies. 2 Regular prenatal care is a vital aspect in producing healthy babies and c hildren. The employment of screening and treatment for medical conditions as well as identification and interventions for behavioral risk factors associated with poor birth outcomes are important aspects of prenatal care. Research suggests that women who receive adequate prenatal care are more likely to have better birth outcomes, such as full term and normal weight babies. 3 Prenatal care can provide health risk assessments for the mother and fetus, early intervention for medical conditions and education to encourage healthy habits, including nutritional and substance -free health during pregnancy. According to a study by The National Public Health and Hospital Institute, cost of care and other financial barriers were cited as reasons expectant mothers did not get adequate prenatal care. 4 Emphasize the link between blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases: Research from the Center for Disease Control estimated that the total cost of cardiovascular diseases in the United States for 2010 was $444 billion. 5 In essence, one out of every six dollars spent on health care is spent on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. 6 However, controlling one's blood pressure and decreasing one's intake of cholesterol also reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. For example, research from the CDC suggests a \"12-13 point reduction in average systolic blood pressure over 4 years can reduce heart disease risk by 21%, stroke risk by 37%, and risk of total cardiovascular death by 25%.\" 7 The number of cases of other cardiovascular diseases at Pontiac area hospitals from the Livingston County region has increased 100% between 2009 (7 cases) and 2012 (14 cases). In addition, the number of cases of inpatient heart failure for individuals 45 to 64 ye ars of age at Pontiac area hospitals from the Livingston County region has increased 166% between 2009 (3 cases) and 2012 (8 cases). 129 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Endnotes Chapter 4 1 Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University, High-Risk Newborn: Low Birthweight.

MORTALITY Importance of the measure: Presenting data that focuses on diseases provides an opportunity to analyze the ratio of sick individuals to healthy individuals in the Livingston County Region and, in addition, define and quantify what diseases are causing the most death and disability. The top two leading causes of death in the State of Illinois and Livingston County are similar as a percentage of total deaths. Diseases of the Heart comprise 29% of deaths in Livingston County and Cancer comprises 26% of deaths in Livingston County. While Diseases of the Heart and Cancer contribute to more deaths in Livingston County than the State of Illinois as a whole, the incidence of cerebrovascular disease in Livingston County is less prevalent than across the State of Illinois as a whole. In addition, nephritis, nephritic syndrome, and nephrosis were attributed to 3.5% of deaths in 2009 in Livingston County vs. 2.6% of deaths in the State of Illinois, making nephritis the 5th leading cause of death in Livingston County compared to the 8th leading cause of death in the State of Illinois. Table 5.1-1. Top 5 Leading Causes of Death for all Races by County, 2009 Rank Livingston County State of Illinois 1 Disea ses of Heart (29%) Diseases of Heart (25%) 2 Malignant Neoplasm (26%) Malignant Neoplasm (24%) 3 Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (6%) Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease (5%) 4 Cerebrovascular Disease (4%) Cerebrovascular Disease (5%) syndrome, and nephrosis (3.5%) Accidents (4%) Source: Illinois Department of Public Health 131 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Mortality: Strategic Implications Minimize unnecessary medical interventions to decrease mortality rates: Three decades of research suggests that more care for patients is associated with higher mortality.1 This paradox is best explained by the fact that all medical proced ures possess risk and by increasing the number of interventions a patient receives, the more risk incurred by the patient. More risk increases the chances of errors and additional physicians becoming involved to treat the patient. The Institute of Medici ne contends that this fragmentary nature of the US health care delivery system is one of the major drivers of poor quality and higher costs. 2 Poor quality disproportionately impacts those with chronic illnesses. Statistically, an estimated 90 million Americans live with at least one chronic illness, 70% of Americans die from chronic disease, and 90% of deaths among the Medicare population are attributed to just nine chronic illnesses: congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, cancer, coronary art ery disease, renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, chronic liver disease, and dementia. 3 The costs to treat chronic diseases are staggering, as inefficiencies drive up the cost of care. Patients with chronic conditions are often trea ted by primary care providers in addition to specialists. In most cases, little is done to coordinate treatments. Over time, as the chronic condition becomes more debilitating, patients require more care and the cost of care increases. According to the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, patients with chronic illnesses in their last two years of life account for nearly 32% of total Medicare spending. 4 Furthermore, overtreatment in the U.S. wastes an estimated 20 to 30 cents on every health care dollar spent.5 Address the diverse needs of underserved populations: Research suggests individuals of color are at greater risk to be afflicted with violent crime, perinatal conditions, and chronic diseases. The U.S. Bureau of Justi ce notes that a racial divide impacts the prevalence of individuals being stricken by violent crime. In 2005, national homicide rates for African Americans were six times higher than the rates for whites. 6 Adverse perinatal conditions include poor maternal health and nutrition, inadequate care during pregnancy and childbirth, and problems relating to premature births. With regard to chronic diseases including heart disease and cancer, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Minority Health suggests African Americans are 30% less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease than Whites, but are more likely to die from it. Furthermore, African Americans are 1.5 times more likely than Whites to have high blood pressure and African American women are 1.7 times more likely to be obese. 7 The incidence of strokes disproportionately impacts African Americans, as they are 70% more prone to having a stroke than Whites. With mortality rates, Black men are 60% more likely to die from a stroke. For stroke survivors, African Americans are more often disabled than Whites.8 For cancer, Black men are 30% more likely than Whites to have new cases of prostate cancer and are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer. The 5 -year survival rates for African Americans are lower for lung and pancreatic cancer, and they are 2.4 times as likely to die from prostate cancer. Black women are 10% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than Whites, but they are 34% more likely to die from it . Black women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with stomach cancer and are 2.4 times more likely to die. 9 132 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Endnotes for Chapter 5 1 The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.

Numerous opportunities may exist that are related to impacting community health benefits, but are not published in secondary research sources. Rather they are discovered through unbiased data collection, rigorous statistical modeling and analyses, and simple, common -sense interpretations and conclusions. Through this type of research, the health -care community can expect to identify areas for self -improvement, opportunities for addressing community needs and underlying perceptions of how demographics impact the community's perceptions and effectiveness. Phase II research consists of providing structure, information, documentation and practical interpretation of data. Five specific objectives are accomplished in the primary research: Create a statistically valid research instrument to collect necessary information; Collect data using a partnership process (rather than respondent mentality); Assess perceptions of current/potential community issues; Segment markets based on key demographics; Draw conclusions and discuss potential future directions to improve the health of the community. In Phase II of the community health needs assessment, there are four chapters that assess different aspects of the general community as well as specific health -related issues for the at-risk population. The chapters are as follows: C HAPTER 6. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS CHAPTER 7. FINDINGS AND RESULTS COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS CHAPTER 8. ACCESSIBILITY TO HEALTH CARE CHAPTER 9. HEALTH -RELATED BEHAVIORS 134 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment CHAPTER 6. G ENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS As mentioned in the Methods section of this study, data were collected via on-line survey and paper surveys. In this chapter, the characteristics of the sample are presented. A total of 967 surveys were completed. All data includes the entir e sample, except where specifically noted. Note that for most characteristics in this chapter, data are analyzed for: (1) the overall sample; and (2) by the at risk population. According to the CDC, at risk populations are characterized by economic disad vantage. Specifically, according to the CDC Public Health Workbook, at risk populations are defined as those individuals living in deep poverty, which for this study is operationalized as those with a household income of less than $20,000. Note that 429 respondents were in this income category. 6.1 Age The average age of respondents was 44.4 years old. The distribution is reflective of the 2010 Census data, however, the mean age of surveyed respondents is slightly older, compared t o the Census average age of 41.0 years old. This occurred because survey respondents were all adults, age 18 and above. Table 6.1 Age Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty 3 11 14 19 25 17 11 6 18 18 16 23 10 9 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Under 20 21-\u00ad30 31-\u00ad40 41-\u00ad50 51-\u00ad60 61-\u00ad70 71 and older Percentage of Respondents Age Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Livingston County Poverty 135 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.2 Race and Ethnicity Table 6.2 Race/Ethnicity Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Overall demographics for race/ethnicity mirrored the secondary data assessed in Phase I. Comparing to Census data and the survey respondents, most ethnic backgrounds were similar to one another. However, higher percentages of individuals identifying Hispanic/Latino were included in Guamanian/Chamorro) Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino/a) Other Race/Ethnicity Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Livingston County Poverty 136 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.3 Educational Attainment Level of education for survey respondents was similar to Cens us data; however, note that 27% of those living in poverty have not completed high school. Table 6.3 Highest Educational Attainment for Livingston County and Deep Poverty 12 16 12 20 31 6 3 2 7 6 17 43 16 9 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Percentage of Respondents Highest Educational Attainment for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Livingston County Poverty 137 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.4 Income Distribution Note that income distribution for survey respondents is skewed low, as 32% of the overall sample had an income level of less than $20,000. This is a result of the targeted efforts to survey the at-risk population. Table 6.4 Income Distribution for Livingston County 32 28 15 10 8 7 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Less than $20,000 $20,001 to Percentage of Respondents Income Distribution for Livingston County Livingston County 138 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.5 Living Arrangements Note that overall, over twice as many respondents indicated they owned homes compared to those individuals who rented. To protect the dignity of homeless survey respondents, a specific choice of homeless was not available, rather there was a category for \"other.\" Table 6.5 Living Arrangement Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty 28 63 9 57 23 20 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Rent Own Homeless Percentage of Respondents Living Arrangement Distribution for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Livingston County Poverty 139 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.6 Household Composition Household composition is based on the number of individuals living in a household. Overall the most prevalent response was 2 people per household, with the exception of those living in deep poverty, where the most prevalent response was one individual living in a household. Table 6.6 Household Composition for Livingston County and Deep Poverty 6.7 Employment Status For employment status, overall, 42% of respondents were employed full time, 11% were employed part time, and 8.7% were unemployed. The rest of the population was either retired, in school, disabled, or served in the armed forces or was a homemaker. 20 38 16 14 12 32 22 18 12 16 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1 2 3 4 5 or more Percentage of Respondents Number of People in the Home Household Composition for Livingston County and Deep Poverty Livingston County Poverty 140 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 6.8 Gender The one demographic variable that was significantly skewed was gender. Overall 71% of respondents were women and 29% of respondents were men. According to Census data, men and women are evenly divided in Livingston County . For this type of survey, it is expected that women would be more likely to fill out the survey compared to men. Note that in a research study performed by the Heart of Illinois United Way in 2011, a positive correlation was found between women and concern for health -care related issues. Stated differently, women are more interested in participating in these types of surveys then men.

C OMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS In this chapter results of the first three sections of the survey are analyzed and discussed. Specifically, perceptions of Health Problems in the Community, Unhealthy Beha viors and factors impacting Quality of Life are presented. First, aggregate scores are presented. Then responses are presented for those living in deep poverty. After each category, correlation analyses between perceptions and demographic variables are p resented in order to identify where certain demographic characteristics influence the way respondents perceive specific attributes of the community. Note that for aggregated perceptions of the Livingston County community, modifications to data were made given the skewed income data and skewed gender data. Therefore specific cases were selected randomly based on income and gender, in order to replicate the demographics of the community based on Census data. The sample used for aggregated analyses contains 811 responses. 7.1 Health Problems in the Community 7.1.1 Aggregated Results The first dimension of the survey asked respondents to rate the three most important health problems in the community. Respondents had a choice of 20 different options. The health problem that rated highest was cancer. It was significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. This was followed by aging issues, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease/attack, identified nearly 30-35% of the time. The next set of health problems identified were mental health and dental health. Other categories were only identified 15% of the time or less. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases, but inaccurate in others. For example, while cancer is a leading cause of mortality in Livingston County, the number of cases treated has been steadily declining for some cancer types. Also, obesity is an important issue and the survey respondents accurately identified obesity as an important health problem. In contrast, liver disease ranked 19 th/20th on the list, yet this is the 5th leading cause of death in Livingston County. 142 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 7.1.1 Livingston County Frequencies for Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community Note: n=811 43 35 32 30 30 25 15 13 13 11 7 7 7 5 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Cancer Aging issues Obesity/overweight Diabetes Heart disease/attack Mental health issues Dental health Chronic pain Teenage pregnancy Infectious diseases Injuries STI Stroke Lung disease Birth defects HIV/AIDS Infant death Kidney disease Liver disease Lead poisoning Livingston County Frequencies for Most Important Health Problems in the Community 143 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 7.1.2 Perceptions of Individuals Living in Poverty When assessing perceptions of those living in poverty, it can be seen that some of the health problems change in terms of importance. For example, while many of the top perceived health problems remain constant, others become more important. For example, 21 % of individuals living in poverty identified chronic pain as a concern and 30% of individuals living in poverty identified dental health as a concern.

Table 7.1.3 Significant Correlations among Most Important Perceived Health Problems in the Community and Demographic Variables 146 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 7.2 Unhealthy Behaviors Respondents were asked to select the three most important unhealthy behaviors in the community out of a total of 14 choices based on importance . Again note that the modified sample of 811 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the characteristics of the Livingston County population. 7.2.1 Aggregate Unhealthy Behaviors The unhealthy behaviors that rated highest were alcohol abuse and drug abuse. They were both significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. This was followed by poor eating habits, lack of exercise, and smoking. Statistically, these three choices were rated similarly. The next unhealthy behaviors were general violence, domestic violence, and child abuse. Other categories were only identified 11% of the time or less. Note that perceptions of the community were accurate in some cases, but inaccurate in others. For example, while drug and alcohol abuse are con cerns Livingston County, the percentage of youths in 12 th grade that smoke exceeds the State of Illinois averages .

Again note that the modified sample of 811 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the characteristics of Livingston County. 7.3.1 Aggregate issues impacting quality of life The issues impacting quality of life that rated highest were job opp ortunities and access to health services. They were both significantly higher than other categories based on t-tests between sample means. It is not surprising that job opportunities was rated high given the recent recession. This was followed by access to health services, affordable housing, less poverty, and healthy food choices. Statistically, these four choices were rated similarly. This was followed by safer neighborhoods and transportation.

Specifically, younger people and low -income respondents appear to have the largest misperceptions regarding the importance of understanding heart disease in the community. Additionally, dental health seems to be rated relatively low, even though annual dental checkups are lower than state averages. Respondents with higher incomes, more education, and older appeared to have the largest misperceptions. Finally, there appears to be a misperception between perceived issues with kidney disease and actual deaths resulting from kidney disease. 154 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment CHAPTER 8. A CCESSIBILITY TO HEALTH CARE In this chapter, results examining access to health services are presented. Specifi cally, access to medical care, prescription medication, dental care and counseling are presented. First, scores are presented for Livingston County. Next, responses are presented for those living in deep poverty. After each category, relationships betwee n accessibility and demographic variables are presented in order to identify where certain demographic characteristics influence access to health services. 8.1 Choice of Medical Care Respondents were asked to select the type of health care they used when they were sick. Six different alternatives were presented, including clinic or doctor's office, emergency department, urgent care facility, health department, no medical treatment, and other. The modified sample of 811 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the demographic characteristics for Livingston County. 8.1.1 Aggregate Reponses The most common response was clinic/doctor's office, where 78% of survey respondents chose this as their primary choice for medical care. This was followed by not seeking medical attention (7%), the emergency department at a hospital (5%), urgent care (5%), the health department (3%), and other (2%). Note that respondents may have interpreted the Health Department as a clinic.

Health department tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, Latino/a ethnicity, higher income and less educated. Individuals identifying with White ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Emergency department tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, Black ethnicity, less education, and lower income. Clinic/Doctor's office tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: women, older, white ethnicity, more education, and higher income. Individuals of Black ethnicity and Latino/a ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Don't seek medical treatment tends to be rated higher by people with the following characteristics: men, younger and lower income. Urgent Care Center tends to be higher by individuals of Latino/a ethnicity. Table 8.1.3 Significant Correlations among Choice of Health Care and Demographic Variables 157 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.2 Frequency of Checkups 8.2.1 Aggregated responses Respondents were asked how often they had a checkup. Of respondents, 67% received a checkup in the last year, 14% in the past 1 -2 years, 8% in the last 3-5 years, 8% 5 years or more and 3% have never been to a doctor's office for a checkup. The modified sample of 811 was used for aggregated responses in order to more accurately reflect the demographic characteristics of Livingston County.

Specifically, 27% of people living in deep poverty had not seen a doctor in 3 or more years. Table 8.2.2 Frequencies for Time Since Last Checkup from Individuals Living in Poverty 58 15 13 11 3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Within the last year 1-\u00ad2 years ago 3-\u00ad5 years ago 5 or more years ago I have never been to a doctor for a checkup Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for Time Since Last Checkup from Individuals Living in Poverty 159 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.2.3 Relationships between frequency of checkups and demographics The data show that younger people, individuals with lower income, individuals identifying with Latino/a ethnicity , and homeless individuals are less likely to get a checkup at a doctor's office. Moreover, results of Ordinary-Least-Squared regression models show that homelessness is the most important predictor, followed by income and age, based on significance levels of beta coefficients. Table 8.2.3 Significant Correlations for Time Since Last Checkup Age - Latino/a + Income - Homeless + 160 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.3 Access to Medical Care Respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed medical care bu t were not able to get it?\" 83% of Livingston County residents were able to receive medical care, however compared to individuals living in deep poverty, only 65% were able to receive medical care. Put differently, 35% of individuals living in poverty could not get access to medical care when necessary. Table 8.3.1 Frequencies for \"Was there a time when you needed medical care but were not able to get it?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 83 65 17 35 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Livingston County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Was there a time when you needed medical care but were not able to get it?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty No Yes 161 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment For relationships between access to medical care and demographics, note that the relationships are reverse coded. Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that they did not have access to medical care if they were younger, less educated, possessed lower income, were of non-White ethnicity, and were homeless. Logit regression results indicate that less education, younger people and homeless were the most important predictors respectively, based on significance levels of beta coefficients. Table 8.3.2 Significant Correlations for \"Was there a time when you needed medical care but were not able to get it?\" Age - Education - Income - Homeless + Race (White) - 162 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment The leading causes of why someone did not have access to med ical care were no insurance (49%) and the inability to afford copayments or deductibles (18%). This was followed by too long to wait for an appointment (17%) and the doctor refusing to accept insurance or Medicaid (7%). Note that total percentages do not equal 100% as respondents could choose more than one answer.

Put differently, 44% of individuals living in poverty could not get access to medical care when necessary. For relationships between access to prescription medications and demographics, logit regression results indicate that homeless was the most important predictor, based on significance levels of beta coefficients.

Individuals of White ethnicity tend to rate it lower. Finally, \"can't afford copay\" tends to be rated higher by women, older individuals, and individuals identifying with White ethnicity. 168 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.5 Access to Dental Care Respondents were asked when was the last time that they had a dental checkup. Residents in Livingston County indicated that 56% of residents have had a dental checkup in the last year. For those living in deep poverty, only 22% had a dental checkup in the last year. Note that Ordinary-Least -Squared regression modeling indicates that age and non- White/non-Latino rated access to dental checkups lower, based on significance levels of beta coefficients.

Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that a longer time has passed since his or her last dental checkup if they were younger, they were of non-White ethnicity, they possessed less education, they possessed less income, and were homeless. 170 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Respondents were then asked, \"Was there a time when you needed dental care but were not able to get it?\" Note that for Livingston County, only 23% respondents indicated that they were unable to obtain dental care when they needed it. Compared to the figures for people living in poverty, 49% indicated that they could not get access to dental care when necessary. Logistic regression modeling indicated that lower income, younger age , lower education and non-White residents were more likely not to have access to dental care, based on significance levels of beta coefficients.

Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she needed dental care and were unable to receive it if they were male, younger, of non-White ethnicity, of lower income, homeless and possessed less education. 172 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment The leading causes of why someone did not have access to d ental care were no insurance (72%) and the inability to afford copayments or deductib les (19%). While fear was a non-issu e with access to medical care, 3 % of respondents indicated they did not get access to dental care because they were uncomfortable going to the dentist. Note that total percentages do not equal 100% as respondents could choose more than one answer.

Refused my insurance/Medicaid tends to be rated higher by homeless individuals. Too long to wait for an appointment tends to be rated higher by people with more education. Fear tends to be rated higher by people with more education. 174 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.6 Access to Counseling Respondents were asked, \"Was there a time when you needed counseling bu t were not able to get it?\" 10% of respondents in Livingston County agreed that when he or she needed counseling, he or she was unable to obtain it. The percentage for individuals living in poverty is more than double (22%). Logit regression results indicated that low income, younger people and homelessness were the most important predictors of no access to counseling, respectively.

Therefore a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she needed counseling and was unable to receive it if they wer e homeless, possessed less education, possessed lower income, and were male. 176 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment The leading causes of why someone did not have access to counseling were no insurance (43%) and the inability to afford copayments or deductibles (21%). Embarrass ment was the fourth leading cause at 10%. Subsequent analyses revealed that members of the Homeless population were highly correlated to fear, embarrassment, refusal of insurance, and inability to pay one's deductible. Note that total percentages do not e qual 100% as respondents could choose more than one answer.

I didn't have any way to get to the counselor tends to be rated higher by individuals of Black ethnicity. Embarrassment tends to be rated higher individuals with higher incomes. 178 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.7 Access to Information Respondents were asked, \"Where do you get most of your medical information.\" The vast majority of respondents obtained information from their doctor. While the Internet was the second most common choice, it w as significantly lower than information from doctors. Note that for individuals living in poverty, friends/family was as important to the Internet. There were no statistically significant relationships between access to information and demographic factors. Table 8.7.1 Frequencies for \"Where do you get most of your medical information?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 61 11 24 4 63 16 16 5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Doctor Friends/family Internet Pharmacy Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Where do you get most of your medical information?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty Livingston County Poverty 179 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.8 Personal physician Respondents were asked if they had a personal physician. For Livingston County, 88% of respondents indicated that they had a personal physician. Logit regression analyses reveal that people with higher incomes, women and older people positively impacted whether someone had a personal physician, and homelessness had a negative impact on whether someone had a personal physician. Table 8.8.1 Frequencies for \"Do you have a personal physician?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 88 82 12 18 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Livingston County Poverty Percentage of Respondents Frequencies for \"Do you have a personal physician?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty No Yes 180 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Numerous significant relationships exist between access to a personal p hysician and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she did not have a personal physician if they were homeless and was more likely to answer that he or she did have a personal physician if he or she was a woman, older, more educated, and earned more income. Table 8.8.2 Significant Correlations among Access to a Personal Physician and Demographic Variables 181 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 8.9 Type of Insurance Respondents were asked to identify the type of ins urance that they had. In Livingston County, the most prevalent type of insurance is private or commercial, however, those living in poverty are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid or have no insurance. Table 8.9.1 Frequencies for Insurance Coverage for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty Access to Health Care: Strategic Implications Approximately 70% of people living in deep poverty seek medical services at a clinic or doctor's office. For this segment of the population, while 8% seek medical services from an emergency department, approximately 18 % will not seek any medical services at all or \"other\" non-traditional sources of care. Those most likely to not seek any medical services when sick include males, younger individuals, and individuals with lower incomes. 35% of the population living in deep poverty indicated there was a time in the last year when they were not able to get medical care when needed. According to regression results, this was more likely among individuals who were younger, less educated, possessed lower income, and were homeless. The leading causes were lack of insurance and inability to afford a copayment or deductible. Similar results were found for access to prescription medication. Regression results indicated that homeless individuals and individuals of Latino/a ethnicity were less likely to have access to necessary prescription medication.

While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous disea ses, including heart disease, 56% of Livingston County residents had a checkup in the last year. Specifically, individuals who were younger, were of non-White ethnicity, possessed less education, possessed less income, and were homeless were less likely to visit a dentist. Moreover, note that almost half of people living in poverty (49%) indicated that they needed dental care in the last year, but were not able to get it. Lack of dental insurance and inability to afford cop ayments were the leading causes. Approximately 22% of people living in deep poverty indicated they were not able to get counseling when they needed it over the last 12 months. Leading indicators are males, less education, lower income, and homelessness. While affordability and insurance were the leading reasons, embarrassment were also significant barriers to mental health services. Across categories, residents of Livingston County get most of their medical information from doctors and the next most prevalent is the Internet. The most prevalent type of insurance is private or commercial, however, those living in poverty are disproportionately more reliant on Medicaid. Also for those living in poverty, 30% do not have any type of insurance at all. 183 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment CHAPTER 9. H EALTHY BEHAVIORS In this chapter, healthy behaviors of the community are presented. Specifically, frequency of physical exercise, healthy eating habits and smo king are examined. Additionally, overall self -perceptions of health are presented. 9.1 Physical Exercise Respondents were asked how frequently they engage in physical exercise. The majority of the population across all categories does not engage in su fficient exercise. Note that these findings are more consistent with state averages when compared to data reported by the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. For physical exercise, ordinary-least-square regression results show that younger people, Black ethnicity, homelessness and less educated people are less likely to engage in physical exercise, while homeless residents are not. Numerous significant relationships exist between physical exercise and demographic variables. Specif ically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she exercised regularly if they were male, possessed higher income, and were more educated. Table 9.1.1 Frequencies for \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 41 45 27 28 22 19 10 8 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Livingston County Poverty Frequencies for \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad2 times 3-\u00ad5 times More than 5 times 184 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 9.1.2 Significant Correlations among \"In the last week, how many times did you exercise?\" and Demographic Variables Age - Education + Income + 9.2 Healthy Eating For healthy eating habits, about 29% of the population consumes at least three servings of fruits/vegetables in a day. Moreover, only about 4% of the population consumes the minimal recommended daily amount of vegetables. These findings are inconsistent with the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, as the BRFSS data suggests approximately 15% of Livingston County residents consume 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Additional research by the CDC states that for a typical person consuming 2,200 calories per day, they should have 7 servings of vegetables. 185 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 9.2.1 Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty Table 9.2.2 Significant Correlations among Number of Servings of Fruits and Vegetables Consumed Daily and Demographic Variables Gender + Age + Education + Income + Homeless - 8 14 63 64 25 18 4 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Livingston County Poverty Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many servings of fruits and/or vegetables do you eat?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad2 servings 3-\u00ad5 servings More than 5 servings 186 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Numerous significant relationships exist between consumption of fruits and vegetables and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she consumed more fruits and vegetables each day if they were had earned a higher income , had attained higher levels of education , were female, and were older. Homeless individuals were less likely to consume more fruits and vegetables. 9.3 Smoking Youth tobacco use in Livingston County exceeds the State of Illinois averages , as seen in the secondary research presented earlier in this report. Primary data sugges ts that individuals living in poverty are significantly more likely to smoke. Note that when comparing these data to the Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, the CHNA survey assesses the frequency of smoking compared to whether a resp ondent smoked or did not smoke. Table 9.3.1 Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many cigarettes do you smoke?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 80 56 4 9 4 7 5 12 7 16 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Livingston County Poverty Frequencies for \"On a typical day, how many cigarettes do you smoke?\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty None 1-\u00ad4 5-\u00ad8 9-\u00ad12 More than 12 187 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Table 9.3.2 Significant Correlations among Number of Cigarettes Smoked Daily and Demographic Variables Age - Race (White) - Race (Black) + Education - Income - Homeless + Numerous significant relationships exist between cigarette smoking and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answ er that he or she smoked more cigarettes each day if they identified with Black ethnicity, were younger, were homeless, were less educated, and earned less income. Individuals of White ethnicity were less likely to smoke. 188 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 9.4 Overall Health In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, 91% of the population indicated that they were in average or good physical health. Similar results were found for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. Table 9.4.1 Frequencies for \"Overall, my physical health is __\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 9 22 41 44 50 34 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Livingston County Poverty Frequencies for \"Overall, my physical health is __\" for Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty Poor Average Good 189 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Numerous significant relationships exist between overall physical health and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed better physical health if they were of White ethnicity, earned a higher income and had attained higher levels of education. Conversely, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed poorer physical health if they were homeless or identified with Latino/a ethnicity. Table 9.4.2 Significant Correlations among Overall Physical Health and Demographic Variables White + Latino/a - Education + Income + Homeless - Table 9.4.3 Frequencies for \"Overall, my mental health is __\" Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty 5 12 24 37 71 51 0 20 40 60 80 Livingston County Poverty Frequencies for \"Overall, my mental health is __\" Livingston County and Individuals Living in Poverty Poor Average Good 190 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Numerous significant relationships exist between overall mental health and demographic variables. Specifically, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or sh e possessed better mental health if they were older, earned a higher income, and had attained higher levels of education. Conversely, a survey respondent was more likely to answer that he or she possessed poorer mental health if they were homeless. Table 9.4.4 Significant Correlations among Overall Mental Health and Demographic Variables Age + Education + Income + Homeless - Healthy Behaviors: Strategic Implications For healthy behaviors, Livingston County residents who were younger, possessed higher income, or were more educated are more likely to engage in physical exercis e, although 32% of the population engages in exercise at least 3 times a week. Similarly for healthy eating habits, about 29% of the population consumes at least three servin gs of fruits/vegetables in a day. Those that are more likely to have healthy eating habits include females, older individuals, people with higher education and more income, and individuals who are not homeless . Given the documented research showing the benefits of physical exercise and healthy eating, this is a concern for the community, as most primary and secondary diagnoses in the Livingston County community can be mitigated, to some extent, by healthy lifestyle. Data suggests smoking is a concern in Livingston County, with individuals identifying with Black ethnicity, who were younger, were homeless, were less educated, and earning less income as being more likely to smoke. In terms of self -perceptions of physical and mental health, 91% of the population indicated that they were in average or good physical health. Similar results were found for residents' self -perceptions of mental health. 191 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment PHASE III - PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES The identification and prioritization of the most impo rtant health-related issues in Livingston County are identified in Phase III. To accomplish this, a summary of Phase I and Phase II were performed to provide a foundation for the prioritization process. After summarizing all of the issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive assessment of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which health-related issues were being addressed. Finally a collaborative team of leaders in the healthcare community used an importance/urgency methodology to identify the most critical issues in the area. Results are included in Chapter 10. CHAPTER 10. P RIORITIZATION OF HEALTH -RELATED ISSUES In this chapter, we identify the most critical health -related needs in the community. To accomplish this, first we identified the most important areas of concern. Next we completed a comprehensive inventory of community resources, and finally we identified the most important health concerns in the community. Specific criteria used to identify these issues included: (1) magnitude to the community; (2) strategic importance to the community; (3) existing community resources; (4) potential for impact; and (5) trends and future forecasts. 10.1 Summary of Community Health Issues Based on findings from the previous analyses, a chapter-by-chapter summary of key takeaways was necessary to provide a foundation to identify the most important health -related issues in the community. Considerations for identifying key takeaways included prevalence of the issues, importance to the community, impact, trends and projected growth. Demographics (Chapter 1) - Three factors were identified as the most important areas of concern from the demographic analyses: increasing elderly population, mental health rates and poverty. Insurance (Chapter 2) - Lack of insurance contributes to decreased accessibility to health care, including both medical and dental insurance. Symptoms and Predictors (Chapter 3) - Based on prevalence and growth rates, factors were identified as having significant impact on the community. These include obesity, hypertension and risky behaviors, including drug and alcohol abuse and smoking. Diseases/Morbidity (Chapter 4) - By evaluating magnitude of morbidities and growth rates of morbidities, several specific issues were identified. These included asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes (specifically Type II diabetes) , hypertension and women's health and men's health. 192 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment Mortality (Chapter 5) - The two leading causes of mortality were heart disease and cancer. While there were other categories for mortality, heart disease and cancer were significantly more prevalent than all other categories. Characteristics of Survey Respondents (Chapter 6) - Not applicable for this analysis. Community Misperceptions (Chapter 7) - Based on results from the survey, respondents to the survey incorrectly perceived \"heart disease\" \"diabetes\" \"dental health\" and \"teen pregnancy\" as being relatively unimportant health concerns in the community. Access to Health Services (Chapter 8) - Results from survey respondents defined as living in deep poverty indicated that access to healthcare service s is limited. This includes medical, prescription, dental and mental healthcare. Health-Related Behaviors (Chapter 9) - Results from survey respondents defined as living in deep poverty indicated that there are limited efforts at proactively managing one's own health. This includes limited exercise, poor eating habits and increased incidence of smoking Identification of Health-Rela ted Community Issues. In order to provide parsimony in the prioritization of key community health -related issues, results are aggregated into 13 key categories. Based on similarities and duplication, the 13 areas are: o Obesity o Risky Behavior-Substance Abuse o Mental Health o Healthy Behavior/Nutrition o Access to Health Services o Respiratory Issues -Asthma and Pneumonia o Heart Disease o Cancer o Diabetes o Community Health Misperceptions o Dental o Women's Health o Men's Health 10.2 Community Resources After summarizing issues in the Community Health Needs Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of existing community resources was performed to identify the efficacy to which these 13 health-related issues were being addressed. 193 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment There are numerous forms of resources in the community.

Table 10.2 illustrates the relationships between the community resources and the 13 summary areas identified in section 10.1. Assessment of these relationships was performed to identify potential gaps in coverage as the collaborative team prioritized health -related issues in the community. Table 10.2 Relationship between Community Resources and Community Needs 199 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment 10.3 Prioritization of Community Health-Related Issues In order to prioritize the previously identified dimensions, the collaborative team considered health needs based on: (1) short-term urgency - issues that need immediate attention; and (2) long-term strategic importance - issues that will have the most significant impact on the future health of the community. Additional considerations included the magnitude of the issues (e.g., what percentage of the population was impacted by the issue), growth rate or proj ected trend of the issue, magnitude to the community, existing community resources, and the potential to make a significant impact to the community. Using these criteria, the collaborative team prioritized the previously identified health issues. Result s can be seen in Figure 10.3.

There was a 16% growth in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (34.6%) and 2009 (40.2%). For comparison, there was a 9% growth in the percentage of Illinois residents reporting they were overweight between 2006 (24.7%) and 2009 (26.8%). Also note that Illinois is ranked as the sixth worst state in the U.S. in terms of obesity. HEALTHY BEHAVIORS According to the BRFSS, 29.9% of Livingston County residents report that their last routine checkup was more than 1 year ago. This figure is over 10% higher than State of Illinois average (19.2%). Results from survey respondents indicated that there are limited efforts at proactively managing one's own health. This includes limited exercise, as 68% of Livingston County residents indicated they exercised 2 or less times per week. With regard to eating habits, 71% of Livingston County residents consume less than 2 servings of fruits/vegetables per day. With regard to smoking, 35% of Livingston County residents living in poverty smoke 5 or more cigarettes per day. However, note that 91% of respondents believe they are average or above average in terms of physical health and 95% of respondents believe they are average or above average in terms of mental health. M ENTAL HEALTH Approximately 20% of residents in Livingston County reported they had experienced 1 -7 days with poor mental health per month between 2007 and 2009. For both segments of residents (those experiencing 1-7 days and 8-30 days with poor mental health per month), each was slightly below the state average for the same time frame. Mental health was also rated the second most important health concern in the community for both the aggregate population as well as those living in poverty. RISKY BEHAVIORS -SUBSTANCE ABUSE Youth subst ance usage in Livingston County exceeds the State of Illinois averages for 12th graders (alcohol and tobacco usage). There was a 3% increase in the growth rate the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting they were at risk for binge drinking bet ween 2006 (22.0%) and 2009 (22.7%). For comparison, there was a 10% decrease in the growth rate Illinois residents reporting they were at risk for binge drinking between 2006 (19.4%) and 2009 (17.5%). There was an 18% increase the growth rate of Livingston County residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (24.3%) and 2009 (28.7%). For comparison, there was an 8% 201 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs Assessment decrease in the growth rate of Illinois residents reporting they were current smokers between 2006 (20.5%) and 2009 (18.8%). Additionally, according to survey respondents, for both Livingston County's aggregate population and those living in poverty, drug and alcohol abuse were perceived as the most prevalent unhealthy behaviors in the community. DENTAL While significant research exists linking dental care to numerous diseases, including heart disease, according to survey results, less than 50% of the aggregate Livingston County population had a checkup in the last year. Moreover, there was growth in the percentage of Livingston County residents reporting their last dental visit was more than 2 years ago between 2006 (21.9%) and 2009 (22.3%). These percentages are higher than S tate of Illinois averages, where in 2006, 17.2% had not seen a dentist in 2+ years and in 2009, 19.8% had not seen a dentist in 2+ years. COMMUNITY MISPERCEPTIONS Based on results from the survey, respondents incorrectly perceived \"diabetes ,\" \"heart disease,\" \"teen pregnancy,\" and \"dental\" as being relatively less important health concerns to the community. These results conflict with morbidity data that suggest diabetes growth rates in Livingston County are higher than growth rates across the State of Illinois; mortality data that indicates heart disease is the leading cause of death in Livingston County; teen pregnancy rates in Livingston County (11.9%) that exceed the State of Illinois rate (9.6%) for 2009; and the aforementioned dental data suggesting 22.3% of Livingston County residents have not seen a dentist in two or more years. Note that while other factors, such as heart disease, diabetes, women's and men's health, access to health, respiratory issues and cancer are all important attributes, in terms of importance and urgency, the collaborative team rated the other six categories as more important. As a validity check, note that the findings f rom this study are similar with the health assessments completed by the County Health Department. 202 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs # # # # ##Kidney#disease # ##Birth#defects# # # # # # # # # ##Lead#poisoning# #Cancer# # # # # # # # # # ##Liver#disease# ##Chronic#pain # # # # # # # ## ##Lung#disease#(asthma) # ##Dental#health# ## # # # # # # #Mental#health#issues#such#as# # ##Diabetes ## # # # # # # # # depression,#anger,#etc # ##Heart#disease/heart#attack# ## # # # # #Obesity/overweight# # ##HIV/AIDS# ## # # # # # # # #Sexually#transmitted#infections # #Infant#death# # # # # # # # # #Stroke# ##Infectious/contagious#diseases# such#as #flu,## # # #Teenage#pregnancy# # # # #Other#___________________________________ # ## # # # # # # # # # # # II.)UNHEALTHY) BEHAVIORS) # Please#identify#the#three )(3))most)important)un health y)behaviors #in#the#community.## ##Angry#behavior/violence # ##Not#able#to#get#a#routine#checkup## # ##Alcohol #abuse ## # # # # # # ##Poor#eating#habits # ##Child#abuse ## # # # # # # # #Reckless#driving # ##Domestic#violence # # # # # # # #Smoking# ##Don't#use#seatbelts# # # # # # # # #Suicide # ##Drug#abuse# ## # # # # #(physical,#emotional,#finan cial,#sexual) ## #Other#___________________________________ # ##Lack#of#exercise ## # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # III.)ISSUES)WITH) QUALITY)OF) LIFE# Please#identify#the#three )(3))most)important)factors)that)impact)your)quality)of)life#in#the#community.## # ###Access#to#health#services# # # ###Good#public#transportation # ###Affordable# #housing## # # # # # # ###Healthy#food#choices# # ###Availability#of#child#care # # # # # # ###Less#poverty # ###Better#school#attendance # # # # # # ###Safer#neighborhoods/schools## # ###Job#opportunities ## # # # # # # #Other#___________________________________ # 203 Saint James Hospital Community Health -Needs #I#didn't#know#how#to#find#a#doctor.# # #Fear ## # # # # # # .## #Fear .## # # #Too#long#to#wait#for#appointment .## #Other#______________________________________ # ## # 204 Saint .## #Fear .## # # # # # # #Too#long#to#wait#for#appointment .## #Embarrassment.# # # # # # ##Average Hospital Community Health # # # #Black/African#American# # #Hispanic/Latino ## # # # # # Bradley#University#Institutional#Review#Board#(IRB)#in#May#2012. # # "}
