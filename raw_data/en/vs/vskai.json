Governor Anthony Brown and I have been honored to meet and learn from Maryland farmers and others who are invested, as we are, in sustaining andgrowing our state's leading industry - agriculture. A prosperous and thriving agricultural industry is so important to our shared priorities of strengthening our family farms and businesses and improving the health of our families and the Chesapeake Bay. Agriculture is facing many challenges in these tough times. But these challenges offer unique opportunities such as meeting an increasing demand for locally gr own and organically grown food, preserving our valuable farmland before it's lost to deve lopment, and balancing profitability while at the same time using the best research available to protect the environment. Maryland farmers continue to set an outstanding example of stewardship for the rest of our state. Even in thesetough budget times, we have providedfull funding for farmland preservationprograms and strong funding for conservation cost-share programs tohelp farmers reach the Bay goals. Formore than 25 years, Maryland farmershave engaged in conservation activitiessuch CREP , cover crop and the installationof a record number of best managementpractices this year. Online programs likeBayStat, GreenPrint, and now AgPrintdemonstrate the real progress farmershave made in Maryland for resourceconservation and water quality. At the state level, we are making sure there is a level regulatory playing fieldacross the nation. I have contacted EPAAdministrator Lisa Jackson directly onnumerous occasions to make sure that Maryland's family farms and businesses receive fair and equaltreatment in its animal feeding operation and other environmental regulatory programs. We cannothave one regulatory standard for farmers in Maryland and another lower standard in other states. We remain as committed as ever to protecting farmland and ensuring that family farming remains profitable by expanding marketing opportunities. T o that end, we are encouraging more Marylandersto \"buy local\" through our Maryland's Best branding initiative, which is designed to kindle a greaterawareness that food that is farmed, fished, and raised locally makes for healthier plates, a healthierplanet, and happier taste buds. The campaign has been very successful in raising sales and consumptionof local products at schools, restaurants, institutions, grocery stores, and farmers' markets as a way toimprove the health of our residents and the profitability of farmers. We have also planted a food garden at Government House through a partnership with the University of Maryland Extension and Maryland Department of Agriculture to promote their \"Grow It Eat It\"campaign. It encourages Maryland families to improve health and save money by growing fresh vegetables, fruits and herbs at home using sustainable practices. | Message from Governor Martin O'Malley |4For the last four years, part of our mission has been to strengthen and growMaryland's family-owned b usinesses and farms. Because we understand thefundamental importance of financing tofarm businesses, we are committed to funding the Maryland Agricultural &Resource-Based Industry DevelopmentCorporation. We are also fighting forincreased energy efficiency and reducedpropane dependency through ourEmPOWER Maryland Farm EnergyAudit Program - now available for allagricultural producers in Maryland -which should save Maryland farmers$4.35 million over the next decade. With the help of the Maryland Congressional delegation, we receivedfederal drought designations in 2009 to help Maryland farmers who sufferedcrop loss from drought or vomitoxincontamination. Also with help from our Congressional delegation, we have secured nearly $2.5 million through the Dairy Economic Loss Assistance Payment program, along with FSA loan reliefand MILC payments of $5.8 million for our dairy farmers, who continue to bear a disproportionateburden of this recession. I want to commend the agricultural community for its conservation leadership and for producing the high quality food we enjoy. We appreciate their perseverance during these challenging times. Thank you for allowing me to serve you. I thank you for joining me and Lt. Governor Brown in protecting our shared priorities as we seek, together as One Maryland, a stronger, smarter, and moresustainable future. T ogether we are choosing a smarte r, greener and growing future for agriculture, the bay and for our children. Sincerely, Martin O'Malley Governor Governor Martin O'Malley meets with dairy farmers during the Great Frederick Fair to discuss issues facing the industry during a period of economic distress.| Message from Governor Martin O'Malley |5Dear Friends The Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost- Share program has just completed a milestone -25 years of helping farmers improve the soil and water quality through the installation of on-farm bestmanagement practices (BMPs). The commitment ofMaryland farmers to soil and water conservation alongwith Governor O'Malley's commitment to funding,even in these difficult economic times, and transparentreporting combines to protect water quality while thefarming sector re mains vibrant and profitable. The agricultural conservation e thic illustrated through 25 years of MACS provides a healthy, local food supply,strengthens our economy, keeps farming profitable and of course protects the environment for the benefitof all Marylanders. At the end of the 25th year of the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share program, the data for thisprogram alone illustrate how invested farmers are inmaking sure that they do the best they can to protect theenvironment. Governor O'Malley's data-driven report-ing system, BayStat, shows that agriculture is makingprogress toward its Bay cleanup goals. Please take a minute to scan the feature on the MACS program in the following pages and www.baystat.maryland.gov to learn moreabout the progress toward Maryland's Chesapeake Bayrestoration goals. As residents of the Bay watershed, weall have an impact on our streams and the Bay and we all must help clean it up. While Chesapeake Bay restoration is of the highest priority, MDA has a broader mission. Through our education, regulation, preservation, promotion and se rvice activities residents can expect a clean and healthy environment and food supply, fairness in the marketplace and that agriculture remains astrong economic force. Some of the department's many accomplishments in 2009 included: Purchasing 75 new easements on 8,332 acres by combining FY 2009 and 2010 funds. Expanding marketing opportunities for local products through the Farm to School, buy-local, and farmers' market initiatives as well as Governor and First Lady O'Malley's Buy Local Cookout. Working with the Maryland Department of the Environment and farmers to develop a new Animal Feeding Operation program that is workable for farmers and meets federal and state regulatory objectives. Developing a new leasing program to encourage the expansion of aquaculture in the Chesapeake Bay. Advancing the Statewide Plan for Agriculture by accomplishing 102 of 109 initiatives in the planand planning a second Forum to develop a new 15-year plan for Maryland agriculture. Containing the emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, and other insect pests and invasive plants thatcould damage our forests and ecosystems. | Message from Secretary Earl F. Hance |6Assisting in obtaining crop disaster designations due to a drought and vomitoxin contamination ofwinter grains. Establishing a regulatory action web page to addtransparency to MDA enforcement actions across all programs. Initiating, with First Lady Katie O'Malley and theUniversity of Maryland Home and GardenInformation Center Master Gardeners, a Grow It-Eat It backyard food gardening campaign. The 2007 Census of Agriculture illustrated that Maryland agriculture and related industries are changing as farmers respond to new markets, new conservation technologies, and many other businessconsiderations. This is an exciting time for us at MDA as consumers become more involved in their food purchasing decisions, making connections between thefarm and their fork. I am honored to serve the citizens ofMaryland, the Executive Branch, and the GeneralAssembly of Maryland State Government. Working together, we are creating a smart, green and growing future for agriculture and for all Marylanders. Sincerely, Earl F. Hance SecretaryMaryland Department of Agriculture| Message from Secretary Earl F. Hance | USDA Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan and Sec. Buddy Hance read to children and serve them breakfast at a day care center in Montgomery County to kick off PresidentObama's Summer of Service and draw attention to USDA food and nutrition programs.A lot has changed in 25 years. In 1984, most of the conservation practices funded by MACS were used to control soil erosionand reduce the devastating effects of sedimentation in theChesapeake Bay and its tributaries. T oday, farmers areinstalling state-of-the-art waste management systems andinnovative heavy use areas for poultry and livestock operationsaimed at curbing nutrient movement into surface and ground-water. Many of these systems - which can cost upwards of$100,000 - are now required by regulation for certain animaloperations. In recent years, our Cover Crop Program has expanded in both popularity and scope thanks to new, dedicated fundingbeing provided by the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund andthe Chesapeake Bay 2010 Trust Fund. A rising star in agricul-ture's efforts to minimize soil losses over the winter andreduce nutrient runoff from crop fields, cover crops plantedon Maryland farms saved 1.17 million pounds of nitrogen and47,800 pounds of phosphorus from entering Maryland water-ways this year. They are prominently featured in GovernorO'Malley's suite of ambitious two-year milestones aimed ataccelerating the Bay cleanup. Cover crops alone are expectedto achieve one-third of the Governor's nutrient reduction goals. But the cumulative efforts of the MACS program speak for themselves: farmers have used about $14 million of their ownmoney to match about $100 million of cost-share funding toinstall and maintain more than 20,000 conservation projectssince 1984. That equates to almost 2.5 BMPs each and everyday for 25 years. As Maryland ramps up its efforts to achieveeven greater nutrient savings for the Bay, MACS will continueto help Maryland farmers lead the way toward a smart, greenand growing future.In 2009, MDA marked its 25th year of extraordinary success in helping farmers protect water quality in thestreams and rivers that feed our great Chesapeake Bay. More than just another government incentive program, theMaryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share (MACS)Program is the cornerstone of Maryland's efforts to protectnatural resources and Governor Martin O'Malley's plan toaccelerate the Bay cleanup. MACS provides farmers with thefinancial resources they need to place conservation practiceson their farms to control soil erosion, manage nutrients,protect wildlife habitat and ensure the health and safety ofall Maryland waterways. MACS has grown tremendously over the last quarter century and farmer interest and action in protecting natural resources has reached unprecedented levels. Despite the recent economic downturn, 2009 was ourmost successful year on record. T o put matters into perspective, back in 1984 MACS provided Maryland farmers with $434,000 in grants to install roughly130 conservation projects on their farms. This year, MACSprovided Maryland farmers with a record $19 million ingrants to install 2,370 conservation projects on their farms.Farmers who received MACS grants over the last 25 yearsinvested more than $14 million of their own money into these conservation projects and must shoulder additionalmaintenance and upkeep expenses for a minimum of 10 years. Such action on the part of Maryland farmers dispels the notion that conservation takes a back seat - even in tougheconomic times.Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share (MACS) Program 7Celebrating Years of Conservation Programs | Celebrating 25 Years of Conservation Programs | Mr. Lloyd Allen, a Kent County farmer and first MACS participantreceives a symbolic check in 1984.Left to right: Wayne A.

The Maryland Agricultural Commission The Maryland Agriculture Commission is the advisory group to the Maryland Secretary of Agriculture. Thereare 30 members on the Commission with representation from each of the State's major commodity groups: Poultry,dairy, equine, nursery, etc. as well as representatives from theUniversity of Maryland, consumer interests, food processingand various other agricultural business segments. The Commission holds monthly meetings and discusses issues of agricultural consequence. This year the Commission hadnotable speakers and subsequent in-depth discussion on thesubjects of: agriculture-related University programs; the the green industryin Maryland: H1N1 novel flu virus; the history of water quality issues and programs; MDA Animal Health Diagnosticlaboratories; the Forestry Summit; and a presentation on forest certification and chain of custody. These topics along with reports from each of the commodity and business groups represented on the Commission keep thegroup proactive with agricultural issues and assure the fulfillmentof the Commission's statutory mission. In addition, theCommission held its bi-annual farm tours in Prince George'sand Charles counties in the spring and Somerset andWicomico counties in the fall. The Commission continues to work actively on the implementation of the Statewide Plan for Agriculture andResource Management. This document was developedthrough a year-long grassroots process led by the Commissionto guide agricultural policy into the future. One hundred andtwo of the 109 recommendations are either completed orunderway. The Commission is planning a second forum todevelop a new 15-year plan for Maryland agriculture.Office of the Attorney General Staff of the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) represents the department on behalf of the State Officeof the Attorney General and provides legal representation and advice. The office routinely provides legal assistance to the boards and units within the department, reviews regulations proposed by various units within the departmentfor legal sufficiency, and assists in producing educational programs for department staff. In 2009, the office: Provided legal services to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. With nearly 2,000 land preservationeasements held statewide, this important program faces anever growing number of problems that call for legal services,including issues over the termination of easements, easementenforcement and easement arbitration appeals before thelocal Property Tax Assessment Appeals Board. Assisted the State Board of Veterinary Examiners in licensing and disciplinary matters. Assisted the Nutrient Management Program in its effort to bring farmers into compliance with the program.This program regulates farmers who are required by statelaw to have nutrient management plans for their farms orbe subject to civil penalties that the department collects.The office handles any appeal hearings before the Office ofAdministrative Hearings, or further appeals to a court. Provided staff support in litigation over the NationalT obacco Grower Settlement Trust. Provided legal support to the Tri-County Council forSouthern Maryland in the tobacco buyout program. Provided legal advice to soil conservation districts. 10| Office of the Secretary | The Maryland Agricultural Commission visits the Holland Family's Chesapeake Bay Farmsstore near Berlin in Worcester County.The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (MALPF) was created by the MarylandGeneral Assembly in 1977 to preserve productive agricultural and forested land that provides for the continuedproduction of food and fiber for the present and future citizensof the state. Preservation of agricultural and forested landhelps to curb the expansion of random urban development,protect wildlife and preserve the environmental quality of theChesapeake Bay and its tributaries. If a landowner's property meets the minimum eligibility criteria for soils, size, and location as established in statute, thelandowner may apply to sell an agricultural land preservationeasement to MALPF. An easement restricts the land to agricultural use in perpetuity, limits in perpetuity the ability of the land to be subdivided or developed for residential,commercial, or industrial use, and requires good stewardshippractices. The Foundation made 75 new easement offers on8,332 acres using FY 2009 and 2010 funds combined for theFY 2009 easement acquisition cycle. MALPF now has purchased or has pending offers to purchase easements on a cumulative total of about 2,079 properties,permanently preserving approximately 283,000 acres. By combining FY 2009 and 2010 appropriations, MALPF was ableto commit almost $50 million to purchase easements duringthis period, including almost $10 million in federal matchingfunds. Real estate transfer tax revenues are the primary sourceof MALPF funding, and because real estate values and thenumber of real estate transactions have declined, fundingavailable to purchase easements has declined.The General Assembly adop ted new legislation affecting MALPF during the 2009 legislative session. The most importantchange for the future of the program was to give the MALPFBoard of Trustees the authority to initiate and assess civilpenalties in cases of willful and serious violations of the deedof easement. Senate Bill 89 allows the imposition of a civilpenalty of up to $2,500 per violation each day until the violation is resolved, up to a maximum of $50,000 for eachadministrative hearing. The law gives a landowner a reasonableamount of time to bring the property back into compliancewith the easement before any administrative hearing or civilpenalty is imposed. New certification requirements from the Agricultural Stewardship Act of 2006 and House Bill 1354 (2007) went into effect on July 1, 2008. Regulations were developed toimplement the statutory changes and became effective January 26, 2009. As of September 2009, all county certificationprograms had been reviewed under the changed requirementsand brought into compliance with the certification regulations.As a result of the most recent reviews, three counties were fullyrecertified, 12 counties were conditionally recertified, and onecounty had its recertification request denied. Currently, 15 ofMaryland's 23 counties have certified local agricultural landpreservation programs. MALPF also partners with other state agencies and local governments to meet a leg islative goal (SJ 10, 2002) of preserving 1,030,000 acres of agricultural land by 2022. As of January 1,2009, Maryland has preserved almost 535,000 acres of agricul-tural land under MALPF, Rural Legacy, GreenPrint, and through local land preservation andtransfer of development rights programs. | Office of the Secretary | The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation 11Permanently preserved farmland protected through the MALPF easement purchase program. The headquarters projects will have significant environmental impact by reducing greenhouse gases including 2.98 millionpounds of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is equivalent to theamount of CO2 emitted by powering 120 homes, within thelife of the 14-year contract. Other reductions include: 7,600pounds of NOx, 21,900 pounds of SOx. Other projects include: Working with the South River Federation to install three bioretention areas on MDA and Anne Arundel Countyproperty that are helping to capture and filter stormwaterand non-point source runoff that flows into Broad Creekand South River. Recycling approximately 45.5 tons of materials that included: mixed paper, 15.8 tons; cardboard, 16 tons;landscape debris, 10 tons; car batteries 0.5 tons; and automobile tires, 1.6 tons in FY09 plus aluminum (128 pounds ), toner cartridges and plastic bottles. Fiscal Services handles all centralized accounting transactionsfor the department. This encompasses all phases of thebudget, grants management, accounts receivable, accountspayable and leave management. The office has continued itsfine record of paying 99.5 percent of MDA bills on time asdefined by state \"on-time\" guidelines.The Office of Administrative Services manages all technical and support services for the department.It is comprised of three sections\u2014Central Services, Fiscal Services, and the Human Resource Office. The department has approximately 500 permanent and seasonal employees and the Human Resource Office facilitatesthe recruitment, training, appropriate compensation, andretention of qualified individuals. Programs and services for employees include risk management and total qualitymanagement, employee leave bank, teleworking, wellness,blood drives, training and employee recognition. Central Services manages facilities, records, inventory, telecommunications, warehousing, the agency motor fleet andthe distribution of supplies and mail. The office also overseesdepartmental procurement and is responsible for the maintenanceand repair of 331,600 square feet of facilities on 40.5 acres ofowned and leased facilities throughout the state. The maintenancestaff implements energy-saving projects wherever possible.A recycling program uses compost piles to transform organicwaste into mulch, which is utilized in landscaping projects atMDA. The motor pool provides quality maintenance andrepairs of the department's 284 vehicles in addition to semi-annual inspections on all vehicles. The MDA fleet traveledmore than 2.7 million miles last year. Central Services provides procurement assistance throughout the department; continues to improve management practicesand automate data concerning motor vehicle operating costs,telephone costs and billing, inventory control and minorityprocurement; and continues to incorporate the financial management information system to improve monitoring,ordering, and delivery of goods and services. In FY09, MDA initiated an energy efficiency performance contract that will save MDA more than $4.36 million over 14 years. All project costs will be funded through guaranteedenergy-related savings as MDA 's headquarters building implements the O'Malley Administration's goal to reducepower consumption by 15 percent by the year 2015. The MDAheadquarters building projects include solar panels, lightingretrofit upgrades, water conservation retrofits, building envelope improvements, renewable technology, HV ACupgrades, direct digital controls, facility maintenance services, and measurement and verification services. 12| Office of the Secretary | The Office of Administrative Services MDA worked with the South River Federation to install three rain garden/ bioretention areas on the grounds that are helping to capture and filterstormwater and non-point source runoff that flows into Broad Creek and theSouth River.The Public Information and Outreach offices reach out to the media, general public, government agency peers,elected officials, the agriculture industry, and to MDA employees with the intent of strengthening the appreciationand understanding of the importance of agriculture and MDAactivities to the everyday lives of Marylanders and to supportpolicy initiatives. A Schaefer Center Survey states that the public has an increasingly positive view of many of theagency's priority activities\u2014farmland preservation, purchaseof local products and environmental stewardship by farmers\u2014an indicator that public relations efforts at MDA may be having an impact over the long term. The most prominent events produced by the Public Information and Outreach offices in 2009 were the Buy-LocalCookout at the Governor's official residence in July to kick offBuy Local Challenge Week, the agency's \"exhibits\" at theMaryland State Fair in August, and the Farm-to-School launchin September. These events showcase the agency to thousandsof people and require the involvement of dozens if not hun-dreds of employees. The office represented MDA at a numberof events such as the Delmarva Chicken Festival, and theMaryland Municipal League, Maryland Association ofCounties, and the Maryland Farm Bureau conventions.During FY2009, staff distributed 243 news releases to approximately 300 news outlets and interested parties, whichgenerated approximately 775 logged calls from the media. Theoffice uses a media monitoring system to track and researchmedia contacts, to distribute news releases, maintain medialists for targeted stories, and to find news clippings of interestto the agency and its constituencies. Each day, news stories areclipped, linked to the agency's website and distributed to allstaff and other interested parties. During the year, the Public Information Office increased the agency's presence on the Internet, making it the first point of agency contact for more and more people. There wereapproximately 415,514 visits of which 65 percent were newvisitors during the year. The visitors viewed nearly 900,000pages. The activity increased steadily through the year. Theleading page views after the homepage were farmers' markets,jobs, licenses and permits and the daily news clippings.Without a designated agency web master, a team representingthe Information T echnology and Public Information officesand the Plant Protection and Weed Management Section keepsthe site up-to-date and determines ways to improve it. 13| Office of the Secretary | Public Information and Outreach Offices First Lady Katie O'Malley with volunteer Master Gardeners and University of Maryland Extension staff.

Other high-profile media inquiries included the new Maryland and federal animal feeding operation permit beingrequired of poultry and livestock producers; and the environ-mental accomplishments or impacts of agriculture, fundingfor the gypsy moth suppression program and consumer complaints related to the high price of gas and the amount offuel dispensed. Exciting new initiatives that the public information staff led in collaboration with other MDA offices, the University of Maryland, state and local agencies and related non-profitorganizations, were the Grow it-Eat it Backyard Food Gardeningcampaign and MDA 's involvement in the O'Malley/BrownAdministration's Capital for a Day community relations events. The public information staff launched an online regulatory action center to publicize the department's enforcement actions.The goal is to give the public a better under standing of how MDA protects consumers, businesses and the environment on a dailybasis. It is also intended to be a deterrent to future violationsof the law by the regulated agricultural community.Planning for emergency communications in the event of plant and animal disease outbreaks is an important component ofthe program. The Public Information Office was activelyinvolved in multi-agency efforts (Delmarva PoultryIndustries\u2014Health Departments Joint Task Force) to refineresponse and communications plans in the event of avianinfluenza outbreak on the Delmarva Peninsula.

For the first time, theCensus data were made available by watershed, or by the sixdigit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC), as defined by the U.S.Geological Survey. Additionally, the publication includeswatershed data from the 2002 Census of Agriculture todemonstrate the changes in land use, production practices and livestock distribution in the past five years. Census data were also made available by congressional district. Thecongressional district profiles show changes in key areas at thelocal level since the last census was taken in 2002. They includedata on such things as the number of farms and acres in farmland,the demographics of local farmers, livestock inventory, cropproduction, and total sales of agricultural products. In May 2009, NASS conducted the first-ever, wide-scale survey to measure the impact and importance of organic crops andlivestock products in the overall food supply and how it ismeeting the growing demand. The survey results will helpshape decisions regarding farm policy, funding allocations,availability of goods and services, community developmentand other key issues. The survey included farmers currentlyengaged in organic production as well as those making thetransition to organic agriculture. Survey results will be published in February 2010.

The results of the Census are availableonline at www.nass.usda.gov or www.agcensus.usda.gov.The Maryland Field Office of the U.S. Department ofAgriculture's (USDA) statistical agency, the NationalAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS), provides the public with data relating to the production of most cropsgrown and livestock raised in the state. Annual information isprovided on the general economic well being of the state'sagricultural sector. NASS statistics are used to administer andsupport USDA farm programs that benefit Maryland farmers,to determine the feasibility of new ventures affecting ourstate's farmers, and to direct program research and development. In 2008\u2014the most recent year that annual statistics are available for this report\u2014agriculture generated nearly $1.97billion in cash receipts for the state's farmers, not accountingfor the additional impact provided by related jobs and services.Maryland's leading cash commodities were broiler chickens,greenhouse/nursery products, milk and dairy products, corn,and soybeans. The Maryland Field Office of NASS estimatedthere were 12,850 farms in 2008 with an average size of 160acres. T otal land in farms in Maryland was 2.05 million acres,one-third of the state's entire land area. In February 2009, NASS published the results of its largest and most comprehensive data collection effort, the 2007Census of Agriculture. The Census, taken every five years,is a complete count of Maryland farms and the people whooperate them. The Census looks at land use and ownership,operator characteristics, pr oduction practices, income and expenditures and many other areas. It is the only source ofuniform, comprehensive agricultural data for every county in the state. Maryland farmers helped make the 2007 Censusof Agriculture the most successful count in history. The Census found that 61 percent of all Maryland farmers have internet access, up from 53 percent in 2002. For the firsttime in 2007, the census also looked at high-speed Internetaccess. Of those producers accessing the Internet, 55 percentreported having a high-speed connection. Other \"firsts\" in the 2007 Census include questions about on-farm energy generation, community-supported agriculture arrangementsand historic barns. 15| Office of the Secretary | USDA/National Agricultural Statistics Service Bonet Taylor with the Maryland office of the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service conducts a telephone survey to gather information from farmers.IT Services has completed a complete hardware refresh/ software upgrade encompassing all user workstations andlaptops across the entire department. All new hardware has dual core processors and 2GB RAM. Microsoft WindowsXP was chosen for the operating system after a problematicevaluation of Windows Vista. Microsoft Office 2007 replaced Office XP in the new machines. This was a significant upgrade for most of ourusers, but most have adapted very well to the new workingenvironment. WordPerfect Suite was not installed with thisupgrade, and IT services assisted users with the conversion ofold word processing documents into Word documents andExcel spreadsheets. A specific workshop was given by IT staffto demonstrate the conversion of Word Perfect labels intoWord labels, which represented one of the greater challengesin the conversion process. As new workstations came on line (both on the Local Area Network, and the Wide Area Network), they were coupledwith the Network Access Control (NAC) system that had been purchased, installed, configured, and tested prior to thecommencement of the migration project. This system has significantly improved the network security by not allowingany PC to connect to the network until NAC has verified that the system is current with Windows Security Update,the firewall is turned on, and anti-virus software is installed,running and its signatures are up to date. Workstations connected to MDA over the Wide Area Network (WAN) now have the ability to connect to the Novell Netwareoperating system and have file services available that were notpossible before the implementation of the NAC system. Thenumber of GroupWise mailboxes has also been increased toprovide MDA based e-mail services to WAN clients. Prior to the migration, laptops were not allowed to connect to the network, as it had been impossible to verify where aparticular unit had been used, if it was properly secured andupdated, and not virus/worm infected. All new laptops are alsoconfigured to authenticate to the NAC system, and, with thatin place, can now connect to the network. When laptops thatare not configured with the NAC software, try to attach to thenetwork they can still have limited access to the Internet, evenif they do not meet NAC's configuration requirements. Thiswill allow visitor to have Internet access for presentations, etc.,without risking the security of the network.As new hardware was distributed, the MDA Inventory System was updated and records now include the NAC address(es) of both the embedded standard network interface and thewireless interface (if present). This will greatly assist in network monitoring and trouble shooting An RSA SecureID server has also been purchased, installed and configured. This is the final piece necessary for MDAusers to have access to network resources, outside of MDA,over the Internet. Clients are issued a SecureID token whichgenerates a new six-digit password every minute, providingtwo factor authentication of users - \"something you know\"(user ID), plus \"something you have (the number generated bythe token). With a high speed Internet connection, users canlogin to MDA 's Virtual Private Network using their networkID and the password generated by the token. They are thenprompted for their usual network credentials, and after pass-ing the NAC verification process, users have full access to net-work resources including, files and Oracle databases In September, 2006, MDA shutdown 2/3 of the WAN remote sites connected to the MDA Headquarters' core network.Funding for these sites was derived from grants that were notrenewed. The primary expense was for the \"last mile\" FrameRelay circuits which were provided by Verizon, and connectedthe remote sites to network.Maryland services. Network.Marylandprovides data transport to and from MDA. This past year network Maryland initiated the Ethernet Everywhere (EE)service which now provides end to end connectivity and eliminates Verizon's \"last mile\" charges. All 24 previously shut down sites, Resource Conservation county offices, havebeen restored. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are currently playing an increased role in data definition and access. Association ofspecific point data (latitude and longitude) with databaseitems such as livestock herds, agricultural land, businessaddresses, and conservation practices is necessary to locateitems for graphical display and emergency management. FiveOracle database applications (farmland preservation, pesticidesensitive farmland, poultry flock registration, Maryland'sBest,and Weights & Measures device registration) have beendesigned or modified to include geo-referenced data (centroids).This will enable the use of appropriate tools to get the databaseinformation associated with specific points on a map. Thesemaps can be used for data verification or any number ofregulatory and information services. 16| Office of the Secretary | Office of Information TechnologyOne of the key responsibilities of MDA 's Office of Resource Conservation is to monitor and assist farmers in the managementof nutrients that are applied to cropland. It is an essentialcomponent of the Bay restoration programs. IT Services hasbeen working with the Resource Conservation Office and theUniversity of Maryland to develop a reporting system to aidfarmers submitting the annual implementation report (AIR),which is required as part of the management of their nutrientmanagement plan (NMP). The NuMan Reporter is a free software product available by request on CD, or on demandover the Internet. This product enables a farmer to take theinformation stored in NuManPro (another software productdeveloped by the University of Maryland), used to generatethe initial NMP , and quickly modify the data to reflect theactual amounts of nutrients applied to various crops raised on the properties covered under the NMP and the acreageassociated with each crop. The report also gathers informationabout manure production and transport as well as individualproperties that may have been added to the cropland used bythe farmer within the NMP during the past year. Once thereport is complete the farmer or consultant working with thefarmer, can upload an encrypted version of the data to MDA,where it is incorporated in to an Oracle database. Furtherenhancements to this software will make it an effective andefficient reporting tool. Providing licensing and registration data services to Maryland citizens is one of IT Services' top priorities. Numerous obstaclesmust be overcome to accomplish this goal. The first phase is tomake Oracle web-based services accessible to MDA employees.The second phase (public access) will require a complete re-design of these tools, with attention to the amount and typeof data accessed, as well as addressing the significantly largerissues associated with facing any application to the Internet.T o begin the first phase of this project, IT's ApplicationDevelopment Staff are learning the programming techniquesassociated with web-based systems deployed on an applicationserver. Open Source tools have been selected for applicationdevelopment (JBoss Developer Suite), as well as the applicationserver itself (JBoss Application Server). Staff will leverage theirexperience with Oracle's web based reporting tool (BI Publisher)to complete the suite of products necessary for the developmentof these applications.The MDA website (www.mda.state.md.us) is the primary interface between the citizens of Maryland and MDA over theInternet. This site has been completely re-designed to reflectcurrent web design standards as well as conform to the generalguidelines for Maryland state agencies. IT Services is working with the Office of Resource Conservation and an outside development team to produce the MarylandNutrient Trading web-site. According to the site, \"Nutrienttrading is a form of exchange (buying & selling) of nutrientreduction credits. These credits have a monetary value thatmay be paid to the seller to install best management practicesthat reduce nitrogen or phosphorous. In general, water qualitytrading utilizes a market-based approach that offers greateropportunity for buyer and seller to exchange credits. It allowsone source to meet and/or maintain its regulatory obligationsby using pollution reductions created by another source at alower cost\" (http://mdnutrienttrading.org/). The site is currently on line, but only providing information at this time.It is scheduled to be fully functional within a year IT staff have dedicated significant time in the maintenance and enhancement of the other MDA sponsored websites includingthe Maryland Seafood website (www.marylandseafood.org),and the Maryland's Best website (www.marylandsbest.net).In addition, significant staff time has been committed to Help Desk user support (hardware and software), networkadministration/management, as well as database applicationmanagement and support. 17| Office of the Secretary |The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Office of Resource Conservation (RC) works closely with Maryland farmers toplan and implement conservation practices and programs thatbalance crop and livestock production with the need to protectnatural resources. The office provides a range of educational,financial, technical assistance and regulatory programs toimprove agricultural management and help Maryland meet itsChesapeake Bay restoration goals. Staff works with a numberof local, state and federal agencies, while implementing policiesestablished by the State Soil Conservation Committee. Fourkey areas\u2014Program Planning and Development, ConservationGrants, the Nutrient Management Program and ConservationOperations comprise the Office of Resource Conservation. 2009 Highlights 2009 was a busy year for the Office of Resource Conservation.Of major significance, the Maryland Agricultural WaterQuality Cost-Share (MACS) Program celebrated its 25th yearof extraordinary success in helping farmers install conservationpractices on their farms that protect water quality in thestreams and rivers that feed the Chesapeake Bay. All told,during the last 25 years, MACS has provided $98.6 million ingrants to farmers to install more than 20,000 conservationprojects on their farms. Maryland farmers invested an additional $14 million of their own money into these projects.The Chesapeake Bay restoration effort moved forward on several key fronts in 2009. In April, Governor Martin O'Malleyand USDA Secretary T om Vilsack signed a new agreementreauthorizing Maryland's Conservation Reserve EnhancementProgram (CREP). The program is designed to help protectMaryland's waterways by offering incentives to farmers whotake environmentally sensitive cropland out of production for10 to 15 years and plant streamside buffers, protect highlyerodible land or establish wetlands to safeguard local streams. Less than one month later, Governor O'Malley announced a series of 27 ambitious two-year milestones aimed at speedingup Maryland's efforts to reduce nutrients entering the Bay and bolster accountability to the public. Seventeen of the 27milestones are related to agriculture and focus on increasingthe use of certain highly valued best management practices(BMPs) by farmers, including cover crops, poultry and livestockwaste management systems, heavy use areas, precision agriculture,manure incorporation, and increased enforcement of nutrientmanagement plans. In order to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the highly valued BMPS in use on Maryland farms, MDAimplemented a new Conservation Tracker database system in local soil conservation district offices statewide. The newsystem, which became operational in September, provides 18| Office of Resource Conservation | Office of Resource Conservation The Richard Soper, Jr. family with (from center left) Congressman Roscoe Bartlett, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, and Governor Martin O'Malley on the family farm for an Earth Day announcement of a new Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program agreement.MDA with a geo-referenced profile of the location of BMPs installed on Maryland farms and calculates the nutrient reduction credits Maryland farmers receive for all their efforts.The Conservation Tracker system will help MDA target technical and financial resources to areas that can achieve the greatest water quality benefits. MDA launched a Nutrient Trading Program in 2009 to create a public marketplace for the sale and purchase of nutrient(phosphorus and nitrogen) credits. The exchange will helpnon-agricultural industries such as wastewater treatmentplants to offset new or increased discharges. At the same time,participating farmers can benefit from economic incentives forexpanding non-point source nutrient reductions. Later in the year, following a number of delays, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) began issuing its general discharge permit for Maryland Animal FeedingOperations (MAFOs) and Concentrated Animal FeedingOperations (CAFOs). MDA is working closely with MDE to ensure that the permit is as manageable and affordable forpoultry and livestock farmers as possible, while safeguardingwater quality. Federal standards currently under developmentfor new CAFOs involve new setback requirements for poultryhouses, storage sheds and composters, and the use of certainbest management practices to address runoff from productionand waste handling areas. Finally, new total maximum daily loads, or TMDLs, recently proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)involve a strategy that will put the entire six-state watershed andthe District of Columbia on a \"pollution diet\" in order to restorethe Bay and its tributaries. The impacts will be wide and farreaching, affecting all types of land uses. The agricultural portionof these milestones will most likely involve enforceable or bindingagreements with landowners to achieve agricultural goals. Staff working in the Office of Resource Conservation are actively working to initiate these programs and keep agriculture in the forefront of the Bay restoration effort. Thefollowing report highlights their accomplishments more fully.State Soil Conservation Committee Established in 1938, the State Soil Conservation Committee(SSCC) consists of 11 members representing local soil conservation districts (SCDs) and state and federal agriculturaland natural resource agencies. The SSCC coordinates theactivities of Maryland's 24 soil conservation districts andappoints SCD supervisors. SSCC also develops, reviews andrefines policies on soil conservation and water quality issues,while advising the Secretary of Agriculture on these matters.Importantly, the Committee serves as a forum for all agenciesinvolved in protecting natural resources. In Fiscal Year 2009, the SSCC approved or recommended the following policy initiatives to MDA: Establishment and coordination of interagency priorities Eligibility guidelines for the 2009-2010 Cover Crop Program Soil conservation district roles and responsibilities in helping farmers comply with MDE's new stormwater permit program A Memorandum of Understanding for forestry activitiesinvolving the Maryland Department of Natural Resources(DNR), the Maryland Association of Soil ConservationDistricts (MASCD), MDA, the USDA Natural ResourcesConservation Service (NRCS) and the U.S. Forest Service In Fiscal Year 2009, the SSCC received the following briefings and tracked these initiatives: Allocation of resources for the Maryland Chesapeake Bay2010 Trust Fund Regional watershed restoration specialist positions createdby DNR to provide support and to engage local jurisdictionsin developing watershed restoration plans Results of a survey on the Cover Crop Program conductedby the University of Baltimore Schaefer Center for PublicPolicy EPA requirements and MDE's proposal to implement theNational Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)permit for Confined Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)and Maryland Animal Feeding Operations (MAFOs) A Nutrient Trading Program for Maryland, including the role of soil conservation districts and opportunities for enhanced implementation of agricultural best management practices 19| Office of Resource Conservation |Maryland's Chesapeake Bay Milestone Goals and agriculture's role in reducing nitrogen loads to the Bay by3.75 million pounds Farm Energy Audit Program initiated in Maryland underthe auspices of the Eastern Shore RC&D Program Planning and Development The Program Planning and Development section is responsiblefor planning, developing and coordinating policy, programs,and public information on resource conservation issues andnonpoint source pollution. Programs and activities are coordinated among local soil conservation districts, federaland state agencies, and public and private agricultural andnatural resource organizations. The section provides staffingsupport to the State Soil Conservation Committee, BayStatand the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)Advisory Committee. Geographic Information Systems In Fiscal Y ear 2009, staff provided geographic information system (GIS) training to field personnel and continued to provide technical assistance and spatial data to a range ofprogram areas within MDA. GIS is a powerful software technology that allows a vast amount of information to belinked to a geographic location. Data from many sources,including digitized and scanned maps, aerial photography,soil surveys, and global positioning systems are integrated bythe GIS in order to create a \"smart map\" of a specific location.During the year, staff reprocessed the 2008 Maryland cropland data layer produced by the USDA 's National AgriculturalStatistics Service (NASS). This data identifies farm fields bycrop type and corresponding acreage estimates. In addition,GIS staff continued work on the Maryland Integrated Map(MDiMap), a statewide base map that uses the best availabledata and tools to allow government agencies and the public to assess state, local and municipal government performance.One of the applications contained in MDiMap is AgPrint,which targets areas for preservation and establishes conservationpriorities based on certain criteria. In 2009, MDA developedand provided the 2007, 2008 and 2009 cover crop data layersto the MDiMap team for inclusion in AgPrint. Information and Education The Information and Education Program provides creative,editorial, design, and production services to all program areaswithin the Office of Resource Conservation. In addition, theprogram provides educational displays, brochures and othercollateral materials to soil conservation districts to assist withtheir outreach efforts. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, efforts to educate Maryland's agricultural community on the State's nutrient management regulationscontinued. Staff produced the spring and winter editions ofthe newsletter, Maryland Nutrient Management News, whichwere mailed to approximately 6,500 farmers and certifiednutrient management consultants. Over the course of the year,annual reports for the Nutrient Management Program, MACS, 20| Office of Resource Conservation | Governor O'Malley and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack sign anew CREP Agreement at theRichard Soper, Jr. farm nearWestminster on April 24.soil conservation districts, and Office of Resource Conservation were prepared. Additionally, a number of farmer publications,direct mailers, and informational displays were developed orupdated to reflect program enhancements and educate farmersand the public on Maryland's agricultural conservation efforts. A special ceremony with Governor Martin O'Malley and USDA Secretary T om Vilsack was held in April to kick off thenewly revitalized Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program(CREP). New CREP fact sheets, brochure, poster, and displaywere produced and distributed to farmers and soil conservationdistrict field offices. In order to promote Maryland's 2009-2010 Cover Crop Program, the office initiated a comprehensive communicationsprogram which included news releases, direct mail and posters. In other areas, the staff worked with the University of Maryland Extension and the Master Gardeners to promoteand expand the popular homeowner series, Backyard Actionsfor a Cleaner Chesapeake Bay. A new 30-second public serviceannouncement on using pesticide alternatives was developedfeaturing a Maryland farmer as a spokesperson. An additionalradio PSA on leaf composting was also developed. Public service announcements appeared on radio stations andMaryland Public T elevision to encourage homeowners topractice backyard conservation. Conservation Grants Since 1984, the Maryland Agricultural Water Quality Cost-Share (MACS) Program has been helping farmers protect natural resources on their farms, adopt sustainable agriculturalpractices and comply with a growing list of federal, state andlocal environmental requirements. MACS provides farmerswith grants to cover up to 87.5 percent of the cost to installconservation measures known as best management practices(BMPs) on their farms to prevent soil erosion, manage nutrients and safeguard water quality in streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, MACS celebrated its 25th anniversary with its most successful year ever. Farmers enrolled in the program received a record $19 million in grants to install2,300 conservation projects on their farms. Collectively,the projects will prevent an estimated 1.3 million pounds ofnitrogen and 86,900 pounds of phosphorus from enteringMaryland waterways each year. Cover crops were responsiblefor the bulk of the nitrogen savings (1.2 million pounds) andmore than 50 percent of the phosphorous savings (48,000pounds). The projects will protect streams from sediment pollution and animal waste by managing an estimated 12,459tons of soil annually and 1,647 tons of manure daily. Covercrops, manure transport, heavy use area protection, grassedwaterways, nutrient management consultant services, wastestorage structures, livestock fencing, watering facilities, filterstrips and grade stabilization structures round out the top 10practices installed by farmers in 2009 with MACS assistance.Farmers who received cost-share grants from MACS in 2009invested more than $923,000 of their own money into start up costs for these projects. Because MACS grants do not cover the entire cost of installing BMPs, Low Interest Loans for Agricultural Conservation(LILAC) are available to help farmers pay for start up costsand additional expenses on large ticket items. Guaranteed bythe State Revolving Loan Fund, LILAC loans are typicallyoffered at rates that are three to four percent below marketrates and are available at lending institutions statewide. InFiscal Y ear 2009, MACS worked with the Maryland Departmentof the Environment and soil conservation districts to providefarmers with approximately $1 million in LILAC loans. Thefunds were used to help pay for conservation tillage and manurehandling equipment as well as waste storage structures, heavyuse areas, and agricultural chemical and handling facilities. Special Projects: Highlights and Accomplishments: Cover Crop Program The Cover Crop Program is the centerpiece in a suite of 27smart, green and growing actions that Governor MartinO'Malley has established to ramp up the Bay restorationand prevent an additional 3.75 million pounds of nitrogenand 201,000 pounds of phosphorus from reaching waterwaysby the end of 2011. Increasing the amount of farmlandplanted annually in cover crops to 460,000 acres willachieve nearly one-third of agriculture's overall nutrientreduction goal. 21| Office of Resource Conservation | On-farm best management practices such as a watering trough and riparian stream buffers on the Richard Soper farm in Carroll County protect soil andwater from agricultural runoff.Participation in the 2008-2009 Cover Crop Program was up 25 percent from last year, with Maryland farmers plant-ing 238,840 acres of cover crops statewide. MACS providedthese farmers with $10.7 million in grants to help offsetassociated seed, labor and equipment costs. Manure Transport ProgramThe Manure Transport Program provides grants to helppoultry, dairy, beef and other animal producers transportmanure off their farms. Animal producers with high soilphosphorus levels or not enough land to spread theirmanure can receive cost-share assistance of up to $20 perton to transport manure to other farms or alternative usefacilities that can use the product in an environmentallysafe manner. Cost-share rates are 20 percent higher forfarms located in Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico andWorcester counties. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, 132 farmers received $663,177 in state grant payments to transport 119,892 tons of manure toapproved farms and businesses. Delmarva poultry companiesprovided matching funds to transport the poultry litter.Increasing the amount of poultry litter that is transportedannually out of the Chesapeak e Bay Water shed to 45,000 tons is one of 27 two-year milestone goals targeted for completion by 2011. With 52,000 tons of poultry littertransported out of the watershed in 2009, the transportprogram has met this milestone goal in the first year. Nutrient Management Cost-ShareMACS provides grants to farmers who hire private,non-government consultants to develop or update nutrientmanagement plans for their farms. The reimbursement rate is 87.5 percent of the cost of the plan, up to $3,000 per operation. Grants cover one nutrient managementplan/update per operator, per year. In Fiscal Y ear 2009,MACS issued $85,718 in cost-share grants to 75 farmerswho hired private consultants to develop nutrient managementplans covering 40,887 acres of farmland. Due to budget cutbacks, the program ran out of funds during the firstthree months of the fiscal year and stopped accepting applications. Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP)In April of this year, Governor O'Malley and USDASecretary T om Vilsack signed an agreement to reauthorizeCREP and stimulate program participation by offeringincreased incentives to landowners who protect valuablestreamside property or stabilize highly erodible land. MACS provides cost-share grants to CREP participants to help cover the costs of establishing BMPs to protect waterquality and create wildlife habitat on enrolled lands that will no longer be tilled or grazed. In Fiscal Y ear 2009,MACS provided 72 landowners statewide with $105,000 incost-share funds to install streamside buffers, conservationcover, wetlands, animal fencing in CREP . Maryland Nutrient Management Program Nutrient management plans are science-based documents thathelp farmers manage crop nutrients and animal waste moreefficiently in order to protect water quality in streams, riversand the Chesapeake Bay. The Water Quality Improvement Actof 1998 requires all farmers grossing $2,500 a year or more orlivestock producers with 8,000 pounds or more of live animalweight to run their operations using a nutrient managementplan that addresses both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs. Theseplans are required on all agricultural land used to produceplants, food, feed, fiber, animals or other agricultural products. Farmers are required to update their nutrient management plans at least once every three years or when changes are made to their operations and file annual reports with MDAdescribing how they implemented their nutrient managementplans during the previous year. Farmers who own or manage 10 or more acres of agricultural land and apply their own nutrients are required to attend atwo-hour MDA-sponsored education program on nutrientapplication once every three years. Professionals and farmerscertified to prepare nutrient management plans are required totake continuing education courses in order to keep abreast ofthe latest nutrient management technologies and regulations. Non-agricultural nutrient applicators, including commercial lawn care companies, landscapers, golf course managers andpublic groundskeepers, are required by law to follow MarylandCooperative Extension guidelines when applying nutrients tolawns, athletic fields or other landscapes. The Nutrient Management Program oversees enforcement activities, a certification and licensing program for consultantsand farmers, training and education programs and an urbannutrient management program. Agricultural Enforcement Nutrient Management Plan Submissions Maryland farmers are required by law to submit nutrientmanagement plans to MDA that have been developed by anMDA certified consultant or farm operator who is trained and certified by MDA to develop a plan solely for his or her 22| Office of Resource Conservation |operation. As of December 31, 2009, following ramped up enforcement efforts, nutrient management plans have beensubmitted for 99.8 percent (5,715) of 5,727 eligible farms.Progressive enforcement actions are being pursued against the12 farmers who remain out of compliance with the program.In calendar year 2009, $3,150 fines were assessed against farmerswho failed to submit their nutrient management plans. Annual Implementation Report Submissions Farmers are required to submit Annual ImplementationReports (AIRs) to MDA by March 1 describing how theyimplemented their plans. In calendar year 2009, MDA issued 1,646 warning letters to farmers who failed to file their AIRs by the March 1 deadline,followed by 553 notifications of pending fines. By December2009, 99 percent of Maryland farmers had submitted theirAIRs to MDA. Fifty-seven farmers remain out of compliance.In calendar year 2009, MDA issued $31,250 in fines againstfarmers who failed to submit their AIRs. On-Farm Plan Implementation Reviews and Inspections MDA conducted approximately 400 on-farm plan implementationreviews and inspections in calendar year 2009 covering101,500 acres to verify that farmers' nutrient applicationrecords and receipts were in line with their nutrient managementplans. These inspections targeted a risk-based sampling offarms and included a visual spot check of the farming operation.Approximately, 69 percent of those inspected were fully incompliance, 25 percent were determined to be out of compliancedue to expired plans and six percent failed their inspectionsdue to inadequate records or failure to allow MDA staff toconduct inspections. MDA is working to bring these farmersinto compliance. In calendar year 2009, MDA issued $3,500 infines against farmers who failed to take corrective actions. Certification and LicensingNutrient Management Consultant Certification In Fiscal Y ear 2009, MDA certified 23 new consultants whopassed the Nutrient Management Certification Exam, bringingto 1,096 the number of consultants who have successfully beentrained by the program. The figure includes 322 consultantswho operate under licenses and are actively writing plans andan additional 28 University of Maryland Extension consultantswho are funded by MDA. Reviews of Plans Written by Certified Consultants MDA conducts periodic reviews and field inspections toensure the quality of plans written by the consultants that itcertifies. In calendar year, 2009, MDA conducted 320 fieldinspections while evaluating 266 plans for MDA cost-shareprojects to make certain that they met regulatory standards. Approximately 91 percent of the consultants inspected passedtheir reviews. MDA provides ongoing training and continuesto work with consultants to improve the quality of the plansthey prepare for farmers. Certification Exam Workshop A two-day training course is offered to individuals interestedin taking the Nutrient Management Certification Examination.In Fiscal Y ear 2009, 50 individuals attended this training with apassing rate of 66 percent. Farmer Training and Certification Program (FTC) Farmers who want to become certified to write their ownnutrient management plans attend specialized workshopsoffered regionally for livestock, poultry, crop, and nursery and greenhouse operations. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, MDA trainedand certified 27 farmers to write their own nutrient managementplans. Since the FTC program began in 2005, MDA has certified 310 farmers to write nutrient management plans fortheir own operations. Training and Education In calendar year 2009, MDA, in partnership with University ofMaryland Extension, offered 28 comprehensive continuingeducation workshops on topics ranging from how to write anutrient management plan to using the Revised Universal SoilLoss (RUSLE) to determine nutrient losses. Approximately2,174 participants attended the training during the year. MDA reviewed and approved an additional 27 workshops and training programs sponsored by recognized organizations 23| Office of Resource Conservation | On-Farm Implementation Reviews and Inspections In Compliance 69% Non-Compliant: Expired Plans 25%Non-Compliant: Inadequate Records/ Failure to allow MDA staff to conduct inspections 6%The Maryland Department of the Environment requires certain livestock and poultry farmers to implement SCWQPsas a condition for obtaining its new permit. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, MDA technical staff working in soil conservation district offices statewide developed 921 new SoilConservation and Water Quality Plans for 44,250 acres ofMaryland farmland. An additional 765 plans covering 59,124acres were updated to ensure their continued effectiveness inprotecting natural resources. T ogether, these plans included1,260 highly valued BMPs that are being tracked by theBayStat program. Enforcement Maryland uses a progressive approach to handling cases ofwater pollution caused by agriculture that is based on theseverity of the situation. Conditions that are likely to causepollution or that have resulted in inadvertent farm pollutionrequire timely corrective action, whereas chronic or willfulmismanagement of farm resources is handled through a formal enforcement action. MDA and MDE work jointly with soil conservation districts to assess farm managementcomplaints and take action against polluters when necessary.Emphasis is placed on voluntary corrective actions by farmersor landowners with assistance provided by the local soil conservation district or the University of Maryland Extension.In Fiscal Y ear 2009, 76 agricultural complaints were receivedconcerning sediment and erosion control issues, odors,manure and livestock concerns. Of this figure, 64 complaintswere corrected or closed, eight complaints are pending andfour enforcement actions have been initiated.2009 Types of Agricultural Complaints Manure: 47Livestock: 10 Agronomic: 14 Odor: 562%13% 7%18%and neighboring universities to help consultants fulfill their continuing education requirements. Persons who apply any nutrients to 10 or more acres of cropland that they own or rent are required to attend an applicatortraining course once every three years. In 2009, MDA and theUniversity of Maryland Extension conducted 32 vouchertraining sessions attended by 251 participants. Urban Nutrient Management Program Approximately 700 operations\u2014including 200 golf coursesand 400 lawn care service providers\u2014are regulated by theUrban Nutrient Management Program. These urban landmanagers are required to take soil tests, follow the fertilizerrecommendations of University of Maryland Extension andkeep certain records of fertilizer applications. In calendar year 2009, MDA reviewed the fertilizer records of 36 individuals/firms to determine program compliance.Following these inspections, MDA issued warnings to 10firms/individuals who were directed to correct their programswithin an established time frame or face fines of up to $1,000.In 2009, one firm was fined $250 for noncompliance with program regulations. The most common compliance issue isfailure to take soil tests. Twenty-seven follow-up reviewsinvolving companies with previous compliance issues were alsoconducted during the year resulting in four additional warnings. Resource Conservation Operations This program provides operating funds and staffing supportto the state's 24 soil conservation districts for promotion anddelivery of soil conservation and water quality programs at the local level. Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans Soil Conservation and Water Quality Plans (SCWQPs) helpfarmers protect and enhance the natural resources on theirfarms. Unlike nutrient management plans, which deal specificallywith fertilizer and manure applications, SCWQPs address arange of natural resource concerns for the entire farmingoperation and often include dozens of best management practices (BMPs) aimed at protecting water quality andenhancing wildlife habitat. Because of their importance in protecting and managing natural resources, SCWQPs are required by the Federal FoodSecurity Act on all highly erodible lands. In addition, SCWQPsmust be implemented on all farmland enrolled in the MarylandAgricultural Land Preservation Foundation Program as well asfarmland located in the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal BaysCritical Area\u2014the 1,000 ft. strip of land along these shorelines. 24| Office of Resource Conservation |Agricultural Water Management T o prevent pollution and protect water resources, the officeworks with local public drainage associations (PDAs) to assurethat operation and maintenance plans for public drainage systems are technically adequate and properly implemented.Due to budget cuts in Fiscal Y ear 2009, the office lost a PDAcoordinator and state funding for emergency maintenanceactivities. As a result, PDAs must now perform their ownmaintenance on approximately 820 miles of drainage ditchesusing local revenues. Tributary Strategy T eam Activities Resource Conservation staff and soil conservation districts areactive supporters and participants in Maryland's TributaryStrategy T eams. These teams\u2014comprised of local citizens,farmers, business leaders and government officials\u2014meetmonthly in each of Maryland's 10 major tributary basins torecommend pollution prevention measures and address localwater quality problems unique to each watershed with theoverall aim of improving water quality in the Chesapeake Bay.They are important components in helping Maryland reachits two-year Bay milestone goals. On March 9, 2009 Tributary team members along with representatives from soil conservation districts met withGovernor Martin O'Malley to discuss agriculture's role in theBay cleanup and the importance of soil conservation andwater quality plans to the cleanup effort. This was the firsttime that a Maryland governor had asked to talk with the soilconservation districts and engage in frank discussion abouttheir vital role in the cleanup effort. Citizens may view Baycleanup progress and learn more about the role of theTributary T eams by visiting www.baystat.maryland.gov. Maryland Envirothon The office supports soil conservation districts that sponsor the Maryland Envirothon, an outdoor natural resources competition for high school students interested in learningabout natural resources and gaining a better understanding of today's complex environmental issues. Designed by soilconservationists, foresters, wildlife experts and other naturalresource professionals, the Maryland Envirothon challengesstudents to move beyond the classroom in order to solve reallife environmental problems in a natural setting. Studentscompete at the local, state and national levels. A group of teens from Carroll County won this year's state competition and went on to place 3rd among teams from 45U.S. states and seven Canadian provinces at the 2009 CanonEnvirothon.The Maryland Envirothon is sponsored by the State Soil Conservation Committee and the Maryland Association ofSoil Conservation Districts. Special Projects and Grants The Office of Resource Conservation is actively managing 24ongoing research and technical assistance grants totaling $5.6million for special programs and demonstration projectsdesigned to help dairy farmers, small sized equine operations,poultry producers and other landowners improve pasture andmanure management, control soil erosion, manage nutrients,reduce runoff and safeguard water quality in streams, riversand the Chesapeake Bay. In Fiscal Y ear 2009, the program received an $118,980 EPA grant to implement an agricultural nutrient trading programfor Maryland that will create a public marketplace for the saleand purchase of nutrient credits (phosphorus and nitrogen). During the year, the program also partnered with the Caroline Soil Conservation District to manage a $188,100 National Fish & Wildlife Foundation grant that will demonstrate twoinnovative options for reducing nutrient discharges from agricultural drainage channels. Finally, the program is workingwith the University of Maryland on a grant project to developa ditch water filter technology system for ditch drained agro-ecosystems. 25| Office of Resource Conservation | Venturing Crew 202 Envirothon Team from Carroll County placed 3rd in the international Canon Envirothon, besting some 250 students from 45 states and seven Canadian provinces.The Marketing Services Division's principle role is to identify and develop profitable marketing opportunitiesfor Maryland farmers and agricultural producers. The division also serves as a conduit for federal resources and forpolicy information specific to the agricultural sector. In 2009,Marketing Services continued to focus resources on initiativesdesigned to create demand among Marylanders for locally-produced agricultural products and open marketing channelsfor Maryland farmers. The University of Baltimore SchaeferCenter for Public Policy's annual public opinion surveyshowed continued strengthening of consumer support for the purchase of local agricultural products vs. those from elsewhere. More than 78 percent said they would prefer to buy Maryland-grown fruits and vegetables. Also in 2009,Marketing staff successfully worked to develop the marketpotential for Maryland agricultural products in Cuba andseafood products in the European Union. National Marketing and Agribusiness Development The Marketing Services staff works with farmers and agricultural producers to assist them in marketing their products directly to supermarkets, schools, chefs, hotels, foodservice businesses and to other wholesale buyers as well asdirectly to consumers at farmers' markets and other venues.The Maryland's Best program enables producers to capitalizeon the consumer's preference for local agricultural products.The 2009 Maryland's Best campaign promoted Maryland-grown products through radio, television and print advertisingas well as through press releases statewide during the year. Thecampaign was designed to direct consumers to the revampedand searchable Maryland's Best website where additionalinformation is available. Governor Martin O'Malley supported Maryland's Best by recording a television spot in 2009. He also hosted local foodbuyers, farmers and media at his official residence in July 2009during a Buy Local Challenge Week cookout in July. This initiative, in its second year statewide, encourages Marylandersto eat locally-grown food during a week at the height of theState's growing season. The Jane Lawton Farm to School Program is now in its second year. Created by the General Assembly in 2008 to honor thelate Maryland House of Delegates member Jane Lawton ofDistrict 18, Montgomery County, this program led to countyand state initiatives to incorporate locally-produced food innearly every county in the State. More than 30 differentMaryland farms participated in the Maryland Home Grown School Lunch Week held September 14-18, 2009. This effortwas coordinated by the Maryland Department of Agricultureand the Maryland State Department of Education with theMaryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, theMaryland Agricultural Education Foundation and theUniversity of Maryland Extension 4-H and public school systems around the State. The Division worked with a professional photographer to bring the story of Maryland's farmers to the consumerthrough five \"sound books.\" A sound book is a photographicslideshow with narration by the farmer. Watermelon,strawberry, apple, dairy and turkey producers were profiled in the sound books this year. The marketing office provides opportunities for farmers and producers to sell their products directly to wholesale buyers inMaryland and beyond. In 2009, the office held a buyer-growermeeting, introducing more than 140 Maryland farmers tobuyers from major chains including Whole Foods, Weis,Wal-Mart, Safeway, and Giant as well as chefs and buyers fromarea institutions. The office continues to cultivate relationshipswith more major supermarket chains as well as restaurants,schools, prisons, garden centers, state agencies, and otherwholesale buyers, and to work to minimize obstacles to direct-to-wholesaler sales. Through work with the Mar-DelWatermelon Association, staff coordinated a statewide promotion to boost marketing opportunities for Marylandwatermelons. This included events at the City Dock inAnnapolis with watermelon queens from Maryland and other major watermelon growing areas of the nation. The marketing office supports the growth of 88 of the state's 103 farmers markets in all 23 of Maryland's counties and the 26| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Marketing ServicesCity of Baltimore. MDA has provided various levels of support from the initial creation and development of new markets topromotional materials and occasional consultation for well-established markets. Maryland farmers estimated their sales(for insurance purposes) at more than $3 million in 2009. At farmers' markets across the state, 300 farmers participated in the Farmers' Market Nutrition Programs (FMNP) forWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC) clients and for seniorsin 2009. Funded primarily by USDA 's Food and NutritionService, the FMNP provides fresh produce for nutritionally at-risk women, infants, children and income-eligible seniorcitizens while increasing sales for farmers. MDA with theDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene leveraged generalfunds of $116,000 to generate a total program commitment ofmore than $457,000, including funds from the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture. The FMNP is a standing program commitmentfrom USDA and must be administered by a state departmentof agriculture, which requires that MDA provide both staffand general fund resources. Marketing staff administer and/or provide support for various grant programs, task forces and other activities which improvethe policy climate and long-term profitability for farmers.These include the Maryland Dairy Industry Oversight andAdvisory Council, the Renewable Fuels Incentive Board, theGovernor's Advisory Commission on Maryland Wine andGrape-Growing, and numerous other industry organizations.In 2008, staff secured and/or administered grants under theSpecialty Crop Block Grant Program, the Federal-State MarketImprovement Program, the Maryland Agricultural Educationand Rural Development Assistance Fund Program(MAERDAF), and the USDA Risk Management Agency'sTargeted States Program. On-going staff assistance and support is provided to other agricultural groups throughout Maryland, including theMaryland Soybean Board, Maryland Grain ProducersAssociation, Maryland Nursery and Landscape Association,Maryland Food Center Authority, Maryland GreenhouseGrowers Association, Maryland Agriculture Council,Maryland-Delaware Forage Council, Maryland OrganicCertification Advisory Committee, Maryland Organic Foodand Fiber Association, and others. The Maryland Agricultural Conflict Resolution Service (ACReS) provides prompt, low-cost, confidential and collaborative mediation and other services for resolving disputes related to agricultural production. The mediationprogram, funded mainly by USDA with matching funds from existing state resources, not only serves those who havereceived an adverse ruling related to a USDA program or other regulatory matter, but also provides assistance for abroad range of issues including those involved in loan servicing, farmer-neighbor disputes, family farm and estateconflicts, for example. The program staff works closely with other government agencies and organizations on policy development and implementation in order to create a more business- and consumer-friendly face of government. Only state departmentsof agriculture can request certification by USDA and receiveUSDA funding for this program; if MDA did not provide theservice, it would not be available to Maryland citizens. Marketing staff manage a federally-funded program to inform Maryland farmers of crop insurance. This program, financedwith $324,000 from the USDA-Risk Management Agency(RMA), combines the resources of MDA, the University ofMaryland, RMA and the National Agricultural StatisticsService to target producers for promotional and educationalactivities. From 2003 to 2009, participation among Marylandfarmers increased by 14 percent\u2014one of the greatest increasesin the Northeast. Farmer investment in crop insurance helpsstabilize Maryland's agricultural economy. Following thedrought of 2008, for example, producers received $30.2 millionin indemnity payments from crop insurance designed to helpthem survive bad weather, insects, disease, and market fluctuations. 27| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Sec. Hance joins students in the cafeteria for a school lunch with locally- grown produce at the Hebron-Harman Elementary School in Anne ArundelCounty for the Maryland Homegrown School Lunch Week kick off.The International Marketing and Trade Development office's mission is to increase export sales by Marylandagricultural producers and agribusinesses in order to enhance their economic well being. The two person staffaccomplishes this by conducting outreach and educationalprograms, organizing and conducting trade promotion activities and facilitating participation by Maryland companies in international trade promotion events. International marketing activities focus on market access, international policy and trade relationships. The priority areasfor market access activities are livestock, value-added foodsand seafood. Activities ranged from researching new anddeveloping markets, to designing and implementing missionsand trade shows, hosting reverse trade missions, arrangingone-on-one meetings with buyers and Maryland agribusinesses,conducting seminars, and assisting companies with developinginternational market strategies. In 2009, International Marketingworked with more than 3,000 companies and individuals inMaryland. Through international policy and export activities, staff participates in the development of export phytosanitary protocols for agricultural products going into new marketsand prepares Certificates of Free Sale for Maryland businesses. Beyond the normal difficulties of international trade, such as differences in language and business practices, exporting foodproducts, livestock and nursery products pose additional challenges because such products require phytosanitary certificates and adherence to labeling standards. Program staffhelps prepare Maryland's agricultural processors, manufacturers,and farmers to be export ready, to develop niche markets thatare competitive in the global market place and to pursue aresults-oriented export marketing management program. Exporting agricultural products provides additional income to farm families and is increasingly important for small- andmedium-sized farmers and agribusinesses. The USDA ForeignAgricultural Service reports that every $1 of product exportedgenerates another $1.62 for the economy in related economicactivity, such as transportation or packaging. It also reportedthat employees engaged in export businesses receive higherwages than their counterparts in non-export businesses. Diversification into profitable export markets can serve as a good risk management tool for U.S. farmers and can help keepdomestic prices high. Exporting has become an increasinglyimportant part of the maintenance of a profitable family-farm.The USDA offers a number of incentive programs to encourage farmers and processors to enter the global marketplace. TheDepartment's International Marketing unit garners federalfunds to underwrite nearly all of its trade missions, tradeshows and reverse buyers' missions. Given the complexities of exporting agricultural products, most USDA funds areawarded to state departments of agriculture where they areadministered for the benefit of the state's farmers and processors.The Economic Research Service of USDA estimates thatMaryland agricultural exports totaled $357.5 million in 2007,the most recent data available. The top three agriculturalexports were: poultry, wheat and soybean products. International marketing specialists work closely with USDA staff at embassies worldwide and with other organizations to facilitate successful exports of Maryland products to more than 35 countries. Through the Southern U.S. TradeAssociation (SUSTA) and the United States Livestock &Genetics Export Associat ion (USLGE) specifically, MDA invested $12,500 in membership dues which resulted last year in more than $200,000 in funding for international trademissions managed by MDA. These activities included reversetrade missions bringing foreign buyers from several countriesto visit Maryland farms. Key Export Activities Implemented by International Marketing in 2009 included:Cuba: Secretary Earl Hance led a delegation of Maryland agribusinesses to Havana, Cuba in November. One Marylandagribusiness signed a contract for soybean meal valued at$12.3 million. European Union: Maryland Department of Agriculture worked with the Florida Department of Agriculture to lead the SUSTA mission to the EU's Seafood Expo in Brussels,Belgium. This key venue for the seafood industry in Europeresulted in sales of more than $2.5 million from Marylandseafood companies. 28| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | International Marketing and Trade DevelopmentAquaculture Development Program The Aquaculture Development Program supports the Maryland aquaculture industry through promotional,educational, and technical assistance programs. The programalso coordinates the statewide aquaculture permit reviewprocess. In 2009, there were 65 commercial aquafarms permittedin Maryland. Maryland has seven licensed fee-fishing operationsand more than 50 schools, nature centers, government agencies,and private organizations producing fish, shellfish, and aquaticplants for educational and restoration projects. Shellfish aquaculture production is increasing in Maryland as moreoyster and clam farms are being established in the Chesapeakeand Atlantic Coastal Bays. The Maryland Aquaculture Review Board, which is chaired by the MDA aquaculture coordinator, provides monthly interagency review of permits and issues across departmentallines. In 2009, the board reviewed 16 applications for aquacultureprojects in Maryland. These inclu ded operations proposing to raise shellfish seed, market clams, oysters, and fish. As a resultof this effort, seven new aquaculture businesses have beenestablished in Maryland, two expansions/renewals have beenapproved and five applications are currently under review. The Maryland Aquaculture Coordinating Council is made up of 11 designated representatives from academic, regulatory,and political organizations as well as six members from industryappointed by the Governor. The aquaculture coordinatorserves as a member of the Coordinating Council and providesadministrative support. The council got off to a fast and productive start in 2009 by providing recommendationsincluded in proposed legislation to restructure the State'sexisting lease law. Council activities culminated with the selection of Aquaculture Enterprise Zone sites located in the Patuxent River and the drafting of new shellfish leasingregulations. In 2009, Governor O'Malley signed House Bill 312/Senate Bill 271 into law. The requirements and regulations establishedas a result of the new shellfish lease law, coupled with theCoordinating Council's 2009 legislative recommendations,provide opportunity for leasing in the Chesapeake andAtlantic Coastal Bays and create the incentive to catalyze private investment in leasing operations while encouragingcommercial fishermen to transition to aquaculture. This law is the culmination of a long process to bring about thesechanges supported by the MDA Aquaculture/Seafood program and the Aquaculture Coordinating Council. The Aquaculture Development Program continues to provide the industry with the opportunity to participate in regional,national, and international trade shows, conferences, fairs,and tours in order to promote and market Maryland farm-raised products. Cooperative programs and collaboration with the Maryland Watermen's Association, Maryland SeaGrant, Maryland Seafood Marketing Advisory Commission,the National Aquaculture Association, and many other organizations are essential to providing aquafarmers withthese opportunities. 29| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | An exhibit of shellfish aquaculture at the Maryland State Fair. Don Webster, former chair of the Aquaculture Advisory Council, receives an award from State Senator Kathy Klausmeier, Delegate Anthony O'Donnell andMDA Aquaculture Coordinator Karl Roscher.Seafood Marketing and Aquaculture Development ProgramSeafood Marketing Program The Seafood Marketing Program promotes increased sales and consumption of Maryland seafood and aquaculture productsthrough consumer education, promotion, public relations, andadvertising. The total estimated value of the Maryland seafoodindustry is more than $700 million. There are 68 processingplants employing 1,310 people and more than 6,000 watermenwho work the Chesapeake Bay. In 2008, watermen landed 58.3million pounds of seafood at a dockside value of more than$61.2 million. This is an increase in harvest by 13.9 percentand increase in value by 14.1 percent since 2007. Advertising funds are generated from a $10 surcharge fee collected from commercial fishing and seafood processinglicenses. In 2009, the fee garnered $65,000. Funds were used toplace advertisements in newspapers and trade journals and forspecial promotions. The use of the $10 surcharge is overseenby the Seafood Marketing Advisory Commission and the TidalFisheries Advisory Commission. The Seafood MarketingAdvisory Commission is composed of 11 industry memberswho recommend marketing activities. The program's website, www.marylandseafood.org, features information for consumers as well as wholesale and retaildealers of seafood. It includes a searchable database, seafoodhandling and nutrition informatio n, recipes, cookbook order forms, an annual seafood festival list and information on starting aquaculture ventures. In 2009, the site had more than58,374 hits. This is an increase from 55,863 hits in 2008. Inaddition, the public received more than 244,000 pieces ofinformation through the Internet and mailings. In 2009, the program teamed up with the University of Maryland Environmental Finance Center to expand the salesof seafood and aquaculture products on the internet through the use of the online Farmer's Market website known asFoodtrader.org. Beginning in September, the Maryland seafoodand aquaculture industry began listing local fish, crabs, oystersand other products on Foodtrader.org. This is a free serviceand had drawn immediate response from consumers. The \"Buy Local Maryland Seafood\" campaign was held in July. The promotion included advertising in newspapers and onradio. In addition, point of sale materials were distributed toretailers and a news release issued. In order to promote the sales of Maryland seafood in the fall, the Seafood Marketing Program developed an Octoberpromotional campaign, entitled \"Make a Splash withMaryland Seafood.\" Newspaper ads were placed throughoutthe State and radio ads were aired in Baltimore. The programprovided retail markets with point of sale materials. Newsreleases were distributed to the press with GovernorO'Malley's proclamation of \"October is Maryland SeafoodMonth.\" Consumer recipe brochures were distributed andinformation was placed on the web site. Other seafood promotions, including newspaper, radio, and Internet advertising and recipe distribution, revolved aroundseasonal availability and holidays. Advertising campaignsincluded: \"Celebrate Seafood,\"\"Fish on Fridays,\" \"Maryland Rockfish Celebration\" and craband oyster seasons. The program placed ads on the BaltimoreOrioles radio station during baseball games. The program is receiving a portion of the federal Blue Crab Fishery Disaster funding from the National Marine FisheriesService through the Department of Natural Resources. Thefunding for seafood marketing efforts to alleviate potentialblue crab fishery disaster by creating economic opportunitiesfor commercial crabbers and the processing industry. Themarketing funding is earmarked to conduct a public relationsand advertising program designed to increase positive awarenessof the Maryland crab industry. In 2009, the funding paid for a billboard advertisement, advertisements on radio and television and in newspapers. The three year funding continuesthrough 2012. The program distributed 12 news releases to more than 300 food editors in the mid-Atlantic region. The topics coveredseasonal species, special events and promotions. Consumereducation included in these news releases discussed safety,handling, and nutrition information. The releases includedphotos and recipes with an opportunity for consumers torequest more information or recipe brochures by mail, phoneor website. These releases are posted on the Maryland seafood 30| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | A billboard advertisement for Maryland crabs.website as well as MDA 's main website. Program staff participated in a wide array of trade shows, conferences, exhibits and special seasonal events including:International Boston Seafood Show, International RestaurantShow, East Coast Commercial Fishermen's and AquacultureTrade Expo, Maryland Dietetic Association Annual Meetingand Exhibit, and the Maryland State Fair. At the events,informational literature, point of sale information andMaryland seafood samples were offered. At the International Boston Seafood Show, space is shared with industry members, assisting them in marketing theirproducts. In 2009, seven companies participated in the statebooth and another 13 companies were represented in thelargest seafood show in the United States. The program sponsored and administered several seafood cooking contests including: National Oyster Cook-off,Chesapeake Seafood Chef Contest, Jr. Rockfish Cooking Contest,and National Hard Crab Derby & Fair Cooking Contest. The Seafood Marketing Program is involved in seafood education through various programs including the sponsorshipof the Maryland Watermen's Association's \"Waterman in theClassroom\" project. This program enables watermen to visitschools to educate students on the life of a waterman andincludes lessons on ecology. The Seafood Marketing Program administers the Maryland Crab Meat Quality Assurance Program. This voluntary program,which the industry helps fund, provides an extra level ofsanitary inspection and education through the Maryland SeaGrant Program. Product and environmental surfaces aremicrobiologically tested and evaluated for Listeria, E. coli and bacteria plate counts. More than two-thirds of Marylandcrabmeat processors belong to the quality assurance program. Staff promotes the participating quality assurance programcompanies through the website, literature and advertising.Maryland is the only state where such a program exists.Future plans for this program will include elimination ofshell in product for an extra quality assurance. The program continues to distribute Maryland seafood information on safety, handling, nutrition and recipes.These are distributed through travel centers, seafood markets,grocery stores, direct consumer requests, trade shows and thewebsite. The program also produces and distributes a varietyof point of sale materials including: decorations, pins, tabletents, menu inserts, and posters. The program sells the famousMaryland Seafood Cookbooks and uses the funds to offset thecost of printed materials. The program has increased its responsibility for the marketing of Maryland seafood internationally. While there is no increasedfunding for such activities, the staff was able to work on several projects. These included SUSTA (Southern UnitedStates Trade Association) activities such as distributing invitations for Maryland seafood companies that export toparticipate in various trade shows in Korea, Canada, China,Japan, and Brussels. The program assisted in a reverse trademission with a group of seafood buyers from Korea at theInternational Boston Seafood Show and co-partnered with theState of Virginia on a SUSTA sponsored cow nose ray promotionin Korea. Through a SUSTA grant, Maryland was able to participle in the European Seafood Show in Brussels. The sixparticipating companies reported sales over $35 million. 31| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Greg Sharpe, CEC, Certified Executive Chef of the Baltimore Convention Center wins the Chesapeake Chef Challenge and will represent Maryland in the 2010Great American Seafood Cook-off in New Orleans.

Commodities meeting the criteriaestablished by USDA and/or MDA standards are identifiedand certified by MDA graders. Official certification provides auniform basis for the marketing of agricultural commoditiesthat enhances the marketability of Maryland commodities.Foreign countries, wholesale food suppliers, large grocery store chains, and state institutions, among others, oftenrequire official certification to ensure they are purchasing agricultural commodities that meet their specifications.The provision of a cost-effective and service-oriented gradingprogram is crucial to Maryland producers competing in these markets. In addition to providing certification services to the producing industry, the section has assisted buyers in developing specificationsto meet their needs. Many buyers have begun requiring auditsof production practices in addition to the certification ofproduct. The section conducts audits of agricultural productionfacilities for compliance with standards for animal welfare,good agricultural practices, food security, food safety andquality assurance programs. As buyers and consumers continueto demand verification of compliance with standards for animalwelfare and food safety, the section anticipates increaseddemand for audits of these practices. Additional staff membersare being trained to accommodate the anticipated increase inaudit requests. The agricultural commodity industry has continued to change and the section has adapted to these changes by offering theservices necessary for the industry to market their products.Consolidation in the poultry and egg industry has reduced thenumber of processing plants in the state reducing the poundsof poultry and eggs certified. These reductions have resulted inhigher fees charged to industry for the services provided. The number of Good Agricultural Practices audits conducted has continued to increase as more wholesale and retail chainbuyers are requiring the audits after recent high profile out-breaks such as an E. coli outbreak in spinach and a salmonella outbreak in tomatoes and jalapenos have caused increasedconcern about food safety and fresh produce. The program has received an $80,000 grant through the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture to develop and implement a Good Agricultural Practices program geared toward smallerproducers selling fruits and vegetables directly to school systems and consumers. The primary commodities graded bythe section this year were 361 million pounds of poultry, 47million pounds of shell eggs and 12.5 million pounds of fruitsand vegetables. Egg Inspection The Egg Inspection Program is responsible for enforcement of the Maryland Egg Law. Inspections are performed at thewholesale, food service and retail level to ensure eggs sold inour state meet the standards established for quality, size,refrigeration, microbial and physical contamination, labelingand record keeping. The section is also responsible for the registration of egg wholesalers and packers. Portions of thelabeling, record keeping and registration requirements weredeveloped to provide traceability in the event of a Salmonella enteritidis outbreak. Other sections of the law were established to reduce the risk of consumers purchasing eggs that couldcause food-borne illness. Eggs found to be out of compliancewith the established standards are removed from sale and violation notices are issued to the responsible party. Theinspection activities are funded through the collection of$.0026 per dozen of eggs sold in Maryland. 32| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Food Quality Assurance Program A Food Quality Assurance inspector analyzing eggs for quality.The percentage of eggs sampled found to be in compliance with the Maryland Egg Law increased to 87 percent this yearcompared to 85 percent last year. The lots inspected increasedas a result of filling a vacancy in the program. The egg inspection chart shows comparison data for the eggs inspectedand violations. The program has begun conducting Country of Origin labeling reviews for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The reviewsare conducted in conjunction with egg inspections and thefederal reimbursement for Country of Origin reviews hasassisted with reducing the costs associated with conductingegg inspections.Organic Certification The United States Department of Agriculture-accreditedMaryland Organic Certification Program certified 85 farmsand 21 handlers of organic products in Maryland in 2009.The program also registered an additional 20 farms as organicthat are exempt from the inspection requirements. Maryland organic producers and handlers continue to benefit from the federal Cost-Share Reimbursement Program fundedby USDA. This cost-share program allowed MDA to reimburse75 percent of the inspection costs growers paid for certification.This program is expected to continue through 2010. Grain Laws All persons in the business of buying, receiving, exchanging orstoring grain from a grain producer are regulated by this sec-tion. Licenses are issued to businesses that meet requirementsset by law for insurance and financial status. There are fourcategories of licenses issued based on the number of bushelspurchased in a calendar year. Fees range from $50 to $300. ADirectory of Licensed Grain Dealers is published and distrib-uted annually. The section licensed 39 businesses with 68business locations in 2009. 33| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | A Food Quality Assurance inspector obtains samples for pesticide residue testing. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000Egg Inspection Lots Inspected ViolationsLots Inspected/Violations 2006 2007 2008 2009The State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners (SBVME) is responsible for setting standards by whichveterinarians, registered veterinary technicians, and veterinary hospital owners must comply through statutoryand regulatory adoptions and amendments. The SBVME also licenses and registers veterinarians; licenses and inspectsveterinary hospitals; licenses animal control facilities; registersveterinary technicians; provides disciplinary information toother state veterinary boards and the public; and submitslicensure verification to other state licensing boards uponrequest. Additionally, the SBVME investigates consumer complaints, initiates its own investigations, and determineswhether disciplinary action shall be taken against licensees orregistrants. Requests for approval of continuing educationcredits are reviewed by the SBVME. The SBVME consists of seven members appointed by the Governor to serve five-year terms. Five of the members areveterinarians; of these five members, two must be primarilylarge animal practitioners. The remaining two members areconsumers. SBVME staff consists of an executive director,administrative specialist, office secretary, administrative officer/investigator, and two agricultural inspectors, both ofwhom split their time between the SBVME and the MarylandHorse Industry Board. The SBVME also funds the work of apart-time assistant attorney general, whose time is devotedexclusively to the SBVME. During the 2009 session of the General Assembly, the SBVME submitted two bills\u2014SB 78 and HB 1413, both of whichpassed and became effective October 1, 2009. SB 78 affectscurrently enrolled veterinary medical students and was draftedto address a long-standing concern amongst these students,who were prohibited in Maryland from obtaining clinical,hands-on experience in a veterinary hospital or animal sheltersetting while they are attending veterinary medical school.Before the passage of SB 78, Maryland law required that anindividual be a graduate of a veterinary medical school,amongst other conditions, before seeking licensure with theSBVME. SB 78 permits a veterinary medical student who hassuccessfully completed three years of veterinary education atan institution approved by the SBVME, and who works underthe responsible direct supervision of a veterinary practitioner,to be exempt from the definition of the practice of veterinarymedicine. Additionally, under the Courts and JudicialProceedings Article, such student is now granted the sameimmunity from liability conferred upon veterinarians whenproviding free veterinary aid or assistance in emergency situations where the owner of the animal is not available to grant permission.The SBVME is in the process of drafting regulations that will set forth its requirements of veterinarians who will besupervising these veterinary medical students. HB 1413 altered the requirement that Maryland-licensed veterinarians obtain 12 hours of continuing education annuallyto renew their veterinary license with the SBVME. Althoughthe bill did not establish a maximum number of hours theSBVME could legally require, the SBVME recently promulgatedregulations that require an additional 6 hours of CE annually.The additional hours must be obtained prior to July 1, 2010,and recorded on the registration application for the 2011 fiscalyear. The SBVME believes that veterinarians should participatein a minimum of 12 hours of CE annually in courses that havesignificant intellectual or practical content dealing with skillsdirectly related to veterinary medicine. Additional hoursrequired by the SBVME may be directed towards non-scientifictopics, such as practice management and improving clientcommunications\u2014areas that relate to the practice of veterinarymedicine, but are not necessarily clinical in nature. A third bill, SB 116, was submitted on behalf of the SBVME by the Department of Legislative Services (DLS) and extendedthe SBVME's sunset date by 10 years to July 1, 2021. Thisextension was based on a review conducted in 2008 to determinewhether the SBVME is fulfilling its mission and meeting the 34| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | The Maryland State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners Veterinarians must meet standards and adhere to laws and regulations over- seen by the Vet Board.The SBVME recently solicited applications from registered veterinary technicians interested in serving as a member of theVeterinary T echnician Committee (VTC). This process wasbegun as a result of the VTC's chair stepping down earlier thisyear. The VTC is responsible, in part, for determining registrationeligibility, establishing continuing education requirements,recommending regulatory language, and assisting the SBVMEin registering veterinary technicians. This year, the SBVME collaborated with a graphic designer to develop a logo specifically for the SBVME. The logo is nowbeing used on certificates and hospital inspection forms utilized by the SBVME's inspectors, and will be used on materials for marketing purposes. Research has begun to determine the feasibility of offering on-line registration for the SBVME's licensees. Each year, thenumber of licensees and registrants who desire this serviceincreases. With a growing number of licensees and registrantseach year, the ability of the SBVME's administrative staff toprocess renewal applications in a timely manner has becomeincreasingly difficult. This is a project the SBVME deems ofprimary importance in the coming months.needs of its stakeholders and customers. In late September, the SBVME filed a specific report, as mandated by SB 116, whichaddressed recommendations and comments made by DLS. In late 2008 and early 2009, a review of the SBVME's complaint-handling process was conducted. Recommendationsthat are expected to decrease the length of time to investigateand resolve cases were proposed and accepted by its adminis-trative staff. The hiring of a part-time assistant attorney general in 2007 has been instrumental in reducing the lengthof time devoted to resolving complaints. By the end of the2009 fiscal year, approximately 28 percent more cases wereclosed than at the same time last year. Additionally, there was a 40 percent decrease in the number of pending cases whencompared to the number of cases pending at the same timelast year. T o further reduce the length of time necessary toresolve cases, the SBVME has recently increased the assistantattorney general's time by 10 percent. This change, coupledwith a revised complaint-handling process, are expected tohave a continuing positive impact on the investigation and resolution of complaints. 35| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Listed below are key statistics from the past three fiscal years: Y ear Y ear Y ear Category 2007 2008 2009 Licenses issued to new veterinarians 145* 140 138 Registrations issued to veterinarians 2,412 2,475 2,416Registrations issued to registered 80 47 117** veterinary technicians Licenses issued to veterinary hospitals 508 512 526Percentage of veterinary hospitals inspected and in compliance 99 100 99 Number of new complaints received 77 97 84Number of complaints pending 61 60 75 from previous year Number of complaints closed 78 82 114 *This number was previously reported at 170 and was calculated ba sed on the amount of revenue the SBVME had received.

Headquarters and regionalstaff members work closely with counterparts in local, stateand federal government, neighboring states and related animalindustries to ensure an efficient team effort for disease prevention,detection and control. A key component of the program is theAnimal Health Diagnostic Laboratory System. The program also has responsibility for responding to all animal emergencies under the State Emergency OperationsPlan, Emergency Support Function 16. Animal emergenciesare categorized as 1) animal health emergencies, such as a disease outbreak in livestock or poultry and 2) animals inemergencies, such as a natural disaster. The Animal HealthProgram provides secondary support to other state agenciesmanaging Emergency Support Functions so assigned. The official program regulatory role in protecting and promoting animal welfare is limited to livestock in auctionmarkets and certain aspects of animal transport and exhibition.MDA AH frequently assists local animal control and otheragencies with welfare issues through field consultation,training and investigative support and diagnostic evaluationsof affected animals. Program Operations Program Consolidations: In response to long-term ongoing changes in the agriculture community leading to a 30 percentreduction in program revenues, increased program operationaland personnel costs, and state budget cuts of approximately 18percent for the department, Animal Health Program operationswere consolidated from five regions to two regions, and threepositions were cut, resulting in an approximate annual savingsof $300,000 in FY2010, and $450,000 by FY2011. A majority of the savings, approximately $250,000, was realized by theclosing of the College Park Laboratory alone. Consolidation oflaboratory testing at two laboratories results in more efficientuse of resources, and was accomplished with no disruption toservices, with the exception that certain clients who usuallydrop off samples at now closed labs may need to ship samplesto the remaining laboratories. The program continues to lookfor efficiencies in the use of scarce resources while providingquality service to laboratory customers.With the closing of the Oakland and College Park laboratories, Western regional services are now based in Frederick,Maryland and Eastern regional services are based in Salisburyafter the closing of the Centreville Laboratory. The FrederickLaboratory will provide primarily livestock diagnostic services,while the Salisbury Laboratory will continue to provide primarilypoultry diagnostic services, with the exception of EquineInfectious Anemia (EIA). The EIA tests, which are required for movement in Maryland, will be provided in Salisbury forEastern Shore owners as well as in Frederick. For field and regulatory work, two field veterinarians and three inspectorswill continue to serve the Western region, and one field veterinarian and two inspectors will serve the Eastern region. Regulatory Actions: Through continued outreach and education by program staff, notable progress was made by fair and show exhibitors and sponsors in the implementationof livestock exhibition regulations, which were revised in 2008. MDA policies pertaining to animal handling and welfare at livestock auction markets were revised, adopted and implemented in 2009. Implementation of these more specific and stringent policies included outreach and trainingof all auction market personnel by Animal Health staff. Theprogram restricted the use of the CEO (Chick Embryo Origin)ILT (Infectious Laryngotracheitis) vaccine in the state to control the spread of this disease caused by unrestricted use of this live virus vaccine. A draft regulation providingcomprehensive application of administrative penalties for violation of Animal Health regulations was submitted forreview in 2009 and is expected to be adopted in 2010,increasing MDA 's ability to enforce animal health regulations. \"State Stat,\" a State-wide statistics tracking program, was implemented by MDA in 2009, to facilitate tracking ofoperational trends for short and long-term planning purposes.Selected parameters for the Animal Health Section from thefinal report are shown in Table 1 (see next page). 36| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Animal Health Program37| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Emergency Response Readiness The emergency response capacity of the program remains high through the continued training and provisioning of adepartment-wide Agriculture Responders unit, consisting of MDA personnel assigned and trained to respond to all agricultural emergencies, including animal emergencies.In addition, Animal Health Program personnel continue tocollaborate with the Department of Health and MentalHygiene, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency(MEMA), the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examinersand the Maryland veterinary community to recruit, train andorganize the State Voluntary Veterinary Corps, a group ofapproximately 230 veterinarians and technicians willing tosupport emergency operations when activated. The programsponsored animal sheltering training, Incident CommandSystem (ICS) training, refresher training in respirator andother personal protective equipment use, as well as ForeignAnimal Disease training for Animal Health personnel, allMDA Agriculture Responders, collaborating agency personneland accredited and volunteer veterinarians. All Animal Healthfield and laboratory technical staff received ICS 100 and 200training under the departmental Emergency Operations andIncident Command System/Unified Command Plan. Animal Health staff participated in four state-wide emergency responses in 2009. These responses including Pr esidential Inauguration Preparedness (Biosecurity and Equine Inspectionsof Parade Horses and Statewide Equine and Companion A nimal Emergency Planning and Sheltering), Vomitoxin (fungal infestation of cereal grains) Investigations in grain and animals, MEMA activation for Hurricane Hannah emergencypreparedness, and novel H1N1 preparation and response,particularly for swine industry surveillance and outreach. Staff participated in numerous multistate industry emergency readiness planning activities and supported those activities innumerous local jurisdictions, particularly for avian influenzapreparedness. The program is a national leader with otherDelmarva partners in developing improved technologies andtactics for detecting and responding to emergency poultry diseases, including protecting the health of workers respondingto such outbreaks. Experience with Hurricane Katrina and subsequent storms made clear that effective evacuation of people cannot occur in the absence of effective animal evacuation and shelteringoperations. In 2009, the Animal Health Program along withthe Maryland Veterinary Medical Association and other partners continued to develop and expand the Maryland StateAnimal Response T eam (MD-SART). While similar to theagency-sponsored Volunteer Veterinary Corps, MD-SART is a non profit entity with broad membership among those withresponsibilities, interests and resources for animal emergencysituations. The long term vision for the Maryland SART is tobe an organization that can provide trained and organizedanimal response expertise and other resources to the Secretaryof Agriculture, other state agencies and local governmentsupon activation. The MD SART focus in 2009 was to promotethe formation of County/City Animal Response T eams (CARTs)across the state to support local governments. Considerablelocal progress on CART formation was made in 2009. Thoseefforts will continue through 2010. Disease Surveillance and Response The Animal Health program oversees or conducts ongoingroutine and active or enhanced surveillance for several livestockand poultry diseases. Enhanced surveillance is defined as an increased frequency or number of tests for a disease ofparticular significance or risk. Specific surveillance programsare highlighted below. Other livestock diseases and issues suchas bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease)in cattle, brucellosis in cattle, illegal garbage feeding to swine,vesicular stomatitis in horses and scrapie in sheep and goatscontinued to be part of our surveillance programs. As a result of disease surveillance and response efforts in 2009, quarantines (\"hold orders\") were placed on farms herpesvirus, rabies in horses, infectious laryngotracheatis in poultry, and routine 30-day quarantines for swine entering the state. Novel H1N1: The H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009 gave rise to enhanced surveillance in swine by the Animal Health program,and this enhanced surveillance will continue through the 2010influenza season. All swine with influenza like signs (ILI),including swine at auctions, exhibitions, and farms or presentingfor necropsy, are tested for influenza. No positive H1N1 swinewere detected in Maryland in 2009. Members of the AnimalHealth staff were heavily involved in national efforts to developaction plans for the novel H1N1 virus Avian Influenza: The program continues enhanced surveillance for avian influenza and other high consequence diseases ofpoultry in commercial and non commercial flocks throughfederal funding. No avian influenza was detected in poultry in2009 in Maryland. Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM): An outbreak of contagious equine metritis in the United States in 2008 continuedthrough 2009. Animal Health staff conducted five trace backinvestigations of Maryland horses in 2009. CEM is classified asa foreign animal disease, and is a bacterial venereal disease of horses which may cause infertility. Its presence in U.S. horseshas significant economic consequences. As of the end of 2009,998 horses linked to the CEM outbreak have been traced to 48states, with a total of 27 horses testing positive for the disease.Maryland has had a total of six trace backs; all tested negativefor the disease. Maryland is one of a small number of statesapproved to conduct laboratory testing for CEM. Marylandalso hosts two CEM quarantine stations in partnership withprivate facilities; one of these stations opened in August of 2009 and is still in provisional approval status. At the quarantine station, imported horses receive extensive testing to ensure they are free of CEM prior to being released forbreeding activity in the United States. Because of this extensiveexperience and laboratory capacity, Maryland is an importantpart of the national response to the CEM introduction.Johne's Disease: Johne's disease in cattle continues to be a serious threat to profitable dairy and beef operations. AnimalHealth employees, working in close cooperation with our cattleindustry and federal animal health partners, have enabledMaryland to continue participation in the Voluntary NationalJohne's Control Program, albeit at decreased levels due to cutsin all federal funding for this activity in 2009. MDA hasfocused a great deal of effort on educating producers and onenlisting the support of the attending herd veterinarian towork with the producer. Tuberculosis: Of particular concern is the ongoing reemergence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in cattle and white tailed deer.BTB has occurred in numerous states during the past severalyears and appears to be on the rise. The Animal Health programhas been heavily involved in national efforts to develop programmatic changes to the national plan needed to reestablishcontrol over this threat to public and animal health. Livestock and Poultry Auctions: All commercial livestock auctions in Maryland are inspected by Animal Health staff.During the inspections, animals are observed for signs ofinfectious or contagious disease, including foreign animal diseases. If an illness is suspected, the animal is isolated andtested. No contagious or infectious diseases of significancewere detected at auctions in 2009. Staff at the Salisbury Animal Health Laboratory with Agriculture Secretary Buddy Hance. 38| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services |39| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Animal Exhibitions: The 2009 fair and show season presented more opportunities for disease surveillance and producer education concerning biosecurity and the prevention ofinfectious diseases. The field inspection staff, augmented byother program staff, exhibit officials and trained volunteers,inspected and tested livestock and poultry upon entry toevents and during the course of the exhibition. Animals withsigns of infectious or contagious disease were isolated andexcluded from the exhibition. Outreach to 4-H and other fairand show exhibitors and sponsors was conducted throughoutthe year to educate animal owners in the recognition and isolation of diseased animals prior to an exhibition, providingincreased protection against the spread of contagious andinfectious disease. Fair sponsors have increased their effortssignificantly in gate inspections and overall animal health control activities.Animal Traceability/Animal ID: This year saw continued progress with the Maryland Department of Agriculture's participation in the USDA National Animal IdentificationSystem (NAIS). The goal is to use automated recordkeeping,similar to that used for tracking packages, to trace the movements of animals implicated in a disease outbreak within24-48 hours. While identifying the animals of concern is a priority, an equal or greater priority is identifying those animals, farms and facilities which are not involved in a disease investigation, so they can resume normal commercewith little or no delay, minimizing economic losses and business disruptions. T o date, property owners and operators with livestock have registered 1,482 premises in Maryland. This representsapproximately 18.9 percent of Maryland producers. T oincrease participation, program staff, along with federal and industry partners, are implementing ways to effectivelyintegrate animal identification with existing production,marketing and disease control systems. The NAIS staff also is aggressively registering poultry premises to comply with legislation enacted in 2005. T o date, 3,462 poultry premises areregistered under the state program. The database has beenused to notify and educate poultry producers of biosecurityrecommendations and testing availability, and has been usedto locate flocks adjacent to farms where avian influenza hasbeen suspected. The database allo wed staff to quickly identify nearby premises, visit them to test birds and provide appropriateinformation for those producers. Throughout the year other MDA Animal Health programs remained active. These included the licensing of livestock markets and dealers, investigation of antibiotic residues inmeat, and accreditation of new veterinarians. Maryland also isan active participant in the National Poultry ImprovementPlan (NPIP) and continues longstanding obligations to NPIP as well as vigorous participation in recent expansions of NPIP activities in response to avian influenza and salmonella concerns.

The mission ofthe system is to support the animal and public health regulatoryand emergency support missions of the Department; assistveterinarians and producers in maintaining healthy herds and flocks; and to support the regulatory activities of othergovernmental units involving animal health matters. T oaccomplish this mission, the system performs a wide array of diagnostic procedures on a variety of specimens and samplessubmitted by producers, agricultural businesses, animal owners, veterinarians and government agencies. Staff and Laboratory Focus The Frederick laboratory centers on food animal livestock and has a staff of four laboratory scientists, a veterinarypathologist and two office managers. The laboratory has special rabies, contagious equine metritis, equine herpes virus,equine infectious anemia, diseasediagnostic capabilities. The laboratory pathologist determinesthe nature, causes and effects of livestock, equine, and poultrydiseases. Emphasis is placed on changes in organs, tissues andcells caused by reportable diseases which affect domestic andfood animals and the public health. Additionally, the veterinarypathologist mentors senior students from the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, veterinarypathology graduate students from Johns Hopkins Universityand the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The Salisbury laboratory has a unique poultry diagnostic laboratory and a staff of one veterinary poultry pathologist,three laboratory scientists, two field inspectors, a laboratory technician and a necropsy technician. The lab has a largemolecular diagnostic capability that is dedicated to the detection of avian influenza and Newcastle disease and primarily serves the commercial poultry industry. Rabies andSalmonella diagnostics are carried out at the Salisbury lab, aswell as many other specific poultry disease diagnostic tests.The laboratory staff participates in disease outbreak surgecapacity programs with the Maryland Department of Healthand Human Hygiene. The laboratory shares a new laboratoryinformation management system (LIMS) with Delaware whichserves poultry producers in Maryland and Delaware.A major change to services provided to constituents occurred in March of 2009 when the Department of Budget andManagement concluded that MDA could not legally charge for non livestock (e.g. companion animals) services, norcharge for disposal of any animals not associated with anecropsy. The consequence of this decision was that MDAAnimal Health Diagnostic Laboratories could no longer provide testing or necropsies for companion animals except in cases of public health importance or by interagency agreements for disease control or animal welfare/cruelty cases. Also, incineration services are no longer offered forcompanion animals or livestock unless associated with anecropsy. This program change further reduced revenue to the program by an estimated $45,000. Statistics for selected livestock and poultry diseases are presented on the next page in Table 2. Laboratory Training, Quality Control and Certifications T o ensure the quality of laboratory services, the laboratory administration develops standards and periodic training forstaff. Presently, the administration is gaining laboratoryaccreditation through the International Standards Organization's(ISO) Section 17025 and the World Organization for AnimalHealth (OIE). This accreditation is administered by theAmerican Association of Laboratory Accreditation. TheSalisbury and Frederick laboratories will be participating inthis program. 41| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory System The MDA Frederick Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory.The Frederick and Salisbury facilities have been certified as Basic Sentinel Clinical Laboratories by the Department ofHealth and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). They participate withthe Maryland Laboratory Response Network which providesmicrobial challenge sets constructed by the State of Wisconsin.These tests are nationally and internationally recognized andcheck the proficiency levels of the technical staff and areadministered by the Laboratory Emergency Preparedness andResponse Committee of DHMH. In 2009, the Salisbury diagnostic laboratory successfully enrolled in the USDA National Poultry Improvement Programwhich recognizes Salmonella di agnostic proficiencies. Additionally, the laboratory personnel in the Salisbury and Frederick laboratories have been participating in the National AnimalHealth Laboratory Network (a USDA program) which pertains to certification to perform molecular diagnosticsassociated with avian influenza and Newcastle disease. A new safety and training officer has been appointed to oversee laboratory and field programs. The entire laboratorysystem staff was trained in shipping biological and chemicalmaterials, and use of personal protective equipment. Thistraining included the use of standard operating procedures,training materials and training records. Training also includedout-of-state workshops on the subject of molecular diagnostics(avian influenza) at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The United States Animal Health Association's (USAHA) annual meeting/training was attended by the State Veterinarian.Participation in the following USAHA committees took place:Johne's disease, Nominations and Resolutions, International Standards, Government Relations and the National Assemblyof State Animal Health Officials. Laboratory directors participated in various livestock and poultry industry workshops. Laboratory directors and staffparticipated in Delmarva Incident Command workshops toplan and practice response to a possible avian influenza incident. Animal Health Laboratory Partners and Customers The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratories serve and cooperate with a wide rangeof public and private entities including livestock producers,zoological parks, private veterinarians, the Maryland StateBoard of Veterinary Medical Examiners, the State Chemist,the equine industry, and state agencies such as the departmentsof Health and Mental Hygiene, Environment, Transportationand Natural Resources, the Maryland Occupational Safety andHealth Administration, the Maryland Emergency ManagementAgency, the Maryland State Highway Administration, theUniversity of Maryland Extension, the Johns Hopkins University,local health departments, and local animal control organizations.Federal partners include the USDA-Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, the Food and Drug Administration, theEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Food and DrugAdministration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Army, and the Smithsonian Institution. 42| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Animal Health Program Laboratory Statistics Diagnostic Activity Number Result Mammalian Necropsy 330 N/A Avian Necropsies 8,816 N/A Avian Influenza Samples 6,551 All negative Rabies 205 10 positive Equine Infectious Anemia 15,948 All negative Contagious Equine Metritis 2,191 All negative Equine Herpesvirus (EHV-1) 153 4 positive Lyme Disease 121 78 positive Johne's Disease in Cattle 5,280 361 positive blood tests (5,186 were serum Enzyme-Linked 30 positive fecal testsImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) or PCR blood tests and 94 were fecal tests)The Maryland Horse Industry Board (MHIB) consists of the Secretary of Agriculture and 11 members appointedby the Governor to four year terms. Chapter 416, Acts of 1998 defined six statutory duties of the Maryland HorseIndustry Board. Those duties are to: create public awareness ofthe value of equine activities as they relate to the preservationof greenspace and agricultural land; promote the developmentand use of horses in Maryland; support research related toequine health and related issues; advise the Maryland Departmentof Agriculture on matters affecting the horse industry; carryout the licensing, inspection, and enforcement of stables in Maryland; and develop and dissem inate informatio n concerning the equine industry, including the history and tradition ofbreeding and the role of horses in recreational activities. The MHIB continues to conduct projects for the benefit of the horse industry utilizing a specially funded source. That fundingsource was legislatively increased in the 2009 legislative session.Thanks to this funding the board continues to achieve all of itslegislatively mandated functions. Projects slated for the benefit of the Maryland horse industry in the near future include: Conducting the 2010 Maryland Equine Census, the firstsuch census since 2002; Conducting a concurrent Maryland Equine IndustryEconomic Impact Report; Setting a strategic marketing plan for the entire horseindustry for the next five years using the information compiled in the 2009 Maryland Horse Forum Final Report; Working on the Governor's Smart, Green, and GrowingInitiative to make horse op erations the most environmentally friendly farms in the nation, and by creating new opportunitiesfor bio-energy production utilizing horse waste; and Finalizing the Maryland Horse Park project, through theselection of a final location. The main challenges the board faces in the next year are: Obtaining funding for a Maryland Equine Industry Economic Impact Report; Retaining and expanding the entire industry in Marylanduntil such time as slot machine revenue is realized in the State; Improving, and preserving Maryland's historic race coursesand other historic Maryland horse sites;Resolving the potential impact of increased federal environmental regulation directed toward horse farms coupled with the low to non-existent funding for the implementation of best management practices on small tomedium sized horse operations; and Creating a cohesive plan to maintain and grow the horseindustry during turbulent economic times. As the commodity board for the Maryland horse industry the board hopes to continue to develop and grow the success ofthe recreational horse industry and to work to re-establish the prominence of the Maryland horse racing and breedingindustries. T o that end the board endeavors to find newsources of revenue to support its activities. Key accomplishments in 2009 Hosted the 2009 Maryland Horse Forum at the PrinceGeorge's Equestrian Center and Showplace Arena. The event, which was organized following a recommendationfrom Governor Martin O'Malley, was an excellent step indemonstrating the overall unity of the Maryland horse industry. Through this event all sectors of the industry wereable to develop recommendations to address all of the issuescurrently affecting the Maryland horse industry. In attendanceat the event on August 6, 2009 were more than 300 leaders ofthe Maryland horse industry. The event was attended byGovernor Martin O'Malley, who served as the keynote speaker.The event resulted in a comprehensive 55 page report whichoutlined how to strategically improve the overall structure and operation of the Maryland equine industry. For moreinformation, visit www.mdhorseforum.com. 43| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Maryland Horse Industry Board Governor O'Malley rides at Tailwinds farm in Cecil County as part of his Capital for a Day activities.Licensed 583 horse stables in FY 2009 The licensing of 583 horse stables is an increase of 55 stablessince FY 2008. The overall rise in facility licenses is attributed tothe work of the stable inspectors, the executive director andadministrative assistant, the continued use of a Oracle databaseto monitor licensed and unlicensed stables, improved recordsbeing supplied to stable inspecto rs, and the installation of civil penalties to allow the MHIB to pu rsue illegally operating stables more effectively. The previous record of 528 licensed stables wasdramatically eclipsed in FY 2009. T hose numbers will most likely remain steady for FY 2010. For a complete listing of licensedMaryland stables visit www.horseboard.org. Worked with the Maryland Horse Council towards the passage of legislation clarifying equine activities as agricultural in nature. The board worked with the Maryland Horse Council towardsthe passage of House Bill 955 which clearly defined equine activitiesas including \"teaching equestrian skills, participating in equestriancompetitions, exhibitions or other displays of equestrian skills,and caring for, breeding, boarding, renting, riding, or traininghorses.\" The legislation further clarified that \"equine activitiesshall be treated as agricultural activities for the purposes of thissubtitle.\" While this only directly impacts the statute of theMaryland Department of Agriculture, it may potentially provideguidance to other agencies, and local governments when evaluatingwhat is and is not an acceptable use of agricultural property. Received support from industry organizations to increase the budget of the board. In a show of support for the work of the Maryland HorseIndustry Board, organizations such as the Maryland HorseCouncil, and the Maryland Horse Breeders Associationworked to support a special fund increase of the board in the2009 legislative session through House Bill 973. Starting in fiscal year 2010 the board will increase its budget by morethan two times its size in fiscal year 2009 and it will rise to asmuch as three times the fiscal year 2009 budget by 2011. Thosefunds are derived from the entire equine industry through areimbursable assessment on equine feed sold in the State. Continued to disseminate the information from the initial Feasibility Study of the Maryland Horse Park. The horse park would create a new large scale market forMaryland equine goods and services as well as an attractionfor increased business, media attention, and marketability ofMaryland's equine industry. If located in Central Maryland the establishment of a Maryland Horse Park would generatemore than $123 million dollars a year in economic impact onthe local and state economy, more than 1,900 new jobs, andmillions of dollars in annual tax revenue from tourists. Thisproject was one of the original missions of the MHIB and willremain a priority until its completion. The project was high-lighted in the Governor's transition report as an important project for the future of the industry. While the MHIB selectednot to pursue a long-term lease on the property in Gambrills,Maryland, the board intends to work on its establishment atanother undetermined location. Currently, a number ofcounties including Harford, Howard and Wicomico have publiclyexpressed interest in the project. The MHIB has also beenapproached by interested parties located on the Eastern Shore,Central Maryland and in Southern Maryland regarding thepotential for the project in those areas. Continued meetings of the MHIB\u2014Health Advisory Committee. This committee was established to: advise the MHIB on matters of equine health and disease in the State; ensure theestablishment and implementation of effective industry andcommunity communication vehicles; and review and adviseon a number of subjects. The issues on which the committeeadvises include: Maryland policies and protocols regardingreportable diseases; Maryland statutes regulations relatingto equine health; Interstate health requirements; capabilities ofthe Maryland State Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratories;and emergency preparedness protocols. Many of the committee'sefforts have yielded positive results for the State including theestablishment of PCR analysis of equine samples in Maryland.This capability enables the MDA Animal Health Section to resolvea potential disease outbreak in a matter of days as opposed toweeks and to better protect the horses and the industry. Assisted the interagency Horse Outreach Workgroup. This interagency task force has worked to reduce the overallcontribution of the equine industry to sediment and nutrientrun off. The group has been recognized nationally for its workand is being used as a model for other state programs. 44| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Governor Martin O'Malley jokes with Steuart Pittman, Maryland Horse Council President at the Maryland Horse Forum.45| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Listed below are program statistics from the past three fiscal years: Y ear Y ear Y ear Category 2007 2008 2009 Number of stable licenses issued 528 518 583 Number of inspections performed annually 440* 376* 481 Percentage of facilities inspected and in compliance 100% 100% 100%Revenue collected from licensing and inspecting horse $39,600 $38,850 $43,725 stables in Maryland and directed to General Funds.Revenue collected from assessment based on tons $85,796 $78,426** $72,826** of horse feed sold in Maryland at $2 a ton Outcomes:T otal amount of money distributed as grants for $20,916 $22,270** $0** for promotional, educational, or research projects for the Maryland horse industry.

As a result the inspection numbers were down for F Y 2007 and FY 2008. Mid-way through FY 2008 a new inspector was transferred to the Board by the MDA. ** In FY 2008 and FY 2009 the revenue generated from the equine commercial feed assessment continued to decline from FY 2007, most likely due to decreased feed consumption caused by the loss of breeding and racing horses to neighboring states wit h slots-supplemented racing and breeding sectors. The MHIB was able to acquire $18,000 for its marketing efforts to offset the los s of revenue and enable the board to fund its grant commitments; however, the MHIB was forced to stop all of its remaining promotionalactivities and was unable to fund grants in FY 2009. The MHIB will have an increase in its special fund budget for FY 2010 and w ill be able to fulfill the granting commitments from FY 2009.The regulation of commercial weights, measures, weighing and measuring devices, prepackaged productsand methods employed in the sale of commodities is a necessary function of government and is the responsibility ofthe Weights and Measures Section. These controls serve bothbuyer and seller by establishing standards of commercialmeasurement that can be uniformly applied to the exchange of goods and service. While the federal government has some limited responsibility for weights and measures controls, the states have historicallytaken the initiative in this area. T oday, enforcement in theUnited States is recognized primarily as a state governmentresponsibility. The federal government plays an important roleby providing assistance to the states through the NationalInstitute of Standards and T echnology (NIST). NIST isresponsible for maintaining the national standards and operating a laboratory for certification of standards. TheNational Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) incooperation with NIST develops and promotes uniformity instandards, laws and inspection methods to provide maximumpublic protection through an equitable marketplace. TheNCWM also manages the National Type Evaluation Program(NTEP), which type-certifies weighing and measuring equipment prior to entering the marketplace. In FY2009, the field staff conducted approximately 44,626 inspections of commercial weighing and measuring devices.This is approximately 6,500 more devices than the previousyear. The inspectors also tested 12,356 individual lots ofprepackaged commodities offered for sale. The inspectors alsowent into non food stores and did price verification and wefound some large price deviations from the advertized price,one large error was an overcharge of $10.00 per item. A number of firms received civil penalties for the price errorsfound. In FY2009 the Weights and Measures Section collected$47,750 in civil penalties. The Weights and Measure Sectiondoes not receive or benefit from these funds as they are all sent to the State General Fund. In FY2009, the field staff investigated 681 consumer complaints. The large number of complaints can be attributed to consumersbeing more aware of the Weights and Measures Section andthe high price of gasoline. The investigation of consumer complaints is given priority over routine inspections.Complaints continue to require the equivalent of two inspectors working full time. With no one dedicated to investigating complaints, inspectors must be redirected on an as needed basis and therefore, fewer routine inspections can be done. The Weights and Measures Section needs a full time investigator who not only has investigative skills but understands all specifications and tolerances in NIST Handbook44 along with the relevant test procedures for all devices. Funding for the field inspection program continues to be a major concern. The field inspection program currently operates on Special Fund revenue collected from device registration fees. Increases in health care and gasoline costsmake it difficult to maintain the current staff. The 1992Maryland General Assembly established the registration fees tooffset General Fund budget reductions. Fees were increased bythe 2005 Maryland General Assembly. The increased fees wereonly a temporary fix to the funding of Weights and Measuresinspection staff. The interval be tween inspections has risen to approximately 24 months. We anticipate this trend will continuedue to the small number (18 field inspectors) of inspection staff. In light of its funding issues, the Weights and MeasuresSection continues to review the operational aspects of the program in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of service. The registration of approximately 7,000 businesses has created a database that is an effective management tool. It allows theadministrative staff to put our limited resources in the mostcritical areas and provides each field inspector a tool to plantheir inspection work more efficiently, thereby reducing driving time and providing more uniform inspection coverage.This information will assist the section in prioritizing its limited resources to protect Maryland consumers and maintaina level playing field for industries that operate in the State. The section published regulations for the Voluntary Registration of Service Agencies and Service T echnicians earlyin FY2004. This program establishes controls over the installation,servicing or repairing of commercial weighing and measuringdevices with a goal of reducing the number of callback or follow-up inspections necessary each year. Currently, 43 stateshave a program establishing some type of control over theinstallation, servicing or repairing of commercial weighingand measuring devices. The effort has produced some additionalspecial funds for the section, but not nearly enough to eliminatethe problems we have encountered in the last five years. Maryland's Metrology Laboratory maintains primary standards of mass, length, volume and temperature that arelegally traceable to the National Institute of Standards andT echnology and provides a measurement capability at the statelevel that is consistent with national measurement goals. 46| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Weights and Measures SectionThe Maryland Weights and Measures Laboratory is recognized by the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program(NVLAP) for compliance with criteria set forth in TheInternational Standard ISO/IEC 17025:1999 and relevantrequirements of ISO 9002:1994.

The Maryland Agricultural Fair Board was created by the state legislature in 1937 to fosteragriculture by promoting and assisting agricultural fairs andexhibits. It gives financial aid to qualifying organizations forpremium awards to exhibitors of agricultural displays.Annually, the Board issues a schedule of fairs and shows tohelp publicize the events. The Board consists of nine memberswho represent various regions of the state and are appointedby the Governor. The daily affairs of the Board are handled bya part-time executive secretary. Headquarters for the Boardhas been the Maryland Department of Agriculture since theagency's creation and prior to that headquarters were at theMaryland State Fair grounds. The Board administers grant funds for fairs, livestock shows, community shows, and 4-H and FFA youth activities throughan application process. The Board funded fairs, communityshows, livestock and other agricultural events, and theMaryland State Fair in 2009. Additional funding for 4-H andFFA enabled tens of thousands of youth to be recognized fortheir achievements and provided helped youth attend judgingcontests and other competitive events on the regional andnational levels. Y outh participation continues to increase in all activities funded by the Board while adult participation in livestock events atfairs decreases. This can be attributed to the tight agriculturalclimate, labor, and weather. Indoor participation at fairs andshows is increasing for adults especially in the hand arts while fruit and vegetable exhibition is dependent on localweather patterns. 49| Marketing, Animal Industries and Consumer Services | Maryland Agricultural Fair Board Top: Governor O'Malley with the 2009 Frederick County Fair King and Queen during his visit to the Great Frederick Fair.

P. ramorum is the pathogen that causes sudden oak death, ramorum leaf blight, or ramorum dieback in a variety of desirable woody plants. MDA notified each of the householdsthat received these plants and requested they send samples toMDA for testing. Sixteen have responded to date, sending atotal of 24 suspect samples. Of the 24 received, only one, awitchhazel sent to Montgomery County, tested positive for the disease. The P. ramorum infected plant was removed and eradicated. Following USDA protocol, soil samples and associatedP. ramorum host plants around the infected plants were also tested and found to be negative. MDA has followed up on theremaining 12 trace forwards to complete the record. Klinker, a female black Labrador retriever, is MDA 's newest dog trained to sniff out American foulbrood (AFB), a bee disease, in honeybee colonies and bee equipment. After extensivetraining and testing, she began working at full capacity thisNovember. So far in 2009, she has visited 47 apiaries andinspected 539 colonies. Klinker, has detected AFB at five apiaries,in a total of six colonies. All six disease alerts were confirmedlater by samples sent to the Bee Research Laboratory (BRL) inBeltsville. In addition, she has detected AFB (also confirmedlater by BRL) that couldn't be found by routine, visual humaninspection of equipment. Klinker must be retested by thetrainers every three months for recertification. She is a pleasure to work with as well as a big asset to MDA and itsApiary Inspection Program. Apiary Inspection The primary purpose of this program is to control honey beediseases, mites, and pests, in order to maintain healthy bees forthe essential pollination of Maryland crops valued at morethan $40 million. Maryland growers of fruit and vegetablecrops annually rent approximately 5,000 colonies to improvepollination. Beekeepers' colonies are essential to Marylandbecause two parasitic mites have nearly eliminated feral colonies. American foulbrood is the most serious brood disease of honey bees and can destroy a colony in one year. The 40colonies that inspectors found to have American foulbroodwere destroyed to control the spread of this bacterial disease tohealthy colonies. The incidence of disease remains relativelylow\u2014less than two percent of colonies inspected.Varroa and tracheal mite populations were very low in Maryland in 2009, but brood problems were attributed to varroa mite in the season. The varroa mite often has beenfound to be resistant to Apistan\u00ae, the primary product used to control this parasite. Four additional products are nowavailable to control varroa. Africanized honey bees arrive occasionally on cargo ships coming from South or Central America. Swarm traps for collecting and monitoring bees were placed at 35 sites atmarine terminals and other shipping locations. No swarmswere collected in 2009. MDA is working with two groups\u2014theMid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium(MAAREC) to provide information to the general publicabout emergency incidents, and the Apiary Inspectors ofAmerica (AIA) for information on the control of movement,other than through natural spread. The small hive beetle was detected in packaged bees and reported or detected in 19 counties this past year. Colonies are treated and monitored to ensure successful control of thebeetles. There have been no reports of larvae damage to established colonies. The small hive beetle is a pest mainly instored equipment and in honey houses, although it can renderstored honey in the hive unmarketable. Permits were issued for 3,975 honey bee colonies to move out of Maryland and 550 colonies to move into Maryland forpollination services. For the fourth year, Maryland beekeeperswill send colonies to California for almond pollination. InDecember, 2,307 colonies will be transported to California forthis purpose, to return to Maryland in March of 2010. Nursery Inspection and Plant Quarantine The nursery and greenhouse industry continues to be a leadingpart of Maryland's agricultural economy, currently rankingsecond among commodities with a total of approximately$732 million in farm income. Other horticultural productsand services sold boosted the total gross receipts to nearly$1.04 billion. A primary goal of state plant protection andquarantine efforts is to facilitate the production, sale, and distribution of Maryland nursery stock. This is accomplishedin large part by inspection and ce rtification activities conducted on-site by MDA staff. Maryland law and reciprocal agreements with other states require that plant material at each producing nursery beinspected annually for freedom from dangerously injuriousplant pests prior to its subsequent sale to other states. State 50| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Plant Protection and Weed Management phytosanitary certificates that assure specific compliance with established domestic quarantines were issued to 10 states.Federal phytosanitary certificates required to export Marylandnursery stock were issued to 10 foreign countries includingArgentina, Spain, and Vietnam. A total of 38 federal and 71state certificates were issued in 2009. Although this reflects a27 percent reduction in total certificates issued from 2008,MDA staff continued to pursue further cooperative agreementopportunities and followed revised protocols that have streamlined and improved the preparation of Maryland nursery stock for sale and distribution to both foreign anddomestic markets. Maryland Department of Agriculture staff inspected plant material at 417 Maryland locations to intercept dangerouslyinjurious or exotic pests. The general health of Maryland-produced nursery stock was found to be excellent. Pest Survey Current information on pest distribution and abundance isneeded for regulatory actions by the Department and for pestcontrol actions by Maryland farmers. Maryland Departmentof Agriculture Plant Protection & Weed Management Section'spest survey program had been utilized for this mission.Economic circumstances necessitated significant reduction instate supported activities in 2009. Due to budgetary cutbacks,the blacklight and pheromone traps were not deployed earlyenough in the spring to alert growers on the Eastern Shore ofpotential outbreaks of black cutworm or true armyworm. Theblacklight trap numbers were reduced by half, started later,and ended sooner than normal. The endemic pheromonetraps were not deployed at all. The black cutworm can causesevere losses to corn and vegetable crops, and the armywormto small grains. Further funding reductions have eliminatedthe blacklight trap program and one permanent state employee assigned to the program. The Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) is a joint project between the MDA and the USDA APHIS, PlantProtection and Quarantine (PPQ). USDA recommends pestsof quarantine export significance as survey priorities and provides funding for these surveys. MDA adapts the appropriatesurvey methods and conducts the ac tual survey. This cooperative program has provided necessary data used to certify Marylandproducts for export to many countries. CAPS surveys document the presence or absence of exotic pests in Maryland, support PPQ exot ic pest survey activities, and provide state-specific data for exotic pests in the UnitedStates. If any of these species were to become established, they would pose a significant threat to our agricultural productionand have a significant impact on Maryland's ability to exportagricultural commodities. Early detection of exotic pestsbefore they become established will aid in any eradication orcontrol efforts undertaken and protect Maryland agricultureand the environment from potentially devastating losses.Federally funded surveys included exotic wood borers,exotic grape pest, imported fire ant, giant hogweed, noxiousweed/Khapra beetle, pine shoot beetle, emerald ash borer, andSirex noctilio . A total of 5,810 insect traps were deployed and monitored in 2009. Through the various types of surveys conducted, 4,098samples were collected and more than 14,443 insects identified.Trapping techniques involved a wide range of devices, includingblacklight and pheromone traps. Educational efforts accountedfor a new giant hogweed site being reported in Garrett County. The surveys target pests that are both exotic and endemic to Maryland. Fourteen extensive surveys for exotic wood borers,stored product pests, and field, fruit and vegetable crop pestswere conducted. The majority of the pests targeted were eithernot present or did not reach significant levels of concern.MDA conducted exotic bark beetle surveys in five countiesand 14 sites and at nine vineyards in four counties in 2009. Afew pests, such as the emerald ash borer and imported fire ant,required responses. It is interesting to note that the euonymusleaf notcher, an exotic moth that can completely strip a euonymus bush of its leaves, has again expanded its knownrange around Glen Burnie and Annapolis/Hillsmere and wasfound in Bowie, Prince George's County. Surveys in these areasshow that it continues to slowly expand its range each year. The red imported fire ant ,Solenopsis invicta , a South American stinging insect, is occasionally shipped out of the southernUnited States, in spite of a federal domestic quarantine thatprohibits movement of a variety of commodities unless treatedand/or certified free of fire ants. The insect's ability to quicklycolonize in a variety of habitats, and its aggressive foragingbehavior, pose additional dangers if established in Maryland.Thirty-two isolated infestations have been eradicated in theState since 1989. New imported fire ant detections inMaryland were down from three in 2007, two in 2008, to onein 2009. The reduction is largely due to MDA 's efforts in thespring to inspect trucks transporting tropical foliage plantsfrom the quarantined areas in the southern United States,work closely with officials in those states, and the brokers andrecipients in Maryland. Three of the four positive sites of 51| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |the 83 surveyed in 2009 were associated with areas under eradication and were likely not new infestations. The Department continues to survey for the pine shoot beetle , Tomicus piniperda , a potentially severe pest of pine trees in North America. This European beetle was inadvertently introduced into the Great Lakes Region in 1992. Since thattime, this pest has been found in 17 states. Its detection hasresulted in a federal domestic quarantine to regulate themovement of pine nursery stock, cut pine Christmas trees,pine wreaths and garlands, and pine logs from areas where it isestablished. Tree-growing sites within the regulated area mustbe surveyed and found free of the beetle before regulatedproducts can be shipped to areas outside the quarantined area.Alternatively, all pine products from within an area underquarantine may be fumigated, however that treatment is generally cost prohibitive. MDA surveys first detected pine shoot beetle in 1995 in Allegany County. Since then pine shoot beetle has been detectedin Garrett, Washington, Frederick and Montgomery counties.All of these counties are under state and federal quarantinerestrictions. Over the past eight years Garrett County hasexperienced a 10-fold increase in captured beetles. However,since 2003 no beetles have been trapped in MontgomeryCounty. Infestations in Allegany, Frederick, and Washingtoncounties continued to be monitored and remain relatively low.In 2009 no additional counties were positive. An additional nine counties, including the pine timber producing counties on theEastern Shore, were surveyed and no beetles were detected. MDA staff, in cooperation with federal Plant Protection and Quarantine officers, continues to work with the nursery,Christmas tree, and logging industries in Western Maryland toinform them of the quarantine and methods of compliance inorder to minimize potential risks and to facilitate commerceand trade. Trapping and/or visual inspections were conductedat all nurseries and tree farms that requested or required certification of Christmas trees, pine nursery stock, and pineproducts. All farms met the requirements for shipping pinetrees and pine products. MDA 's Plant Protection and ForestPest Management staff surveys made it possible for growers toconfirm compliance with federal law and to continue shippinghigh quality pine trees and pine products from within thequarantine area in Western Maryland. The eradication efforts undertaken since the 2006 rediscovery of the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis ) in Prince George's and Charles counties have been redirected due to the realization that removal of all ash host material withinprescribed distances from known positive trees was not 52| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | eliminating the pest. A new plan of action utilizing all available strategies including quarantine enforcement and chemical andbiological control are being undertaken to limit the spread ofemerald ash borer. Intensive statewide survey using purpleprism traps and visual detection will be increased in 2010.Systemic insecticides are being used to treat trap trees in theimmediate vicinity of known populations in conjunction withthe release and monitoring of three parasitoids (wasps thatspecifically target the egg or larvae of the beetle and kill them).With material and assistance from USDA, two sites withknown infestations had over 10,500 parasitoids released in2009. Within the eradication zone, 1,010 trap trees were plantedin an effort to retain beetles that remain in the area. Six hundredeighty seven of these trees were treated with systemic insecticidesas were 570 urban and forest trees. In 2010, urban and foresttrees will be selectively treated around known infestations andheavily infested trees will be removed only where appropriate.In 2009, 2,478 purple prism traps were monitored in 18 counties.Detections were made from traps surrounding the eradicationzone but no new areas were found. For more information on the Maryland Emerald Ash Borer Project, please an exotic pest of pine trees that was first detected in NewY ork in 2004 and is currently known to occur in limited areasof Michigan, Pennsylvania and Vermont. Concern has beenraised because this native of Europe, Asia and northern Africahas the potential to cause significant mortality of pines,including loblolly. This insect has a novel life cycle thatincludes inserting a fungus along with its egg into a healthytree so that the young can feed on the wood fiber digested bythe fungus. This fungus quickly kills the tree. Plant Protectionand Weed Management staff surveyed Maryland's eight northerntier counties bordering Pennsylvania and 14 other high risklocations. Each of the counties had 10 traps which were servicedfrom June through October. No target specimens were collected. Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum ) is a federal noxious weed that was first detected in the State of Marylandin 2003 at 29 sites in Baltimore and Harford counties. In 2005,eight additional sites in Garrett County were added to this listas was one additional site in 2007. Of the 11 locations reportedin 2009, only one of the seven positive sites was new in 2009.Four of the seven sites treated early had no re-growth later inthe summer. A multi-state eradication effort is underway; allprevious sites and all newly verified sites were brought into thisprogram. Plans have been made to continue this effort in 2010.Diagnostic Laboratories The Plant Protection and Weed Management diagnostic laboratories provide testing and analyses that support departmental programs and provide answers to inquiries fromoutside the department and from the general public. During2009, samples submitted to the laboratory were received fromwithin MDA, University of Maryland Extension, nursery andlandscape businesses, and the general public. Entomology Laboratory In 2009, several unusual samples were submitted for identification. The white-footed ant ( Technomyrmex albipes ) was collected in Ocean City from fire ant survey cups. This ant is becoming a major house pest in southern states. Also on the Eastern Shore, woolly pine scale ( Pseudophilippia quaintancii ), was detected from loblolly pine in Trappe. The wet year produced several slime mold, earthstar ( Bipalium sp. ) was found in a woodpile in Baltimore County. It has been seen previously in Howard andPrince George's counties. This large (3\"-5\" long) importedflatworm captures and feeds on earthworms, slugs, ) continued to vex citizens over much of the State. Although harmless andno longer of regulatory concern, these gregarious, fall houseinvaders can be annoying in numbers, much like boxelderbugs ( Boisea trivittatus ). Plant Pathology Laboratory The mission of the Plant Pathology Laboratory at the Maryland Department of Agriculture is to evaluate plant samples for plant pathogens and diseases. General activitiesinclude: evaluating plant samples in support of the NurseryInspection Program to ensure that all plant material inMaryland intended for distribution or sale is disease free;diagnosing plant diseases submitted by other sections ofMDA, other Maryland agencies, home gardeners, homeowners,consultants, and industry representatives; providing technicaland diagnostic support for virus-free certification programs;supporting the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey programthrough laboratory assays for specific diseases; and supportingUSDA APHIS and MDA regulatory functions through diagnosticassays for pathogens of regulatory importance. The PlantPathology Laboratory was positively impacted in 2009 by thehiring of our new Plant Disease Specialist in the spring of this 53| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |year. Dr. Weston Msikita began work in the Plant Pathology Laboratory in May, conducting surveys, running the PlantDisease Diagnostic Clinic, as well as analyses for Phytophthora ramorum on trace forward samples, and training a high school student in correct laboratory techniques. The MDA Plant Disease Diagnostic Clinic was established primarily to assist MDA nursery inspection staff with routinediagnostics of plant diseases. Nearly 200 diseased samples havebeen received in the lab since May, 2009. Samples have comefrom five different sources: plant inspectors (40%), directlyfrom home growers (25%), commercial landscapers (18%),Pesticide Regulation Section (15%), and direct visits to growers(2%). Diseases diagnosed have varied with the host plantinfected, and have ranged from root and stem diseases, bacterialinfections, nematodes, viruses and nutritional disorders.The numerous plant samples on the P. ramorum host and associated host list the lab received from home owners,landscapers, and plant dealers around the state have testednegative for P. ramorum . In 2009, the lab was involved in three different kinds of disease surveys: grape surveys for Phytoplasma yellows and brown rotfungus ( Phellinus noxius ); intensive survey for chrysanthemum white rust at a commercial production unit, and one spotcheck for Japanese rust at a home property. (a) Grape Survey: Nine vineyards in Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick and Montgomery counties were surveyed for thetwo diseases, and none were found to be infected. In anincident unrelated to the two diseases, one vineyard inCarroll County was found to have tomato ringspot virus(T oRSV) some broadleaf weeds. Grape samples, soil, anda larger number of weed samples were tested for T oRSV ,and presence of Xiphinema spp. (the nematode that transmits the T oRSV). No T oRSV was diagnosed on thegrape samples, but the virus was confirmed on dandelions(Taraxacum officinale ), and Xiphinema spp. were isolated from soil samples. (b) Chrysanthemum White Rust: Intensive surveys for chrysanthemum white rust at a commercial productionunit on the Eastern Shore found no rust at the facility. (c) Japanese Apple Rust: Japanese apple rust was reported by USDA at a home in Silver Spring. An on-the-spot checkwas carried out, followed by a random inspection of hostassociated plants in the neighborhood. Rust was found on afew crabapple trees and at least one apple plant.Training: A high school student from Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt has been gaining practical trainingin the lab periodically since October. She is using ELISA toimprove detection of T oRSV in hard to detect host plantspecies, and is scheduled to finish her training before theend of the year. Greenhouse Laboratory Plants were produced for integrated pest management andbiological control programs that require food for insectcolonies and plant material for research. These included purple loosestrife ( Lythrum salicaria ) to produce and mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata ), used of the stem boring weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes . A variety of native grasses were seeded and grown as part of our continuing effort to establish a new native grass nurseryand germplasm repository at the University of MarylandWestern Maryland Research and Education Center inKeedysville. A collection of herbaceous perennials used forteaching and testing purposes by the Certified ProfessionalHorticulturist (CPH) Program, in conjunction with theMaryland Nursery and Landscape Association, was maintained and expanded. Plant Certification The MDA continues to participate in the virus-free rose certification program with Angelica Nursery, maintaining two varieties of roses and certified stock plants of one of thevarieties in 2009. One variety was propagated by tissue culture,producing a total of 236 plants. Laboratory and greenhousepersonnel participated in a visual inspection of all rose plantsat the nursery, both in the spring and the fall, and submittedfour leaf samples of stock plants to Agdia for testing in theirrose screen for viruses. Visual surveys are conducted twice ayear, and testing occurs once each year. The Maryland Ginseng Management Program protects American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius , by monitoring the harvest and by licensing diggers and dealers of wild,wild-simulated, woods-grown and cultivated ginseng. MDAconducts a management program in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that follows establishedprotocols to ensure the continued viability of this potentiallythreatened native resource and to protect it from over-harvest.Harvested ginseng is certified through the program to enablelicensed dealers to sell this wild-harvested plant product ininternational markets. MDA also works with growers of wild-simulated and woods-grown ginseng to allow them to market 54| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |and export their highly valued crops. The dried roots are highly prized, especially in China and Korea, for properties that putatively promote good health. In 2008-2009 the programlicensed seven ginseng dealers and 314 ginseng collectors inthe State. During the 2008-2009 harvest and sales season, the certification program inspected, collected size and age data from, andweighed 74.72 pounds of dry wild and wild-simulated ginsengroot; 444 pounds of artificially propagated dry ginseng rootand 1.5 pounds of wild-simulated stratified ginseng seed.These harvest and certification numbers were among the lowestin Maryland over the last two decades and are likely due to thestatus of the global economy which has driven down the priceper pound of all types of ginseng. Many licensed harvestersdid not sell the ginseng they dug in 2008, hoping for a recoveryin the price of ginseng on the international market. Harvestand sales data were gathered and reports submitted in accordance with FWS requirements. The amount of ginseng cultivated, including woods-grown and wild-simulated designations in Maryland, and certified bythe department, continues to remain high relative to theamount of wild ginseng harvested and certified in the state.This reflects both continuing interest in ginseng as an alternativecrop, and the ability of Maryland growers to produce highquality ginseng. If this trend continues, harvest pressure onwild ginseng may be reduced, in turn allowing wild ginsengpopulations to rebound. Integrated Pest Management & Biological Control In 2009, Plant Protection and Weed Management staff againparticipated in a Plant Protection Guest Lecture Series at theUniversity of Maryland, in ongoing cooperation with theMaryland Plant Protection Center. This effort is a collaborationbetween USDA and the University of Maryland that aims toestablish a leading academic research and extension programin the mid-Atlantic region. W eed Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Plant Protection and Weed Management Section entomologistsand staff continued to conduct an IPM program to providebiological control of certain thistle species. The program hashelped significantly to control musk thistle along highwayareas that are inaccessible to mowing and/or spraying equipment.MDA provided technical assistance with noxious weed problems on public land to various federal, county and stateagencies, including the University of Maryland, theDepartment of Natural Resources, correctional institutions,county road departments, State Highway Administration andthe U.S. Department of the Interior.Weed IPM research activities were conducted at field plots at the MDA facility in Cheltenham, at the Western MarylandResearch and Education Center in Keedysville, and along StateHighway Administration rights of ways. These cooperativeresearch projects have been conducted over each of the pastnine years. IPM investigations continued to target the suppressionof Cirsium and Carduus thistles. Research is focused on theevaluation of organisms for potential biocontrol, testing herbicide formulation efficacy, and evaluating the use ofcompetitive vegetation (including native grasses and forbs), inan effort to provide environmentally sound and cost-effectivemethods for suppression of noxious thistle species in Maryland. The staff entomologist coordinating the weed IPM program and the MDA Plant Protection Section Program Manager metwith State Highway Administration (SHA) Landscape OperationsDivision staff and SHA Research Division administrators to review program accomplishments and progress, and tocoordinate and develop a new work plan and memorandum of understanding for research over the next two years. A survey for the presence and effects of rose rosette disease was continued in 2009. Rose rosette disease is a disease of themultiflora rose, Rosa multiflora , a problem weed in pastures, woodlands, and rights of ways in Maryland and many otherstates. The disease, which has become established in NorthAmerica and is spread by natural means, reduces populationsof this invasive rose species. Since the disease was first detected in Maryland in the 1990s, results of surveys conducted by MDA Plant Protection andWeed Management staff indicate that the disease is continuingto spread over a wide portion of Central and NorthernMaryland, and has become locally established in SouthernMaryland and on Maryland's Eastern Shore. In 2009, a fieldexperiment to test the relative susceptibility of various rosecultivars and native rose species to rose rosette disease wascontinued at the MDA facility in Cheltenham. This experiment,begun in 2002, is intended to provide valuable informationneeded to assess the effects of the disease on rose species otherthan R. multiflora , including native species and cultivars important to the landscape and nursery trade in Maryland. This was another active year for releases of biological control agents, the leaf-feeding beetles Gallerucella calmariensis and Lythrum salicaria ). All of the beetles year were from beetles reared at the MDA plant pest quarantine facility in Annapolis.During the summer of 2009, more than 800 adult beetles werereleased at several locations on the Patuxent River near JugBay and adjacent to the Merkle Wildlife Management Area. 55| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Additional releases were made in Anne Arundel County (200 adult beetles), in Prince George's County (200 adult beetles),in central Howard County (550 adult beetles), in southernCharles County near Port T obacco (1,400 adult beetles) andon the Eastern Shore of Maryland in Caroline County (800)adult beetles. Partners with the Maryland Department ofAgriculture in these efforts are the Maryland Department ofNatural Resources, the Maryland-National Capital Park andPlanning Commission, and the Howard County Departmentof Recreation and Parks. Funding for the project was, in part,derived from funds dedicated by the Maryland Department ofTransportation, State Highway Administration. MDA was theprimary coordinating agency. The Gallerucella rearing program move from Cheltenham to our main headquarters in Annapolis has continued to besuccessful as well as efficient. MDA staff reared beetles at theMDA greenhouse and rearing laboratories in Annapolis and in2008 were successful for the first time at bringing the adultbeetles out of overwintering diapause and increasing beetlenumbers significantly over the course of the spring and summer. Progress continued in 2009 and MDA staff is makingpreparations to increase production even further in 2010. In addition to the releases and the rearing project described above, locations where beetles were previously released inPrince George's, Howard, Anne Arundel, Charles and Carolinecounties were surveyed for Gallerucella, and were evaluatedfor levels of plant control. No detectable level of control ofpurple loosestrife has been noted, but for the fifth consecutiveyear, high numbers of beetles were observed at the HowardCounty site, indicating that established populations are reproducing at that location. Slow increase of beetle populationsis not uncommon, and significant reduction of purple loosestrifepopulations has taken five to seven years or longer in someother states. Additional releases of adult and larval beetles areplanned for 2010. The Maryland Department of Agriculture, in partnership with the Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks(HCR&P), released an additional 2,000 mile-a-minute weeviladults ( Rhinoncomimus latipes ) in 2009. The releases were performed at two new sites in central Howard County. Inaddition, weevils were released at four new sites in PrinceGeorge's County, the first releases in Maryland outside ofHoward County. Three of the sites were at the USDA BeltsvilleAgricultural Reasearch Center (BARC) and releases were madewith cooperation from the USDA Agricultural ResearchService. The other Prince George's County site was inHyattsville, along the Anacostia River, and the release wasmade with cooperation from the Anacostia Watershed Society. A total of 2,000 weevils were released at the four sites in PrinceGeorge's County This weevil is a beetle that feeds exclusively on an invasive vine from Asia known as the mile-a-minute weed ( Persicaria perfoliata ). The first weevils were first released in Maryland in 2007 at testplots located on county property near Meadowbrook Park incentral Howard County. The releases and subsequent data collections are part of cooperative research with the Universityof Delaware Department of Entomology and Wildlife Biologyto study the efficacy of the weevil for biological control ofmile-a-minute weed. Weevils have overwintered successfully atthe field release sites and were very active in the spring andsummer of 2009. As part of an agreement with the U.S. ForestService, the Plant Protection Section Weed BiocontrolProgram began a greenhouse and laboratory mile-a-minuteweevil rearing program in 2008. The program continued in2009, and has made modest progress to date. Field resultsshow great promise for use of the weevil as a host-specificcontrol against mile-a-minute weed. Noxious W eed Management This program supports the control and eradication of designatednoxious weeds in order to reduce their economic and aestheticimpact on farmers and landowners. Noxious weeds (Johnsongrass,shattercane, thistles, and multiflora rose) cause losses in excessof $25 million annually to Maryland agriculture due to reducedquality and yields of crops and forages, increased control costs,and increased roadside and development property managementcost. The Maryland General Assembly enacted the firstNuisance Weed Law on Johnsongrass in 1969. In 1987, theNuisance Weed Law was rewritten and renamed the NoxiousWeed Law (Title 9, Subtitle 4, Agriculture Article, AnnotatedCode of Maryland). The Noxious Weed Law requires that alandowner, or a person who possesses and manages land,eradicate or control the noxious weeds on that land by usingpractices prescribed by the department, including mowing,cultivating, or treating with an approved herbicide. The lawprohibits the importation and transportation of these weedsin the State and prohibits the presence of viable noxious weedseed and rhizomes in seed, topsoil, mulch, nursery stock, onfarm machinery, or any other article. The Noxious Weed Lawalso provides that the Department of Agriculture may enterinto an agreement with a county or political subdivision toprovide technical and financial assistance for initiating weedmanagement and eradication programs. 56| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |A weed control advisory committee has been established in each of the 20 participating counties, with representativesfrom farming organizations, governmental agencies, localfarmers and other property owners. Each committee providesadvice or input into planning the noxious weed control program in that county. A county weed control coordinator,usually employed on a part-time basis, determines the degreeof noxious weed infestations within the county, locates uncontrolled infestations, provides information on currentlyrecommended control practices, and initiates agreements with landowners to implement a control program. In manycounties, the local weed control coordinator also performsspot-spraying on roadsides in cooperation with the MarylandState Highway Administration, to help eliminate Johnsongrassor thistles and to control noxious weeds on private or publiclands for a fee. In counties with no weed control coordinator,MDA Weed Control Program employees handle these duties.This program was highly successful in most areas of the Stateduring 2009. The weed control program provided an average of $2,900 per county in grant assistance to 20 counties. The grants wereleveraged with similar amounts of money from the counties,which generated in excess of $910,000 from spraying servicesprovided by these programs. The county programs are supervised by the state personnel as specified by contract. Under the direction of Plant Protection and Weed Management Section entomologists, staff assisted in an integrated pest management (IPM) program to provide biological control ofcertain thistle species. Noxious weed advisory notices weremailed to 348 managers of property infested with a noxiousweed. Generally these notices were effective in obtaining compliance. When necessary, MDA sent follow-up correspondenceresulting in compliance. The Weed Control Program responds to citizens' requests for technical assistance in controlling invasive, difficult to control,persistent weeds, such as phragmites, kudzu, mile-a-minute,tree of heaven, Japanese stilt grass, purple loosestrife, Japanesebamboo, as well as invasive bamboo. Giant hogweed is a federal noxious weed that was first detected in the State of Maryland in 2003. Giant hogweed ( Heracleum mantegazzianum ) was originally detected at 29 sites in Baltimore and Harford counties. In 2005, eight additional sites in Garrett County were added to this list, as was oneadditional site in 2007. No new sites were found in 2008. Amulti-state eradication effort is underway, all previous sitesand all newly verified sites were brought into this program.The Weed Control staff partnered with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources for the tenth year in providinga phragmites management program. Upon request fromlandowners or managers, the Weed Control Program staffsupplied technical and spraying assistance for control. TheDNR provided 100 percent of the cost of the herbicide(Aquaneet\u00ae) applied in the nine counties of the Eastern Shorefor phragmites. T otal spray revenue for phragmites control wasin excess of $75,000 for treating approximately 320 acres in291 locations in 16 counties. In all counties, the noxious Weed Control Program's spraying service was offered to landowners participating in theConservation Reserve Program (CRP) or ConservationReserve Enhancement Program (CREP). Due to the likelihoodof weed problems occurring on land in these programs, sprayingservices were offered for noxious weed control. Other Section Activities During 2009, MDA continued to take a leadership role in the Maryland Invasive Species Council (MISC), a forum forinformation exchange and consensus building among diverseinterests in public and private agencies or organizations concernedwith invasive species. Several PPWM staff members weredirectly involved with MISC and were able to assist othermembers or individuals with technical expertise, as well aspartner with other agencies on grants to control invasivespecies. Through MISC, the MDA has been able to disseminateinformation on many of the serious pests cited in this report.The MISC website is www.mdinvasivesp.org. Section staff continued to administer the basic and specialist examinations for the Maryland Certified ProfessionalHorticulturist (CPH) program. This is a voluntary program,sponsored by the Maryland Nursery and LandscapeAssociations (MNLA), for those desiring to demonstrate proficiency in horticulture. After meeting a combination ofeducational and work experiences, and studying a comprehensivemanual that is the heart of the program, an applicant mustpass a rigorous examination in order to be certified. Theexaminations have written and practical elements that are set up, proctored, and graded by the MDA. 57| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |58Plant Protection and Weed Management Summary of 2009 Activity 2007 2008 2009 Beekeepers Registered 1,331 1,152 1,363 Apiaries Apiaries Inspected 509 593 660 Apiaries with Disease 29 25 23 Bee Colonies Registered 8,212 9,379 11,474 Bee Colonies Inspected 4,603 4,725 3,918 Bee Colonies with Disease (American Foul Brood) 45 34 40 Laboratory Diagnoses of Bee Diseases and Pests 98 21 96 Colonies Certified for Movement Out of State 3,860 3,975 2,527 Colonies Moved into Maryland Under Permit 452 550 773 Bee Colonies Certified During Inspection 4,603 4,725 3,878 Field Diagnoses for Varroa Mite 92 70 65 Ginseng Dealers Registered 10 9 11 Ginseng Collectors Licensed 230 230 303 Plant Inspections Conducted 920 602 417 Nurseries Certified 400 369 355 Nursery Acreage Certified 9,540 9,360 10,934 Plant Dealers Licensed 642 644 624 Plant Dealer Retail Outlets Licensed 739 838 839 Greenhouse Plants Inspected (1,000 sq. ft.) 7,978 7,978 7,978 Plant Brokers Licensed 13 16 14 Post-entry Quarantine Inspections 11 5 3 Phytosanitary Certificates Issued 328 301 109 Condemnation-Seizure Notices Issued 13 9 1 Plants Condemned 1,149 617 7 Imported Fire Ant Positive Sites 3 6 4 Imported Fire Ant Traps Placed 1,395 1,593 1,502 Imported Fire Ant Traps With Some Species of Ants 409 712 549 Special Insect Traps Monitored 2,027 3,663 5,818 Blacklight Processed for Nematode Surveys 14 10 12| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Seed is the single most important input to any agricultural system. T o be successful, the grower, whether a farmertilling hundreds of acres or a homeowner with a garden, must begin with quality seed. The Turf and Seed Section conductsregulatory and service programs, including seed inspection,testing, certification and quality control services, which aredesigned to insure the continued availability of high qualityseed to Maryland's seed consumers. T oday's seed industry exists in an environment of rapid change. The continued development of biotechnology and theexpansion of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or genetically-modified crops, has had an enormous effect on the production, distribution and marketing of seed and uponstate seed programs. Seed regulatory, testing and certificationprograms throughout the country are being challenged tomeet the demands brought about by these changes. Seed Laboratory The Maryland Department of Agriculture's seed testing laboratory is central to the operation of the section, supportingthe regulatory, certification, supervised seed mixing and turfgrass activities, while also providing service testing for seed producer, dealers, farmers and other seed consumers.Turfgrass professionals look to the laboratory to provide themwith purity and noxious weed seed examinations on seed lotsdestined for use on golf courses, sod production fields, publicgrounds and other areas demanding high quality turf.Commercial vegetable growers utilize the laboratory for specialized vigor testing, part icularly for peas, garden beans and lima beans. The State Highway Administration relies uponthe laboratory to test all grass, wildflower, shrub and otherseed planted along Maryland's highways. Maryland farmersparticipating in the Maryland Agricultural Water QualityCost-Share (MACS) cover crop program utilize the laboratoryto insure that the seed they use meets the standards requiredfor that program. The laboratory also identifies seed submittedby farmers, veterinarians, health officials, other governmentagencies and the general public. Round-up\u00ae Ready testing ofseeds is conducted by the laboratory for authorized seed producers. The laboratory also tests seeds used on wetlandmitigation and restoration projects. Key to a successful laboratory operation is a well-trained staff. The Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) maintainsan accreditation program for seed analysts in official laborato-ries throughout the United States. Analysts who pass rigoroustests, which include both written and practical examinations,are certified as official purity and germination analysts. At the present time, six members of our staff are certified by AOSAin both purity and germination testing, out of a nationwidetotal of 108 analysts who have achieved this level of certification.The laboratory staff also participated in various seed referees.These referees develop new testing methodology and ensureuniform and accurate seed testing throughout the country,while also serving as continuing education requirements necessary for certified analysts to maintain their credentials. Seed Regulatory The Maryland Seed Law requires that all seed offered for salein the state must be accurately labeled. This includes agricultural,vegetable, flower, lawn and turf seed, as well as specialized seedsuch as seeds of trees, shrubs, native species, wildflowers andseed used in reclamation and wetlands mitigation projects.This seed is sold in quantities ranging from small packets ofvegetable and flower seed sold to home gardeners to bulk salesof thousands of pounds of crop seed sold to farmers. All seeddistributed in Maryland is subject to inspection by this section. For much of its seed needs, Maryland relies on other areas of the country and the world where climates are more suited toseed production. Thus, it is important that Maryland maintaina strong and effective regulatory program. Seed importingstates that fail to maintain good seed regulatory programsbecome \"dumping grounds\" for low quality seed that is notacceptable to be sold in many other states. Maryland's seed inspectors visit both retail and wholesale seed dealers throughout the state. They review label claims, ensurethat germination test dates are current and look for seed lots 59| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Turf and Seed Maryland wheat seed that has been certified by MDA's Turf and Seed Section so that consumers can be sure it meets strict standards.60that have been found to be mislabeled or otherwise illegal for sale based on samples taken at other locations. Seed lots aresampled and submitted to the laboratory for testing. Lotsfound in violation of the Maryland Seed Law are placed undera stop sale order until they are brought into compliance.Corrective action may include re-labeling, reconditioning,destruction of the seed lot or its removal from the state. Seeddealers who fail to comply with a stop sale order are subject tocivil penalties. Seed Certification The seed certification program is adapting to changes in theseed business. As biotechnology increases in agricultural crops,movement away from traditional certification services isoccurring. More and more seed varieties are being developedby large investments in biotech research by private companies.The involvement of public institutions, which in the past werethe source for most certified seed varieties, continues to decline. With the increased number of crop varieties being released by private companies, the demand for quality assurance inspectionsby third parties is strong, particularly from small to medium-sized seed companies that cannot afford their own qualitycontrol programs. Companies growing seed in Maryland lookto this section for expertise in field inspections, sampling andlaboratory analysis for quality control of their products. In thefuture, it is anticipated that quality control inspection acreagewill increase as certified acreage decreases. Staff members worked closely with seed growers and conditioners to assist them in producing a product that meets some of thehighest quality standards in the United States. Maryland seedsmenhave become a net exporter of wheat, barley, and soybean seed,adding much revenue to the Maryland agriculture economy. Staff members cooperated with the Maryland Crop Improvement Association, the Maryland Agriculture Experiment Stations,and the University of Maryland in the production and distributionof Maryland Foundation seed. Much effort was spent to maintain the genetic purity of foundation seed of public varieties important to Maryland agriculture. This foundationseed was distributed to the Maryland seedsmen for the production of Maryland certified seed. Supervised Seed Mixing The supervised seed mixing system enables certification to becontinued when certified lots of different kinds and varietiesof seeds are mixed together. Demand from the industry andconsumers for supervised seed mixing is strong. The supervisedseed mixing program's oversight ensures that the consumerreceives quality seed by precluding the opportunity for substitutionof varieties or seed lots that have not been approved. All seedused on State Highway Administration projects and the seed used for the production of Maryland certified turfgrass sod ismixed under this program. Many county and local governments,school systems, golf courses, recreation departments and professional seeding contractors also require that the seed they purchase be mixed under this program. Prior to mixing, component seed lots must be officially sampled and tested by the Maryland State Seed Laboratory. Seed lotsthat meet applicable standards are then mixed under the directsupervision of an MDA inspector who insures that the mixeris free of any contaminants and that only approved seed lotsare used in the mixture. Special tags are sewn onto each bag toverify that the seed was mixed under MDA supervision. Turf Regulatory Maryland's Turfgrass Law requires that all turfgrass sod, plugsand sprigs be accurately labeled. Due to the overall high qualityof sod produced by Maryland sod growers, staff efforts areusually limited to responding to complaints which arepromptly investigated and resolved. In the majority of cases,the problems are determined to be due to site preparation andother growing conditions rather than the quality or conditionof the sod. The Maryland public continues to be able to purchasesome of the highest quality sod available anywhere. Turf Certification Maryland's turf certification program is a leader in the nationand has served as a model for certification programs in otherstates. Growers must plant varieties recommended by theUniversity of Maryland based on performance trials conductedin this region. All seed used in this program is tested by theMaryland State Seed Laboratory and mixed under the supervisionof MDA inspectors, and all certified turfgrass fields areinspected for quality before harvest. Many sod specificationsrequire Maryland certified turfgrass as a means of assuring theuse of high quality varieties that are well adapted to this area. Factors Affecting Turf & Seed Activities The number of acres of turf fields inspected increased due tothe hiring of an agronomist to fill a vacant position in 2007.This allowed the Turf & Seed Section to focus on turfgrassquality and renew an emphasis on consumer protectionthrough additional service and regulatory turfgrass inspections. The Turf & Seed Section's supervised mixing program has been affected by the economic downturn in the building andconstruction industries which rely on this service. Due to atemporary decrease in demand for seed mixes used on highwayand building projects and for the seeding of turf grass sod, thesection's revenue has been impacted as the number of poundsof seed mixed has been reduced. | Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |61Turf and Seed Activities, 2007-2009 2007 2008 2009 Field Inspections Acres of Turf Inspected 3,810 7,140 9,272 Acres of Crop Seed Inspected 10,726 13,066 11,447 Supervised Mixing Pounds of Seed Mixed (thousand) 2,486 1,446 979Retail and Wholesale Seed Inspections Number of Lots Sampled 970 917 890 Number of Regulatory Seed T ests Conducted 3,221 3,243 2,965 Seed Testing Purity Service Germination Service T ests Conducted 4,646 5,230 5,352| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Maryland certified wheat seed production in Frederick County.The Forest Pest Management (FPM) Section is responsible for minimizing losses due to insect pests and diseasesaffecting Maryland's valuable forest and landscape trees in rural and urban areas. The FPM Section advises landownersabout the management of forest pests. When there are seriousoutbreaks, as from the gypsy moth, the section will cooperatewith local jurisdictions to manage the infestation. T o accomplishthis, monitoring, assessment, control and education measuresare administered through two major programs, CooperativeGypsy Moth Suppression Program and Cooperative ForestHealth Program. Both are cooperative cost-share programsconducted with technical and financial assistance from theUSDA, Forest Service (USFS). The Cooperative Gypsy Moth Suppression Program conducts an integrated pest management (IPM) program to protect forestand shade trees from the continuing threat of defoliation anddamage by the gypsy moth. An effective statewide IPM programfor gypsy moth requires extensive amounts of accurate populationdata that must be collected annually. When survey data indicatethe potential for defoliation that could lead to death or diebackof high value hardwood trees, aerial application of insecticidesmay be implemented. The Cooperative Forest Health Program monitors and evaluates insects and diseases affecting Maryland forests and conductseducation and training activities. In addition, staff conductsseparate projects to address specific agents or situations thatare having or may have significant impact on the health ofMaryland's forests. In 2009, staff did specific assessment surveys for hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), southern pinebeetle and others. Cooperative Forest Health Program The Maryland Cooperative Forest Health Program (CFHP)combines two federal cost-share programs: Cooperative ForestHealth and Forest Health Monitoring. The objectives of thesecombined programs are to conduct surveys of major forestpests in Maryland and to provide technical advice and assistanceto managers of state and private forests. The CFHP also provides training on the importance, identification and control of forest pests to various state and local agencies and forestry organizations.Surveys Hemlock woolly adelgid (HW A) \u2014 The HWA-infested area now includes the metropolitan area between Baltimore andWashington and native stands of hemlock in Harford,Frederick, Washington, Allegany and Garrett counties. As partof a Mid-Atlantic, multi-state survey, MDA monitors 13 plotsestablished in six Maryland counties to assess the impact ofthe adelgid on hemlock resources. The condition of hemlocktrees in these plots continues to deteriorate with significantdieback and mortality. By the close of 2009, the leading edgeof this pest was in central Garrett County. Southern pine beetle (SPB) \u2014 Since 1989, Maryland has participated in a multi-state SPB survey throughout the southernUnited States using pheromone-baited traps. Trap data indicatedthat SPB numbers would continue to remain low in 2009.Populations have been below outbreak level since 1994. Aminor outbreak of SPB occurred in 2005 in Talbot County (99acres, 22 spots), a first time record for that county, but did notcarry over into the next season. Two SPB spots were found inTalbot in November of 2008 (8 acres). Emerald ash borer \u2014 In cooperation with the Plant Protection and Weed Management Section, staff established 40purple trap locations and set traps up in Baltimore County. Pine shoot beetle \u2014 In cooperation with the Plant Protection and Weed Management Section, staff have conducted surveysfor the pine shoot beetle since 1993 in western Maryland. Pineshoot beetle, a European bark beetle, was targeted in 2009 by aUSDA APHIS funded survey conducted in 14 Maryland counties. Defoliation and Damage Report After seeing 15,793 acres of gypsy moth defoliation in 2006,68,460 acres in 2007 and 19,279 acres in 2008, the third year ofthis gypsy moth outbreak finally came to an end. Gypsy mothcaused only 295 acres of defoliation in the state in four counties.In 2009, 4,631 acres of gypsy moth caused tree mortality wereaerially mapped. Just over 5,909 acres were aerially mapped in 2008. 62| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Forest Pest ManagementHemlock Woolly Adelgid Suppression and Management Report The hemlock woolly adelgid remains the major threat to the health of Eastern hemlock. Infested hemlocks occur in themetropolitan area between Baltimore and Washington and innatural stands from Harford to Garrett counties. So far in 2009,675 hemlocks have had soil injection treatments for a total of3,707 soil injection trees since 2005. So far in 2009, 51 trees havebeen trunk injected for a total of 524 trees since 2004. The predatory beetle, Laricobius nigrinus , was recovered from Rocky Gap in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. The beetle release site in the Rocky Gap gorge has been declared an establishedpopulation after recoveries in 2007. Recoveries have been sonumerous that efforts have begun to establish a field insectary atRocky Gap with the hopes of harvesting enough L. nigrinus in future years to release in other areas of the state. The beetleshave also been recovered from a release site at the FredrickCity Watershed. More beetle releases were made in 2007 atRocky Gap, Hagerstown watershed, Pretty Boy Reservoir andBroad Creek Boy Scout Camp. In 2008, additional L. nigrinus releases were made at Rocky Gap, Broad Creek, Savage RiverState Forest, Frederick City Watershed and Potomac StateForest. In 2009, additional L. nigrinus releases were made at Rocky Gap. Two other predatory beetle species, Scymnus sinuanodulus and Sasajiscymnus tsugae were released at several different sites, with no recoveries made. Through 2009, 3,603trees in priority sites have been soil injected and 512 were trunkinjected with imidacloprid insecticide for control of HWA. 63| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Hemlock Trees Treated for Hemlock Woolly Adelgid with Imidacloprid 2004-2009 County # Trees Soil Injected # Trees Trunk Injected Allegany 38 3 Baltimore 1,514 251 Frederick 494 96 Garrett 525 36 Harford 0 109 Washington 1,136 29 Total 3,707 524 In addition to gypsy moth-caused damage the orange striped oakworm, cherry scallop shell moth, beech bark disease, oak wilt and frost caused damage toMaryland's forests.Cooperative Gypsy Moth Suppression Program The basis for all decision-making for the integrated pest management of gypsy moth in Maryland is timely, accurate pestpopulation data. These data, in the form of annual populationsamples and other survey information and observations, arecollected from state-owned land, and forested residential areas.Eighteen counties and Baltimore City were cost share partnersin conducting the surveys in 2009. The 2008-2009 fall/wintersurveys disclosed infestation levels resulting in the prescribedtreatment of 32,722 acres of trees by the Forest Pest ManagementSection in 14 counties across the State, the highest number ofcounties since 1995. Only 295 acres of defoliation were seenwith no defoliation within spray areas. Treatment with aerial application of insecticide to suppress gypsy moth caterpillar populations may be proposed on a prioritybasis to protect high-value forest and shade trees, especially in those areas where death and die back of the trees would not betolerated. One of two insecticides is used\u2014diflubenzuron(Dimilin) or Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.)\u2014and are chosen fortheir specificity and effectiveness. In 2009, some 28,929 acres(88 percent) were treated with the B.t. insecticide and some3,793 acres (12 percent) were treated with the Dimilin insecticide. This marks the second distinct outbreak of the gypsy moth since the mid 1990s. Both the current outbreak and an earlierone starting in 2000 have been characterized by a sharp initialincrease in populations. It appears that this outbreak has collapsed. 64| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Maryland Cooperative Gypsy Moth Suppression Program 1999-2009 NOTE: In 2005, no gypsy moth suppression was conducted.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture and cooperating local agencies provided mosquito control services to 2,132communities with an estimated population of 1.3 million residents in 22 counties. Participation in the program is voluntaryand requires a request to begin service or annual renewal ofexisting service and agreement by local government to pay ashare (55 percent or greater) of the cost of providing mosquitocontrol services. MDA provides mosquito control directly;however, Calvert, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties provideservice to their respective communities. The towns of Easton,Fruitland and Ocean City also operate their own programswith funding assistance from MDA. The mosquito control program is staffed by 18 classified employees and approximately 65 seasonal contractual employees.Regional offices are located in Annapolis, College Park,Hollywood and Salisbury, with a satellite facility in Dundalk tofacilitate efficiency in providing services. Equipment used inthe program includes 63 light trucks, one van, two heavytrucks, three boats, five all-terrain vehicles, three amphibiousditcher-excavators and one multiple engine, fixed wing aircraft. Tiger mosquito infestations continue to drive the demand for program services, particularly in areas west of the ChesapeakeBay. The number of participating communities in AnneArundel County has increased from 156 in 2004 to 252 in2009. A waiting list of more than 80 communities has beenestablished to manage service requests in the central andsouthern regions. The tiger mosquito, which has pest and vector significance due to its persistence as a day time biterand ability to transmit arboviruses to people and animals, isexclusively a container breeder, and is primarily found in theurban and suburban environment where it lives in close association with people. Containers of all types, from flowerpots to tire casings, discarded cans and bottles, plastic tarpsand boat bilges, serve as breeding locations. A very smallamount of rain or irrigation provides sufficient water for this species to prosper.By all measures, the 2009 mosquito population in Maryland was above the long-term normal level. An exceptionally wetspring and strong winds which pushed tides further inlandcaused flooding of the high marsh lands resulting in extensivebreeding of salt marsh mosquitoes throughout the LowerEastern Shore counties. Landing counts, a standard method tomeasure the density of biting mosquitoes, routinely reportedlanding rates of 20 mosquitoes per minute and peak counts of100 mosquitoes per minute. A significant and welcomed dropin the mosquito population occurred in July when rainfall wasgenerally scattered and light throughout the State. Seasonalrainfall patterns returned in August and mosquito populationsrebounded in the late season.| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | 67Mosquito Control In Memoriam. Long-time MDA Mosquito Control Section Phil Brittingham passed away this year and is missed by all.Biological Control of mosquitoes continued with the stocking of fish and Open Marsh Water Management (OMWM).Biological control of mosquitoes is a method of applied ecologywhich seeks to regulate mosquito populations by enhancingthe access of predatory fish to populations of developing mosquito larvae. Properly designed and implemented OMWMprojects can eliminate or greatly reduce the need for follow-upuse of insecticides to control larval mosquitoes. Numerousstudies have identified the benefits of OMWM in improvingoverall marsh productivity, preserving bio-diversity andincreasing waterfowl utilization. Despite the documented benefits, securing permits to conduct OMWM is a lengthy anddifficult process. In the early 1990s, the Maryland Departmentof Natural Resources (DNR) out of concern for the Black Rail,a secretive shore bird, placed state-owned marsh lands beyondthe reach of MDA 's OMWM program. There is no scientificevidence that OMWM adversely affected Black Rails or thatthe Black Rail population has responded favorably since therestriction of OMWM on state lands were put into place nearly 20 years ago. Wetland management practices were conducted on 1,085 acres. This represents an increase of25 percent over 2008 (876) and represents a 250 percentincrease over the 10 year average of 434 acres. Long-term biological control of mosquito larvae can be accomplished through the release of Gambusia holbrooki minnows (mosquitofish) into permanent bodies of water.The use of this native species of fish is a cost-effective naturalmethod of control since these minnows are highly adaptiveand, once established, will produce a self-sustaining population.They are predaceous on many species of mosquito larvae andare considered an essential component of a strong IPM program. During the 2009 mosquito season, 13,527 Gambusia were released at 25 sites in 10 counties. The habitat type consistedof ornamental ponds and stormwater retention ponds. Theseartificial wetlands are ideal sites to release mosquitofish sincethey tend to lack piscivores which allows the mosquitofishpopulation to become established. These wetland types arealso very capable of producing large broods of mosquitoes due to their design and, coupled with their close proximity toresidences and businesses, long-term mosquito control is necessary to minimize nuisance and arboviral disease exposure. Aerial spraying continues to be an invaluable tool for mosquito control as it provides the only practical way to treat the largeexpanses of wetlands that constitute the mosquito breedinghabitat on Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore. Use of aircraft toapply insecticides for adult and larval mosquito controlincreased by 72 percent in 2009 (308,754 acres) as comparedto the yearly airspray average from 2004-2008 (179,566 acres) and was 51 percent greater than aerial spraying activity in2008 (204,159 acres). The seasonal distribution of acressprayed by aircraft was atypical in 2009 and reflects the prevailing weather conditions and high mosquito populationsof the early season months. Normally, 50 percent of the yearlytotal of acres sprayed by aircraft occurs from mid August tomid October. In 2009, 66 percent of the aerial spray workoccurred from April to June. The department continues itsgood fortune to have the services of an extremely knowledgeableand skilled pilot to administer the airspray program and aircraft maintenance as well as fly all missions. This year ranked third in the number of acres sprayed behind 2003 (332,000) and 1981(321,862). MDA continues to comply with regulatory updates from FAA and Homeland Security to keep the airspray program in operation.Upgrades to the aircraft instrumentation and pilot certificationwill enable the continuation of night-time spraying. The aircraftwas moved to a secure hangar, which is a great improvementover the old facility and provides the level of security that isnow required of aircraft equip ped for applying insecticides. Product Evaluations Mosquito control scientists conducted field trials of two novel adulticides and a novel application technique. The syntheticpyrethroids have been the adulticides of choice in MDA 'sground spray program for over 10 years. Large scale applicationsof pyrethroids by aircraft to control salt marsh mosquitoes onthe Lower Eastern Shore have produced highly variable butgenerally poor results. The two new pyrethroid products testedproduced adult mosquito mortality ranging from eight-80percent based on pre and post application mosquito counts.Pyrethroid aerosol clouds produced in aerial applications arehighly affected by the high temperature, heat inversions andvariable wind speeds that are characteristic of the weatherconditions at prime application times on the Lower EasternShore. Additionally, the pyrethroids tested were priced similarlyto Naled, the product now in use and, therefore, there is nocost advantage. Maryland was one of several states to experiment with a novel application technique using liquid methoprene, an insectgrowth regulator (IGR) to control tiger mosquito larvae. Aspreviously stated, the tiger mosquito, makes use of a variety ofman-made containers that hold small amounts of water forlarval breeding habitats. Using an application technique that isvery similar to how insecticides are applied to control adultmosquitoes with truck-mounted equipment, the IGR is 68| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |applied as an aerosol of extremely fine droplets that can drift and settle into breeding containers. In one field trial, larvae inbreeding containers received effective doses from settlingdroplets at distances greater than 50 feet from the point ofdischarge. This technique, which holds promise as a tiger mosquito control method, will require EPA approval before itcan be incorporated in an integrated management program. Public education, community outreach and participation in professional association meetings and recertification programsserve a dual role in disseminating information on mosquitoesand vector-borne disease and providing training with therecognition and remediation of neighborhood tiger mosquitobreeding sites. The predominant type of public contact was throughmedia interviews. Mosquito Control personnel participated in 27interviews in print, radio and TV media outlets in 2009. Inaddition, Mosquito Control employees participated in sevenpublic meetings in four counties as guest speakers using PowerPoint presentations. Mosquito Control personnel participatedin eight training sessions held for Master Gardeners, Universityof Maryland Extension, and local health and public worksdepartments. Mosquito Control personnel also participated inthe programs of state and regional professional societies whichoffered continuing education credits for attendees. Mosquito-borne Disease Surveillance The Maryland Department of Agriculture, working with the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene(DHMH), completed the ninth year of a cooperative effort tomonitor the occurrence and distribution of mosquito-bornepathogenic viruses throughout the State. A total of 40,680mosquitoes was collected, separated into 3,122 pools and analyzed for viruses at the DHMH Laboratory in Baltimore.Eight pools from two jurisdictions (Worcester and PrinceGeorge's counties) tested positive for West Nile virus. A mosquitosample collected in Forest Glenn, Montgomery County andprocessed by Department of Defense personnel also testedpositive for West Nile virus. Maryland reported two humancases of WNV and its first human fatality since 2003. Humancases occurred in two jurisdictions, Baltimore and Montgomerycounties, in 2009 with the fatality reported from Montgomery.This is the lowest incidence of human illness in Marylandsince 2001 when the first cases were reported. The number ofcases nation-wide dropped from 1,356 in 2008 to 663 with 30fatalities nationally as of this report in 2009. Estimates of thecost of illness are difficult to determine, however, scholars haveplaced the cost for an uncomplicated case with full recovery at$1,000 per case for lost work and the cost of neuroinvasive illness at $27,000. In addition to the two human cases, twocases of arbovirus in horses were reported, one fatal case ofEastern equine encephalitis in Worcester County and one non-fatal case of WNV in Prince George's County. Interactions with Other Agencies The cooperative effort between MDA and DHMH for mosquito-borne disease surveillance is of great benefit to publichealth. DHMH administers a federal grant for mosquito-borne disease surveillance and provides funds to MDA for collection, identification and preparation of mosquito samplesfor virus detection. Unfortunately, the level of federal fundingfor this work has greatly decreased during the past five yearsand currently pays for less than 10 percent of the actual costsincurred by MDA. We look forward to continued cooperation with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers withproposed wetlands management projects for mosquito abatement and marsh restoration through OMWM work.Cooperation among MDA, DNR, and MDE is essential to provide effective mosquito control on wildlife managementareas and other state lands under DNR control.| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | 6970| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Mosquito Control Activity Summary 2006 2007 2008 2009 Communities Participating in Mosquito Control Program 2,106 1,974 2,006 2,711 2,767 Percent of Light Trap Nights Below Threshold 65 68 68 55 Number of Landing Rate Counts Performed 20,756 25,861 22,672 22,487 Percent of Landing Rate Counts Below Action Threshold 66 71 49 37 Number of Public Service Requests by Open Marsh Water Management 493 302 876 1,085 Acres Treated with Insecticide Treated by Aircraft Number of of Arbovirus Statewide 11 10 14 2 Number of Human Cases of Arbovirus in Areas with Mosquito Control 3 0 1 1 Number of Cases of Arbovirus in Domestic Animals 0 0 2 2 Number of Mosquito Pools Positive for Arbovirus 9 6 16* 8** *Department of Defense collected an additional 11 positive pools at military reservations in Montgomery County, Maryland. **Department of Defense collected 1 positive pool at military reservation in Montgomery County, Maryland.71| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Number of Human Cases of West Nile Virus Illness in Maryland, 2001- 2009 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 TOTAL Allegany 0 Anne Arundel 8 7 2 2 19 Baltimore City 3 5 14 4 2 6 3 37 Baltimore Co. 3 1 17 3 1 3 2 2 1 33 Calvert 11 Caroline 1 1 2 Carroll 2 2 Cecil 0 Charles 1 1 2 Dorchester 2 2 Frederick 5 3 1 9 Garrett 0 Harford 2 2 3 7 Howard 3 1 1 5 Kent 0 Montgomery 7 10 1 4 1 23 Prince George's 7 4 3 1 1 1 17 Queen Anne's 5 5 St. Mary's 1 1 Somerset 0 Talbot 0 Washington 1 4 1 6 Wicomico 0 Worcester 11 Statewide 6 (3*) 36 (7) 73 (9) 16 5 11 10 14 2(1) 173 (20) *Number of fatalities in parentheses72| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Number of Communities Participating in Mosquito Control 2008-2009 # of Communities % Change County 2008 2009 Allegany 2 3 +50 Anne Arundel 242 252 +4.1 Baltimore City 1 1 0 Baltimore County 329 359 +9.1 Calvert 67 76 +13.4 Caroline 8 65 +812.5 Carroll 3 3 0 Cecil 42 40 -4.8 Charles 97 101 +4.1 Dorchester 127 129 +1.6 Frederick 19 10 -47.4 Garrett 0 0 0 Harford 46 52 +13 Howard 9 11 +22.2 Kent 38 35 -7.9 Montgomery 22 20 -9.1 Prince George's 302 302 0 Queen Anne's 20 20 0 St. Mary's 111 109 -1.8 Somerset 125 126 +0.8 Talbot 110 117 +6.4 Washington 4 4 0 Wicomico 152 169 +11.2 Worcester 130 128 -1.5 TOTAL 2,006 2,132 +6.373| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Cumulative Acres Treated with Insecticides for Mosquito Control By County During 2008-2009 Acres Sprayed % Change County 2008 -65.1 Anne Arundel 98,936.56 100,272 Regulation Section (PRS) is responsible for regulating the use, sale. Storage and disposal ofpesticides. The primary functions of the section are to enforce state and federal pesticide use laws and regulationsand to ensure that pesticides are applied properly by competentindividuals so that potential adverse effects to human healthand the environment are prevented. The Pesticide RegulationSection contains five major programs: (1) Pesticide ApplicatorCertification and Training: (2) Pesticide Use Inspection andEnforcement; (3) Pesticide T echnical Information Collectionand Dissemination; (4) Integrated Pest Management inSchools and on School Grounds: and (5) Special Programs. Pesticide Applicator Certification and Training Two types of pesticide applicators are certified by the PesticideRegulation Section\u2014private and commercial. Private applicatorsare farmers and other individuals applying restricted-use pesticidesto their own land or rented land for the purpose of producingagricultural commodities. Commercial applicators apply generaluse and restricted use pesticides as employees of licensed pestcontrol businesses, not-for-hire businesses or public agencies.A total of 63 private applicators were certified in 2009 for a three-year period after passing a closed book examinationadministered by section personnel during exam sessions. Onethousand six hundred nineteen private applicators renewedtheir certificates by attending recertification training. Currently,there are 3,284 certified private applicators. Section staffapproved and monitored 111 priv ate applicator recertification training sessions that the University of Maryland Extension,MDA, or the pesticide industry conducted. A total of 432 new commercial pest control applicators and consultants were certified in one or more of the 13 categoriesof pest control by satisfying minimum experience or educationrequirements and by passing written certification exams. Thesection certified 1,069 public agency applicators in 2009,bringing the total number of certified commercial and publicagency applicators to 4,103. In 2009, a total of 18 exam sessions were held during which 2,667 exams were administeredto 888 applicants. Once certified. commercial applicators arerequired to participate in at least one update training sessionapproved by the department each year in order to renew theircertificates. Two hundred seventy seven recertification training 74| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Pesticide Regulation Section A pesticide use observation inspection is part of the PesticideRegulation Section's activities to assure thatpesticide applicators areworking within toprotect consumers andthe environment.sessions for commercial pesticide applicators were approved and monitored by this section and were conducted by the pesticide industry, the University of Maryland Extension, orthe department. By attending recertification training, 3,280applicators were recertified in 2009. During 2009, the section licensed 1,371 commercial businesses and 160 not-for-hire businesses to apply pesticides and to perform pest control services. Three hundred ten publicagency permits were issued to governmental agencies thatapply pesticides. Forty-one pest control consultant licenseswere issued. A total of 1,710 registered employee identificationcards were issued during 2009. The department currently has15,060 employees of pesticide businesses and public agenciesregistered to apply pesticides under the supervision of certifiedapplicators. A total of 146 dealer permits were issued to busi-nesses that sell restricted use pesticides. Pesticide Use Inspection and Enforcement Besides enforcing state pesticide laws, MDA enforces federalpesticide laws under a Cooperative Enforcement Agreementwith the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Routine inspection activities are conducted throughout the year and include use observations and inspections of businesses,public agencies, dealers, market places and producer establishments.Consumer complaint and pesticide misuse investigations alsoare conducted by the staff. In 2009, 809 routine business inspections were performed during which 243 businesses were cited for violations of thePesticide Applicators Law and Regulations. Seventy-eight pesticide dealer inspections were conducted to ensure that restricted use pesticides were sold only to certified applicators.Seventy-nine use observations were conducted, during whichpest inspections and pesticide applications performed by commercial and private applicators were observed by sectionpersonnel. A total of 31 consumer complaints were investigated.Under the federal cooperative agreement, 28 pesticide producer establishment and 30 market place inspections were conducted.Other enforcement actions taken during 2009 included theassessment of 33 civil penalties totaling $10,500.Pesticide Technical Information Collection and Dissemination A listing of pesticide sensitive individuals was first compiled in 1989. During 2009, this section registered 152 individuals.These individuals receive advance notification of pesticideapplications made to adjacent properties by commercial ornamental plant and turf pest control businesses and publicagencies. A mailing was sent to all commercial companies andpublic agencies licensed or permitted in the ornamental plantand turf pest control category. Searchable databases of registered pesticide products, licensed pesticide businesses, commercial and private applicators andpesticide dealers continue to be posted on the MDA 's web site.These databases provide information to applicators and thepublic about pesticides that may legally be sold, distributed or used in Maryland and the names and addresses of licensedpesticide businesses. Pesticide dealers can check the certification status of pesticide applicators prior to selling them restricteduse pesticides. This database is linked to EPA 's registrationdatabase so that information on each pesticide productqueried, such as the EPA registration number, pest controlled,site of application, formulation active ingredient and thebrand name can be obtained. Integrated Pest Management in Schools The section continues to promote and support implementationof the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program in PublicSchools. Regulations that require schools to develop andimplement notification and IPM plans for indoor pest controlbecame effective in 1999, and regulations for notification andlPM plans for school grounds became effective in 2002. Staffprovided technical assistance in the development of the plansand distribution of information on potential adverse effects ofpesticides applied. The PRS staff continues to work withMaryland Public School districts on implementation of IPMon school property. In addition, PRS staff members serve asmembers of the Northeast Region lPM School IPMWorking Group, the Northeast Region's K-12 the Association of Official's IPM in School Committee. PRS staffcontinues to work with the Maryland Public School districtson the use and implementation of IPM on school property.During 2009, MDA hosted a meeting for school personnel andtheir pest control contractors. T opics for the meeting includeddiscussions on compliance, implementation of IPM programswith limited budgets and nuisance wildlife problems. 75| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Training Events During 2009, the PRS hosted the annual EPA Region III State Pesticide Inspector's Workshop. Fifty-seven Inspectors from Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., Virginiaand West Virginia were in attendance. The agenda for theworkshop included health and safety training for theInspectors as well as presentations on the importance ofpersonal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent pesticideexposures, conducting inspecti ons at pesticide producing establishments and market places where pesticides are sold,pesticide label interpretatio n, concerns and challenges of invasive species control, investigating fish kills along with respirator fit testing. Also included in the workshop was a field trip to the Sarbanes Ecological Science Center where amock investigation exercise of a bird kill took place. At the request of the EPA, the PRS hosted a six member delegation of the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture's Institutefor the Control of Agrochemicals. The delegation was visitingthe United States to see how pesticides are regulated on thenational and local levels. Staff from EPA headquarters andEPA 's Region III office provided information on pesticide regulation from the national perspective while MDA/PRS staff provided the delegation with information on how pesticides are regulated at the state level, as well as, the working relationship between the State and EPA.Special Programs During 2009, the section offered its recycling program forempty plastic pesticide containers to growers and commercialpesticide applicators at 20 locatio ns. Collection centers were maintained in nine counties (Caroline, Frederick, Harford,Kent, Prince George's, Talbot, Washington and Wicomico)with the assistance of county government agencies. A total of128 collection days were held from June through September.In addition, 13 pesticide dealer/custom applicators participatedin inspection and collection of containers at their own facilities.A total of 49,000 containers weighing nearly 22 tons, were collected from 125 participants, of which 30 were first timeparticipants. The containers were processed for transportingto a plastic recycling facility. The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Regulation Section staff continued to offer outreach and assistance to growers and pesticide dealers under the WorkerProtection Program. The Worker Protection Standard (WPS)was established to minimize occupational exposure to agricultural pesticides. The WPS requires agricultural workers,who could be exposed to pesticides, to received training onpesticide safety. Brochures on the Worker Protection Standardhave been produced and widely distributed to the regulatedcommunity. T o aid with on-farm compliance, the section hasdeveloped a pocket-sized WPS Compliance Evaluation Checklistwhich is available to all of the WPS regulated community. Thesection also contracted with T elamon Corporation to providepesticide safety training to farm workers. In 2009, T elamonmembers provided training to 607 farm workers and 46 non-farm workers (health care providers). T elamon also provided pesticide safety and awareness training to 180 children of farm workers, from pre-K through eighth grade. 76| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |77| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | Pesticide Regulation Section Activities 2007-2009 2007 2008 2009 Commercial Pesticide Businesses Licensed 1,354 1,631 1,371 Not-for-Hire Businesses Licensed 150 168 160 Commercial Pest Control Applicators Certified in One or More Category 2,947 3,113 3,134Registered Personnel Employed by Licensed Businesses and Public Agencies 47,719 13,981 15,060 Public Agency Permits Issued 301 321 310Public Agency Applicators Certified In One or More Category 996 1,054 1,069 Private Applicators Certified to Date 3,494 3,434 3,284 Dealer Permits Issued 149 141 146 Applicator Certification Examination Sessions Held 18 18 18 Individuals Taking Certification Examinations 934 982 888 Certification Examinations Administered in All Categories 2,172 2,463 2,677 Number of Businesses Inspected 801 975 809Number of Businesses with Violations 203 363 243 Unregistered Employees Violations 15 42 26Records Incomplete or Inaccurate Violations 98 175 143 Vehicles Not Properly Identified Violations 30 34 43 No Anti-siphon Device Violations 10 27 25No First-aid/Safety Equipment Violations 11 13 13 Incomplete or No Customer Information Violations 0 27 14 Pesticide Dealer Inspections 78 77 78 Application Records Reviewed 801 975 809 Hearing and Investigational Conferences 0 1 0 Consumer Complaint Investigations 79 54 31 Pesticide Use Observations 66 86 79 Pesticide Samples Collected for Analysis 32 48 51 Market Place Inspections 35 42 30 Pesticide Producer Establishment Inspections 28 28 28The State Chemist Section regulates the sale and distribution of pesticides, feeds, pet foods, fertilizers,compost, soil conditioners and agricultural liming materials in order to enhance and promote agricultural production, protect consumers and the environment fromunsafe products, ensure the sale of effective products and providethe regulated industry with a competitive marketplace. Regulationis accomplished by product registration, laboratory analysis,inspection, voluntary compliance and enforcement actionssuch as stop sale orders. The section is totally fee-supported. Registration of Products Pesticide products, commercial feeds, fertilizers, fertilizer/pesticides, liming materials, and soil conditioners are registeredfor sale or distribution only after careful review of the label todetermine the material's nature, proposed uses and potentialadverse impacts on agriculture, the environment, the generalpublic, and the regulated industry. During 2009, the sectionregistered 14,512 commercial feeds. See Table 1 for detailsand comparisons to product registrations of prior years. Inspection Field inspectors routinely sample products that are randomly selected at retail outlets, distribution centers, warehouses, andformulating facilities. These inspections enable the section tomaintain efficient regulatory control that ensures the sale,distribution and use of effective products that are safe for the consumer and environment, when used in accordancewith approved label instructions. The inspectors sample a representative cross section of products for chemical analysisand obtain reliable data on the distribution, formulation andsale of these commodities. This enables the section to stop thesale or distribution of ineffective products or those that areharmful to humans, animals or the environment because of unacceptable levels of pesticides, plant nutrients, trace elements and/or toxic materials. In 2009, section inspectorsperformed approximately 1,978 on-site inspections. See Table 2 for details on inspection activities.Laboratory Analyses/Investigations MDA 's state-of -the-science laboratory is staffed with chemistswho have expertise and experience in the use of highly sophisticatedcomputer controlled instruments used for the analysis ofagricultural chemicals and toxic contaminants in commercialproducts, crops and environmental samples (water, soil, fish),etc. The laboratory staff provides reliable scientific data thatare used to assist farmers and to initiate or support regulatoryactions against violative products or violators of state and fed-eral agricultural and environmental laws. The laboratory alsoprovides support to the Maryland Departments of the Environmentand Natural Resources, to the federal Department of Agriculture(USDA) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Homeland Security\u2014FERN (Food Emergency Response Network) for Chemistry MDA 's State Chemist Section's laboratory is the primary Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) chemistry laboratoryfor the State of Maryland. It is an essential part of a nationalFederal-State network that is expected to be in a state of readinessfor quick response to a chemical terrorist attack on stateand/or national human and animal food supplies. In the event of such an attack, the section's laboratory staff would beexpected to provide rapid and accurate analysis of food, feed,crops and water samples to determine if such items would beembargoed or released for human and animal consumption.The laboratory is an active participant in a federal/state laboratory proficiency program for the analysis of highly toxic materials in food and water. In 2009, the section participated in 11 studies conducted by FERN for the analysis of Melamine in food. Enforcement Any regulated product determined to be ineffective, misbrandedor deleterious to the public, agriculture, or the environment isremoved from the market place. Determination for productremoval is based on inspection, laboratory analysis of officialsamples, information received from federal or state regulatoryagencies, products offered for sale but not registered for use or distribution in Maryland, and review of labels or othermaterials submitted by companies to support product registration. See Table 3 for details relating to stop sale orders. 78| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management | State Chemist SectionHuman and Animal Health Activities Maryland Winter Wheat-T oxin Problem\u2014V omitoxin (Deoxynivalenol or DON)An abnormally wet and cool spring rendered most ofMaryland's winter wheat crop unacceptable due to high levelsof vomitoxin. Much of the crop shipped to Pennsylvania flourmills was not accepted and a significant amount could not beused for animal feed. The section started monitoring DON in soft winter wheat for the Food/Feed Quality AssuranceProgram of the department for the purpose of insuranceclaims. The section worked closely with the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Agriculture, the U.S Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), grain elevators, feed mills and farmersin the state to determine the level of DON in the wheat and toassure that samples that exceeded FDA guidelines were keptfrom entering the human and animal food chain. A remediationplan was devised to deal with the products that were betweenthe acceptable limits and the FDA guidelines to allow theproduct to be used in animal feeds. The Agriculture Emergency Responders were activated to help with sampling of feed ingredients and finished feeds in variousmills in the State. The total number of samples analyzed was561. The samples included flour for human consumption, feedingredients, whole grains, grain screenings and finished feeds.The flour samples were taken from a commercial flour milland one tourist grist mill. Of the grain samples, nearly all softwinter wheat samples had elevated DON levels. Few of the oatand barley grain samples taken had elevated DON levels.There were several finished feeds and feed ingredients thatwere in excess of the FDA guidelines for the species. Therewere stop sale orders issued for these products and the products were not allowed in the animal feed chain. Theresults of the flour samples were forwarded to DHMH for theirevaluation. Table 4 is a compilation of laboratory analyses.Protein Adulteration Surveillance\u2014Melamine The section continues its monitoring activities for proteinadulteration in pet foods by analyzing them for melamine.Since the pet food crisis in 2008, which resulted in manydeaths of cats and dogs, and the hospitalization of many others, the section continues to monitor wet, moist andcanned pet foods for melamine by an ELISA technique. If anypet foods are found to be over one ppm (part per million)they are confirmed by a second technique, HPLC-MS/MS.The section has analyzed 150 samples for the presence ofmelamine. Of these 150 samples 72 were below one ppm andrequired no further testing. The remaining 78 samples wereover the limit and were confirmed. Of these 78, all were underthe 10 ppm limit set by the FDA in 2008 for pet food. Thesamples ranged from one ppm to 8.5 ppm melamine. Milk The State Chemist laboratory staff continues to closely workwith DHMH and MDA 's Animal Health Section in a continuingmonitoring project to determine the presence of lead in rawmilk. The State Chemist Section is uniquely capable of providinglaboratory support for such a project because it has theexpertise and the necessary sophisticated instrumentation todetect and quantify exceptionally low concentrations of heavymetals in many different matrices. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE-Mad Cow Disease) The section continued an inspec tion program in conjunction with FDA that began in 1999 to determine if feed mills, retailand wholesale distributors, haulers and grain storage facilitieswithin Maryland comply with FDA 's regulations pertaining tothe prevention of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),also known as Mad Cow Disease. Feed mills and/or feed distributors are issued stop sale orders for products determinedto be not in compliance with state and FDA regulations. In 2009, the State Chemist Section of MDA completed 83 BSE inspections and collected 70 samples from 35 feed mills,various retail and wholesale distributors, grain haulers/storagefacilities and pet food manufacturers. All facilities that wereinspected during the contract period were found to be in compliance and void of any violations of the FDA regulationspertaining to BSE. All samples were analyzed by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to determine the presence of bovine tissue via DNA replication. 79| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |Four samples contained bovine tissue\u2014the results were reported to FDA. The threat of terrorist activities has resulted in placing additional emphasis on section inspection activities that go beyond theprotocols established by the FDA. Section inspectors distributedhandouts that list specific precautions that farmers, retailers,distributors and warehouses should follow to help ensure thatruminant animal feed manufactured or distributed inMaryland does not contain ingredients that may transmit BSE. The inspectors have been instructed to personallyemphasize to mill workers, distributors, etc. the need to read, understand and follow the specific precautions thatappear on the warning handouts. The economic havoc that would ensue from animal feed containing BSE transmissible ingredients inadvertently ordeliberately fed to the ruminant farm animal populationscould be ruinous to the beef industry and allied businesses,e.g., fast food companies, food stores, restaurants, etc. Beyondthe economic considerations, public health concerns would beeven greater because ingestion by humans of BSE-contaminatedmeat could result in incurable fatal brain cell degeneration. Antiterrorism and Homeland Security Issues Because of the nature of the duties and capabilities of the section, many of the activities reported elsewhere in this document have homeland security implications. Specific mention has been made of the section's BSE and FERN activities. In addition, the section cooperates with theDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene, LaboratoriesAdministration, the State Police, the Maryland Department of the Environment and all of the local health departmentsthrough its position on the Laboratory EmergencyPreparedness Advisory Committee. As noted above, the section has inspectors who routinely visit establishments distributing fertilizer. A part of the inspectionprotocol involves reviewing the measures that the establishmentuses to assure that fertilizer ingredients are not diverted to illegaluses. Protocols that are recommended at these inspections arethose that have been developed in cooperation with the federalgovernment, other states and industry groups.USDA\u2014Pesticide Data Program (PDP) Since 1997, the USDA has contracted with the section to sample various food items from principal distribution centersin the State. These samples consist of such diverse items aspineapples, potatoes, processed food, processed fruit juices,produce, milk, and peanut butter which are analyzed by federaland state laboratories for several hundred different pesticides.In concert with the EPA-Food Safety program, the data will beused to establish new pesticide food tolerances with addedemphasis on the diet of infants and children. See Table 2. USDA\u2014Microbiological Data Program (MDP) Since 2001, the section has been contracted by USDA to samplevarious produce items from principal food distribution centersfor analysis to determine the presence of specific pathogensrelative to a national health concern about food-borne bacteria.Raw agricultural food commodities were collected by sectioninspectors to be analyzed for E.coli ,Salmonella sp. and Listeria monocytogenes. These analyses are being conducted by variousfederal and state contract microbiological laboratories. SeeTable 2. Food Safety Survey of Maryland Produce Since 1992, the section has collected from roadsidevegetable/fruit stands random samples of Maryland grownproduce which were then tested for 400 different pesticides.The data are sent to EPA and USDA for incorporation intonational data banks. The section has performed this survey for 19 years and is pleased to report that the surveys indicatedthat Maryland grown produce does not contain any toxic levels of pesticides. Drugs and Additives in Livestock Feed In order to help ensure the safe and effective use of drugs in livestock feed, the section has expanded its feed analysis program. Any feed products containing drugs that do notmeet the federal requirements relative to use, over-formulationor deficiency are removed from the marketplace. Removal ofviolative products not only protects farm livestock but alsoprovides protection to the public against exposure to drugresistant bacteria. In 2009, the section analyzed 51 samples offeed for 81 different drugs. Distributors and registrants ofdefective feed products were notified and either stop saleorders or warnings of potential regulatory action were issuedto remove unacceptable products from the marketplace. Inaddition to monitoring animal feed for drugs and phytase, thesection randomly samples and screens the ingredients that areused in the production of feed for pesticides and heavy metals. 80| Office of Plant Industries and Pest Management |81Table 1.
