The recall is due trace amounts of an unexpected impurity, N-Methylnitrosobutyric acid (NMBA), detected during testing.1 Losartan is used to treat hypertension, hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and for the treatment of nephropathy in [Type 2 diabetic patients](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/diabetes?rel=0).2 Torrent is only recalling lots of losartan-containing products that contain NMBA above the acceptable daily intake levels released by the FDA. The expanded recall includes the following products:1 - NDC 13668-409-10: Losartan Potassium Tablets, USP 50mg, 1000 expiration December NDC Losartan Potassium Tablets, USP 100mg, 90 count; expiration December NDC Losartan Potassium Tablets, USP 100mg, 1000 90 and expiration 30, NDC Losartan / Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, USP 100mg/25mg, 90 count; batch 4P04D007, and expiration July 31, 2020 The affected products were distributed nationwide through Torrent's wholesale distributor, repackager, and retail customers.1 Patients who are taking Losartan should continue taking their medication, as the risk of harm to the patient's health may be higher if the treatment is stopped immediately without any alternative treatment, according to the FDA. Patients also should contact their pharmacist or physician who can advise them about an alternative treatment prior to returning their medication.1, 2 This new recall expansion is the fifth in 2019 for Torrent's losartan products, following the initial recall on December 20, 2018. Recall expansions also were announced [January 3](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/diabetes/recall-expanded-for-losartan-potassium-tablets), [January 22](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/cardiovascular-health/six-additional-lots-of-losartan-tablets-recalle-), March 1, and April 18.1 Some of the previous recalls were due to N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) impurity. Since July 2018, multiple companies have voluntarily recalled products containing valsartan, irbesartan, and losartan, stemming from concerns about levels of impurities, including NDEA and NMBA. According to the FDA, at least some of the impurities have been traced to active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured by Hetero Labs Limited in India3 and Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals in China.4 In addition to Torrent, pharmceutical companies affected by these impurities include [Aurobindo](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/cardiovascular-health/aurobindo-recalls-80-lots-of-valsartan-tablets?rel=0), [Camber](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/cardiovascular-health/fda-new-nitrosamine-impurity-detected-in-certain-losartan-lots), [Macleods](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/cardiovascular-health/detection-of-impurity-prompts-company-to-recall-1-lot-of-combination-tablets), [Mylan](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/mylan-expands-voluntary-nationwide-recall-of-valsartan-tablets), and [Teva](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/resource-centers/cardiovascular-health/teva-recalls-35-lots-of-bulk-losartan-potassium-tablets).
