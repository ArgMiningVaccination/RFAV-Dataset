Mind Body Spirit Healing was envisioned and created by Samira Alemana, Reiki Master, Intuitive, Energy Healer and Goddess Mentor Intuitive Life Coach. Through her healing and coaching work, Samira has become a go-to for those seeking to expand their own understanding of the Universe and their place in it, as they realize the stories they've lived so far, are no longer serving them, but they are unsure about their next steps. She's a dauntless ally in empowering people to step into their own personal power and embrace their authentic selves! She also brings an understanding of the connectedness of the mind and spirit with the dis-ease of the body, and how to address it. This relation between mind, body and spirit, brought about the name of the business, because you must bring health and wellness to all three. The Celtic triskelion symbol was chosen as the logo for Mind:Body:Spirit Healing to represent this three-part connection that makes up the whole person's well-being.", "sitename": "Yelp", "date": "2015-08-13", "cleaned_text": "Mind Body Spirit Healing [(2 reviews)](#reviews) [Massage Therapy](/search?find_desc=Massage+Therapy&find_loc=Vancouver%2C+WA), [Life Coach](/search?find_desc=Life+Coach&find_loc=Vancouver%2C+WA), Might Also Consider [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=eR5HcnLdF46q6oeXmBJSMw&campaign_id=pBOT11gVhlAmpPKZ8URbag&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fbridgeway-of-hope-recovery-transition-for-men-portland%3Fhrid%3D77QMzrPcTvDdtVm8c95s0g&request_id=c2b4e5f4a547a50b&signature=0073ff2f15d0827c4eef203c11b0121ea01ef0542fa17127f1d81b20ac3a1348&slot=0) in Counseling & Mental Health, Rehabilitation Center [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=ZmE4-GHwA1E4BBY0fril_Q&campaign_id=fRRakGM7IalPJnF8d-233A&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fcore-chiropractic-vancouver%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=c2b4e5f4a547a50b&signature=495d33d4f0ee895ba18cca82c18e354b64760a257df903976e4b627dbb490e9c&slot=1) in Chiropractors, Massage Therapy [read more](/adredir?ad_business_id=37PbUltB40oBAFoOUjrcNA&campaign_id=Db4jhuRP9PulmDAErB-j_w&click_origin=read_more&placement=above_biz_review&placement_slot=0&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelp.com%2Fbiz%2Fforged-through-the-fire-portland%23atb_alias%3AAboutThisBizSpecialties&request_id=c2b4e5f4a547a50b&signature=de37a2c5003de14741681d3270b3ef442c4d0dc7dfa8e48ae2a355d0de48a3e6&slot=2) in Life Coach About the Business Business owner information Samira A.

I'm so happy I decided to try this class because I'm a Reiki 2 and I have been looking for people to share my experiences with. I also wanted to learn and practice as well as receive healing. The class was small and cozy and everyone was amazing! We had a Q&A and also had some healing time. This is a group I was new to, and they all welcomed me in with open arms. I'm so happy I found Samira because she is amazing. Highly recommended! Christy Bork - 6/18/2015First to Review Samira is very good at what she does. She is thorough in her work, caring and honest. I would recommend her.
