A table of VAERS reportable events can be found at https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/vaers_table_of_reportable _events_following_vaccination.pdf . X. Management of Adverse Events All vaccines have the potential to cause an adverse reaction. In order to minimize adverse reactions, vaccinees must be carefully screened for precautions and contraindications before the vaccine is administered. Even with careful screening, reactions may occur. These reactions can vary from trivial and inconvenient (e.g. soreness, itching) to severe and life threatening (e.g. anaphylaxis). If reactions occur, the pharmacist or pharmacy intern must be prepared with procedures for reaction management. The procedures for managing adverse reactions are set forth in Appendix F . XI. Supply Considerations The supply of vaccines and the timing of distribution is based on CDC guidance and is not guaranteed. If supplies of vaccines are delayed or limited, the pharmacist or pharmacy intern must comply with state and national guidance and directives for the tiered use of vaccin es and must cooperate with health officials and local practitioners to ensure that limited supplies of vaccines are targeted to and reserved for those persons at higher risk for disease and disease related complications. XII. Vaccines Pharmacists or pharmacy interns supervised by a pharmacist may administer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized or approved formulations of the vaccines listed below, alone or in combination, provided they follow all requirements set forth in this Protocol, assess patient eligibility according to indications, precautions, and contraindications recommended in current guidelines from the ACIP, and adhere to dosing and administration information provided by the package inserts and ACIP recommended guidelines.

(b) If symptoms are generalized, activate the emergency medical system (e.g., cal l 911) immediately. This should be done by a second person, while the pharmacist assesses the level of consciousness, circulation, airway and breathing of the vaccinee. (c) Place vaccinee in a recumbent position and elevate legs. (d) The first line therapy in anaphylaxis is epinephrine. There are no cont raindications to epinephrine ranges from 0.3mL to 0.5mL, w ith a maximum single dose of 0.5mL), as indicated: Ampules or vials of solution: Dose 2244 lbs ( 1020 kg) = 0.15mg (or mL) IM X 1 dose 4588 lbs ( 2140 kg) = 0.30mg (or mL) IM X 1 dose 89110 lbs ( 4150 kg ) = 0.45mg (or mL) X dose 111 lbs+ ( 51 kg+ ) = 0.50mg (or mL) IM X 1 dose Prefilled devices (i.e., EpiPen Jr. / EpiPen): Weight (lbs) Weight lbs ( 1530 kg) EpiPen lbs ( >30 kg) EpiPen\u00ae 0.30mg IM X 1 dose The site of injection can be gently massaged to facilitate absorption. (2) If EMS has not arrived and symptoms are still present, the dose of epinephrine may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes for up to 3 doses, depending on the patient's response. (e) Antihistamines may be given for hives or itching. Administer diphenhydramine either orally or by intramuscular injection. The standard dose is 1 2 mg/kg every 4 6 hours, up to 100 mg maximum single dose for adults, and 50 mg maximum sin gle dose for children and adolescents. Do not attempt to give oral medications to a vaccinee who is not fully alert and able to swallow safely. Refer to the dosing chart below: Age Group Weight (lbs) Weight (kg) Diphenhydramine Dose (Injectable dose based on 50 mg/ml solution) 16 months 9 15 lbs ( 47 kg) = 5 mg (0.1 mL) IM X 1 dose 736 months 16 31 lbs ( 814 kg ) = 1015 mg (0.2 0.3mL) IM X 1 dose 3759 months 32 42 lbs ( 1519 kg) = 20 mg (0.4mL) IM X 1 dose 512 yrs. 43 99 lbs ( 2045 kg) = 3040 mg (0.6 0.8mL) IM X 1 dose 13 yrs. and older 100+ lbs ( 46+ kg) = 50100 mg (1 2 mL) IM X 1 dose STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY 800 SW Jackson, Suite 1414 Topeka, Kansas 66612- -8420 STATEWIDE Administration of Vaccines Page 16 of 21 Revised 9/14/2021 (f) Monitor the vaccinee closely and check vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and respirations) every 2 to 5 minutes. (g) Stay with vaccinee until EMS arrives. (h) If necessary, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and maintain airway. (i) Keep vaccinee in supine position unless he or she is having breathing difficulty. If breathing is difficult, vaccinee's head may be elevated, provided blood pressure is adequate to prevent loss of consciousness. If blood pressure is low, elevate legs. (j) Record all vital signs, medications administered to the vaccinee (including the time, dosage, response, and the name of the person who administered the medication), and other relevant clinical information contemporaneously in an adverse reaction medication log to be maintained by the pharmacy, a copy of which may be provided to EMS and/or the vaccinee's primary care provider. A Vaccine Adverse Event R eporting System (VAERS) form is attached as Appendix G. (k) Notify the vaccine e's primary care practitioner as soon as possible.
