D'Anci, PhD; Stacey Uhl, MS; Gina Giradi, MS; and Constance Martin, BA Background: Suicide is a growing public health problem, with the national rate in the United States increasing by 30% from2000 to 2016. Purpose: To assess the benets and harms of nonpharmaco- logic and pharmacologic interventions to prevent suicide and reduce suicide behaviors in at-risk adults. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and other data- bases from November through May 2018. Study Selection: Systematicreviews(SRs)andrandomizedcon- trolled trials (RCTs) that assessed nonpharmacologic or pharma-cologic therapies for adults at risk for suicide. Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data and as- sessedstudyquality,andasecondinvestigatorcheckedabstrac-tions and assessments for accuracy. Data Synthesis: Eight SRs and 15 RCTs were included. The ev- idence for psychological interventions suggests that cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) reduces suicide attempts, suicidal ide-ation, and hopelessness compared with treatment as usual(TAU). Limited evidence suggests that dialectical behavior ther-apy (DBT) reduces suicidal ideation compared with wait-list con-trol or crisis planning. The evidence for pharmacologic treat-ments suggests that ketamine reduces suicidal ideation with minimal adverse events compared with placebo or midazolam.Lithium reduces rates of suicide among patients with unipolar orbipolar mood disorders compared with placebo. However, nodifferences were observed between lithium and other medica-tions in reducing suicide. Limitation: Qualitative synthesis of new evidence with existing meta-analyses, methodological shortcomings of studies, hetero-geneity of nonpharmacologic interventions, and limited evi-dence for pharmacologic treatments and harms. Conclusion: Both CBT and DBT showed modest benet in re- suicidal ideation compared with TAU or wait-list control,and CBT also reduced suicide attempts compared with TAU.Ketamineandlithiumreducedtherateofsuicidecomparedwithplacebo, but there was limited information on harms.

Suicide is a growing public health problem, with the national rate in the United States increasing by 30% from 2000 to 2016 (1). According to data from the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, the nationalsuicide rate increased from 10.4 to 13.5 per 100 000persons, with average annual increases of 1% from2000to2006and2%from2006to2016.Findingsfroma 2017 survey by the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) suggest thatsuicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide at-temptshaveespeciallyincreasedoverthepast10yearsamong persons aged 18 to 25 years (2). The SAMHSAnotes that these increases have co-occurred with an in-crease in the prevalence of mental health conditionsthat cause signicant impairment in daily functioning,especially major depressive episodes and chronic sub-stance abuse. This systematic review (SR) served to update the 2013 clinical practice guideline (CPG) from the U.S. De-partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the U.S. Depart-ment of Defense (DoD) on assessment and manage- ment of suicide risk. Because this SR supports anupdate, the literature searches were intended to coverthe period from the previous CPG searches to immedi-ately before the guideline panel meeting. The keyquestions (KQs) addressed in this review were devel-oped by the VA/DoD workgroup for the suicide man-agement CPG. The specic questions are listed in theAppendix (available at Annals.org). The full CPG covers a range of recommendations pertaining to screening,assessment of risk factors, and interventions and treat-ments intended to mitigate risk for suicide. This articlefocuses specically on the evidence from that reviewthat assessed the benets and harms of nonpharmaco-logic and pharmacologic treatments for persons at riskfor suicide. METHODS This SR focused on various nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions compared with no inter-vention, wait-list control, placebo, other active medica-tion or nonpharmacologic intervention, or combinationmedication plus nonpharmacologic treatment. Consis-tent with the methods outlined in the VA/DoD Guide-line for Guidelines (3), the rst line of evidence waspreviously published SRs. For interventions of interest,we selected the most recent, relevant, and comprehen-sive SR that was rated by a validated assessment tool asSee also: Related article ............................3 4 3 Editorial comments ...................... 372, 374 Web-Only SupplementREVIEW Annals of Internal Medicine 334 Annals of Internal Medicine Vol. 171 No. 5 3 September 2019 Annals.org Downloaded from https://annals.org by VA Central Office of Acquisition Operations user on 09/05/2019having good methodological quality (4). If there were multiple good-quality SRs for a given intervention withsimilar arrays of included studies, we chose the mostcomprehensive (in terms of the number of high-qualitystudies included) and/or recent SR for our evidencesynthesis to avoid multiple ratings of a similar evidencebase. Systematic reviews were supplemented withsubsequently published randomized controlled trials(RCTs). Any RCTs that were included in the SRs werenot considered independently as evidence in this re-view. For interventions for which no SR was available,we summarized the overall ndings of RCTs that ad-dressedtheinterventionandreportedonatleast1out-come of interest. Data Sources and Searches The current review serves to update the evidence supporting the VA/DoD's previous CPG on assessmentand management of suicide risk. The end date of theliterature search in the previous guideline was 18 No-vember 2011; our searches encompassed this periodand extended through May 2018. We searchedMEDLINE and EMBASE MEDLINE In-Process PubMed.gov), PsycINFO, the PILOTS (Published InternationalLiterature on Traumatic Stress) database, the CochraneDatabase of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Ab-stracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Central Reg-ister of Controlled Trials, and the Health TechnologyAssessment Database. A search of ClinicalTrials.govthrough February 2019 did not identify any additionalrelevant studies. Clinical experts serving as members of the guideline workgroup were also asked to identifyany important publications published after our searchdate during the guideline development process.Search terms are provided in Appendix Tables 1 to3 (available at Annals.org). Study Selection Literature was screened using DistillerSR (Evidence Partners). The titles and abstracts identied in the liter-ature search were screened for relevancy against theinclusion and exclusion criteria, and relevant titles un-derwent full-text review. All disagreements were re-solved by consensus between 2 screeners. We used a PICOTS (population, intervention, com- parator, outcomes, timing of outcomes measurement,and setting) approach to identify studies that met ourinclusion criteria. The population of interest was adults(aged 18 years) at risk for suicide. Interventions in-cluded nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic thera-pies. Nonpharmacologic interventions of interest response planning (CRP), andcommunitysupportprograms.Pharmacologicinterven-tions of interest were anxiety med-ications, lithium, antipsychotics, ketamine, and nalox-one. Comparators of interest were no treatment (forexample, placebo or wait list), other active therapies orcombination medication, and nonpharmacologic treat-ments. Critical outcomes included suicides, suicide at-tempts, suicidal ideation, harms (such as reduction ofhealth-seeking behavior and effect on patient-providerFigure.Evidencesearchandselection.

Studies were limited to English-language SRs or RCTs with no minimum follow-up that took place in anoutpatient health care setting, including primary care,emergency care, VA, community, and specialty caresettings. Data Extraction and Risk-of-Bias Assessment One investigator extracted study data, and a senior reviewer veried the accuracy of the extractions. Forindividual RCTs not included in the SRs, we abstractedthe following study-level details: country, purpose, andrisk-of-bias (ROB) rating. For SRs, we reported on thesearch strategy; study selection criteria; and overall in-formation about the evidence base, including the num-ber of included studies, the overall number of patientsenrolled, and the ROB assessment. For RCTs and SRs,we also abstracted data on the population, interven-tions, and results. One investigator assessed the ROB of each SR us- ing criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive ServicesTask Force (USPSTF) for SRs (4). The ROB of individualRCTs not included in the SRs was rated as good, fair, orpoor using criteria developed by the USPSTF for ran-domizedtrials(4).ForstudiesincludedinSRs,wereliedon the quality assessments performed in the reviewsand used the overall rating that was reported (good,fair, or poor). A senior reviewer veried the accuracy ofthe ROB ratings. Disagreements were resolved throughdiscussion. Appendix Table 4 (available at Annals.org) shows ROB assessments. Data Synthesis and Analysis We used a narrative approach to synthesize the ev- idence for each intervention. We reported on meta-analysis results from SRs and examined the degree ofheterogeneity identied through the analysis. Ratherthan conducting an updated meta-analysis, we exam-ined whether the results of new studies were consistent(same direction and similar magnitude) with the nd-ings of the prior SRs. The overall quality of the body ofevidence supporting the ndings for the outcomes of interest was assessed by the authors using the GRADE(Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop-ment and Evaluation) approach (5). A senior reviewerveried the accuracy of the GRADE ratings. Disagree-ments were resolved through discussion. Role of the Funding Source This review was funded by the VA to support an update of the CPG on assessment and management ofpatients at risk for suicide to be used in VA and DoDclinical practice. These agencies helped rene thescope, informed KQ development, and reviewed adraft report of the ndings. The authors are solely re-sponsible for the content preparation, writing the man-uscript, and the decision to submit the manuscript forpublication. RESULTS Literature searches identied 5410 citations poten- tially addressing all of the KQs of interest for the guide-line evidence review (see the Figurefor the study flow).

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Four SRs and 1 additional RCT examined treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for suicide be-havior and prevention. One SR (10 RCTs; n= 1241) fo- cused on the effects of CBT compared with treatmentas usual (TAU) on suicide attempts in adults who hadattempted suicide within 6 months of the study (6). An-other SR (22 RCTs; n= 1977) evaluated the effect of CBT delivered face-to-face or via the Internet com-pared with TAU or, in some studies, a nondirective con-trol (for example, wait list or befriending) on suicidalideation (7). A third SR (6 RCTs; n= 1040) focused on the effect of CBT versus TAU on suicide prevention (8).The nal SR (18 RCTs; n= 3458) assessed the effect ofCBT compared with TAU on hopelessness, suicidal ide- ation, and suicide (10). The RCT assessed the effectiveness of CBT com- pared with an attention-control program for prevention of suicidal ideation among medical interns with a meanage of 25 years (19). Participants in the CBT group ( n= 100) received 4 weekly Web-based sessions lasting 30minutes each, and those in the attention-control group(n= 99) received 4 weekly e-mails containing informa- tionaboutdepressionandsuicideandcontactinforma-tion for local mental health services. The ndings suggest that CBT reduced suicide at- tempts (risk 0.47 0.30 /H110020.31 [CI, /H110020.51 to /H110020.10]) (10) compared with TAU. The strength of the evidencefor these outcomes was moderate ( Table 1). However, CBT did not seem to prevent or reduce suicide (8, 10);the strength of evidence for this outcome was low. Noharms related to CBT were reported in the includedevidence.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) ele- ments of CBT, skills training, and mindfulness tech-niques with the aim of helping persons with borderlinepersonality disorder (BPD) develop skills in emotionregulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tol-erance. One SR (10) and 3 RCTs (13, 14, 20) assessedtheefcacyofDBTforsuicidebehaviorandprevention. The SR included 5 RCTs ( n= 222) that examined the efcacy of DBT among patients with BPD who wereat high risk for suicide (10). The included RCTs com-paredDBTwithTAU(3trials),client-orientedtherapy(1trial), less directive psychotherapy (1 trial), and DBTplus prolonged exposure therapy (1 trial). Two of theadditional RCTs also assessed the efcacy of DBT inreducing suicidal behavior among patients diagnosedwith BPD. One compared DBT skills training plus TAU(n= 42) versus TAU alone ( n= 42) (13), and the other compared DBT plus the Collaborative Assessment andManagement of Suicidality n= 57) RCT as- the efcacy of DBT among veterans at high riskfor suicide without a diagnosis of BPD (20). Veteranswere randomly assigned to standard DBT for 6 months(n= 46) or treatment according to the recommenda- tions of their mental health team ( n= 45). The ndings for DBT suggest that it is more effective than client-oriented therapy (MD, /H110027.75 [CI, /H1100214.66 to /H110020.84] RCT [ n= 84]; P< 0.04) (13) in reducing suicidal ideation.However,theoverallqualityoftheevidencesup-porting this outcome was low. No differences were foundbetween DBT and TAU, \"expert-led\" psychotherapy, orCAMS for suicidal ideation. Similarly, no differences werefoundbetweenDBTandTAUorotherpsychotherapeu-tic interventions for hopelessness, suicide attempts, ordeath. Brief Intervention One SR included 3 RCTs ( n= 2028) that compared the World Health Organization's Brief Intervention andContact method (WHO-BIC) with an active control con- dition for suicide prevention (8). The intervention in-cluded an educational session on suicide preventionfollowed by regular contact with a trained provider bytelephone or in person for up to 18 months. The nd-ings suggest that WHO-BIC reduced the incidence ofsuicide compared with the control condition (3 of 1041vs. 24 of 987; odds ratio [OR], 0.20 [CI, 0.09 to 0.42];P< 0.001). Crisis Response Planning the effectiveness of enhanced CRP (E-CRP) ( n= or TAU ( n= 32) for prevention of suicide attempts in pa- tients with active suicidal ideation or a history of suicideattempt (18). The TAU group used a verbal contract forsafety along with risk assessment, supportive listening,and provision of crisis resources. The standard CRPgroup used the same components as the TAU group,but without the verbal contract for safety. The E-CRPgroup used the same components as the standard CRPgroup but also included an explicit discussion of thepatient's reasons for living. The ndings suggest a dif-ference in the number and proportion of suicide at-tempts that favored CRP of either type versus TAU (haz-ard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.06 to 0.96]; P= 0.028) but no difference between E-CRP and standard CRP. Window to Hope One RCT evaluated the efcacy of a group psycho- logical intervention called Window to Hope in reducinghopelessness and suicidal ideation among veteranswithmoderatetoseveretraumaticbraininjury(11).Par-ticipants were randomly assigned to receipt of ten2-hour weekly sessions of Window to Hope ( n= 15) or to a wait-list control ( n= 20). The wait-list group contin- ued to receive usual care from the VA until the start ofgroup therapy. The average age of the veterans in thisstudy was 51 years, and follow-up was 3 months. Thendings suggest that Window to Hope improved hope-lessness (MD, 4.4 [CI, 0.52 to 8.3]; P=0.03) P=0.07) compared with wait-list NR \u2014 NR \u2014 \u2014 NR \u2014 GRADE = Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation; ND = no difference between intervention and control; NGA newer-generation antidepressant; = strength of evidence; SR = systematic review.* Supplement Table 4 (available at Annals.org) provides reasons for the GRADE ratings.

Overall, the ndings suggestno difference between the interventions and the con-trol conditions. Pharmacologic Interventions Three SRs (23-25) and 3 RCTs (26-28) evaluated the effectiveness of a range of pharmacotherapies foradult patients at risk for suicide ( Table 3). Using the USPSTF criteria, we rated the quality of the SRs asgood. The quality of the included studies was rated asfair overall in the 3 SRs. Study limitations were primarilyrelated to lack of clarity surrounding randomization, al-locationconcealment,andblindingintheoriginaltrials,as well as study attrition and possible selective report-ing of outcomes. Table 3 shows quality ratings for the body of evidence for each medication. Quality ratingsranged from fair to poor across the individual RCTs.Limitations of the studies rated as fair included lack ofblinding of some patients (28) and lack of clarity aboutallocation concealment and blinding of outcome asses-sors (27). Limitations of the RCT rated as poor (26) in-cluded high attrition rates and unexplained diagnostic,pharmacologic, and therapeutic heterogeneity of thestudy population. Supplement Tables 4 to6(available at Annals.org) provide full GRADE ratings and studyinformation. Ketamine A meta-analysis used individual patient-level data (n= 167) to compare a single intravenous dose of ket- amine with placebo or midazolam for reducing suicidalideation (23). Two additional RCTs examined the ef-cacy and safety of a subanesthetic dose of racemic ket-amine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg of body over40 60) 40] or 0.05 mg/kg [ n= 19]) (27, 28). In all studies, sui- cidalideation(clinician-assessedandself-reported)wasreduced with ketamine. Only 1 study reported on ad-verse events and showed a transient increase in bloodpressure during administration, with a return to normalwithin approximately 15 minutes after the infusion 0.001]; diastolic: n= 6674) sought to determine the ef- cacy of lithium versus other active treatments (25 RCTs)or placebo (23 RCTs) in preventing suicide in patientswith unipolar or bipolar mood disorders over a rangeof4to48months(24).Ratesofsuicidewerestatisticallysignicantly lower with lithium than with placebo (OR,0.13 [CI, 0.03 to 0.66]). There were no differences be-tween lithium and other active treatments (ORs: ami-triptyline, 377.68]). Harms Other Two additional studies of pharmacologic treat- ments were identied but were not used to inform anyrecommendations because of concerns about very lowcertainty of the evidence, adverse effect prole, andlack of applicability to a U.S.-based patient population.One RCT examined the safety and efcacy of very lowdosages of sublingual buprenorphine as a time-limitedtreatmentforsuicidalideation,suicideattempt,andad-verse events (26). The buprenorphine group had agreater reduction in Beck Scale for Suicide Ideationscore than the placebo group after 4 weeks (MD, /H110027.1 [CI,/H1100212.0 to /H110022.3]; P= 0.004). There was 1 suicide attemptineachgroup(differencenotsignicant).Ratesof treatment-related adverse events were higher in thebuprenorphine group, and the most common adverseevents were fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, and constipa-tion. Finally, an SR compared a range of pharmacologicand natural products for patients with a history of self-harm (25). The authors noted that data were not re-ported numerically in many of the included studies,which limited their ability to analyze outcomes. We re-port on the most complete available data on newer-generation antidepressants (NGAs), which include mi-anserin, nomifensine, and there were no signicant differences be-tween NGAs and placebo (OR, 0.32 [CI, 0.01 to 8.04])Table Suicide Adverse Events (25) ND Low \u2014 NR \u2014Treatments for the Prevention and Management of Suicide REVIEW Annals.org Annals of Internal Medicine Vol. 171 No. 5 3 September 2019 339 Downloaded from https://annals.org by VA Central Office of Acquisition Operations user on 09/05/2019in suicide or hopelessness. The authors of an included trial stated that hopelessness scores did not differ be-tween NGAs and placebo, but no numerical data werereported. Our searches for other medications did notyield any new publications that met inclusion criteria.Therefore, the workgroup retained the recommenda-tions related to other medications in the previous CPG. DISCUSSION In this SR, we reviewed and synthesized evidence from 8 SRs and 15 RCTs of nonpharmacologic andpharmacologic interventions intended to prevent sui-cide in at-risk persons. These interventions are a subsetof topics included in the updated VA/DoD 2019 CPGfor assessment and management of patients at risk forsuicide. The full nal guideline is available from the VAWeb site (www.healthquality.va.gov). Nonpharmacologic interventions encompassed a range of approaches delivered either face-to-face or viathe Internet or other technology. We found moderate-strength evidence supporting the use of face-to-face orInternet-delivered CBT in reducing suicide attempts, sui-cidalideation,andhopelessnesscomparedwithTAU.Wefoundlow-strengthevidencesuggestingthatCBTwasnoteffective in reducing suicides. However, rates of suicidewere generally low in the included studies, which limitsour ability to draw rm conclusions about this outcome.Data from small studies provide low-strength evidencesupporting the use of DBT over client-oriented therapy orcontrolforreducingsuicidalideation.Forotheroutcomesand other comparisons, we found no benet of DBT.There was low-strength evidence supporting use ofWHO-BIC to reduce suicide, CRP to reduce suicide at-tempts, and Window to Hope to reduce suicidal ideationand hopelessness. We found moderate-strength evidence supporting use of short-term intravenous ketamine for reducingsuicidal ideation and use of lithium for reducing sui-cide.Patientsinameta-analysisthatusedindividualpa-tient-level data (23) had diagnoses of major depressivedisorder, bipolar disorder, or posttraumatic stress dis-order with baseline suicidal ideation. Patients in 1 RCThad a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (28), andthose in another RCT had recently been diagnosedwith cancer (27). All trials in the meta-analysis and theRCTs excluded patients with a history of substance usedisorder or past or current psychotic disorders, whichlimits generalizability to these high-risk populations. Ina large SR, risk for suicide was signicantly lower withlithiumthanplaceboinpatientswithunipolarorbipolarmood disorders. However, compared with other activetreatments for mood disorders, no benets of lithiumuse were found. The data for these comparisons werehighly variable and do not suggest that the treatmentsare equivalent. Our review has several limitations. The methods underlying the SRs for VA/DoD guidelines rely on pre-viously published SRs. Although a benet of this isthe ability to perform rapid reviews for formulatingevidence-based recommendations, we were limited bywhat was reported in the SRs. When SRs addressing a question or outcome of interest were not available, weincorporated and synthesized data from published clin-ical trials. However, the time frame for conducting theSR did not allow us to perform quantitative synthesis;therefore, we provide a qualitative, narrative synthesisof the literature. In addition, our time frame did notallow for dual screening or dual ROB assessment. Weaddressed the former issue by using the DistillerAIfunction (Evidence Partners) to conrm that no studieswere missed in the database and relied on iterativefeedback from the guideline panel. To address the lat-ter concern, a senior reviewer checked all ratings andmade corrections as needed. Finally, the methods out-lined in the VA/DoD Guideline for Guidelines (3) directthe approach of using existing SRs as the primarysource of evidence in reviews supporting the VA/DoDCPGs. Using previously published SRs could result inpotential bias, either by overrepresenting studies ifthey are reported in more than 1 review included in thenalevidencesynthesisorbymissingimportantstudies(29). We recognized this and attempted to reduce biasby including the most comprehensive, recent SRs withhigh methodological rigor; by also including studiesthat were published subsequent to the review; and bycarefully assessing areas of overlap. We occasionallyincluded reviews that overlapped provided that theyreported on different outcomes or subgroups of inter-est. Typically, overlap in reviews is highlighted for theCPG workgroup panel to assist them in interpreting theoverall ndings. Given the need for interventions to mitigate risk for suicide, particularly in the veteran and active militarypopulations, the lack of evidence to support currentnonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventionsand the lack of information on potential harms is signif-icant. We found modest benet of CBT and DBT in re-ducing suicidal ideation compared with TAU or wait-listcontrol, and CBT also reduced suicide attempts com-paredwithTAU.Bothketamineandlithiumhadmodestbenet in reducing the rate of suicide compared withplacebo. The data on ketamine are short-term, withfollow-up of only 1 to 7 days in the SR and up to 6weeks in 1 small RCT, and long-term information onpatients treated with ketamine is not available. Re-cently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearedthe s-enantiomer of ketamine, esketamine, as a nasalspray for use in patients with treatment-resistant de-pression, and long-term follow-up studies may betterinform future guideline recommendations. Adverseevents related to ketamine administration in 1 includedstudy were limited to transient increases in blood pres-sure. Although adverse events were not measured inthe trials examining use of lithium, it has a low thera-peutic index and requires patient safety monitoring. Fi-nally, several gaps in the literature merit further study.These are described extensively in the full CPG, whichis available at the Web site for the VA/DoD CPGs (30).

APPENDIX :KEYQUESTIONS KQs Addressed in the Review 1. For adults identied as being at increased risk for suicide, what non-pharmacologic/behaviorally basedinterventions improve health outcomes (decreasedsuicide attempts, decreased suicide deaths, improvedfunctional status and quality of life, or health status) orintermediate outcomes (decreased suicidal ideation, de-pressive symptomatology, or hopelessness)? a. Does the effect of the interventions vary by level of risk? b. Does the effect of the interventions vary by population characteristics? c. What are the potential harms of the interven- tion and do the harms vary by population? 2. For adults identied as being at increased risk for suicide, what pharmacological interventions im-prove health outcomes (decreased suicide attempts,decreased suicide deaths, improved functional statusand quality of life, or health status) or intermediate out-comes (decreased suicidal ideation, depressive symp-tomatology, or hopelessness)? a. Does the effect of the interventions vary by level of risk? b. Does the effect of the interventions vary by population characteristics? c. What are the potential harms of the interven- tion and do the harms vary by population? 3. In adult patients at risk for suicide, what community-based interventions and/or social supportprograms are effective at reducing risk of suicide? 4. In adult patients at risk for suicide, what is the effectiveness of telehealth modalities compared to ausual care setting? 5. In adult patients at risk for suicide, what is the effectiveness of technology-based interventions as anadjunct to usual care in improving outcomes? KQs Addressed in the Full CPG 1. In adults, do screening programs to detect suicide risk improve health outcomes (decreased suicide at-tempts, decreased suicide deaths, improved functioning, improved quality of life, or improved health status) or in-termediate outcomes (decreased suicidal ideation, de-pressive symptomatology, or hopelessness)? a. Does the effect of screening programs vary by population characteristics? i. Population characteristics include: gender, age, race/ethnicity, post-deployment status,populations at high risk for suicide, chronicmedical or mental health co-morbidities(PTSD, TBI) b. Does the effect of screening programs vary by healthcare setting (primary care, mentalhealth,ED,community-basedsetting,Vetcen-ters, specialty care [e.g., oncology])? c. Are there potential harms or unintended con- sequences associated with screening for sui- cide risk in healthcare settings? 2. In adults, do instruments used in healthcare set- tings to screen for increased risk for suicide accuratelyidentify those who are at increased risk? a. Does the accuracy of the screening instru- ments vary by population characteristics? b. How often and by whom should these instru- ments be administered? c. Are structured assessment tools superior to unstructured clinical assessment interviews? d. In what settings and populations does the positive predictive value of instruments sup-port their utility in practice? 3. What methods are most effective in stratifying risk of suicide behavior and suicide? a. Are structured assessment tools superior to unstructured clinical assessment interviews? 4.Forpatientsidentiedasbeingatriskforsuicide, what are the most effective treatment approaches? a. Does the effect of the interventions vary by level of risk? b. Does the effect of the interventions vary by population characteristics? c. What are the potential harms of the interven- tion and do the harms vary by population? 5. In adults with suicide ideation/attempt, what are the most effective post-acute care approaches? a. What follow-up plan is most effective immedi- ately after discharge (e.g. intervention, fre-quency, timing, assessments, location)? b. What are the most effective interventions for managing long-term risk in an adult whowas hospitalized? 6. In adult patients at risk for suicide, what factors can increase risk or reduce or protect against suicidalbehavior? 7. What community-based interventions are effec- tive at reducing population-level risk of suicide?
