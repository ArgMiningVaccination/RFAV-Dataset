This protocol posting deals with objectives & outcome measures of the extension phase at year 11 to 20. No additional subjects will be recruited during this long-term follow-up. |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Hepatitis A||Biological: Havrix||Phase 4| This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after primary vaccination with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A vaccine (two-dose schedule). To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will donate a blood sample at Years 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to determine their anti-hepatitis A (anti-HAV) antibody concentrations. If a subject has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies during any of the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Months 138, 150, 162, 174,186, 198, 210, 222, 234 and 246), he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose. A blood sample will be taken on the day of the additional vaccination 14 days and one month after additional vaccination to evaluate the immune response following this vaccination. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007 and to extend the follow up until Year 20.

Hence this subject was not included in the LT-ATP cohort for immunogenicity analysis at Month 246. - Anti-hepatitis A Virus (Anti-HAV) Antibody Concentration [ Time Frame: Before additional vaccination, 14 days after additional vaccination and 30 days after additional vaccination ] Concentrations given as GMC expressed as mIU/mL. 4 subjects received additional vaccination at Month 186 and 1 subject at Month 198. Please note that value 14.9 means <15. - Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited Local Symptoms [ Time Frame: During the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period after additional vaccination ]Solicited local symptoms assessed include pain, redness and swelling. Additional vaccination was given to 4 subjects at the Month 186 timepoint and to 1 subject at the Month 198 timepoint. - Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited General Symptoms [ Time Frame: During the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period after additional vaccination ] Solicited general symptoms assessed include fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and headache. 4 subjects received additional vaccination at Month 186 and 1 subject at Month 198. - Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events (AE) [ Time Frame: During the 30-day follow-up period after additional vaccination ] An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 4 subjects received additional vaccination at Month 186 and 1 at Month 198. - Number of Subjects Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Assessed by the Investigator as Related to Primary Study Vaccination, Procedures or Lack of Vaccine Efficacy [ Time Frame: At Months 138, 150, 162, 174, 186, 198, 210, 222, 234 and 246 ]An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject, or may evolve into one of the outcomes listed above - Number of Subjects Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) After Additional Vaccination [ Time Frame: During the 30-day follow-up period after additional vaccination ] An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject, or may evolve into one of the outcomes listed above. 4 subjects received additional vaccination at Month 186 and 1 at Month 198. - Number of Subjects Reporting Pregnancies After Additional Vaccination [ Time Frame: At Months 186 and 198 ]The number of subjects with outcome of pregnancies reported among subjects who had received the additional vaccination was tabulated. 4 subjects received additional vaccination at Month 186 and 1 subject at Month 198.
