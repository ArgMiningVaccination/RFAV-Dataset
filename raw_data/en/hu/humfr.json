This spring, the college awarded degrees to 167 students, its largest class ever. Enrollment is also its highest ever, at 635 students. Also, in October NCNM received approval from accreditors to become a university . Much remains to be done before the school makes that transition, including settling on a new name. The announcement came on the heels of approval and formation of a new School of Undergraduate & Part-Time Studies earlier this year, with classes to begin in fall 2016. The Big News in the School of Classical Chinese Medicine (CCM) was approval of a different sort: After several years of diligent work, Dean Laurie Regan heard in April that a new four-year Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine program had been approved. The new program, which began this fall, continues the scholar-practitioner model with a focus on the roots of ancient Chinese medicine, the hallmark of the Master of Science in Oriental Medicine program. Doctoral students will dive deeper into the ancient texts as the basis of training in acupuncture and herbal medicine, but with additional focus on integration with modern biomedicine. Speaking of China, faculty members Brenda Hood, PhD, LAc; Brandt Stickley, LAc; and nine students visited Shanghai in August for 15 days of classes in acupuncture, herbal medicine and pulse-taking at the clinic of Dr. Li Xin, the noted Chinese medicine practitioner, consultant and teacher. Dr. Li visited NCNM earlier in the year as part of CCM's continuing effort to forge ties with Chinese medical practitioners and teachers. Evidence-Based Research is always a hot topic in natural medicine, with funding historically tight. NCNM's School of Research & Graduate Studies and its Helfgott Research Institute are certainly paving the way to attract support for our students. Ongoing studies of diabetes, cancer, gastrointestinal issues, pain and nutrition, to name a few, are underway. Work at the school got a huge boost in June with the award of more than $3 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. The two five-year complementary and integrative health grants will support studies involving mindfulness- based stress reduction for people with multiple sclerosis, and clinical research training for naturopathic doctors and Chinese medicine practitioners, as well as training in naturopathic and Chinese medicine modalities for conventional medicine researchers. ncnm-helfgott.ncnm.edu/ study-participation-opportunities Zoom+ Stocks up on NCNM Grads: The fall 2013 issue of NEXUS reported that alumna Sara Gillham, ND ('11), had become the first naturopathic physician hired by the growing storefront urgent care company. Dr. Gillham has since been promoted to product development manager, and the company, which changed its name to Zoom+, has hired 11 NCNM graduates in the last year to bolster its natural medicine offerings. AANP Awards: NCNM President David Schleich, PhD, was named \"AANP 2015 Champion of Naturopathic Medicine,\" at the recent American Association of Naturopathic Physicians conference for \"changing the landscape of health care through University Status, New Chinese Medicine Doctorate, $3 Million in NIH Grants SAVE THE DATE: JULY 1-3, 2016 \"Global Patient Care: Preventing Chronicity Naturopathically,\" is the theme of the 3rd International Congress on Naturopathic Medicine (ICNM) t o be held in Barcelona, Spain.

Willamette Week 's recent readers' poll \"Best of Portland,\" recognized a group of NCNM grads. Suzanne Scopes, ND ('85), was voted the \"Best Naturopath\" in Portland, citing her volunteer work at Outside In. Runner-up was NCNM Adjunct Satya Ambrose, ND ('89), of Bloom Healthcare, with Bloom practitioners Ashley Haywood, ND, MSOM ('06), and Molly O'Neill, ND, receiving Honorable Mentions. Melissa Berry, ND ('08), owner of Missionary Chocolates, received an honorable mention for \"Best Chocolatier in Portland.\" Lawsuit Demands Parity: Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains a clause that outlaws discrimination against natural medicine primary care providers and other state-licensed \"alternative\" care providers, some insurance companies have been slow to comply. Fed up with the delay, the American Chiropractic Association is suing major carriers. Meanwhile, in July, the Oregon Association of Naturopathic Physicians (OANP) filed a class action lawsuit against Health Net and its health plan administrator, American Specialty Health Group Inc., alleging insurance discrimination against naturopathic patients. The OANP was also instrumental in passage of a state anti-discrimination measure by the Oregon Legislature, the first by any state. The new law codifies the concept that all licensed primary care providers in Oregon should be treated and reimbursed equally. The legislation is intended to protect natural medicine primary care providers in the event the ACA is watered down or repealed. Orange is for MSOM: Each year, the NCNM Library accepts and files student theses from the graduating class. Among the ever-accumulating natural medicine scholarship are this year's Master of Science in Oriental Medicine (MSOM) theses, designated by a bright orange cover. Students print out their work, which is bound by the Trappist Abbey Book Bindery in Carlton, Oregon. In addition to the physical availability, NCNM librarians create a record for each thesis on WorldCat, a worldwide online library resource. Students: Where Do They Come From? Top Ten States of Origin NCNM enrollment currently stands at 635 graduate students. Not surprisingly, most students hail from the West Coast, but a significant number also come from the Midwest and the East, with 45 of the 50 states represented. The largest group from outside the United States, at 1.44%, are Canadians.

He also helped found the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians and the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, rather sizable feathers in those caps. Tribe, now NCNM's alumni officer, was a naturopathic student for two years from 1977 to 1979 when the then National College of Naturopathic Medicine had a branch in Kansas. He came to Oregon in 1975 when the Kansas branch and another in Seattle closed, consolidating operations in Portland. (See Editor's Note, below) However, his interest in natural medicine goes back to his undergraduate days at Middlebury College in Vermont. As Tribe tells it, his roommate was \"a macrobiotic freak,\" and introduced him to a range of whole foods and natural approaches to life. His roommate also told him about \"Back to Eden\" by Jethro Kloss, a book on natural food, medicine and herbal remedies. \"I got really fascinated with that and wondered how to apply it, and about the biology and chemistry of how herbs work and why.\" He reviewed the chemical and biomedical literature on about two dozen herbs and wrote a series of monographs on his findings. Shortly after, he won a fellowship from the Thomas Watson Foundation to work with the National Institute of Medical Herbalists in Great Britain to study the role of medical herbalism in modern British society. It was while studying in the UK that he read about NCNM and enrolled. However, \"it was somewhere in my third year (that) I realized I was not cut out to be a physician,\" he said. While he enjoyed the research and scholarship, he found he wasn't fully comfortable interacting with patients. \"But I had a great passion for the school itself and for natural medicine in general,\" he said, \"so I kinda hung around and created a job for myself.\" He served as assistant to the academic dean, dean of students and as development director. He even served a year as interim president. In 1981, though, he and NCNM parted ways. \"The board decided they needed something else and I walked away from NCNM for a while.\" In the interim, he was the first executive director of the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) and served for four and a half years as volunteer executive director of AANP, which he and a group of doctors, including NCNM alumnus Jim Sensenig, ND ('78), started in 1985. Ten years later, he was back at NCNM working on another couple of caps. Initially, he coordinated the writing and publication of the school's first CNME self-study, a successful effort in the process of securing NCNM's first accreditation. That job morphed into a position as special assistant to NCNM President James Miller. With NCNM's first accreditation complete, he left NCNM again, this time to work with his wife on their Corbett, Oregon, daffodil farm. That lasted for 15 years, but he never completely lost contact with the college. So one day in 2012, Tribe heard that NCNM was looking for a new alumni officer. Now retired from daffodil farming, he called Advancement Vice President Susan Hunter and told her, \"You need to hire me.\" She did, and he added one more hat to the collection. \"It's great,\" said Tribe, \"I like to say that I was rescued from retirement to continue my 40-year love affair with this place. I really enjoy being in contact with alumni and fostering a personal relationship.\" He added, \"When you drill down to the bedrock of it all, there is something fundamentally right about what the natural medicine profession does. I want to be part of the excitement in expanding that. My object has always been to be useful.\" n Editor's Note: NCNM was founded in Portland in 1956 and has always had a presence there.

Residents once actually lived in the hospital\u2014thus the name\u2014and were in a great position to work with patients from admittance to discharge, on the way to becoming full-fledged physicians. Although one could argue that the ancient Chinese and ancient Greeks, with their strong master-to-student medical traditions, had a kind of residency way back in time, NCNM is credited by NDhealthFacts with the first modern U.S. naturopathic residency in 1979. From the beginning, the biggest difference has been money. Allopathic residencies receive federal money through Medicare, naturopathic residencies do not. So, natural medicine educators depend heavily on corporate support to give newly minted graduates additional clinical experience to deepen their ability to treat disease and enhance their careers. Also, getting a job right out of med school certainly helps pay off those student loans. At NCNM, the number of residencies remains small at 44 but is growing. Some 15 residencies are onsite, funded by the college. The remaining 29 residencies at 23 remote sites are supported primarily by the hosting doctors, but with key support (about 20 percent) coming from sponsoring companies. One of the leading residency sponsors is Canada's Nutritional Fundamentals for Health (NFH), which contributes to three of NCNM's naturopathic residencies each year. Hevert Pharmaceuticals also helps support three annual ND residencies, and Alletess Lab sponsors one. In addition, NCNM's School of Classical Chinese Medicine launched its first two annual residencies in 2015 thanks to BEMA Botanicals. NFH sponsorships include A Woman's Time clinic in Portland, Oregon, Lokahi Health Center in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, and A Family Healing Center in McMinnville, Oregon. Dr. Leah Gillingham, chief scientific officer for NFH, said the supplement company's support for residencies neatly dovetails with NFH's health and wellness mission, its strong interest in evidence-based research, and continuing education support for the naturopathic profession. Said Gillingham, \"While naturopathic medicine is [experiencing] exciting rapid growth, there are a limited number of residencies available...and financial support is needed. NCNM provided the opportunity to partner with NFH in the expansion and refinement of the residency network.\" The company has committed to five years of support for NCNM residencies, totaling $162,000. That support is greatly appreciated at NCNM. Said Melanie Henriksen, ND ('06), dean of the School of Naturopathic Medicine, \"Because we don't qualify for federal funding, growing residencies is something that has been a consistent struggle.\" She said most students would like to move into a residency upon graduation, and most healthcare facilities would like to see the experience on graduate's resumes. \"Funding support from outside companies is one way that the profession is working to bridge the need. We are extraordinarily grateful to the companies that do choose to offer financial support to naturopathic residencies.\" Dr. Henriksen said care must be taken to avoid conflict of interest, \"which is why the residency director and the residents themselves have very little contact with the companies. From an academic perspective, it is our job to assure an unbiased education and we have multiple processes in place to assure that is the case.\" Companies Help Fill Residency Funding GapLack of federal funding for natural medicine residencies keeps advocates scrambling.

Dr. Fuller fondly remembers her own time as a first-year resident at the NCNM Clinic and second-year resident at Portland's Nature Cures Clinic. She had extensive clinical/ patient experience during her doctoral program, but was able to quadruple that time as a resident. \"It hugely helped me,\" she said, \"Being able to walk into a treatment room with comfort after a year of patient care was big.\" Tori Hudson, ND ('84 ), medical director at A Woman's Time clinic in Portland, one of the NFH sites, knew she wanted to do a residency from the first day of her student orientation. Dr. Hudson became an NCNM resident in 1984, when there was only one position. She and two other grads concocted a plan to share the slot, with all three working full-time and splitting the pay three ways. Hudson's clinic hosted the first integrative medicine residency for NCNM grads in 1996, she said. Ever since then, she has offered an accredited residency at her clinic. Although NCNM's doctoral program includes 1,200 hours of clinical time over four years, graduates really benefit from residencies, she said. \"A residency offers a much faster clinical learning curve, a wide range of clinical experiences, mentorship, opportunities for joining a practice, career opportunities imagined and not yet imagined, a guaranteed income and malpractice insurance.\" Residencies also often come with health insurance, a retirement plan and paid CME, she said, and offer a more certain path to financial and clinical success. \"My goal is to have it be a successful stellar learning experience and career building opportunity for each resident; provide them with the knowledge, experience, salary, health insurance and CME that they need to feel secure; and have it work to the benefit of my patients at A Woman's Time,\" she said. Overall, though progress has been slow, Hudson said there are now about 60 ND residencies nationwide, funded through a combination of support from naturopathic doctors and colleges, corporations and the nonprofit Naturopathic Education and Research Consortium (NERC). About two new spots are added each year, not a bad comparison to the one lone residency at NCNM 36 years ago, she said. \"The future is getting brighter for ND residencies,\" said Hudson, \"but, to bring more residency opportunities to graduates, it is going to take more than the generosity of just the schools and the NERC clinics. It's going to take grant money, government money, visionary money.\" NFH's Gillingham echoes those sentiments. \"The naturopathic profession is in great need of more residency opportunities, and financial support is essential to its success. NCNM's residency program is uniquely positioned to place new naturopathic medicine graduates within successful, thriving and cutting-edge naturopathic medical clinics, enabling a dynamic learning experience under the mentorship of leaders in the field.\" n n cnm.edu | NEXUS 7 HOW TO GIVE Opportunities abound to support the education of NCNM students and the work of NCNM faculty, including the residency program.

Although Southern Nepal is a hot and tropical river valley, most of the rest of the small country is dominated by the tallest mountains in the world, including Mt. Everest. Known as Sagarmatha to the locals, Everest is just one of many stunning peaks in the region created by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. In the lore of the Hindu, Buddhist and Bon religions, the mountains and deep gorges are the sacred homes of gods, demons and fairies, created by the conflicts between good and evil. Some, including Tibet's Mt. Kailash, are considered so holy that climbing \"the cosmic mountain\" is considered a desecration. It is a region of many myths and legends, including those telling of a giant ape-like creature, the Yeti or Abominable Snowman, and the story of Shambhala or Shangri-La, the hidden city of peace and enlightenment. But in April 2015, whether the work of gods, demons or simply natural forces, the ground shook, twisted and rumbled, laying most of the country to waste and killing approximately 9,000 people.When disaster struck the Nepali village of Karmidanda, alumna Erin Moore was the only doctor for miles. ODYSSEY (OPPOSITE PAGE) EXCERPT FROM DR. ERIN MOORE'S JOURNAL.Dr. Erin Moore, a 2014 graduate of NCNM's naturopathic medicine doctoral program, had been to Nepal before. During her first trip in 2007, as part of a trip around the world, she traveled into the Himalayas, and like many before her, was instantly taken in. \"There is something about this place,\" she said, \"it feels like home when you first arrive.\" She returned as a tourist again in 2009, and was on a bus ride to the mountains near the Tibetan border when the bus broke down. Far from any towns or repair facilities, and having no other options, Moore and a fellow American female companion accepted an invitation from a local man on the bus to come to a village where a friend of his lived. The catch: the village of Karmidanda was four hours away on foot. Though both were tired and her friend was skeptical, the pair set out with the villager. It was a long, rough walk up the side of a river valley, but when they reached Karmidanda, she quickly felt a sense of serendipity. The village warmly welcomed the Americans with food and shelter, and Moore was impressed with a group striving to make things better in the remote area. \"They didn't have a lot of needs, but the group was really motivated to help.\" All told, she made four trips in five years, including one to help set up a temporary clinic. Other trips saw her leading development projects like building clean water stations, gardens and sanitary services. A family there \"adopted\" her and gave her a place to stay. She felt a special call to Karmidanda and kept coming back, even as she worked on her medical degree, both to help and to recharge from the rigors of the Western world. A year after graduation she returned again in the spring of 2015 to improve on earlier efforts at the village, some of which had proven unsustainable in her absence. The problem, she had decided during her year away, was that such things as gardens and even modern sanitation facilities were her priorities, not necessarily the villager's goals. Although she had applied the naturopathic principle tolle totem (treat the whole person) to the village, it was another principle, tolle causam (treat the cause) that inspired her to employ a community development concept called participatory development. It's a process where locals identify their needs and take the lead on developing and applying solutions. In a variation on the old \"give a man a fish\" proverb, the program teaches skills such as assessment and needs mapping, which local leaders then apply to their community. A sense of ownership naturally develops and projects continue after outside aid workers leave. The project was set to begin in a few weeks, but nature had other plans. On the morning of April 25, as Moore and a group from Karmidanda were walking to Katmandu, the Nepali capital, 30 miles away, a powerful 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit. Though she had never been in an earthquake, she All told, she made four trips in five years, including one to help set up a temporary clinic. 10 NEXUS | Fall/Winter 2015knew immediately what it was. The ground rolled and swung back and forth, reminding her of a roller coaster. In her journal, she recalled those first moments after the quake: \"We walked a few minutes back toward the village and saw the scope of the destruction. It was a clear day and the hillsides of the Trisuli River valley are usually speckled with pretty little villages amidst the terraced land. Today, the villages turned to clouds of dust. We were horrified as we realized Karmidanda probably looked the same.\" She continued, \"The quakes kept coming and our group grew with young people trying to get back home. People were screaming and wailing all around, every house we passed was totally destroyed...survivors were huddled in the road scared and crying.\" Hurrying back towards Karmidanda, she saw a dust cloud and knew it was a bad sign. When she got there, her worst fears were confirmed. \"Karmidanda...two modern houses standing. I was so happy to see each face...groups huddled in open spaces...we got to our house and could see right through it...the kitchen is a pile of rocks. Many are dead, several are severely injured. We've built shelters for the night and are praying we can get some to the hospital tomorrow. I don't think I will sleep tonight\u2014aftershocks constantly.\" The following day, April 26 around noon, she recorded this assessment: \"What a nightmare. Twenty-four hours ago this place was my paradise and now it feels like a war zone. Everyone is homeless. We're in tent sites and makeshift shelters. Most are still in shock, paralyzed with fear. The aftershocks are countless and continuing. We can see and hear landslides all around us\u2014helicopters every five minutes rescuing foreigners and (the) severely ill.\" In addition to the toppled home, in one stroke the village's clean water supply and limited sanitation facilities were destroyed. Most of the livestock and at least four villagers were dead, with many more injured. Luckily, her host family made it through relatively unscathed. Moore, the brand new graduate of NCNM, all of 31, was the only doctor for miles. The village's lone clinic was buried in rubble. Fortunately, she had carried a first aid kit and a homeopathy kit along on her aborted trip to Katmandu. Still in a state of shock herself, Moore knew she was going to need every scrap of her ND training. She set up a clinic under a tarp and began triage. Patients with severe crush injuries were loaded on makeshift stretchers and taken by foot to the nearest hospital in Trisuli. \"I knew that we were going to have a lot of serious needs, and I was the only doctor,\" she said. \"I made a conscious choice to feel later and just act. I stuffed away my fear and heartbreak, and just worked.\" Luckily, many of the survivor's wounds were superficial and easily treated. \"I did a lot of Still in a state of shock herself, Moore knew she was going to need every scrap of her ND training. n cnm.edu | NEXUS 1 112 NEXUS | Fall/Winter 2015cleaning wounds and tried to provide a calming presence,\" she said. \"The people were so appreciative.\" Other people, though, were bleeding, a challenge with her limited supplies. She used dried cinnamon from a neighbor's kitchen and a native plant called banmara, eupatorium adenophorum , long used in Nepal for cuts and bruises, made poultices and was able to slow or stop bleeding. For bright red, gushing blood, she applied the cinnamon and banmara poultices and administered homeopathic phosphorus by mouth. \"That plant saved lives,\" Moore said of banmara, \"my knowledge of local plants and my homeopathy kit\" also proved invaluable. So did her outside contacts, notably boyfriend Nat Willis, a Portland businessman with experience in Nepal, and fellow NCNM grad Desha Wood, ND ('14), who cranked up the social media machine to help raise relief funds from Haiti where Wood was working with Naturopaths Without Borders. More than $30,000 was raised via the YouCaring website, allowing Willis to put together relief supplies, including tin panels for roofing, food and water. The NCNM Clinic donated three suitcases of medical supplies, and the college's Portland neighbor, the Southwest Charter School, conducted a fundraiser to help. Willis reached Karmidanda five days after the quake. Moore had another thing working for her. The participatory development program she had helped start basically picked up where it left off, with the villagers working on the same basics as before, but with the added help of in-country relief nonprofits. As she put it, \"everything had changed and nothing had changed,\" referring to the continuing needs and her commitment to stay on until basic, sustainable services were in place. The Spanish Red Cross donated emergency toilets. Blankets and mosquito nets, the latter in anticipation of the coming seasonal monsoons and the potential for malaria, came from YouCaring funds. As a result, the village saw relief much faster than much of the rest of the country, said Moore. The imminent rains gave the whole relief effort a heightened sense of urgency, she said, starting with getting people out of tents and tarp shelters into temporary, but hardier structures of tin and wood reclaimed from destroyed houses. Karmidanda weathered the monsoons well, said Moore, but there still is much work to do to help the village achieve sustainability. Even in the best of times, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. To that end, Moore formed a new nonprofit called ParticipAid, with the goal of refining the participatory development process. She hopes the concept will not only continue to be applied in Nepal, but serve as a model for other areas in need. \"It puts the power of development more in the hands of the people where it belongs.\" n A message from Dr. Erin Moore & Nat Willis: news.ncnm.edu/himalayan-odyssey Editor's Note: ParticipAid is now part of NCNM's Research Institute as an independent project, particip-aid.org n cnm.edu | NEXUS 13N ATE WILLIS AND DR.

On his long drive home that night, he wondered what agonizing decisions a mother raising a family with limited financial resources must make if all her kids happened to contract an acute illness at the same time. His thoughts drifted and he found himself wondering where people without any means go when they get sick. As Dr. Chris Meletis, ND ('92), drove home, he continued to imagine ways in which access to health care might be expanded for the uninsured and underserved. He wondered if NCNM, which already offered generous low-cost clinical care at its small campus clinic, could begin to provide an even greater and more expansive program of free and low-cost health care to people who would otherwise not be able to afford a doctor. Soon after, Meletis, an NCNM grad and now an internationally recognized naturopathic expert, along with Drs. Laurent Chaix, Jill Sanders, Rich Barrett and Judy Peabody, among others, began to set up NCNM's first safety-net community clinics at churches and outreach agencies throughout Portland's metro area. It was the first time that the safety-net concept of care was developed at an American naturopathic medical college. There was a need for health care and an opportunity to help heal a wide range of presenting conditions. There was also the chance for NCNM students to develop clinical skills alongside attending NDs. NCNM Clinics Today Fast forward to 2015: NCNM has graduated 2,264 ND students since it opened in 1956. Those students have seen and helped thousands of underserved patients through NCNM's network of community clinics\u2014now numbering a dozen. This seed of an idea from so many years ago has seen a number of iterations. Naturopathic clinical care has developed over the years, not only at NCNM's community clinics, but at the campus' main NCNM Clinic, which opened in 2009. The large, modern, natural medicine clinic offers its naturopathic medical providers and student interns technology that's state-of-the-art, including an electronic medical record system that shares records with area hospitals and clinics throughout Portland. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) now provides health care to about 16 million Americans\u2014many formerly uninsured. But there are still millions more who remain uninsured or uninsurable. The need for community clinics remains. Natural medicine is also no longer a fringe health system as it was thought to be when Meletis launched the community clinics concept. With the ACA came legitimacy for NDs, Chinese medicine practitioners and others due to a provision in the law that prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against them. In Oregon, state legislators have come to see NDs as primary care providers. As public demand steadily grows for natural medicine, confidence is growing, too, by conventional medical doctors, public policy makers and public health agencies\u2014all concerned with the growing shortage of primary care physicians. NCNM Wins Public Health Agencies' Recognition and Funding Most recently, NCNM is the recipient of that vote of confidence. Last year, the NCNM Clinic received a grant from CareOregon to join a Primary Care Patient-Centered Home learning collaborative with a select group of area medical clinics and hospitals. CareOregon is the state public health agency that provides health plan Learning and Healing IN NCNM'S CLINICS Back in the mid-90s, alumnus Dr. Chris Meletis wondered how NCNM could broaden help for people without adequate health care. NCNM's Community Clinics were born. n cnm.edu | NEXUS 17 services to coordinated care organizations serving about 250,000 Oregonians with limited incomes. In July 2015, the college announced that its newest satellite clinic in a suburb of Portland, the NCNM Beaverton Clinic, was awarded a two-year $387,000 grant by the Washington County Health & Human Services Department. The grant has the potential to be renewed for an additional three years for a total of $967,500. The county closed two of its clinics and funded the clinic to provide naturopathic primary care and preventive services to the county's thousands of uninsured patients. Services at the NCNM Beaverton Clinic include family planning, sexually transmitted disease screening and treatments, vaccine immunizations, as well as treatments for a range of health conditions, from allergies, colds and flu, to diabetes, heart disease and gastrointestinal disorders. NCNM's Dean of Clinic Operations and Chief Medical Officer, Regina Dehen, ND, LAc, said that NCNM students consider the experience of working with a diverse cross-section of patients at the college's community clinics critical to their training. \"The opportunity to provide care to underserved patients using botanical medications alongside mainstream pharmaceuticals, such as vaccinations or contraceptives, has tremendous educational value,\" Dehen said. \"Whether or not a naturopathic doctor chooses to provide vaccinations or contraceptive management as part of their future private practice, these skills are an essential part of our training as primary care providers,\" she added. NCNM's Community Clinics Manager Lori Knowles agrees. \"Our students are learning critical skills as they help a population who often come to us for their first visits in pretty bad shape\u2014with physical complaints that have been undiagnosed and untreated for far too long. They learn to trust our practitioners and the students, and make great strides toward health maintenance. Our patient volume in Beaverton has grown quickly, which speaks to successful health outcomes. To also have the support of the county health department in assuming care of their patients is awesome.\" New graduates are also finding doors long closed to NDs flung wide open. Consider the success of Dr. Sara Gillham, a 2011 NCNM grad, who confidently promoted herself and her clinical skills with ZoomCare, now called Zoom+, a wildly successful out-patient urgent care clinic. About a year after graduation, she was hired as a clinical manager of wellness, charged with implementing naturopathic medical care at all ZoomCare clinics. The neighborhood clinic model that ZoomCare introduced has changed the way clinics look at the delivery of medical care, and the company is expanding into California, Idaho and Washington\u2014with 11 more NCNM NDs hiring on as primary care providers. Gillham, meanwhile, has been promoted to product development manager for the quickly growing company. Gillham, interviewed by the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges this year, acknowledged there still are challenges ahead for NDs in the changing medical marketplace, but added, \"By offering naturopathic care in a conventional medical setting we are succeeding in educating our conventional colleagues in the efficacy of naturopathic medicine, and we are reaching patients who might not otherwise consider naturopathic care.\" nNCNM CLINIC, THE COLLEGE'S MAIN TEACHING FACILITY. THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY CLINICS WAS LAUNCHED IN THE 1990S.18 NEXUS | Fall/Winter 2015Last year, as NCNM's community clinic at the Elsie Stuhr Center in Beaverton was set to close, administrators looked for a new, permanent location that would serve as a pilot project for a new community clinics model. The idea was to create a professional clinic space that would attract existing patients, but also set the stage for growth to serve other underserved populations. Importantly, the new space would allow for a permanent clinic space, a move away from the former pop-up clinic model at Elsie Stuhr and other community clinics. After commissioning an analysis of population density and proximity to potential and existing patients, they chose a storefront site in the center of Beaverton with good visibility, next to the Social Security Administration office. With staff and equipment in place, the next step was outreach events, news media coverage, open houses and ads in the local papers. \"This area of Beaverton has a large population of established NCNM patients, but also has a population density with the right mix of demographics to project steady growth and return on investment,\" said Community Clinics Manager Lori Knowles. \"With the Affordable Care Act, we knew the NCNM community clinics program had to provide community-based options for the growing number of newly insured patients eager for a more professional clinical setting option.\" The combination clearly worked. Many of the first patients coming through the Beaverton Clinic door in the summer and fall of 2014 indicated they had also been seen by NCNM doctors and students at Elsie Stuhr. Then, a marvelous thing happened. The numbers just kept growing. As a result, physician shifts have nearly doubled since opening day. Two acupuncture shifts were added and now have a month-long waiting list. The clinic also has a hybrid billing model that offers more payment flexibility to accept private insurance, Medicaid and cash.Knowles has watched with interest as patient demographics have shifted over time. She said the first patients tended to be primarily lower to middle income Caucasian women and some men. They are still getting those patients, but, \"Now we are seeing more Medicaid patients than ever before and are also seeing an enormous jump in the Latino- and Spanish-speaking uninsured (many undocumented) population in the last and current fiscal quarter. This is mainly due to our involvement in the Washington County clinic contract ( see \"Learning and Healing in NCNM's Clinics,\" p. 16 ) and the specific goals for serving that population. We are also doing our own outreach efforts within that demographic as well.\" Quick success has also brought some challenges, said Knowles. With so much growth, it was necessary to create a separate budget for Beaverton apart from the community clinics, and mirror the main clinics' price structure. Staff costs have risen as paid bilingual front office staffers replaced volunteers. The transition away from the community clinics model also included a need to close the donation-based inventory and replace it with a fully stocked retail medicinary. Clinic administrators have also needed to be nimble, closely tracking demographics for trends and opportunity. \"We have continuously adjusted and expanded our clinic hours, services, treatment offerings, billing model, etc., to adapt to the needs of NCNM, the shifting healthcare landscape, and most importantly, the needs and expectations of our patients, students and providers.\" Another mark of success occurred over the summer. With all of the changes in structure, NCNM's first permanent clinic outside the Portland city limits is no longer considered a community clinic. It's now referred to as a satellite of the main NCNM Clinic\u2014and is clearly a template for future growth. n Beaverton Clinic a Hit in Washington County n cnm.edu | NEXUS 19 From the earliest days of the NCNM clinics, invaluable real-world experience for naturopathic and Chinese medicine students has gone hand-in-hand with helping the vulnerable and poor get better through free or low-cost care. Dr. Laurent Chaix, a 1995 graduate of NCNM's naturopathic medicine doctoral program, was a resident in one of the first community clinics. Working with Chris Meletis, ND ('92), and others, he helped set up a series of NCNM clinics at Portland Community College (PCC) sites, downtown Portland's Outside In and several other sites, including the community clinic at Mt. Olivet Church in Northeast Portland. That latter clinic, recalls Dr. Chaix, was formed in 1995 after NCNM's African-American students approached the church pastor. Soon, NCNM students and faculty were visiting the church each week, initially setting up partitions and massage tables near the pastor's office. Other nearby rooms served as exam rooms. \"We had a pretty decent medicinary,\" Chaix said. \"Appointments were made at the main clinic and we had a binder where slots were filled. We were given a filing cabinet and all the charts were kept locked onsite. Every week we had a bin that would ferry the meds and money bag, and other items. It was a pretty good system.\" Using Mt. Olivet as a model, NCNM set up its first PCC clinic at the community college's Portland Metropolitan Workforce Training Center in Northeast Portland, according to Chaix. \"The population served at that PCC (site) was in need of medical attention as well as workforce preparations,\" he said. \"At that point we became known in the PCC community and we were being invited to their multiple locations around Portland. Every PCC wanted to have a clinic onsite at least once a week.\" Chaix also heard that Outside In, a downtown Portland clinic that serves a largely homeless and drug afflicted population, might lose its state funding. He approached the director with a plan to help keep the doors open: NCNM, in the midst of an enrollment uptick and in need of more student teaching sites, would place students there, supplementing the clinic's limited staff. The arrangement was accepted and continues today, currently with three weekly Chinese medicine shifts. \"That gave students an opportunity like no other,\" said Chaix, \"seeing pathologies that would never come across our doors at the main clinic.\" NCNM students have similarly benefitted with experiences at the other clinics, whether it was PCC students or the African-American community. NCNM community clinics since have broadened their reach and now also include the Asian and transgender communities, and with the addition of the Beaverton Clinic ( see Beaverton Clinic, p. 18 ), NCNM is seeing increasing numbers of Spanish-speaking patients. \"There were students in my graduating class that never once saw a diabetic patient,\" Chaix said. \"Now, lots of students see diabetics and patients afflicted with common chronic conditions like hypertension, gastrointestinal issues and acute illness like colds.\" Chaix sees positives and negatives with the changing medical landscape. The Affordable Care Act has cut community clinic numbers because now more people are covered by insurance, he said, but there are more opportunities to help the uninsured in the Hispanic community. Whatever happens, Chaix remains a strong advocate of the teaching and healing opportunities the clinics provide. \"Most of the students that choose NCNM do so based on the reputation we have that our clinical training is awesome, in great part due to the community clinics,\" he said. n Learn more about NCNM's Community Clinics: ncnm.edu/clinicBack in the Day: NCNM's Early Community Clinics CLINIC STAFF AT OUTSIDE IN (LEFT TO RIGHT) STUDENT DIANA HENSON; DR.
