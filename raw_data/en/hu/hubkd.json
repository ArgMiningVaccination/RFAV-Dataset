MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP Your Lymphoma Follow-up Schedule MEDICAL SIDE EFFECTS Radiation and/or Chemotherapy Surgery Side Effects Transplant Fertility and Pregnancy Fatigue Memory, Concentration and 'Chemo-Brain' RELAPSE GENETIC COUNSELING Part 2 : Information for Lymphoma Cancer Survivors After cancer treatment many survivors experience a wide range of emotions, thoughts and concerns both medical and otherwise. Excitement, for example, can be mixed with anxiety and uncertainty about your future. You may also have many questions about your health and other issues. This care plan will make this time of transition easier - helping you know what to expect in the months and years ahead. The information is specific to lymphoma survivors including details on medical follow-up, recurrence, and medical and non-medical side effects of cancer. Who Provides Care? Chang i ng health care providers once treatment is over can be challenging and unsettling. Many patients come to rely on their oncologist, for example, and are nervous about leaving his or her care. This transition is necessary, however, to ensure you are cared for in a timely manner. Depending on the situation, you may continue to see an oncologist for follow-up visits, but your long-term care should be managed by your local family doctor or nurse practitioner. Medical Follow-up Medic a l follow-up may include appointments with medical professionals, physical exams, and various tests (such as CBC and TSH levels). The main goal is to detect new or recurrent disease. Another goal is to determine the effectiveness of the treatments you have already had. The BC Cancer Agency recommends follow-up that depends on the type of lymphoma you were diagnosed with. In general, the BCCA guidelines for lymphoma cancer follow-up include: After treatment for malignant lymphoma, you should discuss your follow-up schedule with your oncologist and family physician. An example testing scheulde is every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually, though your doctor may recommend a different strategy. Breast and skin self-examinations should be performed regularly by yourself. You should keep your immunizations up to date. Preventative measures and/or recognition and treatment for late effects should be considered during follow-up appointments. Although the occurrence of long-term or late effects is rare for malignant lymphoma patients, follow-up schedules should take into consideration the risk of relapse, secondary neoplasms, infertility, hypothyroidism, and dental caries. Your L ymphoma Follow-up Schedule The schedule below is based on the BCCA lymphoma follow-up guidelines. The dates are a suggested timeline which your doctor may adjust to fit your needs. Procedure Recommended Schedule Year 1 Lymph node, abdominal, thyroid, and skin examination Every ___ months CBC, Alkaline Phosphatase, LDH Every ___ months Chest radiograph Every ___ months (if dis ease in thorax) TSH level Annually (if thyroid irradiated) Influenza immunization Annually Pneumococcal immunization Every 5 years Pap Smear and Mammography Annually Year 2 Lymph node, abdominal, thyroid, and skin examination Every ___ months CBC, Alkaline Phosphatase, LDH Every ___ months Chest radiograph Every ___ months (if disease in thorax) TSH level Annua l ly (if thyroid irradiated) Influenza immunization Annua l ly Pap Smear and Mammography Annually Year 3, 4 and 5 Lymph node, abdominal, thyroid, and skin examination Every ___ months CBC, Alkaline Phosphatase, LDH Every ___ months Chest radiograph Every ___ months (if di s ease in thorax) TSH level Annually (if thyroid irradiated) Influenza immunization Annually Pap Smear and Mammography Annually Beyond Lymph node, abdominal, thyroid, and skin examination CBC, Alkaline Phosphatase, LDH Chest Smear and Mammography Medica l Side Effects Treat m ent for cancer is rapidly changing. With the development of new medications and therapies, it is hard to keep up with all the long-term side effects. Further, every person is unique, as are the side effects that each will experience. Be an active participant in your care and share news of any changes in your health with a member of your health care team. This section covers common side effects. Treatment-Specific Side Effects: Most cancer patients and survivors experience mild, short-term side effects - rarely all of them. Here are some common side effects from different treatment types Radiation and/or Chemotherapy Heart There is a small risk of heart damage in patients receiving radiation to the heart or surrounding area. This risk is very low. Some forms of chemotherapy can also damage the heart. Your routine physical exams should include a cardiac exam. Brain Long-term effects of radiation to the brain are rare for adults, and more common in children. Most commonly this would present as problems with memory. Your doctor may want to organize testing and therapy with occupational or physical therapists. Spinal Cord Nerves can be damaged from certain chemotherapy and radiation protocols, including loss of strength, difficulty with coordination, bladder or bowel control, or paralysis. Bones of the spine can also be damaged by radiation therapy; new back pain should be analyzed by a doctor for spine curvature or fracture. Lungs A small number of patients receiving radiation therapy can develop breathlessness, fever, dry cough or chest pain due to scarring or inflammation of the lung. These symptoms can appear months to years after therapy and are usually temporary. Sometimes, however, they can become long-term side effects. Problems can be worse if you smoke or have asthma. If you develop a dry cough and fever after radiation, contact your radiation oncologist. It is suggested that patients keep up with regular influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Throat/Upper Airway If you received radiotherapy to your throat, scarring or swelling of the throat or upper airway may occur making breathing, swallowing and speaking more difficult. Worsened cough, coughing blood, significant weight loss and difficulty eating should be discussed with your health care team. Dehydration and other nutritional concerns may result and should be discussed with a certified dietitian. Thyroi d The thyroid gland, located in the neck below the voice box, can be damaged from a number of chemotherapy drugs or if you had radiation to that area. Patients that have received thyroid irradiation have a 50% chance of developing hypothyroidism. Thyroid damage can present as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), or thyroid nodules or tumours. Fatigue, drastic increase or decrease of weight, constipation, cold intolerance, anxiety, dry skin, brittle hair, and heart tremors, can all be signs of thyroid damage. If any of the above symptoms occur, TSH levels should be evaluated by your family doctor. Bones Radiation can, on rare occasion, cause bone damage in the area receiving therapy (such as ribs). Bones can thin and become more brittle with a slightly increased risk of rib fracture (about 1-2%). Permanent stiffness or arthritis can develop if radiation therapy is administered in the area around joints. Chest/Breast Receiving radiation to the chest may very slightly increase the risk of breast cancer to females, and less regularly males. Females who received chest radiotherapy (sometimes termed \"mantle radiotherapy\") at a young age are at an increased risk of breast cancer. The BCCA recommends annual mammograms 10 years after chest radiotherapy, or at the age of 40, whichever comes first. Annual breast and armpit tissue exams should be done for both males and females by a doctor. Skin The color and texture of skin can be affected by radiation therapy, as well as scarring and loss of hair to the affected region. Swelling and loss of flexibility in muscles under the skin can occur if irradiated. Vitamin E may help soothe skin discomfort. Sunscreen should be used for patients after receiving radiation. If cuts or wounds persist or may be infected, contact your doctor. Liver Some chemotherapy drugs can have a negative effect on your liver. Most liver toxicities resolve over time, but some can result in long-term liver problems such as liver failure or abnormal liver function. There may be no symptoms other than abnormal blood test results or the patient may experience yellowing of the skin or eyes, abdominal swelling, and/or weight gain. Kidney Decreased kidney function and high blood pressure may result from treatment-specific damage. Those patients with hypertension, diabetes and only one kidney are at greater risk of complications. Blood pressure and kidney function should be checked by a health professional annually. Bowel R adiation to the rectum, colon or small bowel may cause several late or lasting effects. Abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, weight loss, bloating, blood in stool, malnutrition, or abnormal urine passage with blood or air should be reported immediately to a doctor. The above symptoms may be a sign of fistula formation, ulceration or bleeding, chronic diarrhea, or scarring of the abdominal organs. Female Pelvis Long term changes to the vagina, uterus, ovaries and groin lymph nodes can result from cancer treatment to the pelvic area. Lubricants, Vitamin E, and physical therapy may aid some symptoms of damage to the pelvic region. Damage to the lymph nodes in the groin may result in swelling of the legs or genital region. If these symptoms, bleeding, pain, dryness or not returning menstrual periods 6 months after treatment, occur please contact your health care provider. Women who become pregnant after receiving treatment affecting the pelvis, should discuss this with their doctor as the chance of miscarriage, preterm labor and low birth weight infants is increased. Male Pelvis Lymph nodes may be damaged causing swelling in the genital area and legs, for which physical therapy may be useful. Erectile dysfunction has been known to occur in men who receive radiation to the pelvis. If either occurs, please discuss symptoms and treatment with your doctor. Total Body Irradiation There is a small chance that organs and glands of the head and neck are affected by low- dose total body irradiation. Dry mouth and increased risk of developing cavities can result from damage to the salivary glands; therefore, patients should have regular dental appointments. Ophthalmologists should be seen annually as patients are at increased risk of developing cataracts and experiencing dry eyes. Similar to effects described above, total body irradiation patients may have symptoms involving the thyroid gland, liver, kidneys, lungs, skin, and/or the reproductive organs. Total body irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy treatment increases one risk of developing a second cancer; therefore, patients should have careful follow-up by a doctor, including having regular colonoscopies and/or mammograms. Some chemotherapy drugs can cause specific side effects. For a listing of these side effects visit the BC Cancer Agency website specific to Chemotherapy Protocols. You can also look up specific drugs using the BC Cancer Agency Drug Index where you will find a handout on each drug listing cautions and side effects (see resources box below). Resources: www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/DrugDatabase/DrugIndexPt/default. h tm www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/TypesofCancer/Lymphomas.htm www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/ChemotherapyProtocols/Lymphoma/default.htm Surger y Side Effects : Splenectomy The spleen is removed during a spelenctomy, an organ that acts to filter certain bacteria and dead red blood cells out of the blood stream. Patients having undergone a splenectomy are at increased risk of developing infections that can progress rapidly to sepsis. Therefore patients should seek immediate medical attention if experiencing signs of infection, such as a fever, and should report to medical staff that they have had a splenectomy. Patients should also discuss the need for scheduled vaccinations with doctors. Hernia, change in bowel patterns, and bowel obstructions are all uncommon side effects of a splenectomy. Lymph Node Removal Lymph node removal surgeries may result in lymphedema in the area near to where the lymph nodes were removed. For more information please see the section below on lymphedema. Nerves in the area of surgery can be damaged resulting in pain, decreased sensation, numbness and/or tingling. Radiation therapy may aggravate these effects. Contact your doctor if you feel you may have nerve damage. Lymphedema Lymphedema is a swelling of the hand, arm, leg, foot, neck, face or other region caused by the surgical removal of lymph nodes or by radiation near the affected area. Lymphedema is usually mild and develops slowly months to years after treatment. This side effect can make daily activities difficult. You may experience stiffness and awkwardness in your hand and arm, for example, that limits your ability to get dressed or prepare food. Those at risk of developing lymphedema should consider exercise or wearing compression garments. Consult your doctor before commencing any exercise routine, and be sure to start with low intensity movements. Sign of lymphedema may include changes in the skin, discomfort, movement difficulty, and heavy feeling in the area, or nearby limb, where surgery occurred. Once lymphedema occurs it rarely goes away, but can be managed. There are many ways to lessen the condition. Reducing your risk of lymphedema: Maint a ining a healthy body weight is suggested as obesity increases the risk for developing lymphedema Avoid injections in, and having your blood pressure taken from the affected arm Keep the skin on your arm clean and avoid injuring your arm Use a compression garment for the affected area during strenuous exercise and while lifting heavy weights Enjoy massage therapy Specia l safety measures should be taken with the affected area as it can be prone to infection. Transplant Autol o gous Bone Marrow or Stem Cell Transplant Autologous transplants utilize the patient's own cells allowing the use of very high doses of chemotherapy agents to treat the cancer while decreasing damage to the patient's bone marrow. Risks of this type of treatment are lower than for allogeneic transplant but are still relevant: lung complications, decreased kidney function, dental problems, and/or changes in hormone production. Patients that have received an autologous transplant should participate in healthy lifestyle practices, such as smoking cessation and exercise, to decrease their risk of cardiac complications. Survivors are at an increased risk of having diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack, high cholesterol, blood clots and other artery-related diseases. Allogeneic Bone Marrow, Cord Blood or Stem Cell Transplant Allogeneic transplants involve the use of blood stem cells of a donor to allow the use of strong chemotherapy doses that will likely destroy bone marrow as well as to promote a functional immune response. Because of the high dose of chemotherapy used to treat certain patients, side effects may be increased and should be discussed with your cancer care team. If total body irradiation was used in preparation for the transplant, please refer to the section above for side effects of that procedure. As the side effects of allogeneic transplantation can be complicated, be sure to thoroughly discuss and take notes of these effects with your transplant team. It is not recommended to visit other health care professional in the first 3 months after transplant as the risk of infection is highest. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) or long-term immunosuppressive agents may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and stroke, heart attack and other vascular problems. Tips to prevent infection: Wear gl oves when cleaning and gardening. Use an electric razor if you shave. Keep your skin clean and dry, use moisturizing cream daily to keep skin supple. Cut your nails with nail clippers instead of scissors and never push back or cut cuticles. Treat even small scrapes and cuts with antiseptic and keep the injuries clean until they are healed. See your doctor at the first sign of infection (i.e. area feels warm and tender). Avoid sunburns and too much time in the sun. Do not use insect repellents containing DEET as this may be harmful to sensitive skin. Instead, use a repellent with natural ingredients like citronella. Do not apply repellent to any skin that will be under your compression sleeve as this can cause irritation. Healthy lifestyle choices are important to help avoid many adverse effects of allogeneic transplantation. Pulmonary, oral, hormone, visual, osteoporosis and/or kidney issues are not uncommon for allogeneic transplant patients, therefore proper follow-up is important. As this can be complicated, be sure to discuss thoroughly with your transplant team and your primary care physician. Fertility and Pregnancy Some cancer treatments affect a woman's reproductive capabilities. Surgery to remove the ovaries or radiation to the pelvis or brain, for example, can cause early menopause. Chemotherapy can also cause early menopause and resulting infertility. Chemotherapy drugs that are strongly linked to infertility are: cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, vinca alkaloids, and bortezomib. Becoming pregnant once you have completed anti-cancer treatments does not increase your risk of cancer recurring. You should be aware that some women are more likely to have low birth weight babies, miscarriages or preterm deliveries after treatment. Please discuss this with your doctor. What are some symptoms of infertility? Some survivors do not realize that their fertility has been affected until they find they are unable to get pregnant. The following are some symptoms of infertility. If you experience any of these symptoms, it does not always mean that you are infertile. They can also be caused by other medical conditions. Resources: www.livestrong.org/Get-Help/Learn-About-Cancer/Cancer-Su p port-Topics/Physical- Effects-of-Cancer/Female-Infertility For more information on fertility and pregnancy after treatment see appendix A Resources: http://leukemiabmtprogram.org/patients_and_family/di sease s/lymphoma/index.html Talk to your doctor if: Your p eriod cycles are not regular You are having hot flashes You have been trying but are unable to get pregnant You have had several miscarriages Fatigu e Fatigue is one of the more common side effects of cancer treatment. Friends and family may expect your energy levels to return to normal once treatment is over. You, however, may feel exhausted a while after treatment. Fatigue can have many causes and you should be aware of changes in your energy level. If you experience new or worsening symptoms talk them over with your doctor. Fatigue can also be caused by dehydration, diarrhea, anemia, fever, infection, nausea, vomiting, pain and depression. To help manage your fatigue, try planning your days in advance and avoid hectic schedules. If you are going to have a full day, be sure to set time aside to eat and rest between activities. Light exercise can also help improve energy levels and enhance your quality of life. Sudden or severe fatigue can be caused by an infection or it could be due to the cancer treatment you received. If you suffer from this type of serious fatigue, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Memory, Concentration and 'Chemo-Brain' Serious memory or concentration problems are less common side effects of cancer treatment. Many survivors do notice minor changes, however, the sources of which are various. Chemotherapy, for example, can directly affect your brain causing lapses in memory and concentration - 'Chemo Brain'. Such problems can also be due to the fatigue and stress caused by the cancer treatments. In rare cases, they can also be a sign of a more serious problem, such as the spread of your cancer, and should be discussed with your doctor. Possib le Causes of Memory Problems and 'Chemo Brain': Medications Chemotherapy drugs that weaken your immune system (Immunosuppressive drugs), antibiotics, steroids, pain management drugs, nausea/vomiting drugs, and other cancer- related symptoms can affect your thinking and memory causing symptoms of 'Chemo Brain'. Metabolic Problems Certain cancers produce hormones that affect the brain. The thyroid gland, if it is not working properly, can affect thinking and memory and cause a depressed mood. If the liver or kidneys are not functioning right, toxins can build up in the blood and lessen mental sharpness. Unhealthy Diet The lack of a well balanced, healthy diet also contributes to memory and concentration problems. Symptoms of Memory/Thinking Problems in Cancer: Diffic ulty understanding complex information Easily distracted Exhausted by tasks requiring mental energy \"Chemo Brain\" represents a lack of clear thought: Not remembering what you are talking about Forgetting what you are doing Forgetting phone numbers that you could recite easily before treatment Asking questions only to repeat them 15 minutes later For information and tips on memory & concentration see Appendix B Potential Treatment Related Side-Effects My current side effects My side effect management plan 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Relaps e In ge n eral 20% to 80% of lymphoma patients relapse. This figure depends on the stage, histological subtype, and bulk of presentation. Therefore patients and health care providers should be aware of changes to, or abnormalities of, lymph node sites previously involved in the diagnosis. What is the chance I will have a relapse? Your oncologist will evaluate your risk for recurrence which depends on factors such as your age, the stage of your cancer, sex, certain level readings and/or markers, and the treatment you received. Discuss these risks with your oncologist. Signs and Symptoms of Recurrence If you experience the following general symptoms, discuss them with your family doctor. Fatigue Shortness of breath Abdominal swelling Unusual pain in abdomen or back Itchiness on the trunk of the body Persistent fever Unexplained weight loss Severe night sweats Signs and Symptoms to Watch for and When to Seek Advice Sign/Symptom Who to Contact 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Geneti c Counseling Some t umors are considered as hereditary cancer meaning they can be passed down from family member to family member. Talk with your doctor about hereditary cancer and whether genetic testing is needed for you or your family. The following criteria indicate the possibility of a hereditary cancer: Multiple cancers in a single individual Clustering of the same cancer type in close relatives Cancers occurring in multiple generations of a family Occurrence of rare tumors Geographic or ethnic populations known to be at high risk of hereditary cancers Resources: www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/Prevention/Hereditary/Default.htm Resources Follow up Lymphoma - www.lymphoma.ca/ Part 3 : Quality of Life and Healthy Living After Cancer Table of Contents LIVING BEYOND CANCER Stress, Anxiety and Depression FINANCIAL INFORMATION RETURNING TO WORK FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS SPIRITUALITY HEALTHY EATING Bowel Changes Fatigue Eating Guidelines Supplements (Vitamins, minerals, and herbal pills and powders) PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Physical Activity Journal SUN EXPOSURE TOBACCO USE ALCOHOL Part 3 : Quality of Life and Healthy Living After Cancer This s ection includes information on factors that affect your quality of life including the emotional and psychological effects of cancer and cancer treatment and lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Additional information on this subject is included in the resource section. Living Beyond Cancer You fi nally made it. You finished your treatment and are ready to continue with your life. Many patients and their loved ones expect life to return to normal. This expectation, however, sometimes brings disappointment. You have just gone through a physically, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually changing experience and the idea of life returning to the way it was before your diagnosis may be unrealistic. As time passes, your side effects and symptoms will lessen and you will be able to start returning to a more normal routine. It is important for you, and for those around you, to realize, however, that this takes time and not to expect that you will feel wonderful right away. You may want to ponder the journey you have just completed and how this finds you in a new situation. You may have to make some changes to daily living, work or how you spend your free time, but this is not necessarily a bad move. You are not alone and there are many resources and support services to help. Stress, Anxiety and Depression Stress Stress can affect you in many different ways - physically, emotionally and/or behaviorally. Review the list of symptoms below and ask yourself if any are having a negative effect on your life? When they affect your day-to-day living, you need to seek professional help. Physical Emotional Behavioral Muscle tension Cold sweaty hands Facial ticks Fatigue Tension headaches Indigestion High blood pressure Heart palpitations Back pain Jaw tension Nervous stomach Nausea Diarrhea Teeth grinding Appetite change Anxiety Fear Irritability Hopelessness Helplessness Impatience Depression Nervousness Feeling overwhelmed Loss of concentration Anger Sadness Disbelief Indifference Frustration Change in appetite Sleep disturbance Forgetfulness Physical violence Decline in productivity Social withdrawal Indecisiveness Misuse of alcohol-drugs Misuse of caffeine Misuse of tobacco Use of addictive methods of coping such as: Gambling Hoarding Excessive spending Exchan ge your Stresses Understanding the types of stress you are faced with can help you handle them better. For example, you may be able to deal with your stress level by \"exchanging stresses\". This means that you rank your stresses (make a list of your top 5 or 10) so that you are dealing with the most important ones. Ask yourself 'What is one thing on this list I can take care of today? What steps can I take to remove this stress from my list?' Decide on a step you can take to remove a stressor. This will help to avoid piling up all of your stresses until you are unable to cope. Sometimes the process of listing stressors also helps one to organize and de-stress. Develop a \"Tool Box\" for Dealing with Stress Once you have identified the types of stress in your life, you can begin to try different ways of dealing with them. These can then become part of a 'tool box' that you go to for help during times of stress. What are some of the common ways you already use to cope? New tools might include deep breathing and active relaxation. Learning about ways to reduce stress means that you can use these tools whenever you need to. You will learn what works best for you and to seek help from others when needed. Anxiety Ongoing physical problems associated with cancer can result in anxiety. Anxiety often stems from feelings of loss of control, feeling alone and/or uncertain about your health. These feelings can be handled by using helpful tools and seeking support when needed. Feelings of anxiety during treatment usually continue into survivorship despite the belief that when treatment is over the anxiety will lessen. Situations like returning to work and dealing with health benefits details are sources of anxiety for many survivors. We all experience anxiety at some time in our lives and there are ways to reduce and manage it. Identifying anxiety is the first step. From there, you can learn the cause of your anxiety and decide on ways to cope. Counseling, support groups and relaxation techniques can also be helpful. Anti-anxiety medication may be another option to talk over with your health care team. Managing your Anxiety Learning about the causes of your anxiety is the first step to help you to manage that which makes you feel anxious. Try keeping a diary of moments when your anxiety level increases so that you can measure your improvement. You may need to talk with a counsellor at the beginning. Try methods like deep breathing, muscle relaxation and others until you find what works for you. Sadness Your views on how your family is affected by your cancer or whether you will be able to return to your old job may create feelings of sadness. It is important to work through your emotions and express them rather than keeping them to yourself. Identify supportive people in your life whom you feel will be helpful in sorting through your emotions with you. For more information on w a ys to deal with stress see Appendix C Depress ion Depression is an affliction different from sadness. The duration is longer and the symptoms are different and more serious. You may experience any number of these symptoms. Depression can reduce your quality of life. The stage at which you were diagnosed with cancer and treatment you received both have an effect on your risk of depression. If you feel any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a counsellor to learn how you can better manage them. You may just need someone to talk with who will help you explore your emotions and provide suggestions to help you cope.

(2011) Breast Cancer Survivor to Financial Survivor Rural and Remote. www.cbcn.ca/index.php?pageaction=content.page&id=6582&la n g=en Return ing to Work For s o me cancer survivors, returning to work offers the opportunity to resume 'normal' routines, to be back in control, to focus on other challenges, and to reconnect with friends and co-workers. Deciding When to Return to Work: Discuss with your health care team when would be best for you to return to work. The ideal time is unique to each individual. If your job is physically demanding, stressful or increases your chance for infection - such as nursing or child care - you may need to wait for a longer time before returning. Before Planning a Return to Work: 1. Discuss the physical and mental challenges you may experience with a health care professional and have that professional write a letter for your employer outlining the situation including possible solutions. 2. Discuss your follow-up care with a health care professional including how it may affect your ability to do your job. 3. Discuss flexibility and options with your employer including employee assistance programs, transitional plans and extended medical coverage. You can also ask for help from the human resources department, the return to work coordinator, union representative, and insurance vocational rehabilitation consultant if available. Once at Work: Once you have returned to work, you may face challenges that did not affect you before your diagnosis. Do not ignore these difficulties as your body may need more time to recover. Be sure to: 1. Take small breaks throughout the day and be realistic about your workload. Try not to be overwhelmed with work tasks. 2. Eat a healthy diet. 3. Know what time of day you have the most energy and adjust your routine and meetings to fit. 4. Be sure to book your follow-up medical appointments near the end of the day or the work week so that you have time to recover before returning to work. 5. Discuss any challenges with your employer including potential solutions. 6. Track employment issues. Although employment discrimination rarely happens to cancer survivors, be sure to protect yourself. A helpful resource is the BC Human Rights Coalition, www.bchrcoalition.org If yo u would like information, support and counseling related to remaining or returning to work call the Provincial BC Cancer Agency Vocational Rehabilitation Counsellor at 1-800- 663-3333 extension 672189. Family Relationships You m a y need to work at rebuilding your relationships with those who supported you during your cancer journey particularly if you feel less close than before diagnosis. In many cases, family members do not talk about the effects of the treatment in effort to protect their loved ones. It is important that you talk openly about your experience. This will help bring back the closeness of your relationships so that you can work towards recovery together. The BC Cancer Agency Patient and Family Counseling are also available at 1-800- 663-3333 extension 2194 and in Prince George at 1-250-645-7330 . Spirituality Cance r may leave you with a new outlook on life. You might find yourself searching for meaning and wanting to make the best of the time you have. There are many ways to bring new meaning to your life and to help make sense of what you have gone through. Some people find their religion or faith helpful in this regard while others prefer to volunteer their time for various causes. You may decide to change your own priorities or try new activities like meditation or expressing yourself through art. Recovery includes making our experiences a part of who we are and who we have become. How to move forward every day: Be ho n est and caring with each other, laugh often Keep a regular time and place or outing when you don't discuss cancer Talk about each other's goals and dreams Find ways to exercise together Relax together and do activities that you both enjoy Try something new Resources: Empowe r (2010).

After a diagnosis of lymphoma, and its treatment, it may take some time for your energy level to improve and for symptoms you may have had to get better. You might find that some symptoms do not fully get better and that you have to use longer- term solutions to manage them. Use these eating tips and tools to help improve your health and help you in your recovery from treatment. These tips may help manage the symptoms from lymphoma as well suggest foods to try if eating is difficult for you. This section also describes an eating pattern that aims to improve your health and manage other health conditions. That is because eating well also is important to keep you healthy and help to prevent or better manage other common diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. A healthy diet can also help you achieve or maintain a healthy weight. In addition, early research shows that lifestyle factors that you can control or modify such as diet, smoking, body weight and exercise can help to reduce your risk of recurrence. There are several websites listed at the end to help you find more help if needed. Managing Common Symptoms You may have had several side effects from your cancer treatment. Most of these symptoms will slowly improve over time after treatment is finished, but it can take weeks or months. Each person is different. Common symptoms that can last for a long time include fatigue, changes to normal bowel habits, problems with chewing or swallowing, and changes in appetite and body weight. In this section, you will find tips to help with some of the most common symptoms you may be faced with after treatment. Changes in Appetite Changes to your appetite are common during cancer treatment. Some people find that their appetite can vary and doesn't return to normal for quite some time. If your appetite is less than normal or you have difficu l ty maintaining a healthy weight Stay hydrated with high calorie and high protein fluids o Smo o thies, milkshakes, and nutritional supplement drinks Choose foods that pack a lot of calories o Avocados, nuts and seeds and nut butters (such as peanut, cashew or almond), Greek yogurts, cottage cheese, and eggs Eat more when your appetite is at its best o If you feel best in the morning, have a bigger meal at that time Take the stress out of making meals by enjoying simple meals, using more ready- to-eat foods or making meals in advance and freezing portions. If you can, have friends and family help with grocery shopping, making meals or clean up. Make mealtimes fun o Eat with others and try new recipes Weigh t loss Some people lose weight during cancer treatment due to factors such as changes in appetite or factors that make eating more challenging such as a sense of taste, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. If you lost weight and were not trying to, now is a good time to look at how your diet can help you return to a healthy weight. Physical activity can help to manage stress and build muscle. Excess activity, however, can make it difficult to return to a normal weight. See your doctor if you are not able to maintain your weight. You may need help with symptoms or to be seen regularly by a dietitian. Weight gain Your body weight may have changed since your diagnosis. Unwanted weight gain is common in some cancer survivors and may also result in changes to your body composition such as an increase in fat mass and a loss of muscle mass. The cause of weight gain is unclear but likely results from a number of factors that create a change in eating habits or physical activity levels such as an increase in appetite, fatigue. At times weight gain is associated with the use of some medications or can occur if you have just stopped smoking. Weight gain may result from other factors such as fluid weight gain. Now may be a good If your Appetite is Increased or you have food cravings H ormonal changes, medications, change in your daily routine and stress can cause your appetite to increase. For some people, this can also cause food cravings. Fill up on healthy choices o fruit and yogurt, veggies and dip, or hummus and pita Savor small portions of foods you are craving o Over-restricting can lead to over-eating Be mindful of why you are eating o Listen to your body's hunger cues Strategies Eat a t regular times during the day o Even if you don't feel hungry or like eating much, try to eat something. It will help create a routine Make every sip count o 100% fruit juice, milk, smoothies and milkshakes give you fluid and calories Choose healthy protein choices o Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts, cheese and yogurt are all good choices Choose healthy fats o Fats that are liquid at room temperature, such as vegetables oils, are better for heart health o Nuts and seeds are good sources of healthy fat time t o think about how to make changes in your eating habits to attain a healthy body weight. Achieving a healthy body weight is one of the most important steps to take for people who have had cancer to improve overall health, manage other health conditions and possibly decrease risk of cancer recurrence. See \"Health Canada's BMI online calculator\" in the Resources section below to find out if you are at a healthy body weight. Some people lose weight without trying after their cancer diagnosis and may find it difficult to maintain their weight. Others may gain weight or be at a stable but increased body weight. Weight loss is not easy for many people. Even if you cannot get your body weight within a healthy range, any amount of weight loss can still have health benefits for people who are overweight. As well, physical activity can help you meet your weight goals. Being physically active is also one of the best ways to keep unwanted weight off and maintain your goal weight. Strategies Choos e fibre-rich vegetables and fruits often such as peas, leafy greens, raspberries, pears, oranges and dried fruit o Eat them whole instead of as juice o Keep the skin on potatoes, sweet potatoes, and fruits with edible peels Quench your thirst with water Choose whole grain breads and cereals o Look for 100% whole grain as the first ingredient Limit portions of high calorie foods o Have only small portions of regular or high-fat dairy products, fried foods, store bought baking, desserts and convenience foods Keep Track o Keep a record of your food intake to help you stay on track o See \"EATracker\" in the Resources Section below for a free online tool Bowel Changes It is common to notice changes in your bowel habits during and after cancer treatment. After treatment, most people eventually settle into a new routine that may not be the same as before. Loose stools and constipation are two of the most common changes in bowel habits. Constipation Hard stool or trouble having bowel movements may be a problem for you. As well, physical activity can also help to manage constipation. Some people need to take medication to manage their bowels. If these tips are not helpful for you, speak with your doctor for more help. Loose stools If you had loose stools after surgery or during treatment, this may be a symptom you need to learn to manage. Surgery, radiation to certain regions and some medication can cause loose stools. Here are some tips to help you manage: Drink 8-10 cups of fluid daily o Limit drinks with caffeine such as colas, coffee, or energy drinks Choose lower fibre fruits and vegetables o Fruits: peeled apples and peaches, bananas, melons and grapes o Vegetables: potato (no skin), asparagus, tomato, mushroom and zucchini Choose grain products that are low in fibre o Look for less than 2 grams of fibre per serving on the Nutrition Facts panel. Choose lower fat choices that are bland and not fried Here are some tips to help you manage: Drink 8-10 cups of fluid daily o Warm fluids such as hot water, tea, or coffee can be helpful Choose higher fibre fruits and vegetables o Fruits: berries, raisins, prunes, dates, pears o Vegetables: beans, peas, leafy green vegetables and broccoli Choose grain products that are high in fibre o Look for 'whole grain' or 'whole wheat' at the start of the ingredients list Fatigu e Fatigue is possibly the most common side effect among people recovering from a diagnosis of cancer or its treatment. It can take months or even years for you to feel like your energy level is closer to what is normal for you. In some cases your level of energy may vary and may improve, but may not completely return to normal for a number of reasons. As well, physical activity can help to manage fatigue. If you have other symptoms that make it difficult to eat enough, or you find it hard to keep your weight stable, talk to your doctor. Here are some tips if your energy level is affecting your eating: Look for easy-to-make choices when food shopping o Deli's often carry cut up fruit or vegetables, salads and to-go foods Soft and easy to chew foods take less energy to eat o Soups, stews, baked vegetable dishes and starches like rice or pasta Ask for help o Those who may have helped you out during your treatment are likely still able to, they just may not know you still need help o Some communities have meals-on-wheels type services that can bring a hot meal to your home for a reasonable price o Some grocery stores may deliver Eating Guidelines If you do not have symptoms that make eating difficult and you are able to keep your weight stable, there are eating guidelines that are good for your health and may reduce risk of cancer recurrence. There has been a lot of research on diet and cancer prevention, but not as much on the role of diet in preventing cancer recurrence. Early research suggests that the same dietary patterns that reduce risk of cancer may also help to prevent it from coming back. These guidelines are for cancer prevention but are also appropriate for reducing risk of cancer recurrence and are good for overall health: Supplements (Vitamins, minerals, and herbal pills and powders) Many cancer survivors may want to know more about supplements and the role that these products may have in their health. Research that has looked at whether supplements are helpful for people who have had cancer has shown that supplements do not reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and, in fact, some may be harmful. It is best to get your nutrition through food. Information on supplements is easy to find on the internet, though not all of it is reliable. If you are looking for more information about supplements, please see the \" CAMEO Links\" in the Resources section. If you have concerns that you are lacking in a nutrient, speak with your doctor or dietitian. Doctors can order tests to check if a nutrient is low in your blood. Dietitians can talk to you about your diet to see if you are getting enough of the nutrients your body needs. 1. Be as lean as possible without being underweight 2. Be p hysically active as part of everyday life 3. Limit energy-dense foods (such as processed or fast foods) and sugary drinks (pop and sweetened juices or drinks) 4. Favor vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and lentils 5. Limit red meat (includes beef, pork, lamb, and goat) and avoid processed meat (smoked, cured or salted) 6. If consumed, limit alcohol intake to no more than 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women 7. Limit salt intake by avoiding salt-preserved or salty foods 8. Aim to meet nutritional needs through diet alone. Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention. Physica l Activity Physi c al activity is an important part of healthy living. It can improve how your body works, build your strength and fitness, and add to your quality of life. It can also help you better manage symptoms and reduce anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Further, physical activity can help with stress and weight management and improve your body image. Check with your doctor before increasing your physical activity. If you have anemia (low blood count), a weakened immune system, or problems with nerves that affect your balance, you may need to take special precautions. You should be aware that pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory medications, can mask pain related to physical activity. Injuries should be taken seriously and looked after right away. When beginning any form of physical activity, consider your starting level and set a timeframe with short and long-term goals. Exercise for Health recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity physical activity (e.g., jogging). The total minutes should be spread over at least 3 days per week (e.g., 3 days for 50 minutes or 5 days for 30 minutes of brisk walking). People who have been inactive for some time, however, should start with 10 minutes per day (or less) and increase as their fitness improves. As your fitness improves, you can increase your activity 10 minutes at a time. Measure your level of exertion based on your breathing. In moderate exercise, you should be able to talk in full sentences but not be able to sing. In vigorous exercise, you will only be able to talk in short phrases if at all. If you feel that you are working hard, you probably are. It is important to listen to your body and be aware of your how much it can take. Exercise and Healthy Living You might find yourself anxious to return to good health after treatment. The recommendations for cancer survivors are the same as those for anyone wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. Small changes such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or walking a few blocks instead of driving, are great ways to introduce more activity into your routine. Make sure you get your doctor's okay before starting an exercise program. Research indicates that exercise benefits the heart, lungs and other organ systems and may help to reduce the risk of cancer and possibly its recurrence. Ease into any new routines to allow your body to adjust. This will also ensure that the changes become a part of your life and not just a phase. Benefits of Exercise: Impro v ed sense of well-being, mood and self-esteem May speed up recovery and possibly lower chance of recurrence Improved strength, endurance, muscle and bone strength Increased life expectancy Decreased depression, anxiety and fatigue Decreased symptoms of menopause and arthritis Strengthening The l e ngth of time after surgery that will be safe for you to begin strengthening will vary based on the type of surgery received. Some people may be ready at 4-6 weeks, some may take up to 8 weeks. Discuss with your doctor when you can begin strengthening. Start with light weights, 1-2 pounds and gradually work your way up to 5-10 pounds. Start with the muscle group you feel most comfortable with doing 8-12 repetitions in one set about two times per week and step by step involve all major muscle groups. Whatever form of strength training you choose, the recommended guidelines are at least 2 days per week. Try to incorporate flexibility and stretching of the major muscle groups and tendons after your strength training as much as possible. Many other strengthening exercises exist and are highlighted in the online resource provided below, the Exercise for Health Guidebook is specific for breast cancer survivors (although the recommendations can be applied to other cancer types), and includes helpful tips, for example, goal-setting. Home and yard duties are also strengthening activities. Heavy weight training is anything more than 10 lbs. You should wear a compression garmet to reduce swelling if you have lympedema. You can buy these at medical equipment stores or pharmacies where trained staff will ensure you are fitted properly. If you experience swelling of the fingers while wearing your sleeve (if applicable), you may also require a glove or gauntlet which can likely be purchased at the same store where you bought your sleeve.

Skin that has been radiated may remain sensitive to the sun after radiation treatment has ended. Tobacco Use Tobacco use (including smoking and chewing tobacco) is the singl e most preventable cause of death, disease and disability. All tobacco users have a higher risk of numerous chronic diseases and tobacco use is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. The harmful effects of smoking on health is widely known and there are several programs to help you quit. If you smoke , please ask your doctor for help in quitting. Provincial programs (British Columbia) exist to provide you with different stop smoking products free of charge. Visit www.health.gov.bc.ca/pharmacare/stop -smoking/ Northern Health Tobacco Reduction Program - visit: www.northernhealth.ca/YourHealth/PublicHealth/SchoolYouthHealth/TobaccoReductionPr ogram.aspx Alcohol As the amount of alcohol a person drinks increases, the risk of developing cancer increases. Moderate alcohol consumption can even be good for your heart. To determine wheth er you should avoid alcohol completely, talk with your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks for your individual health needs. To reduce your risk of cancer, limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Women are recommended to limit alcohol to less than one dr ink per day. Men should have less than two drinks per day. One drink is considered to be: 350mL (12 oz) bottle of beer - at 5% alcohol 45mL (1.5oz) of spirits - at 40% alcohol 145mL (5oz) glass of wine - at 12% alcohol Be Sun Smart: Use sunscreen of at least SPF15. Check the expiry date on the bottle as old sunscreen will not protect you from sun damage Re-apply at least every two hours or after swimming or sweating Seek shade especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Cover yourself with clothing and wear a hat If you are outdoors on a sunny day in the winter, you still need sunscreen Healthy Living After Cancer Lifestyle change suggestions (ie. quit smoking, weight management) Suggested Programs 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence to suggest that your cancer treatment will affect your children. We recommend, however, that you wait two years after diagnosis as that is a period of greater risk for the cancer to return and speak with your health care team. B. Tips on Memory & Concentration Both d aily mental and physical activity will increase memory and other mental functions. Training your brain by reading, doing puzzles, learning new skills and hobbies all help to strengthen your brain (think of it as mental housekeeping - unused brain power will collect 'dust'). Physical activity is also important as it increases your blood flow and triggers muscle groups and their various control centers in the brain. You can cope better with symptoms of memory and concentration by making sure you are well rested, paying attention, organized and writing reminder notes. Support groups can also help by learning of others' experiences by sharing your own. C. Ways t o Deal with Stress Start the day by putting yourself on your To-Do list. Make you a priority! Spend time doing the activities you love or try volunteering for a cause you believe in. Deep breathing and active relaxation are healthy and helpful techniques for dealing with stre ss. Deep Breathing Use deep breathing for a calming effect before an event that makes you anxious. Deep breathing is a simple and effective way to relieve tension and increase comfort. It can make you more comfortable if you are experiencing episodes of pain, fatigue or nausea. This method can be used before you go to bed to help ease you into a restful sleep. You can practice deep breathing anywhere. Muscle Relaxation By learning how to relax your muscles, you can actively l ower your blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate. Progressive muscle relaxation is the tensing and then relaxing of each muscle group of the body, one group at a time. In a comfortable position, breathe slowly taking deep breaths. The idea is to tense one muscle group at a time and hold for 5-10 seconds (if a part of the body is painful or tender, do not tense in that area). Release the tension and stay relaxed for 10-20 seconds. You can tense the areas of the body in any order and as much as you like. There are also tapes available that can guide you through this process. Examples of this method: clench hands into fists, flex biceps, tense abdomen, eyes (close tight, hold, and release), and arch your back to name a few. Deep breathing technique: 1. Place yourself in a comfortable position with legs and arms uncrossed 2. Take the palm of one hand on your chest; place the other on your abdomen 3. Breathe normally. Notice how your hands rise and fall with your breathing 4. Picture your stomach as a balloon as you do this 5. Concentrate on breathing from your stomach silently keeping count 6. Say to yourself 'relax' each time you exhale Try to practice this method for 5 minutes every day D. Self E steem Low se l f-esteem can have a negative effect on all aspects of your quality of life. People who think poorly of themselves for long periods of time can still make simple changes to improve their self esteem. Here are four steps to start recovering your positive sense of self. Thoug h t processes that are counterproductive: All-or-nothing thinking . Pass or fail style of thinking. : \"If I can't do this, I am a complete failure\". Mental Filtering perceiving only the bad side of every situation: \"I mad e a mistake and now everyone will think I'm incompetent\". Converting positives into negatives. You are unable to accept compliments or achie v ements: \"I only succeeded because it wasn't hard to do\". Jumping to negative conclusions. In the absence of any evidence, you still reach a negat i ve conclusion: \"My friend didn't return my call so they must be mad at me for something I did\". Mistaking feelings for facts Confusing your own opinion with facts: \"I feel useless th erefore I am useless\". Self put-downs. Combination of overreacting to a situation and underval u ing yourself: \"I am not worthy of succeeding\". Step 1: Identify the main sources What lo wers your self-esteem? A troubling environment at work or home? Problems in certain relationships? Once you identify the root of the problem you can start targeting your action plan for success. Step 2: Awareness of your inner voice Pay a t tention to your inner voice as you come across situations which make you say negative things about yourself. You will need to decide if you are being reasonable or if you are thinking about it in an unrealistic way. Were you thinking about any positive points or was your inner conversation mostly negative? Step 3: Challenge negative or unrealistic thoughts The f i rst thought that comes to your mind in these situations needs to be checked as to whether it makes sense. Your though process may be so set that it will be difficult at first. You need to question whether your view of situations that leave you with thoughts that lower your self -esteem are based on facts or just your own opinion. Step 4: Changing the way you evaluate yourself Now t h at you have identified the root of your self-esteem issues, your increased awareness of your inner voice and negative thought processes, it is time to start taking a positive outlook. Though t processes that are realistic and constructive: Hopeful statements. Treat yourself how you would treat others. If you feel c onfident you are capable of the task at hand, you are more likely to succeed: \"This isn't easy, but I can do it\". Forgive yourself. Nobody is perfect and mistakes happen, but he or sh e sho uldn't change your opinion of yourself: \"I didn't do it right the first time, but that doesn't mean I am incapable of getting it right the second time\". Avoid unrealistic goals. If you are constantly placing demands on yourself a nd ot hers that are not possible, you are only setting yourself up to fail. Focus on the positive. If you doubt your abilities and self-worth, remind yours elf of your accomplishments and other aspects of your life of which you are appreciative. Re-label upsetting thoughts. If your inner voice is saying you can't do something, th i nk of a way to change the situation to make it more manageable: \"How can I make this less stressful?\" Encourage yourself. You need to compliment yourself. If you feel that somet h ing went well, take a moment to acknowledge yourself and use it to inspire your next task. Don't feel discouraged if you need to return to step one. Do this as often as you need to. Habits can be hard to break, but if you work at it, you will notice your self-esteem begin to improve and benefit from increased confidence in all aspects of your life. If you are unable to resolve self-esteem issues on your own, or if your self-esteem interferes with your daily functioning, seek professional help. E.
