Pressenza: Thank you very much Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 for this interview, in which we want to start by asking you what is the IHWC? Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Fr\u00edas: The International Humanist White Circle (IHWC) was originally called the International Humanist White Cross, devoted to public health and personal and social development. It was born as a social project of volunteers from Dominican Republic and Haiti. Back in 2014, it changed its name and is currently being organised and developed in several countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, promoting and incorporating programs in health, nutrition, natural medicine, medicinal plants, training, dissemination on social networks, and both social and personal development. Facing this global crisis of COVID-19, the CBHI is working intensely so that the natural medicine known as CDS or Chlorine Dioxide promoted by the German scientist Andreas Kalcker is recognised, as well as medicinal plants highly studied by the farmer Josep P\u00e0mies, the Catalan specialist in this matter, as a health benefit and as a method of curing diseases. Pressenza: What is Chlorine Dioxide or CDS? MJF: \"Chlorine dioxide\" is a substance that provides oxygen to tissues and all body fluids, activating the mitochondria of cells, which in turn generate more energy that allows the body to recover. Like blood, chlorine dioxide releases oxygen when it is acidic, either from lactic acid or from the acidity of the pathogen. Its therapeutic effect is due, among others causes, to the fact that it helps cure many types of disease by creating an alkaline environment, while eliminates acidic pathogens. Chlorine dioxide eliminates viruses, bacteria, and fungi through a selective oxidation process in a very short period of time. Our body gets its energy from combustion. For this combustion, oxygen is essential, without it there is no energy and without energy there is no health or life. In order to obtain energy, we burn sugars, fats and proteins from our diet. Nutrition is, therefore, one of the most important points to take into account when we want to be healthy. Hippocrates, the founder of medicine, said: \"Let food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.\" Diseases are caused by poor eating habits, the environment and lifestyle. This can result in cancer. A healthy diet is achieved by avoiding aggressive foods that cause acidosis. Food that we eat every day without knowing the damage they cause to the cells of our body. Premature aging, lack of energy, stress, headaches, heart disease, allergies, eczema, urticaria, asthma, kidney stones, atherosclerosis, cancer, among others are nothing but the result of accumulation of acids. Therefore, we say that the use of CDS to purify water is always a complementary use within the diet, and other personal, social and medical characteristics of the person who decides and chooses to consume it, as a way to prevent and seek positive effects on their health and life, as all those people who, using their freedom to choose, use alternative and complementary therapies to improve their health and quality of life. Pressenza: What is the IHWC doing about it? MJF: It is informing all the IHWC\u00b4s health teams in the different countries about the existence of this substance, already proven by us, as a solution to numerous health problems. In the IHWC team of Argentina, Graciela Romero and Jos\u00e9 Ruiz are proposing to inform as widely as possible about the benefits of CDS, teaching people how to use it, as prevention and as a natural medicine for health, given its proven benefit, as well as the use of medicinal plants. For this reason, and for the scientific and medical research that is being carried out in different countries, the International Humanist White Circle recognises CDS or Chlorine Dioxide, widely disseminated by scientists Andreas Kalcker and Joseph Pamies, in addition to medicinal plants, as a solution for Covid 19. Its consumption as prevention and even for cure is very important since it would avoid unnecessary death of many human beings in the world. Pressenza: As you well know, Kalcker and also P\u00e1mies are highly questioned, they are not considered scientists. The use of the CDS is also not scientifically proven and there are those who argue that it produces significant damage to various vital systems. It is a much-discussed topic at the moment in the context of COVID-19 and we wanted to have your point of view on it. We will follow the use of this controversial substance closely and report on it.
