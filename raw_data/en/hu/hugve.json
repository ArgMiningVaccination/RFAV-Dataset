Naturopathic Doctors are able to spend longer amount of time with patients to dive deep into their health history. In order to properly assess and treat the patient, Naturopathic Physicians will often use laboratory testing, physical exams, other functional testing, supplements, physical medicine, nutritional advise, injection therapies and if needed prescription medication to come up with a comprehensive treatment plan which suits the individual patient needs. Naturopathic medicine has been practiced for generations as a way of providing patients with holistic & integrative approach to health care. At Ironwood Chiropractic in Richmond, we combine naturopathic medicine with chiropractic care to heed the best results for our patients How Naturopathic Medicine Can Help Our goal is to treat a patient's mind and body with naturopathic medicine by treating the root causes of an illness instead of just the symptoms (even though symptom management is important as well). Our naturopathic doctor will conduct an examination to properly assess your health history, lifestyle, and stress levels. Lab tests may be required depending on the patient's conditions. Once we have all the information we need, our team will work with you to create a treatment plan unique to you. The philosophy of naturopathic medicine is not to simply look at the organ in which the disfuntion is occurring, but to look at the whole body and all of the organ systems and how they play a role in each others function or dysfuntion. We also use spinal manipulation combined with our naturopathic medicine to help realign the spine and reduce pain from injuries. Suppose your injury has resulted in a herniated disc. In that case, we can treat your condition with spinal decompression by gently stretching the spine and allowing increased circulation of nutrients to the disc. We also use myofascial release treatment for damaged muscles and soft tissues to alleviate pain and effectively improve the healing process. Our naturopathic medicine and chiropractic care work hand in hand to provide patients natural relief.
