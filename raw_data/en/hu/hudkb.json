The ayahuasca ceremonies were life-changing for every single person I met at the retreat. My goal with this review is to provide some practical information and hopefully help people reading this with their retreat decision, as I was once in your shoes, painstakingly researching retreats while trying to make the best decision for my aya experience. I will also mention a few things that I believe makes Arkana a unique experience when compared to other retreat options. After extensive research I couldn't decide between the Amazon and the Sacred Valley locations, so I ended up booking the two week experience, spending one week at each center. Below I will provide information on both locations. The Amazon: There was a unique energy being in the home of the ayahuasca plants, which I believe cannot be replicated in any other location. Being in the jungle provided me with a deep sense of peace and closeness to nature that would have been worth the price of admission, even if there were no ayahuasca ceremonies offered. The sounds of the jungle at night as a backdrop to the Shaman's songs (known as 'Icaros') created incredibly powerful moments during the ceremonies. Seeing the plant and animal life of the Amazon during the jungle excursions was awe-inspiring and the fulfillment of a life-long dream for me. The practical info about the Amazon location: - It is important to note, you are a guest in the jungle, be prepared to share space with the insects, spiders, lizards, monkeys, etc., all of which will not bother you, if you don't bother them (I did not use bug spray during my entire stay and I was fine). -There is no hot water, but you won't need it- cold showers feel amazing in the jungle climate. -The food was 5 star restaurant quality. The kitchen staff is also very accommodating to people with dietary restrictions/ special requests -The center is powered by solar energy, so don't expect to be able to charge your phone or use wifi 100% of the time, but while I was there wifi was available every day, usually in the morning. (however, I only used it a few times throughout the week to check in with loved ones and let them know I was ok. One of the things I liked most about the location was disconnecting from technology and freeing up that mental energy to focus on the healing/ inner journeys/ meditation/ being present in the moment as much as possible) -The rooms/ beds are comfortable and sheets/ towels are changed daily. I had a shared- accommodation with two other people in my room and there was plenty of space for all three of us. -The pool was always clean and refreshing during the hot afternoons. -The Maloka (where the aya ceremonies take place) is a sacred space where energy flows as freely as the currents of the Amazon. -when I was booking my retreat I was concerned about being in a remote location and far from medical care in case of an emergency. This is a risk each individual person will have to assess based on their own health history, but my mind was eased when I arrived and learned there was a facilitator on staff with a medical background as a registered nurse. I do not know if this is a standard staffing practice, but if this is important to you, I'm sure you could reach out to the staff and ask before booking. Overall, I found the Amazon accommodations to be luxurious, given that the center is built deep in the jungle. 100% highly recommend. It somehow managed to be above and beyond all my wildest expectations. The Sacred Valley location is just as magical as the jungle. Surrounded by breathtaking views in every direction, there is an undeniable energy and feeling of safety at the retreat center. Just be aware of potential of altitude sickness the first few days, and bring warm clothes, as it does get chilly in the evenings and mornings (I was there in July and a sweater and windbreaker combo worked just fine for me). I won't go into as much detail about accommodations because it is closer to the standard expectations of a top quality retreat center/ hotel experience. There is hot water, Wifi available, the food is 5-star quality, the beds are super comfortable and cozy. They offer multiple massage and physical therapy options (sensory deprivation tank, reflexology, among other options). The excursion to the Salt Mines is incredible (it is a good workout, but not too strenuous). I also really enjoyed sitting around the bonfire, having deep conversations, while sipping cacao with my fellow guests. To me, the best thing about the Sacred Valley location is being able to experience the Huachuma/ San Pedro ceremony, which was probably my favorite day during the week at Sacred Valley. It is thoughtfully scheduled at the end of the week and it was the perfect way to end my two week experience with Arkana. What makes Arkana unique: The Arkana program- There is a certain magic that comes with this experience. To witness the healing that happens here is unlike anything I have ever experienced. The magic was enhanced by the program that Arkana has built around the plant medicines. The group sharing sessions helped me form a deep bond with all of my fellow guests. The techniques I learned during the yoga and breath work classes helped me stay focused during the ceremonies. Through this structure and the guidance of the Arkana team, I felt they provided me with a roadmap for navigating my journeys in the ayahuasca realm. Sapo ceremony- To me, this is what really sets Arkana apart, as I did not see this offered anywhere else. I found the Sapo experience to be equally as important to the Ayahuasca experiences. For me, it enhanced my relationship with aya and helped me to go deeper in my inner explorations with ayahuasca. Arkana has crafted a one-of-a-kind program by offering these medicines within the same retreat. Jose (the owner of Arkana), in my humble opinion, is one of the most knowledgeable people world-wide in regards to Sapo and it was an honor to learn from him and experience a Sapo ceremony with him as Maestro. The Arkana team- Jose the owner, the Maestros/Maestra, the facilitators, the kitchen and cleaning staff, the administrative team that helps with the pre-retreat preparation and post-retreat integration- all do an incredible job to make the guests feel welcomed and safe from the moment you sign up, throughout your stay, and even after you return home. The expertise of the Arkana team allows for these medicines to be experienced in a safe setting, with a peaceful mindset, creating the best opportunity for healing. Everything is done with thoughtfulness and intention, and those qualities are just two of the many gifts I received from the Arkana team and continue to carry with me as I integrate my experiences into my life in the outside world. Peace, love, light and gratefulness to the Arkana family and the plant medicines -Sean O... "}
