Dr. Taylor completed her acupuncture studies at The Chi Institute of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine in Reddick, Florida in December of 2014. The course consisted of five separate sessions (2 online, 2 on site) for a total of 130 hours of continuing education, as well as having to pass written and practical examinations. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is defined as \"needling\" or stimulating specific points in the body with certain methods, resulting in a therapeutic effect. The specific points on the body are called \"Shu-xu\" or acupoints (acupuncture points). The ancient Chinese discovered 173 acupoints in animals. Vital Energy or Qi The traditional Chinese people found that the health of the body depends on the state of Qi (pronounced \"Chee\"). Qi is the \"life force\" or vital energy of the body. There are two opposite forms of Qi: Yin and Yang. Physiologically, Qi flows through the body following channels or meridians and maintains balance of Yin and Yang. When the flow of Qi is interrupted by any pathologic factor (bacteria, virus or inflammation), the balance of Yin and Yang can be lost and disease occurs. Pain is a result of disruption of blockage of Qi flow. Acupuncture stimulation helps restore free flow of Qi, enabling the body to heal itself. Acupuncture Methods and Goals Acupoints may be stimulated in several ways. The techniques include dry needling, aqua-acupuncture, electro-acupuncture and moxibustion. Whichever method is used, the goal is always the same: to restore Qi flow and allow homeostasis to return to the body. How Safe is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a very safe procedure when administered by a qualified practitioner. There are very few side effects that have been found in clinical cases. When is Acupuncture Indicated? Musculoskeletal problems: muscle soreness, back pain, disc problems, arthritis and degenerative joint disease. Neurological disorders: seizures, laryngeal pareses and nerve paralysis. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, ulcers, vomiting, and constipation. Other conditions: asthma, cough, ocular diseases, behavior problems, kidney disease, thyroid disease, Cushing's disease, infertility, geriatric weakness, and skin problems. Why is Acupuncture frequently combined with herbal therapy? Chinese Herbal Medicine is chosen as a support or adjunctive therapy for acupuncture, or sometimes, in lieu of it. Herbs are frequently used in cases that have not responded to traditional western veterinary medicine. How Much Does Acupuncture Treatment Cost? A typical range of fees for a single session of acupuncture will vary from $50-$200 depending on time and methods used. Don't hesitate to contact us for more information. Call to schedule your "}
