A B S T R A C T Background Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and p ressure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and there are many different dressing options includin g hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of the current evidence i s required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing u se for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives T o assess the effects of hydrogel dressings on the healing of p ressure ulcers in any care setting. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Grou p Specialised Register (searched 19 June 2014); The Cochrane Cent ral Register of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 5); Ovid M EDLINE (1946 to June Week 2 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 23 June 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 20 June 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2014). There were no restrictions based on language or date of p ublication. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs ) comparing the effects of hydrogel dressings with alternativ e wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (s tage II or above). Data collection and analysis T wo review authors independently performed study selection , risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We included eleven studies (523 participants) in this review. T en studies had two arms and one had three arms that were all rel evant to this review. Three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with a basic wound contact dressing; three studies compared a hydrog el dressing with a hydrocolloid dressing; three studies compared a hydrog el dressing with another hydrogel dressing; one study compar ed a hydrogel dressing with a foam dressing; one study compared a hydrogel d ressing with a dextranomer paste dressing and one study compa red a hydrogel dressing with a topical treatment (collagenase). Lim ited data were available for analyses in this review: we condu cted no 1 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.meta-analyses. Where data were available there was no evidence of a difference between hydrogel and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. One small study r eported that using hydrogel dressings was, on average, less costly than hydrocolloid dressings, but this estimate was imprecise and i ts methodology was not clear. All included studies were small, had short follow-up times and were at unclear risk of bias. Authors' conclusions It is not clear if hydrogel dressings are more or less effective than other treatments in healing pressure ulcers or if differ ent hydrogels have different effects, Most trials in this eld are very smal l and poorly reported so that risk of bias is unclear. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers Background Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and p ressure injuries, are areas of injury to the skin or the under lying tissue, or both. Pressure ulcers can be painful, may become infected, and af fect quality of life. Those at risk of pressure ulcers include th ose with spinal cord injuries and people who are immobile or who have li mited mobility such as some elderly people and people with acut e or chronic conditions. In 2004 the total annual cost of treating pr essure ulcers in the UK was estimated as being GBP 1.4 to 2.1 bil lion, which was equivalent to 4% of the total NHS expenditure. Press ure ulcers have been shown to increase length of hospital stay a nd the associated hospital costs. Figures from the USA suggest that ' pressure ulcer' was noted as a diagnosis for half a million hos pital stays in 2006; for adults, the total hospital costs of these stays was U SD 11 billion. Dressings are one treatment option for pressure ulcers. Ther e are many types of dressings that can be used; these can vary cons iderably in cost. Hydrogel dressings are one type of available dressin g. Hydrogel dressings contain a large amount of water that kee ps ulcers moist rather than letting them become dry. Moist wounds are thought to heal more quickly than dry wounds. In this study we investig ated whether there is any evidence that pressure ulcers treated wit h hydrogel dressings heal more quickly than those treated wit h other types of dressings or skin surface (topical) treatments. What we found In June 2014 we searched for as many relevant medical studies as we could nd that had a robust design (randomised controlled trials) that had compared hydrogel dressings with other trea tments for pressure ulcers. We found 11 studies involving a to tal of 539 participants. From the results of these studies we could not te ll whether hydrogel wound dressings heal pressure ulcers mor e quickly or slowly than other types of dressing or topical treatments. Generally, the studies we found were small and the results in conclusive. Some studies lacked information about how they wer e conducted and it was difcult to tell whether the results presented were robust. More research of better quality is needed before it can be determined whether hydrogel dressings are better or worse at healing pr essure ulcers than other types of dressings or topical treatme nts. 2 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and p res- sure injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the under- lying tissue, or both. They often occur in areas with a bony prom i- nence such as the sacrum (base of the spine) and heel ( Vanderwee 2007 ), and are caused by external forces such as pressure, or shear, or a combination of both ( EPUAP-NPUAP 2014 ). Populations at risk of pressure ulceration include those with spinal cord injuries ( Gefen 2014 ), and those immobilised or with lim- ited mobility such as some elderly people and people with acute or chronic conditions that might limit movement or bodily sen- sation, or both ( Allman 1997 ;Berlowitz Bergstrom 1998 1994 ). Incontinence can also increase risk of ulceration by producing a detrimental environment for the skin ( Brandeis 1994 ). Impaired nutritional status may also in- crease risk ( Allman 1997 ;Donini 2005 ), however, there is cur- rently limited evidence for the effectiveness of nutritional intake interventions for preventing or treating pressure ulcers ( Langer 2003 ;Smith 2013 ). Mobility produces relief from pressure within the body throu gh regular, often subconscious, shifts in positions when sittin g or ly- ing. These movements, triggered by a reduction in oxygen leve ls at pressure points and possible discomfort, distribute pressu re from contact at the surface, thus reducing the compression of soft tis- sue against bone ( Gebhardt 2002 ). Populations with limited au- tonomous movement or conditions that dull body sensation, or both (as described above), are at risk of failing to achieve adequ ate pressure relief. Prolonged exposure of an area of the body to pres- sure or compression can interrupt the local blood circulation and trigger a cascade of biochemical changes that may lead to tissue damage and ulceration. Immobility can also lead to increased da m- age from shear and friction, for example, when people are pull ed into position in chairs and beds. Pressure ulcers vary in severity. One of the most widely recogn ised systems for categorising pressure ulcers is that of the Nation al Pres- sure Ulcer Advisory Panel which is summarised \"Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a localized area usually over a bony prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanch - ing; its colour may differ from the surrounding area. The area may be painful, rm, soft, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Category I may be difcult to detect in individuals wit h dark skin tones. May indicate \"at risk\" persons.\" Category/Stage II - partial thickness: \"Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a shallow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough [dead tissue]. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-lled or sero-sanguinous lled blist er. Presents as a or dry shallow ulcer without slough or brui sing(bruising indicates deep tissue injury). This category should n ot be used to describe skin tears, tape burns, incontinence associa ted dermatitis, maceration [damage through scratching/abrasion or burns].\" Category/Stage III full thickness skin loss: \"Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle are not exposed. Slough may be present but does not ob- scure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tun - nelling. The depth of a Category/Stage III pressure ulcer var ies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput [back of the head] and malleolus (adipose) subcu- taneous tissue and Category/Stage III ulcers can be shallow. I n contrast, areas of signicant adiposity can develop extremely deep Category/Stage III pressure ulcers. Bone/tendon is not visi ble or directly palpable.\" Category/Stage IV - full thickness tissue loss: \"Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or esch ar [scabbing] may be present. Often includes undermining and tun- nelling. The depth of a Category/Stage IV pressure ulcer vari es by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have (adipose) subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Category/Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g., fascia, tendon or jo int occur. Exposed bone/muscle is visible or directly palpable.\" Pressure ulcers are relatively common wounds that can be com- plex to manage and heal. Prevalence estimates vary according to the population being assessed, the data collection methods us ed and decisions about whether or not stage I pressure ulcers shou ld be included (since there is no active wound at this stage, but pa- tients are 'at risk' and have early tissue damage). A large sur vey of hospital patients undertaken in several European countri es re- turned a pressure ulcer prevalence (stage II and above) of 10.5% (Vanderwee 2007 ). In 2009, a USA estimate for pressure ulcer prevalence (stage II and above) across acute-care, long-term care and rehabilitation settings was 9.0% with prevalence highes t in long-term acute-care settings (26%; VanGilder 2009 ). In the UK, national pressure ulcer data are collected across community and acute settings - although data collection is not yet universal - as part of the National Health Service (NHS) Safety Thermome- ter initiative ( Power 2012 ). Five per cent of patients across these settings were estimated to have a pressure ulcer in January 20 14 (National Safety Thermometer Data 2014 ). We note that all the prevalence gures quoted above are for at-r isk populations currently receiving medical care. The point preval ence of pressure ulceration in the total adult population was recen tly estimated using a cross-sectional survey undertaken in Leeds, UK. Of the total adult population of 751,485 the point prevalence of pressure ulceration per 1000 was 0.31 ( Hall 2014 ). UK pres- sure ulcer prevalence estimates specically for community setti ngs have reported rates of 0.77 per 1000 adults in a UK urban area 5 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(Stevenson 2013 ). Pressure ulcers have a large impact on those affected; the ulcers can be painful, discharge exudate and may become seriously infecte d. It has been shown that - after adjustment for age, sex and co-mor - bidities - people with pressure ulcers have a lower health-rel ated quality of life than those without pressure ulcers ( Essex 2009 ). The nancial cost of treating ulcers in the UK was recently estimated as being between GBP 1214 for a stage I ulcer, to GBP a stage IV ulcer ( Dealey 2012 ). In 2004 the total annual cost of treating pressure ulcers in the UK was estimated as being GB P 1.4 to 2.1 billion, which was equivalent to 4% of the total NHS expenditure ( Bennett 2004 ). Pressure ulcers have been shown to increase length of hospital stay and the associated hospital co sts (Allman 1999 ). Figures from the USA suggest that 'pressure ul- cer' was noted as a diagnosis for half a million hospital stays in 2006; for adults, the total hospital costs of these stays was U SD 11 billion ( Russo 2008 ). Costs to the Australian healthcare system for treating pressure ulceration have been estimated at AUD 2 85 million per annum ( Graves 2005 ). Description of the intervention There are two main strategies in the treatment of pressure ul cers, namely relief of pressure, usually through the use of pressu re reliev- ing beds, mattresses and cushions (\"support surfaces\") ( McInnes 2011 ), alongside management of the wound environment using wound dressings. Other general strategies include patient e du- cation, pain management, optimising circulation/perfusion, op- timising nutrition, surgical wound closure and the treatment of clinical infection ( AWMA 2012 ;EPUAP-NPUAP 2014 ). Dressings are widely used in wound care, with the aim of protect - ing the wound and promoting healing. Classication of dressi ngs usually depends on the key material used in their construction . Several attributes of an ideal wound dressing have been descr ibed (BNF 2013 ), including: the ability of the dressing to absorb and contain exudate without leakage or strike-through; lack of particulate contaminants left in the wound by the dressing; thermal insulation; permeability to water and but not bacteria; avoidance of wound trauma on dressing removal; frequency with which the dressing needs to be changed; provision of pain relief; and comfort. Hydrogel dressings are the focus of this review; their proper ties are described below. As hydrogel dressings are likely to be evalu ated against one of the many wound dressings available, a descript ion of potential comparators, based on the British National Form ulary structure ( BNF 2013 ), is also provided. Dressings are listed be- low, by their generic names and, where possible, with exampl es ofcorresponding trade names and manufacturers. Dressing names , manufacturers and distributors may vary between countries. 1. Basic wound contact dressings Low-adherence dressings and wound contact materials: these are usually cotton pads that are placed in direct contact wit h the wound. Examples include parafn gauze dressing, BP 1993 and Xeroform (Covidien) dressing - a non-adherent petrolatum blend with 3% bismuth tribromophenate on ne mesh gauze. Absorbent dressings: these can be applied directly to the wound or used as secondary absorbent layers in the management of heavily-exuding wounds. Examples include Primapore (Smith & Nephew), Mepore (M\u00f6lnlycke) and absorbent cotton gauze (BP 1988). 2. Advanced wound dressings Alginate dressings: these are highly absorbent and come in the form of calcium alginate or calcium sodium alginate, and can be combined with collagen. The alginate forms a gel when in contact with the wound surface, which can be lifted off at dressing removal or rinsed away with sterile saline. Bondin g to a secondary viscose pad these dressings contain hydrophilic polyurethane foam and are designed to absorb wound exudate and maintain a moist wound surface. These are produced in a variety of versions: some foam dressings include additional absorbent materials, such as viscose and acrylate bres or particles of superabsorbent polyacrylate; are silicone-coated for non-traumatic removal. Examples Allevyn (Smith (Coloplast) dressings: cross-linked insoluble polymers (i.e. starch or carboxymethylcellulose) and up to 96% water. They are designed to absorb wound exudate, or rehydra te a wound, depending on the wound moisture levels. They are supplied as either flat sheets, an amorphous hydrogel or as be ads. Examples include: ActiformCool (Activa) Aquaflo (Covidien). Films - permeable lm membrane dressings: these dressings are permeable to water vapour and oxygen, but not t o water or micro-organisms. Examples includeT egaderm (3M) and Opsite (Smith & Nephew). Soft polymer dressings: these dressings are moderately absorbent and composed of a soft silicone polymer held in a non-adherent layer. Examples include: a hydrocolloid matrix bonded onto a vapour-permeable lm or foam backing. This matrix forms a gel 6 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.that provides a moist environment when in contact with the wound surface. Examples include: Granuflex (ConvaT ec) and NU DERM (Systagenix). Fibrous alternatives have been developed that resemble alginates, are not occlusive, and tha t are more Capillary-action consist of an absorbent core of hydrophilic bres held between two low-adherent contact dressings: these charcoal and are used to absorb wound odour, often in conjunction with a secondary dressing to improve absorbency. Examples include: honey, which is thought to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and can be used for acute or chronic wounds. Examples include: Medihoney dressings release free iodine, which is thought to act as a wound antiseptic, when exposed to wound exudate. Examples include Iodoflex (Smith & Nephew) and Iodozyme (Insense). Silver-impregnated dressings: these dressings are used to treat infected wounds, as silver ions are thought to have antimicrobial properties. Silver versions of most dressing types are available (e.g. silver foam, silver hydrocolloid etc). Exam ples include: Acticoat (Smith & Silver (Urgo). Other antimicrobial dressings: these dressings are composed of a gauze or low-adherent dressing impregnated with an ointment thought to have antimicrobial properties. Examp les include: chlorhexidine gauze dressing (Smith & Nephew) and Cutimed Sorbact (BSN Medical). 4. Specialist dressings Protease-modulating matrix dressings: these dressings alter the activity of proteolytic enzymes in chronic wounds. Examples include: Promogran (Systagenix) and Sorbion (H & R). The diversity of dressings available to health professiona ls (includ- ing variations within each type) can make evidence-informed de- cision-making challenging. Furthermore, whilst dressings ma y be viewed as 'inert' and cheap products, increasingly they are bei ng formulated with an 'active' ingredient e.g. silver, or other anti-mi- crobial products. With increasingly sophisticated technology b e- ing applied to wound care, practitioners need to know how ef- fective these alternative dressings are compared with more tr adi- tional, and usually less costly, options. There are limited d ata aboutthe current use of dressings for the treatment of pressure ulce rs although older studies have shown wide variation in practice a nd wound (wound type) care knowledge ( Pieper 1995 ). How the intervention might work Animal experiments conducted over 40 years ago suggested that acute wounds heal more quickly when their surfaces are kept mois t, rather than left to dry and scab ( Winter 1962 ;Winter 1963a ; Winter 1963b ). A moist environment is thought to provide op- timal conditions for the cells involved in the healing process, as well as allowing autolytic debridement (removal of dead tiss ue by natural processes), which is thought to be an important part of t he healing pathway ( Cardinal 2009 ). The desire to maintain a moist wound environment is a key driver for the use of wound dressin gs. Different wound dressings vary in their level of absorbency s o that a very wet wound can be treated with an absorbent dressing (such as a foam dressing) to draw excess moisture away and avoid skin damage, whilst a drier wound can be treated with a more occlusive dressing to maintain a moist environment. Hydrogels are ins oluble polymers that can bind a relatively large volume of water that can then be 'donated' to wounds to maintain a moist environment. Furthermore, if the hydrogel polymer matrix is not fully hyd rated, it can absorb some wound exudate and help to optimise the mois- ture level of the wound. When hydrogel material is manufacture d in the form of a xed structure via cross-linking of the polymers it is considered to be a hydrogel sheet dressing. Why it is important to do this review Pressure ulcers are a relatively common but complex wound that have a negative impact on people's lives and incur high costs to health services. Dressings are a widely used treatment for pr essure ulcers, and understanding the existing evidence base and pote ntial uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of differ ent dressing types is important for decision making in this area. A key international guideline recommends that a dressing sho uld be chosen \"that keeps the wound bed moist\", this recommenda- tion was classed as being level C evidence, that is \"supported b y indirect evidence (e.g., studies in normal human subjects, huma ns with other types of chronic wounds, animal models) and/or exp ert opinion\" ( EPUAP-NPUAP 2014 ). The same guidelines suggests that hydrogel dressings are used to treat pressure ulcers in v arious scenarios, but these recommendations are based on limited evi - dence ( EPUAP-NPUAP 2014 ). T wo notable systematic reviews of treatments for pressure u lcers have included trials of dressings ( Reddy 2008 ;Smith 2013 ).Reddy 2008 (search date 2008) included eight trials of hydrogel dressings in people with pressure ulcers. These studies were included as part of a much larger review that reviewed multiple interventions for treating pressure ulcers. The report stated that \"No single d ressing 7 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.was consistently superior to other dressings in the trials of pressure ulcers we examined\", however, because of the breath of the revi ew, detailed examination of the effect estimates and quantifyin g un- certainty around the hydrogel trials was difcult. The more re cent review seems to include dressing interventions but does not m en- tion hydrogels specically ( Smith 2013 ). We conclude that up-to- date and transparent information on the evidence for the use o f hydrogel dressings to treat pressure ulcers is required. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigati ng the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers . Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. These reviews will be summarised in an overview of reviews that will draw togeth er all existing Cochrane review evidence regarding the use of dressi ngs to treat pressure ulcers. O B J E C T I V E S T o assess the effects of hydrogel dressings for healing press ure ulcers in any care setting. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review T ypes of studies Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT s), including cluster RCTs (which could include studies where mul- tiple wounds on the same participant were treated with the all o- cated treatment and outcome data were collected and analysed for each wound) were eligible for inclusion, irrespective of langu age of report. RCTs reported only as abstracts were eligible for incl usion only where there was sufcient data available for reasonable data extraction either from the abstract itself or from the study au thors. Cross-over trials were eligible if outcome data were availabl e from the end of the rst treatment period prior to cross-over. Studi es using quasi-randomisation were excluded. T ypes of participants RCTs that recruited adults with a diagnosis of pressure ulcer (s tage II or above) managed in any care setting were eligible for inclu - sion. We excluded participants with stage I ulcers. We accepted study authors' denitions of what they classed as stage II or a bove, unless it was clear that they included wounds with unbroken ski n. Studies that recruited participants with ulcers of stage II or h igher alongside people with other types of chronic wound (e.g. leg or foot ulcers, or both) were included if the results for people wi th rel- evant pressure ulcers were presented separately (or availabl e fromthe study authors). Similarly, where a trial included both sta ge I and more advanced staged pressure ulcers, the study was only in - cluded if data on ulcers of stage II and above were reported sepa - rately or available on request from study authors. T ypes of interventions The primary intervention was hydrogel wound dressings ( BNF 2013 ). Any RCT where the use of a specic hydrogel dressing was the only systematic difference between treatment groups was eligible for inclusion. We anticipated comparisons could includ e: different types of hydrogel dressings compared with r; hydrogel dressings other dressing types; and h y- drogel dressings compared with other interventions (possibl y non- dressing treatments e.g. topical treatments). T ypes of outcome measures We list primary and secondary outcomes below. Decisions regard - ing study selection were not based on whether measured outcome data were reported in a 'usable' way, nor on the absence of the primary outcome if other relevant outcomes were reported. Primary outcomes The primary outcome for this review was complete wound healing . We note that, since wound healing is a subjective outcome, it can be at high risk of measurement bias when outcome assessment is not blinded and so we focused on this in our risk of bias assessm ent. For this review we regarded the following as providing the mo st relevant and rigorous measures of outcome. Time to complete wound healing (correctly analysed using censored data and preferably adjusted for prognostic covaria tes such as baseline size). We only considered mean or median time to healing without survival analysis as a valid outcome if rep orts specied that all wounds healed (i.e. if the trial authors rega rded time to healing as a continuous measure as there is no censoring ). Proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up (frequency of complete healing). Where both time to healing and proportion of ulcers healed were reported, we presented all data in a summary outcome table for reference purposes, but focused on reporting the 'best' heali ng out- come available. We considered time to healing to be the best out - come. We presented data for the latest time point available un less there was an earlier time point that was clearly the primary fo cus of the study, in which case data from multiple time points were extracted. We accepted authors' denitions of what constituted a healed wound. Secondary outcomes Change (and rate of change) in wound size, with adjustment for baseline size (we contacted study authors to request adjust ed 8 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.means when not presented). Where change or rate of change in wound size was reported without adjustment for baseline siz e we documented use of the outcome in the study, but did not extract data, summarize or use the data in any meta-analysis. Participant health-related quality of life/health status (measured using a standardised generic questionnaire such as EQ-5D, SF-36, SF-12 or SF-6 or wound-specic questionnaires such as the Cardiff wound impact schedule). We did not include ad hoc measures of quality of life that were not likely to be validated and would not be common to multiple trials. Wound infection (with infection as dened by the study authors). Other adverse events, including pain associated with the ulcer or experienced at dressing change (measured using survey/ questionnaire/data capture process or visual analogue scale), where a clear methodology for the collection of adverse event data was provided. Resource use (including measurements of resource use such as number of dressing changes, nurse visits, length of hospit al stay and re-operation/intervention). Cost (allocated to resource use). Wound recurrence.

We combined the EMBASE search with the Ovid EMBASE lter developed by the UK Cochrane Centre (Lefebvre 2011 ). We combined the CINAHL searches with the trial lters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guide lines Network ( SIGN 2011 ). There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We also searched the following clinical trials registries: ClinicalT rials,gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/); WHO International Clinical T rials //apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx); EU Clinical T rials Register (https:// www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/). Searching other resources We contacted corresponding authors of trials and the manufac- turers and distributors of wound dressings. We searched the U S Food and Drug Administration brieng documents used in the licensing of wound dressings. We searched for other potential ly eligible trials or ancillary publications by searching the ref erence lists of retrieved included trials as well as relevant system atic re- views, meta-analyses, and health-technology assessment repo rts. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Independently, two review authors assessed the titles and a bstracts of the citations retrieved by the searches for relevance. After this initial assessment, we obtained full text copies of all studi es felt to be potentially relevant. Independently, two review author s checked the full papers for eligibility; disagreements were resolv ed by dis- cussion and, where required, the input of a third review autho r. 9 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Where the eligibility of a study was unclear, we attempted to con - tact study authors to ask for clarication. We recorded all reaso ns for exclusion of studies for which we obtained full copies. We com - pleted a PRISMA flowchart to summarise this process ( Liberati 2009 ). We obtained all relevant publications when studies were repo rted more than once. Whilst the study was included only once in the review, all reports were examined to ensure the maximal extr action of relevant data. Data extraction and management We extracted and summarised details of the eligible studies. T wo review authors extracted data independently and resolved di sagree- ments by discussion, drawing on a third review author where re - quired. Where data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact the study authors to obtain this information. Where a study was included with more than two intervention arms, data were extracted only from intervention and control groups that met the review's eligibility criteria. We extracted the following data, where possible from those tr ial arms that are relevant to the review: country of origin; type/grade/category of pressure ulcer; location of pressure ulcer; unit of randomisation and analysis, e.g. single wound, patient, or multiple wounds on the same patient; trial design, e.g. parallel; cluster; care setting; number of participants randomised to each trial arm; eligibility criteria and key baseline participant data; details of treatment regimen received by each group; duration of treatment; details of any co-interventions; primary and secondary outcome(s) (with denitions); outcome data for primary and secondary outcomes (by group); duration of follow-up; number of withdrawals (by group); publication status of study; and, source of funding for trial. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Independently, two review authors assessed the included stu dies that had individual randomisation using the Cochrane Collab o- ration tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011a ). This tool ad- dresses six specic domains: sequence generation, allocation con- cealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome report ing and other issues ( Appendix 2 ). We assessed blinded outcome as- sessment and completeness of outcome data for each outcome sep- arately. We present the risk of bias assessment using two 'Ri sk of bias' summary gures; one providing a summary of bias for eachitem across all studies, and the second providing a cross-tabula - tion of each trial by all of the risk of bias items. For trials us ing cluster randomisation we planned to assess the risk of bias us ing the following domains: recruitment bias, baseline imbalance , loss of clusters, incorrect analysis and comparability with individ ually randomised trials ( Higgins 2011b ;Appendix 3 ). Measures of treatment effect For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% condence intervals (CI). For continuous outcome data we planned to use mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for trials that used the same assessment scale. When trials used differen t assessment scales, we planned to use the standardised mean di f- ference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We anticipated reporting time-to- event data (e.g. time-to-complete wound healing) as hazard rati os (HR) where possible in accordance with the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Deeks 2011 ). If studies reporting time-to-event data (e.g. time to healing) did not report a hazard ratio, then, where feasib le, we planned to estimate this using other reported outcomes, such a s the numbers of events, through the application of available s tatis- tical methods ( Tierney 2007 ). Unit of analysis issues Unit of analysis issues may arise with studies that include pa rtic- ipants with multiple wounds that are treated with the same in - tervention, and report outcomes for each wound, or with studie s in which multiple assessments of an outcome are presented for participants. We recorded whether trials presented outcomes i n relation to a wound, a limb (e.g. foot or leg), a participant, or as multiple wounds on the same participant. For wound healing , unless otherwise stated, where the number of wounds appeare d to equal the number of participants, we treated the participant a s the unit of analysis. Where a cluster trial has been conducted and correctly analysed, ef - fect estimates and their standard errors may be meta-analysed using the generic inverse-variance method in Review Manager ( RevMan 2014 ). We also recorded occasions when multiple wounds on a participant were (incorrectly) treated in the included study as b e- ing independent of each other, rather than having within-pati ent analysis methods applied. This was be recorded as part of the ' Risk of bias' assessment. Where a cluster-randomised trial was conducted, but incorrectly analysed at the individual rather than the cluster level, we p lanned to approximate the correct analyses if possible following Cha pter 16 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions using information on ( Higgins 2011b ): the number of clusters (or groups) randomised to each intervention group; or the average (mean) size of each cluster; 10 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.the outcome data, ignoring the cluster design for the total number of individuals (for example, number or proportion of individuals with events, or means and standard deviations); and, an estimate of the intracluster (or intraclass) correlation coefcient (ICC). Dealing with missing data It is common to have data missing from trial reports. Exclud- ing participants post-randomisation from the analysis, or ig nor- ing those participants who are lost to follow-up, compromises t he randomisation and potentially introduces bias into the tria l. If we thought that study authors might be able to provide some miss ing data then we contacted them. In individual studies, where data on the proportion of ulcers healed were presented, we assumed that randomised participants not included in an analysis had a n unhealed wound at the end of the follow-up period (i.e. they wer e considered in the denominator but not the numerator). Where a trial did not specify participant group numbers prior to drop-o ut, we presented only complete case data. For time-to-healing analy sis using survival analysis methods, drop-outs should be accounte d for as censored data. Hence all participants will contribute to t he analysis. We acknowledge that such analysis assumes that drop - outs are missing at random. We present data for area change of ulcer, and for all secondary outcomes, as a complete case analysis . Assessment of heterogeneity We considered clinical heterogeneity (that is the degree to which RCTs vary in terms of participant, intervention and outcome cha r- acteristics) and statistical heterogeneity. We assessed stat istical het- erogeneity using the Chi\u00b2 test (a signicance level of P less tha n 0.10 was considered to indicate statistically signicant heter ogene- ity) in conjunction with Higgins 2003 ). I\u00b2 exam- ines the percentage of total variation across RCTs that is due t o heterogeneity rather than chance ( Higgins 2003 ). We considered that I\u00b2 values of 40%, or less, indicated a low level of heterog ene- ity, and values of 75%, or more, indicated very high heterogen eity (Higgins 2011c ). Assessment of reporting biases Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research n dings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. Publicatio n bias is one of a number of possible causes of 'small study effects', t hat is, a tendency for estimates of the intervention effect to be mo re benecial in smaller RCTs. Funnel plots allow a visual assess ment of whether small study effects may be present in a meta-analysi s. A funnel plot is a simple scatter plot of the intervention effe ct estimates from individual RCTs against some measure of tria l size or precision ( Sterne 2011 ). We planned to present funnel plots for meta-analyses comprising 10 or more RCTs using RevMan 5.3.Data synthesis Details of included studies were combined in narrative review ac- cording to comparators. Both clinical and statistical heterogen eity were explored. We had planned to pool data using meta-analysi s (conducted using RevMan 5.3), that is, where studies appeared similar in terms of intervention, study duration and outcome as- sessment and data type, however, no data were meta-analysed i n this review. Had we pooled data, in the absence of clinical heter o- geneity and in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (I\u00b2 va lue over 50%), we planned to use a random-effects model, however, we did not anticipate pooling studies where heterogeneity wa s very high (I\u00b2 value over 75%). Where there was no evidence of clini- cal or statistical heterogeneity we would have used a xed-effe ct model. For dichotomous outcomes we presented the summary estimate as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Where continuous outcomes were measured in the same way across studies, we would have present ed a pooled mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. We planned to pool standardised mean difference (SMD) estimates where studies h ad measured the same outcome using different methods. For time-t o- event data, we planned to plot (and, if appropriate, pool) est imates of HRs and 95% CIs as presented in the study reports using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan 5.3. 'Summary of ndings' tables We present the main results of the review in 'Summary of nd- ings' tables. These tables present key information concernin g the quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the effects of the in- terventions examined, and the sum of the available data for t he main outcomes ( Schunemann 2011a ). The 'Summary of ndings' tables also include an overall grading of the evidence relatin g to each of the main outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recom- mendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) appro ach. The GRADE approach denes the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be condent that an estimate of effect or association is close to the true quantity of specic interest . The quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within -trial risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, h et- erogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publicat ion bias (Schunemann 2011b ). We planned (in the protocol) to present the following outcomes in the 'Summary of ndings' tables: time to complete ulcer healing, where analysed, using appropriate survival analysis methods; proportion of ulcers completely healing during the trial period; and, adverse events. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We planned to perform a sub-group analysis to explore the influ - ence of the following factor on effect sizes: 11 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.ulcer category: where possible assessed whether there are differences in effect sizes for stage II pressure ulcers and the more severe stage III and IV pressure ulcers Sensitivity analysis We planned to perform the following sensitivity analyses in order to explore the influence of the following factor on effect sizes: risk of bias: we planned to assess the influence of removing studies classed as being at high and unclear risk of bias from meta-analyses. We would only include studies that were assess ed as having a low risk of bias in all key domains, namely adequat e generation of the randomisation sequence, adequate allocati on concealment and blinding of outcome assessor, for the estimate s of treatment effect.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 1. Study flow diagram 13 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Included studies Eleven studies were included in review ;Mulder 1993 ;Sopata 2002 ;Thomas 1998 ;Young 1996 ): see Characteristics of included studies as well as a summary tables Table 1 andTable 2 for more details. Collectively the included studies contained 523 participants r ele- vant to this review. This gure was calculated using available data, however, Darkovich 1990 had potential unit of analysis issues be- cause some participants entered the study with more than one wound and outcome data were presented at the wound rather than participant level. From the study report we were unable to det er- mine the number of participants to whom the relevant pressure ulcer data pertained. So, in order to include the Darkovich 1990 gures when calculating the total number of participants we as- sumed one wound per person. T en of the included studies had two comparison groups and one had three groups ( Mulder 1993 ). Three of the studies were ( Bale 1998a ;Bale 1998b Darkovich 1990 ;Motta 1999 ;Milne 2012 ;Mulder Den- mark ( 1998 one was conducted in Poland ( Sopata 2002 ), and one was reported as being multi-national with no further d e- tails provided ( Colin 1996 ). All included studies had relatively short follow-up times ran ging from three weeks to 12 weeks ( Colin 1996 ;Matzen 1998 respec- tively). Included studies also had small sample sizes with the small- est having 10 participants ( Motta 1999 ), and the largest 143 par- ticipants (information is presented on 135 of these 143 partici - pants; Colin 1996 ). The median size of each group, for the 10 studies that had clear data concerning the number of participant s, was 17 participants. The included studies evaluated six comparisons: Hydrogel dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings (including 1998 ;Mulder 1993 ). One brand of hydrogel dressing compared with dressings compared a topical application of collagenase ( Milne 2012 ). Three studies reported complete wound healing ( Milne 2012 ; Motta 1999 ;Thomas 1998 ), and one study reported this outcome but at the wound level, that is, participants could have more th an one wound ( Darkovich 1990 ). Excluded studies In total 20 studies were excluded from the review; we have list ed reasons for exclusion below. T en studies did not evaluate a hydrogel dressing ( Banks 1994 ;Bito 2012 ;Brod ;Meaume 1994 2000 ; T orra i Bou 1999b ). Three studies did not report a relevant outcome (study authors were contacted where possible to request further information if available; Fear 1992 ;Peschardt 1997 ;T orra i Bou 1999a ). Four studies not controlled trials (Flanagan 1995 ;Parnell 2005 ;Sadyak 1990 ;Weheida 1991 ). The study population in one study included stage I pressure ulcers (we attempted to contact study authors to request data on stage II ulcers only; Kaya 2005 ). In two studies use of a hydrogel dressing was not the only systematic difference between trial groups ( Lum 1996 ;Small 2002 ). Risk of bias in included studies We classed studies as being at an overall high risk of bias if on e of the following domains was deemed to be at a high risk of bias : generation of randomisation sequence, allocation concealment , or blinded outcome assessment. On the basis of this approach, we deemed no included studies to be at a high risk of bias ( Figure 2 ; Figure 3 ). 14 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Figure 3. Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements abo ut each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies Allocation We classed three studies as being at low risk of bias for the gen era- tion of use of a computer-generated number list randomisation schedule. We classed the remaining eight studi es as being at unclear risk of bias for this domain, as no informat ion regarding generation of the randomisation sequence was avai lable for assessment. We classed all 11 studies as being at unclear risk of bias for the domain of allocation concealment, as no information regarding allocation of the randomisation sequence was reported. Blinding We classed 10 studies as being at unclear risk of bias for blindi ng, as there was no indication that blinded outcome assessments we re conducted for any outcomes relevant to the review. One study re- ported performing blinded outcome assessment for wound heal - ing parameters ( Milne 2012 ). Incomplete outcome data We deemed three studies to be at high risk of bias for the domai n of incomplete outcome data ( Bale 1998b ;Milne 2012 ;Thomas 1998 ).Bale 1998b was presented as an interim analysis; Milne 2012 presented outcome data for only those randomised partic- ipants whose wound(s) had been debrided by the mid-point ofstudy follow-up, and Thomas 1998 appeared to exclude data from 27% of those randomised. We considered four studies to be at a low risk of bias for this domain ( Bale 1998a ;Motta 1999 ;Mulder 1993 ;Sopata 2002 ), and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias ( Colin 1996 ;Darkovich 1990 ;Matzen 1998 ; Young 1996 ). Selective reporting T wo studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for the domain of selective reporting ( Milne 2012 ;Mulder 1993 ).Milne 2012 reported outcome data for only a specic group of those randomised. Mulder 1993 described outcome data that were not reported in the study results. Six studies were deemed to be a t a low risk of bias for this domain ( Bale 1998a ;Colin ;Young 1996 ), and three at an unclear risk of bias ( Bale 1998b ;Matzen 1998 ;Thomas 1998 ). Other potential sources of bias We considered Darkovich 1990 to be at a high risk of bias as there were possible unit of analysis issues. The study reports tha t 90 participants with 129 ulcers were randomised (some were stage I ulcers); data were then presented at the ulcer level. We also dee med Sopata 2002 to be at a high risk of bias due to unit of analysis issues, as the trialists had recruited participants with multiple wou nds and presented complete healing data at the wound rather than 16 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.participant level. It was not possible to assess unit of analy sis issues for one study ( Mulder 1993 ). We deemed the remaining studies to be at a low risk of bias for other potential sources of bias.

The follow-up periods of the studies were 12 weeks ( Matzen 1998 ), 10 weeks ( Thomas 1998 ), and eight weeks ( Mulder 1993 ). We classed both Mulder 1993 andThomas 1998 as being at a high risk of bias for one domain (reporting bias for the former and attrition bias for t he latter). All studies were small in terms of participant number s and events observed. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) One study presented data on complete wound healing ( Thomas 1998 ). We can only present complete case data here as the num- ber of participants randomised to each trial group prior to los s to follow-up was not reported. There was no evidence of a differ- ence in the number of ulcers healed in the hydrogel-dressed grou p (63%: 10/16) compared with the basic wound contact-dressed group (64%: 9/14): RR 0.97 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.68; Analysis 1.1 ). The analysis provides low precision due to the small sample si ze, so there could be an effect in either direction (or none).This stud y was classed as being at high risk of attrition bias due to the ap par- ent exclusion of participants from the analysis.Secondary outcome: change in wound size Matzen 1998 reported that the basic wound contact dressing group had a mean relative wound volume that was 64% of baseline vol- ume (standard deviation (SD) 16) compared with the hydrogel- dressed group which had a mean relative wound volume that was 26% of baseline volume (SD 20). There was a statistically signif - icant difference in the mean difference of -38% in favour of hy- drogel (95% CI -50.49 to -25.51; Analysis 1.2 ). Mulder 1993 reported the mean percentage reduction per week in wound size for each group. This was 5.1% (SD 14.8) in the basic wound contact dressing group and 8.0% (SD 14.8) for the hydrogel dressing group: mean difference 2.9%, (95% CI -6.27 Analysis 1.3 ). Secondary outcome: wound infection Matzen 1998 reported that six participants in the basic wound contact dressing group developed necrotic tissue with infectio n. No information about the hydrogel dressing group was presen ted. It is not clear if adverse event data were recorded systematical ly for both groups. Secondary outcome: other adverse events Matzen 1998 measured pain during treatment on a scale from 1 to 4. The median score and associated range for both groups was the same: median 2 (range 1 to 3). Mulder 1993 reported limited adverse event data (summarised in Table 2 ). It was not clear how these data were collected and whether all events were reported. The extracted data are not considere d further. Summary: hydrogel dressings compared with basic wound contact dressings (3 trials; 106 participants) The relative effects of hydrogel dressings and basic wound con tact dressings are unclear as there are very few comparative data av ail- able. The trials included are small, report very limited outco me data and are at an unclear or high risk of bias. One small study reported a greater mean reduction in ulcer size in the hydrogel group compared with the basic wound contact dressing group. Comparison 2: hydrogel dressings compared with hydrocolloid dressings (3 trials; unable to calculate numbe r of studies hydrogel ). tri- als included two different named brands of hydrogel dressing and an unspecic hydrogel dressing - all three studies used the sa me hydrocolloid dressing as a comparator ( Table 1 ). The follow-up times for the studies were nine weeks ( Darkovich 1990 ); and eight 17 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.weeks ( Motta 1999 ;Mulder 1993 ).Darkovich 1990 was classed as being at a high risk of bias due to unit of analyses issues. Mulder 1993 was classed as being at a high risk of reporting bias. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) T wo of the three studies presented data on complete wound heal - ing. A graph presented by Darkovich 1990 reported that 32% of stage II pressure ulcers were healed in the hydrogel dressing group com- pared with 16% in the hydrocolloid dressing group. However, t his trial recruited participants with more than one ulcer wound and data were presented at the wound level rather than at particip ant level. Additionally the study does not report how many peopl e with a stage II ulcer were randomised, so, while we report the percentage data here, we do not have access to the gures used to calculate these. We were unable to contact the study authors to clarify these issues, and as a result of these issues, the data from this trial are not considered further here. Motta 1999 reported that 40% (2/5) of participants in the hydro- gel dressing group had a healed ulcer and 40% (2/5) in the hydro- colloid dressing group also had a healed ulcer: RR 1.00, (95% CI 0.22 to 4.56; Analysis 2.1 ). This study was very small and under- powered; there was high imprecision so the result is compatibl e with both increased and decreased healing with hydrogel dress ings relative to hydrocolloid dressings. Secondary outcome: change in wound size T wo of the three studies present data on adjusted change in wou nd size. Darkovich 1990 reported a 64% reduction in wound area (com- pared to baseline) in the hydrogel dressing group and a reduct ion of 34% in the hydrocolloid dressing group. The data limitatio ns (the number of participants with a stage II pressure ulcer was no t reported) as well as the lack of data on variation around the po int estimate precluded further analysis. It is known that this tr ial has unit of analyses issues so these data should be treated with ca ution. Mulder 1993 : reported a mean 8% (SD 14.8) per week reduction in wound size (compared to baseline) in the hydrogel dressing group and a 3.3% (SD 32.7) per week reduction for the hydrocol- loid dressing group: mean difference (MD) 4.70, to 20.12; Analysis 2.2 ). Secondary outcome: other adverse events Mulder 1993 report limited adverse event data (summarised in Table 2 ). It was not clear how these data were collected and whether all events were reported. The reported data were considered t o be limited and so are not considered further in this review.Secondary outcome: costs Motta 1999 reported a mean cost of treatment of USD 57.76 (SD 18.9) in the hydrogel dressing group and USD 91.48 (SD 31.5) in the hydrocolloid dressing group: mean difference g hydrogel) CI -65.92 to -1.52; Analysis 2.3 ). These costs were reported to include the number of dressings us ed per participant multiplied by the unit cost of the dressing plu s the cost of labour time per dressing. Whilst this is a statistica lly signicant difference, there is huge imprecision around the tr eat- ment estimate with 95% CIs suggesting that the difference coul d be as large as USD 66 or as small as USD 1.5. Additionally these cost data alone are of limited value in the absence good evidence regarding any potential harms or benets that the dressings may cause. hydrocolloid dressings (3 trials; number participants unknown) The relative effects of hydrogels and hydrocolloids for the he al- ing of pressure ulcers are unclear due to the lack of good quality comparative data. The three included trials were small, with s hort follow-up periods, were at an unclear of bias and reported limi ted outcome data. One study reported lower mean participant costs with hydrogel. Comparison 3: one brand of hydrogel dressings compared with another hydrogel dressing (3 trials; 138 participants) Three studies compared one brand of hydrogel dressing with an - other brand 1998b ;Young Bale ;Bale 1998b ), ). We classed Bale 1998b as being at a high risk of attrition bias. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) None of the three studies included in this comparison reported on complete wound healing. Secondary outcome: change in ulcer size Young 1996 reported mean proportion reduction per day in wound size (compared to baseline) (see Table 2 ). No information regarding variation around the mean gures (e.g. SD ) were pre - sented, so we have not considered the data further. Secondary outcome: wound infection Bale 1998a reported no cases of wound infection (0/26) in one hydrogel dressing group and 12.5% (3/24) in the other hydroge l dressing group: RR 0.13, (95% CI 0.01 to 2.44; Analysis 3.1 ). 18 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Secondary outcome: other adverse events Bale 1998a reported that 41.6% (10/24) of the participants in one hydrogel dressing group reported no wound-related pain at st udy end compared with 21.7% (5/23) in the other hydrogel group: that 77% of participants (17/22) in hydrogel Group A had no pain on dressing removal compared with 65% (13/20) in hydrogel Group B: RR 1.76; Analysis 3.3 ). Bale 1998b reported a median pain score on dressing application using a 1 to 4 scale (it was not clear whether this is a validated measure). The median for both groups was 1 (range 1 to 3; Table 2). Young 1996 reported no treatment-related adverse events in either group during the study. Secondary outcome: resource use Young 1996 reported mean dressing wear times for each hydrogel group ( Table 2 ). No information regarding variation around the mean gures (e.g. SD) were presented, so we have not considered the data further. Summary: one brand of hydrogel dressings compared with another hydrogel dressing (3 trials; 138 participants) There are very few comparative data available to assess the re lative treatment effects of different hydrogel dressings. Included trials are small, have short follow-up periods are at unclear of bias and r eport limited outcome data with no study reporting data on complete wound healing. Based on this current evidence base there is no evidence of a difference between hydrogel dressings in terms o f adverse events, but available information is very limited. Comparison 4: hydrogel dressings compared with foam dressings (1 trial; 34 participants with 38 wounds) One study compared a hydrogel dressing with a foam dressing (Sopata 2002 ;Table 1 ), it had an eight-week follow-up and we classed it as being at a high risk of bias due to unit of analysis issues. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) Fifteen pressure ulcers were reported as healed in both the hy drogel dressing group and the hydrocolloid dressing group. However , the trialists recruited participants with more than one ulcer a nd presented data at the wound level rather than at participant l evel. Presenting data at the ulcer level means that 75% (15/20) of ulce rs healed in the hydrogel group compared with 83% (15/18) in the foam dressing group. However, because of the unit of analysisissues with this analysis and a lack of further information, w e have not considered the data further here. No other outcomes were reported. Summary: hydrogel dressings compared with foam dressings (1 trial; 34 participants with 38 wounds) There were no clear data available for this comparison. Comparison 5: hydrogel dressings compared with dextranomer paste dressings (1 trial; 135 participants) One study compared a hydrogel dressing with dextranomer past e dressing ( Colin 1996 ). This trial was at unclear risk of bias ( Figure 2) and had a three-week follow-up. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) The one study included in this comparison did not report on complete wound healing. Secondary outcome: change in ulcer size Colin 1996 reported mean proportion reduction in wound area at 21 days (compared to baseline) ( Table 2 ). Only range data and no information regarding variation around the mean gures (e .g. SD) were presented, so we did not consider the data further. Secondary outcome - adverse events: Colin 1996 reported limited adverse events. The information has been extracted in Table 2 but is not considered further. Summary: hydrogel dressings compared with dextranomer paste dressings There was one study that compared hydrogel dressings with dex - tranomer paste dressings. The study was small, had a short fo llow- up time, was at unclear of bias and reported limited outcome dat a. There was little data that could contribute usefully to this re view. Dressing compared with topical treatment Comparison 6: hydrogel dressings compared with collagenase (1 trial; 27 participants) One small study with 84-day follow-up compared a hydrogel dress - ing with collagenase ( Milne 2012 ). We classed the study as being at a high risk of attrition bias, as only wounds debrided by da y 42 were followed for the remaining follow-up period. Thus of the 14 participants randomised to hydrogel dressings, only four ha d been 19 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Thus for outcomes following debridemen t these data are highly compromised and could be considered non- randomised. Primary outcome: complete wound healing (proportion of ulcers healed during follow-up) Milne 2012 reported that three participants healed in the hydro- gel group (14 participants) compared with nine in the collagenas e group (13 participants). However only a sub-group of those ran- domised were followed up to this point for this outcome, so the se data must be interpreted with caution. Summary: hydrogel dressings compared with collagenase (1 trial; 27 participants) Only one study compared hydrogel dressings with collagenase; it was small, at a high risk of attrition bias and presented very limited data. 'Summary of ndings' tablesWe planned to present an overview; synthesis of the volume an d quality of the evidence is presented in 'Summary of ndings' t able for each of the dressing comparisons for following outcomes: time to complete ulcer healing where the data were analysed using appropriate survival analysis methods; proportion of ulcers completely healing during the trial period; and, adverse events. Due to limitations in the reported data, we were only able to i n- clude estimates of complete healing and adverse events as deta iled below.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results This review includes all available RCT evidence evaluating hy - drogel dressings to treat pressure ulcers. The review include s 11 studies with a total of 523 participants that were relevant to the review. The studies compared hydrogel dressings with six dif ferent and a collagenase topical application. O ver- all the evidence found was limited: included studies were smal l and therefore statistically underpowered to detect treatmen t differ- ences, should they exist. The volume and quality of reported d ata were also limited. For example the primary outcome for this re view was complete wound healing, and data concerning the propor- tion of wounds healed were presented in ve studies ( Darkovich 1990 ;Milne 2012 ;Motta 1999 ;Sopata 2002 ;Thomas 1998 ). In Darkovich 1990 it was not clear how many participants had stage II pressure ulcers so the data had limited usability. Sopata 2002 also had unit of analysis issues. In Milne 2012 healing data were only presented for a sub-set of those randomised, so again we did no t deem analysis of these data to be appropriate. From the remai ning available data there was no evidence of a difference in numbers of healed wounds for the hydrogel dressing groups and either the basic wound contact dressings or hydrocolloid dressings. Quality of the evidence Limitations of design and implementation RCTs need to be adequately powered so that they are able to detect treatment effects of a specied size, if they exist. This means that sample size calculations should be used to help estimate t he number of people recruited to a trial. Additionally trials sh ould have an adequate follow-up period so that there is enough time for important outcome events, such as complete wound healing, to occur.The trials included in this study were all small and the ir follow-up periods were generally short which limited the numb er of healing events that took place and ruled out assessment of o ther potentially important outcomes such as recurrence. This result ed in an evidence base that is underpowered and can only report imprecise ndings with wide condence intervals. All studies included study in this review were of high or unclea r risk of bias. In general, the studies did not follow good pract ice, as laid out in conduct and reporting guidelines e.g. CONSORT ( Schulz 2010 ). Key areas of good practice are: the robust generation of a randomisation sequence, for example, computer-generated randomisation; robust allocation concealment, for example th e use of a telephone randomisation service; and, where possibl e,blinded outcome assessment. All this information should be cl early stated in the study report as all trial authors should anticip ate the inclusion of their trials in systematic reviews. Additional ly studies should report clearly how they plan to collect adverse events da ta and how this process will be standardised for both/all treatm ent arms. In terms of analysis, where possible, data from all par ticipants should be included, that is, an intention to treat analysis sh ould be conducted, and measures of variation such as the SD or standard error should be presented around measures where appropriat e. Steps should be taken during trial conduct to prevent missing d ata, as far as is possible. Potential biases in the review process The review considered as much evidence as it was possible to ob- tain, including studies that were not published in English la nguage journals. It is possible that there may be unpublished data t hat we have not been able to access. There is a potential for publicatio n bias, however, this is likely to be a limited issue in this rev iew given the large number of negative ndings that have been publishe d. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews No other reviews have presented data on hydrogel gel dressin gs as transparently as they are presented here. Our ndings do gen erally agree with the conclusion of a large review that looked at sever al treatments for pressure ulcers and concluded that, \" No single dress- ing was consistently superior to other dressings in the tria ls of pressure ulcers we examined \" (Reddy 2008 ). In relation to dressings, the re- cent National Institue of Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NI CE) Pressue Ulcer Guidelines state that \" a dressing for adults that pro- motes a warm, moist wound healing environment to treat grade 2, 3 and 4 pressure ulcers \" should be considered ( NICE 2014 ).The NICE review included all the studies included here, but this re - view includes three additional studies that were not included in the NICE review ( Bale 1998a ;Bale 1998b ;Young 1996 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice A comprehensive review of current evidence did not nd reliable evidence that hydrogel dressings either increase or decrease t he healing pressure ulcers compared with other dressings. Practi tion- ers may therefore elect to consider other characteristics such as costs and symptom management properties when choosing be- tween dressings. 28 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Implications for research Currently there is no evidence of a difference in ulcer healing b e- tween hydrogel dressings and the other dressings and topical treat- ments that have been evaluated. In terms of dressing choice, an y investment in future research must maximise its value to decis ion- makers. Given the large number of dressing options, the desi gn of future trials should be driven by the questions of high prior ity to patients and other decision makers. It is also important for r esearch to ensure that the outcomes that are collected in research studie s are those that matter to patients, carers and health professi onals. Where trials are conducted, good practice guidelines must be fol- lowed in their design, implementation and reporting. Furth er re- views are being conducted to synthesise evidence regarding the ef- fect of other dressings on the treatment of pressure ulcers . It would then be useful to conduct further evidence synthesis (overviews of reviews, network meta-analysis or both) to aid decision-makin gabout the choice of dressings for pressure ulcers across all dres sing options.

Was the allocation sequence randomly generated? Low risk of bias The investigators describe a random component in the sequence g eneration process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random-number generator; coin tossing; shuffling car ds or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots. High risk of bias The investigators describe a non-random component in the seque nce generation process. Usually, the description would involv e some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence genera ted by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rul e based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Unclear Insufcient information about the sequence generation proces s provided to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias. 2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed? Low risk of bias Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equ ivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central ing telephone, web-based and ce; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. High risk of bias Participants or investigators enrolling participants could p ossibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bia s, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list o f random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without ap propriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or n ot sequentially-numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. 68 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Unclear Insufcient information provided to permit a judgement of lo w or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of co ncealment is not described or not described in sufcient detail to allow a d enite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envel opes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequ entially-numbered, opaque and sealed. 3. Blinding - was knowledge of the allocated interventions a dequately prevented during the study? Low risk of bias Any one of the following. No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome measurement are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, an d unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding o f others was unlikely to introduce bias. High risk of bias Any one of the following. No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome m easurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken. Either participants or some key study personnel were not blin ded, and the non-blinding of others was likely to introduce bia s. Unclear Either of the following. Insufcient information provided to permit a judgement of lo w or high risk of bias. The study did not address this outcome. 4. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? Low risk of bias Any one of the following. No missing outcome data. Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to tru e outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introduci ng bias). Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention g roups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimat e. For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference i n means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on ob served effect size. Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. High risk of bias Any one of the following. Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true ou tcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups. For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcom es compared with observed event risk was enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate. 69 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference i n means or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes was enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observ ed effect size. 'As-treated' analysis done with substantial departure of th e intervention received from that assigned at randomisation . Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputatio n. Unclear Either of the following. Insufcient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit a ju dgement of low or high risk of bias (e.g. number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided). The study did not address this outcome. 5. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective ou tcome reporting? Low risk of bias Either of the following. The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre-speci ed (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specied way. The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the publ ished reports include all expected outcomes, including those th at were pre-specied (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). High risk of bias Any one of the following. Not all of the study's pre-specied primary outcomes have been r eported. One or more primary outcomes are reported using measurements , analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specied. One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specied (unl ess clear justication for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect). One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported inco mpletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis. The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study. Unclear Insufcient information provided to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. 6. Other sources of potential bias Low risk of bias The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. High risk of bias There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study: had a potential source of bias related to the specic study desi gn used; or has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or had some other problem. 70 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Unclear There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: insufcient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or insufcient rationale or evidence that an identied problem w ill introduce bias. Appendix 3. Assessment of risk of bias (cluster randomised control led trials) T ypes of bias in cluster-randomised trials In cluster-randomised trials, particular biases to consider in clude: recruitment bias; baseline imbalance; loss of clusters; incorrect analysis; and comparability with individually randomised trials. 1. Recruitment bias Recruitment bias can occur when individuals are recruited to the t rial after the clusters have been randomised, as knowledge ab out whether each cluster is an 'intervention' or 'control' cluster co uld affect the types of participants recruited. 2. Baseline imbalance Cluster-randomised trials often randomise all clusters at on ce, so lack of concealment of an allocation sequence should not usua lly be an issue. However, because small numbers of clusters are rando mised, there is a possibility of chance baseline imbalance betw een the randomised groups, in terms of either the clusters or the indi viduals. Although this is not a form of bias, as such, the risk o f baseline differences can be reduced by using stratied or pair-matched ran domisation of clusters. Reporting of the baseline comparabil ity of clusters, or statistical adjustment for baseline characterist ics, can help reduce concern about the effects of baseline imbalance . 3. Loss of clusters Occasionally complete clusters are lost from a trial, and have to be omitted from the analysis. Just as for missing outcome data in individually-randomised trials, this may lead to bias. In ad dition, missing outcomes for individuals within clusters may also lead to a risk of bias in cluster-randomised trials. 4. Incorrect analysis Many cluster-randomised trials are analysed by incorrect stati stical methods, that do not take the clustering into account. Such analyses create a 'unit of analysis error' and produce over-precise resul ts (the standard error of the estimated intervention effect is too small) and P values that are too small. They do not lead to biased estimat es of effect, but if they remain uncorrected, they will receive to o much weight in a meta-analysis. 5. Comparability with individually randomised trials In a meta-analysis including both cluster- and individually-ra ndomised trials, or including cluster-randomised trials with different types of clusters, possible differences between the intervention e ffects being estimated need to be considered. For example, in a vaccine trial of infectious diseases, a vaccine applied to all individuals in a community would be expected to be more effective than if the vacci ne was applied to only half of the people. Another example is pro vided by a Cochrane review of hip protectors ( Hahn 2005 ). The cluster trials showed a large positive effect, whereas individually -randomised trials did not show any clear benet. One possibil ity is that there was a 'herd effect' in the cluster-randomised trials (which were o ften performed in nursing homes, where compliance with using t he protectors may have been enhanced). In general, such 'contaminat ion' would lead to underestimates of effect. Thus, if an inter vention 71 Hydrogel dressings for treating pressure ulcers (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.effect is still demonstrated despite contamination in those t rials that were not cluster-randomised, a condent conclusion ab out the presence of an effect can be drawn. However, the size of the effect is likely to be underestimated. Contamination and 'herd eff ects' may be different for different types of cluster. Appendix 4.
