This work would not have been possible without the efforts of many people. First, I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Prof. Inge Huter, my initial supervisor, who saw in me the potential to be a good scientist and provided me with an opportunity to get where I am today. Inge, I thank you so much. I would also like to express my utmost appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Hinke Haisma, and co-supervisor, Dr. Ajay Bailey, for their enthusiasm, support, encouragement and supervision of this work from its inception to the end, particularly when I encountered various difficult situations. I don't know where I would have been without your patience, thoroughness and unwavering belief that I could do it! Hinke, you have been there for me tirelessly since my first time in Groningen. You provided me with your invaluable suggestions that lit up my path in the dark moments and unceasingly encouraged and supported me in all the processes necessary to get me through the rigours of this PhD thesis. Together with Dr. Ajay, we had invaluable meetings that contributed immensely to the study and broadened my perspectives. As a team, each of you helped me to grow by allowing me independence and, at the same time, guiding me to new ideas. You had immense faith in me, always believing that I could do more: \"You can do better, think more... Give it time\". These words not only challenged me but also served as an inspiration that propelled me to greater heights. They helped me navigate even the toughest times in the PhD pursuit. From you I have learned to step down and think critically about the community's point of view. On the whole, I have benefited greatly from having direct access to your wisdom and kindness as my supervisors. Indeed, I could not have asked for more: I had supervisors who were more than supportive. I thank you very much indeed. Dr. Ajay, I also thank you for allowing me to observe your teachings during the NOHA master's course. This privilege accorded me an opportunity to acquire teaching skills and get acquainted with the world of academia. Your advice in both research and my career has been priceless, thank you.

Despite the decrease, infectious diseases continue to dominate in SSA [2]. With the epidemiological, nutritional and demographic transitions alongside the increasing life expectancy, poverty, urbanization and globalization, non-communicable diseases are posing yet another threat to these communities. Indeed, while in 2013, 128 million people were infected with malaria in the Africa region [3], the number of African residents with diabetes reached 19.8 million in the same year [4]. This number of diabetes patients is projected to rise to 41.4 million by 2035 if appropriate measures are not taken [4]. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority (90-95 per cent) of the diabetes cases [5], and is mostly affecting adults [6]. Diabetes is responsible for 8.6 per cent of all deaths among adults aged 20-79 years in the African region [4]. This picture of Africa also applies to Tanzania. Infectious and non-communicable diseases coexist. Malaria remains a threat to the health of the Tanzanians [7, 8], accounting for over 30 per cent of the national disease burden [9]. According to the Tanzania Health System Assessment report 2010, malaria was responsible for 34 per cent of all people aged 5 years and above attending consultations in public health facilities, and for 28 per cent of the top 10 causes of in-hospital deaths in the same age group [10]. While the Tanzanian communities are in the middle of grappling with the persisting infectious diseases such as malaria, diabetes is emerging as another health concern. Diabetes is evolving rapidly in the country [11] and seriously challenging not only the health system's capacity to manage the condition [12] but also the communities and the individuals who face both the physiological, economic, social and the psychological sufferings of the chronic NCDs. Thus, the general burden of diabetes - on the health system [11], the communities, and families - is alarming [13]. Considering that most of the type 2 diabetes patients are asymptomatic during early stages of the condition [14], the actual number of people in the country unknowingly living with the condition is unclear. Because malaria and diabetes are causing so much misery and suffering to the Tanzanians and have such a widespread negative impact, it is important to understand the current policy environment, the health system and the community responses against these illnesses in order to shed light on how these health constituencies could be adapted in response to the rising NCDs, including diabetes.16 Chapter 11.1 Epidemiology of malaria in Tanzania In Tanzania, almost everyone is at risk of contracting malaria [15]. Tanzania is the country with the 3rd largest population at risk of malaria in Africa after Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo [16]. However, the country has great variation on malaria endemicity and transmission risks due to differing rainfall patterns, altitude, and temperature [17]. This variation suggests that 75 per cent of the population is prone to stable perennial or stable seasonal malaria transmission; 8 per cent to unstable highly seasonal transmission and 17 per cent to no malaria transmission in the average year (but still at risk of epidemic malaria). However, the available national statistics indicate a dramatic decline of malaria incidences over the last decade as a result of the expansion and intensification of malaria control programmes [15]. For example, the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys (TDHS) indicate a successive fall in the number of fevers, a common indicator of perceived malaria, from 35.1 per cent in 1999 to 24.4 per cent in 2004 to 22.9 per cent in 2010 [18-20]. Similarly, the national representative survey on malaria indicators shows that malaria prevalence in children 6-59 months old halved (from 18.1 per cent to 9.5 per cent) between 2008 and 2012, with higher declines seen more in urban than in rural areas [21, 22]. Across Tanzania, between 2000 and 2010, there has generally been a greater than 50 per cent reduction in predicted mean population-adjusted parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years (malaria strategic plan 2014 - 2020). Despite such observed trends, malaria is still an important cause of health facility utilization in both children and adults in the country [7, 8]. As children aged under five years continue to be the most susceptible age group to malaria, the recent literature shows a shift in the level of malaria infection to the older age groups [23, 24]. Additionally, the observed changes in mosquito biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor biting [25], is also thought to have increased adults' susceptibility to contracting malaria. With this in mind, sustaining the lifesaving gains achieved with malaria control efforts and to continue reducing the malaria risks in the community, prompt, effective and appropriate health care-seeking behaviour is required on the part of every patient. This is because delays in appropriate treatment for malaria have the potential of increasing malaria transmission, as the parasite infection pool is maintained longer than necessary. Additionally, delays in treatment and management can allow malaria to rapidly develop into severe and complicated forms of the disease with fatal consequences to the patients. Therefore, understanding the people's perspectives on malaria, their experiences with the condition, and their motives in terms of seeking treatments in the context of decreasing malaria trends is crucial not only for informing development of such disease control interventions, but also for enhancing health care-seeking behaviour practices in the community.17 Introduction1.2 Epidemiology of diabetes in Tanzania In recent years, diabetes has evolved to become one of the most serious public health concerns in Tanzania. Its prevalence has risen steadily in both urban and rural areas from 0.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent in the 1980's to 4 per cent and 1.3 per cent in 2000 respectively [11]. In 2003 diabetes prevalence reached 5.4 per cent in urban and 1.7 per cent in rural areas [26]. Ten years later, a national population survey reported the prevalence of diabetes to have reached 9.1 per cent among adults aged 24-65 years and at roughly equal rates between men and women and in urban and rural areas [27]. The recent International Diabetes Federation estimates indicated that by 2013, 1.7 million Tanzanians were living with diabetes and the number is projected to double by the year 2030 [4]. Although the reported statistics on diabetes in the country are alarming, a population-based survey in one urban district of Dar es Salaam city and one rural village in Kilimanjaro region indicated that more than 80 per cent of the people with diabetes were not aware of their diabetes status [28]. Most people with diabetes are unaware of the signs and symptoms of the condition, leading to late presentation at the health facilities and initiation of care and management [11]. Consequently, many diabetes patients remain unreported and die undiagnosed and prematurely because they cannot survive long without treatments [29]. It is therefore important to understand from the people themselves what underlies diabetes perspectives in the community - the meanings ascribed to the emerging symptoms and the intricate relationship it forms - in order to shape individuals' health-seeking behaviour including medication use, as well as their day-to-day life with the illness. Such information could contribute to the formulation of context-adaptive interventions; to the improvement of the awareness and knowledge of the disease's signs and symptoms; to the strengthening of prompt and appropriate health-seeking behaviour in the community; and to the provision of the necessary social and psychological support to the patients and their families. 1.3 Health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes Literature on malaria health-seeking behaviour in Tanzania suggests that peoples' responses to malaria depend on the perceptions about the illness symptoms and their aetiologies [30-32]; perceived severity of the illness [33, 34]; perceptions on the quality and effectiveness of the treatments [35]; access to the health care services [36, 37]; and household socioeconomic characteristics [38-40]. It also recognizes that most people with malaria in the country practice self-medication and treatment with the use of medicines from the drug shops and or medicines remaining from their previous malaria treatments [33, 40-44], and that medical professionals are only consulted when the illness symptoms persist or worsen [32, 43], which results in delays in initiating prompt, appropriate and effective treatments [45]. Despite the 18 Chapter 1relevance of this literature in understanding malaria health-seeking behaviour, the literature does not help our understanding about the underlying decision-making processes with respect to malaria health-seeking behaviour. Of specific concern is the information on why people choose self-medication for malaria - What are the motives for the use of the medicines from the drug shops? These issues are crucial, especially nowadays, because despite the reports on reduction of malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality, malaria is still an important cause of ill-health and health facility utilization [7, 8]. Non malaria fevers such as typhoid, urinary tract infection (UTI) and dengue fever are increasingly being reported in Tanzania [46, 47]. Therefore, to reduce prolonged illness in patients and improve their treatment outcomes, it is important to ensure that all febrile illnesses including malaria are promptly and effectively treated. A deeper understanding about the motives underlying peoples' decision-making process for malaria self-medication and the use of drug shop services has the potential to contribute to the development of context-adaptive interventions for informed decision-making processes on malaria treatments in the community. Although malaria and diabetes have different aetiologies, manifest differently and require different modes of treatment and management, the two diseases occur in the same communities and may coexist within the same households and or individuals. The coexistence of these conditions adds stress to the already stressed communities in terms of resource allocations for their health care-seeking behaviour and management, and the increased burden of care on the households and families. It also increases the emotional, psychological and the physiological pain for the sick individuals and their family members. Yet insufficient information is available on how health-seeking behaviour for diabetes is framed in the context of malaria as a predominant illness in rural settings. To develop more context- adaptive interventions for their prevention and control, it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the communities' own points of view - firstly on how these diseases are perceived in the community and the experiences that are encountered, and secondly, on the meanings ascribed to the emerging symptoms and the linkage they form to shape health- seeking behaviour, as well as on the reasons for the responses that are made. Because of their differential nature in acuteness and chronicity, the interplay formed by the socio-cultural aspects on malaria health-seeking behaviour might not be the same as for diabetes. Whereas prompt and effective health care-seeking behaviour for malaria could lead to a cure, this is not the case with diabetes. After its clinical manifestation, diabetes requires patients to continue with the use of the medications and management of the condition and or lifestyle changes. This requires a change from curative health care-seeking behaviour to prompt and appropriate management of the condition, including probable lifestyle change 19 Introductionpractices and continuation of care. Thus, understanding of diabetes health-seeking behaviour is crucial for encouraging the continuity of care - including medication use continuity - and for strengthening care continuity in the communities in general. Health-seeking behaviour studies on diabetes in Tanzania are uncommon. The existing studies have assessed self-care and educational needs among diabetes patients [48]; health- seeking behaviour and related behaviour for type 2 diabetes [49]; and diabetes health-seeking behaviour and medical pluralism [13]. While these studies provided us with the relevant information on diabetes treatments, they are all concentrated in urban areas, reflecting the popular belief that diabetes is a disease affecting those living in urban settings [28, 50]. Such a focus does not help our understanding of how it is to experience a chronic NCD such as diabetes in rural areas. Social science literature detailing how diabetes is conceived in the rural settings of Tanzania and the motivations for health-seeking behaviour among patients is scarce. This study generates knowledge that contributes to filling that research gap. Understanding what underlies diabetes patients' decision making processes and the resultant health-seeking behaviour practices will contribute to developing context-adaptive interventions for disease control and strategies for strengthening community responses to diseases in the country. 1.4 Research objectives and questions Human actions and practices are shaped by the cultural context in which they occur. Understanding individuals' health-seeking behaviour thus requires an understanding of the cultural aspects that shape the practices. Cognitive and behavioural change theories such as the concept of Cultural Schemas [51] and the Health Belief Model - HBM [52] were applied in the study to allow a better understanding of the intricate relationship between the processes underlying individual behaviours when seeking health care. Using these theoretical underpinnings, the overall objective of the study was: To explore the cultural aspects shaping health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes among adults in Tanzania, a country that is undergoing the epidemiological transition. Several specific objectives and research questions followed from this overall objective: 1. Guided by the following research question, a narrative review was conducted in order to provide an inventory of how the existing policy environment, health system and community platforms are addressing the NCD situation in the country:20 Chapter 1How can the existing public policy environment, health system and community actions against illnesses be used as platforms for NCD responses in Tanzania? (Chapter four) 2. Studies on community responses to illnesses such as malaria suggest that self-medication and treatment with medicines bought at a retail shop is a common initial action when individuals experience ill health. To gain deeper insight into why people choose self-care practices in malaria treatment and the motives for the choice of drug shop services, the following research question was developed: How do the underlying cultural motives shape adults' decision-making processes in their choice of malaria self-care practices? (Chapter five) 3. The new challenges in public health have arisen with the emergence of chronic non- communicable diseases such as diabetes. The following research question was developed in order to grasp - via an emic perspective - how the communities assign meanings to the emerging symptoms, and the intricate relationship these meanings form to shape individuals' health-seeking behaviour: How does the underlying cultural context inform the meaning given to the emerging diabetes symptoms, and how do these meanings shape the individuals' health seeking behaviour practices? (Chapter six) 4. To gain insight into behaviour aspects shaping diabetes medication use experiences and continuity of use, the following research question was developed: How do the underlying cultural motives shape diabetes patients' decision-making processes and their experiences regarding diabetes medication use and continuity of use? (Chapter seven) 5. Despite their differential nature in aetiology and management, malaria and diabetes occur in the same communities and sometimes coexist in the same households and or individuals. To better understand the illness experiences of diabetes in a context where malaria is a predominant illness, the following research question was formulated: How is diabetes experienced in a context where malaria is a predominant illness? (Chapter Eight)21 IntroductionTo provide in-depth information on the study's objectives and to answer the specific research questions, a narrative review was conducted to document the existing policies, health system practices, and community responses to NCD prevention and control. In addition, fieldwork was conducted with (i) people in the community, (ii) malaria and/or diabetes patients, (iii) neighbours and/or people related to diabetes patients, and (iv) family members of diabetes patients. 1.5 Outline of the thesis The theoretical framework of the PhD project, presented in chapter two, is based on a behaviour change theory: the Health Belief Model (HBM) is used as a guide in understanding individuals' decision-making processes involving their health, specifically their responses to malaria and diabetes. One of the critiques of the HBM is its simplistic or narrow focus on individuals and their tendency to act based on what they know [53]; it thus fails to account for the social context in which the individual behaviour is embedded. In view of the criticism and to increase the likelihood of the model succeeding to illuminate how cultural aspects in the community shape health-seeking behaviour, the cognitive anthropological perspectives of the Cultural Schemas [51] was integrated into the components from the HBM. This combined conceptual framework is presented towards the end of the chapter (section 2.4) followed by an account of the theories that aided data interpretation during the analysis. Chapter three presents the research methodology. A detailed description of the study area and population is provided, followed by a description of the study design. The chapter also provides explanations of the data collection methods (section 3.6) that were applied in the study. Data analysis processes (section 3.8) and a reflection on the field work and the researchers' positionality ( section 3.10 ) is provided towards the end of the chapter. The chapter on platforms for responses to NCDs in Tanzania (Research question 1, chapter four; article published in Global Health Actions) provides a detailed account of how the existing public policy, health system and community actions against illnesses can be used as platforms for responses to the emerging NCDs. A discussion on how NCD research and policy agenda can be moved forward is provided. Chapter five (Research question 2; article published in Malaria Journal ) discusses the underlying motives for malaria self-care in the communities. Both individual and health facility characteristics are indicated as important aspects informing self-care practices for malaria in the study. Chapter six (Research question 3; article published in BMC Public Health ) discusses how the communities use the prevailing cultural meaning systems on infectious diseases to inform the emerging diabetes symptoms, 22 Chapter 1which in turn influences their health care-seeking behaviour. Chapter seven (Research question 4; article published in BMC Health Services Research ) discusses the lived experiences with respect to medication use and continuity among diabetes patients in settings of limited access to medicines. Bringing together the findings in the previous chapters and considering the different natures of the two illnesses in terms of acuteness versus chronicity, Chapter eight (Research question 5; article submitted to international peer-reviewed journal ) discusses the illness experiences of diabetes in the context of malaria as a predominant condition. As the final chapter, chapter nine then ties the research together and sets forth the contribution it makes to understanding health-seeking behaviour in communities with the double burden of malaria and diabetes in Tanzania. Theoretical and methodological reflections, as well as implications of the study findings, recommendations for policy and public health, and suggestions for community initiatives and future research directions are also included in this conclusion to the research.

In this study the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the concept of Cultural Schemas were applied in guiding the line of inquiry on adults' health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes in a rural setting. This chapter presents the HBM and describes the different components of the model ( section 2.2 ), followed by an explanation of the concept of Cultural Schemas ( section 2.3 ). Then a conceptual framework ( section 2.4 ) is presented which incorporates the various theoretical concepts that guided the study. The last section of the chapter ( section 2.5 ) provides an account of the additional theories that aided interpretation of the data during the analysis process. 2.2 Health Belief Model (HBM) 'Health seeking' is a conditioned behaviour, so any attempt to encourage people to seek care requires an understanding of their motivation for such behaviour. Only through a deeper understanding of the intricate factors shaping behavioural practices can health promotion programmes and or interventions successfully be introduced into the realities of the people's lives to bring about changes in health behaviour. Behaviour change theories and models such as the Health Belief Model (HBM) [1]; Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) [2]; Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [3]; and the Transtheoretical Model [4] have been widely applied in public health in an attempt to explain or predict health-seeking behaviours [5, 6]. Their use enables identification and understanding of people's health-seeking behaviour beyond their knowledge, attitudes and practices [5]. Although most of these theories and models share many of the components [7], HBM is a health-specific behavioural cognitive model [8, 9]. Originating in the 1950's, the HBM was created by the US Public Health Service Department to explain why public health preventive services were not successful [10]. The use of the model was later expanded for insight into compliance with medical prescriptions [10-12]. The central posits of the HBM are based on the beliefs that \"behaviour is a function of the subjective value of an outcome and of the subjective probability or expectation that a particular action will achieve that outcome [13]. The model is based on the idea that people are more likely to change their behaviour [14] and adhere to treatments [10, 12] if: (i) they perceive that they are at risk of contracting the disease (perceived susceptibility), (ii) they perceive the disease might have an unfavourable outcome (perceived severity), (iii) they perceive the proposed health behaviour to be both effective and practical (perceived benefits), (iv) they perceive the barriers to adopting the behaviour to be minimal (perceived barriers), (v) they perceive themselves to have the ability of applying and practicing the specific 30 30 Chapter 2behaviour proposed (perceived self-efficacy), and (vi) they have the cues for motivating their actions such as internal cues (pain, symptoms, past experiences) or external cues (advice from friends, relatives and mass media campaigns) (cues to action). The specificity of the HBM to health made it suitable for use in understanding and explaining the behaviour vis-\u00e0- vis health outcomes - and this may also explain its wider use in public health [5, 15, 16]. The HBM components are considered in this study to be useful in assessing risk perceptions with respect to malaria and diabetes as well as in explaining the individual decision-making processes as regards the health-seeking behaviour for these conditions. The HBM has been successfully applied to predict health behaviours across several diseases and conditions among adults [10, 17-19]. Specifically, the model has been applied to help increase voluntary screening rates for cervical cancer [20] and on cancer support group participation [19]; breast self-examination [21], chronic disease management [22], adult physical activity practices [23], smoking cessations [24], predicting the uptake of vaccinations [25], HIV prevention and risk perceptions [26, 27], and osteoporosis prevention [28], to mention a few. Despite HBM being primarily a behaviour change model, in this study the HBM model is applied to explain the health-seeking behaviour of malaria and diabetes among adults. Although many studies that used the model applied the model as a whole without separating out its various components, in this study different components of the model are applied separately to examine individuals' own risk assessment, decision-making processes, and continuity of medication use. Risk perceptions were examined by assessing the individuals' perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of the diseases. Decision-making processes were assessed through exploring the perceived barriers and perceived benefits of adopting specific health- seeking behaviours including medication use continuity. The following sub-sections elaborate the components of the model as adapted in the study ( see Figure 2.1 ). 2.2.1 Perceived susceptibility Perceived susceptibility is one of the influential factors that motivate people to practice healthier behaviours. It refers to individuals' own beliefs regarding the risk of contracting an illness; the greater the perceived susceptibility, the greater the likelihood of engaging in behaviours to decrease the susceptibility [29, p. 66]. For example, to make the decision to seek and continue with care, a person must first perceive him/herself to be as susceptible to contract malaria or diabetes. The greater the perceived susceptibility, the more likely health- seeking decisions will be made. 31 31 Theoretical framework2.2.2 Perceived severity This refers to individuals' beliefs about the severity or the consequences the disease might have on him/her if actions are not taken [29, p. 65]. Perceived severity is also shaped by the previous experiences with the illness and can include assessment of the health, social and economic consequences of acquiring the disease [14]. In this study, people seemed to need to perceive serious negative consequences from malaria and diabetes for them to opt for health- seeking behaviour and continue with care. 2.2.3 Perceived threat This component of the model as applied in the study refers to a combination of the perceived susceptibility and the perceived severity of the condition [9, p. 22]. Perceived threat in the study is treated as perceived severity to include the perceived possible consequences that malaria and diabetes may have for the individuals if health-seeking actions are not taken. When the threat is perceived to be negative, prompt health-seeking behaviour can be expected; the perceived threat also encourages continuity with care. 2.2.4 Perceived benefits Perceived benefit signifies an individual's own judgment on the advantages of adopting and continuing with the proposed actions in order to reduce the severity or consequences of the illness [29, p. 68]. In this context, people with malaria or diabetes needed to feel that the benefits of seeking and continuing with care were greater than if they did not; they needed to feel certain that adopting health-seeking practices would have favourable outcomes. 2.2.5 Perceived barriers This refers to an individual's evaluation as to what would stop him/her from adopting the new behaviour [29, p. 66]. If people perceived obstacles to performing health-seeking behaviour for malaria or diabetes (for example where the proposed treatments were perceived as inappropriate for treating the specific disease or was perceived to be costly), it was less likely that a decision for health-seeking behaviour or continuing with care would be made. 2.2.6 Self-efficacy Self-efficacy was not in the original Health Belief Model [14]. The concept was derived from Bandura's social learning theory in order to encompass individuals' own belief regarding their capability to practice the suggested health behaviour successfully [30, p. 94]. Self-efficacy is realized when perceived benefits outweigh the perceived barriers. People are normally hesitant to attempt new behaviour unless they believe they can do it [31]. As such, for a person to opt to undertake health-seeking behaviour for malaria or diabetes and continue with care, 32 32 Chapter 2he/she must first believe in him/herself as being able to perform the specific behaviour successfully. 2.2.7 Cue to action This is the other concept that was later added to the model [32] and it has been widely observed as an important aspect triggering people's health-seeking behaviour and medication use [33, p. 49]. In this study, cues to action relate to information and ideas about malaria and diabetes that people have and the sources thereof, whether internal (symptoms, past experiences) or external (health care workers, friends, relatives, mass media), which influence their health- seeking behaviour and continuity with care. Cues to action are not directly linked to perceived threats, because individuals must first have perceived susceptibility, perceived severity and a higher perceived threat; then, when they develop pain or illness symptoms (cues to action), it prompts their perceived threat to trigger their decision-making processes and they thus become more likely to take action in terms of health-seeking and continuing with care. On the other hand, symptoms (cues to action) directly trigger individuals' self- efficacy, which [also] triggers decisions for actions. For example, an individual must feel s/he is at high risk for contracting malaria (perceived susceptibility) and believe that malaria can be severe (perceived severity) and lead to death (perceived threat). When this person experiences malaria symptom (cues to action) it prompts the perceived threat (i.e. I may die), and this triggers the decision-making processes by increasing her/his likelihood of taking actions to reduce/alleviate the symptoms. On the other hand, illness symptoms (cues to action) prompt individuals' evaluation of their ability to take actions successfully (self efficacy) and this in turn shapes the decision-making process by inducing health-seeking behaviour to offset the symptoms. The HBM is one of the most highly applied theories in public health [5, 15, 16], despite being critiqued for its focus on individuals, especially in its general assumptions; i.e an individual's perceived susceptibility and perceived severity regarding an illness are directly linked to a change in his/her health behaviour [13]. Its focus on individuals as sole decision makers that can say \"I know, therefore I act\" neglects other factors like social and cultural environments that shape the way people think and act [6, 15]. Thus, the model fails to allow any understanding of what motivates peoples' decisions for either adopting or not adopting health behaviour. However, despite the critiques, the HBM has been adapted and applied successfully in informing and explaining a range of behaviours connected with health outcomes [9]. The model was useful in this study in aiding the understanding of the decision-making processes underlying health-seeking behaviour at the individual level. To address the HBM criticisms 33 33 Theoretical frameworkand to further the understanding of cultural aspects shaping individuals behaviour, this study applies the concept of Cultural Schemas to accommodate the social and the cultural aspects.

[as adapted from [1, p.31] 2.3 Concept of Cultural Schemas The concept of Cultural Schemas was adopted in the study to make the HBM components more relevant in the understanding of the cultural and behavioural aspects in health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes. The main proposition of the concept of Cultural Schemas is that people's perceptions and decision-making processes are directly linked to their cultural context [34]. That is to say, people's lives exist within the contexts that influence individual behaviour and impact their ability to choose a life they want. Cognitive anthropologists argue that a cultural meaning system of any society is formed by the cultural schemas that motivate people's behaviour and the responses they make to their life conditions. Therefore, these schemas form the reality-defining system of the human being and provide information about what states of the world can be and should be followed [34, p. 33]. According to Hutter et al., 2006 [35] cultural schemas have four main functions that link directly to the cultural meaning system. Those functions include: \"(i) representational functions that define knowledge and beliefs about the world, (ii) constructive functions which create the cultural entities that people adhere to, (iii) the evocative function to evoke certain feelings, and (iv) 34 34 Chapter 2directive functions that are used to direct behaviour through social pressure and external sanctions by forming intrinsic motivations to conform\" [35, p. 41]. In this study, we propose that communities' cultural meaning system and schemas inform peoples' opinions, beliefs, perceptions and attitudes towards malaria and diabetes, which in turn characterize and motivate individual responses in terms of health-seeking behaviour. The concept of Cultural Schemas and the HBM were used to construct the study's conceptual framework. 2.4 Conceptual framework The study's conceptual framework (see Figure 2.2) depicts health-seeking behaviour as interplay between macro- and micro-level aspects. The macro-level aspect of the \"cultural meaning system\" denotes an organized system of knowledge, ideas, beliefs, values and norms that people use for understanding and shaping their world and to cope with their life circumstances. This cultural meaning system is passed on from generation to generation through socialization and learning [36]. According to D'Andrade, the cultural meaning system is made up of shared cultural schemas that inform peoples' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and views about their world and shape their response actions as they face both familiar and new challenges [34]. That means the cultural meaning system of the wider community (macro- level) informs the cultural schemas of individuals (micro-level), shaping their perccived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived threats, perceived barriers, perceived benefits , and self-efficacy (the HBM components), and thereby motivating their health-seeking behaviour as well as the continuity with care. Cues to action in the framework refer to internal or external factors such as pain or symptoms and information from relatives/family members, friends and health care workers or media campaigns that prompt the perceived threat to trigger decision-making processes vis-\u00e0-vis health-seeking behaviour and care continuity. On the other hand, these cues to action directly prompt individuals' self efficacy (individuals' perceived ability to take action successfully) and shape their decisions involving health- seeking behaviour and continuity of care. Similarly, these individuals, in turn, update the cultural meaning system through their lived experiences that accumulate over time. 35 35 Theoretical framework2.5 Theories aiding interpretations Several themes emerged through the data analysis and interpretation processes, specifically through inductive reasoning; these themes were not part of the theoretical framework that informed the data collection. Emergence of themes from the data via induction is one of the underlying principles of grounded theory that influences the analysis of qualitative data [37]. Several theoretical concepts were adopted to move the analysis beyond the descriptive accounts and to better explain the emergent themes in the study. The self-care concept ( see chapter five ) was combined with the HBM components to help explain the individual actions - in terms of self-medication and self treatment - to understand their health-seeking behaviours. The 5A's of access to care dimensions ( see chapter seven ) were combined with the HBM components to help explain the context that shaped diabetes patients' behaviour vis-\u00e0-vis medication use.

Kilombero district has a total area of 14,018sq kms and a population of 407,880 (202,789 men and 205,091 women), representing 0.9 per cent of the total population in the mainland of Tanzania. The average household size in the district is 4.3 [1]. The district comprises 400,000 hectares of plain land suitable for agricultural activities such as farming, fishing and animal husbandry. Kilombero extends from the middle to the far southwest of Morogoro region. It is bordered by rural Morogoro to the east and Kilosa to the northeast. The north and west borders are shared by Mufindi and Nyombe districts of the Iringa region, while at its south and southeast it shares the boarders with rural Songea (Ruvuma region) and Ulanga districts respectively. Most of the district lies along the Kilombero Valley, a part of Rufiji Basin which extends below the Udzugwa Mountains from its east towards the southwest. There are major Figure 3.1 Map of Kilombero districtLegend Ifakara Town Rivers Railway Roads Kilombero district Study Namwawala Viwanjasitini42 Chapter 3plantations of teak in Kilombero and the neighbouring Ulanga district. The low-lying area in the northwest of the district is occupied mostly by the Illovo sugar companys' sugar- cane plantations. The district has four climatic conditions: a hot, wet season from December to March; a cool, wet season from April to June; a cool, dry season from July to August, and a hot, dry season from September to November. The rainfal patterns in the district are bimodal, between 1,200 mm and 1,600 mm per annum, accompanied by seasonal flooding that makes physical accessibility to most parts of the district critical. Kilombero is a low-lying district with 38 permanent rivers that are equivalent to 60 per cent of Morogoro Regions' total water bodies. This condition makes Kilombero an ideal area for paddy production, with 63 per cent of agricultural households cultivating paddy, the main staple food and cash crop in the area. The valleys climatic and ecological features are favourable for high and perennial transmission of malaria, [2] making the Kilombero district one of the most malaria- prone areas in Tanzania. Ifakara, a small town, is the headquarters and as such, the administrative centre of the district. There are four major health institutions in the district, all concentrated in this small town. Those include the Ifakara Health Institute - IHI ( http://www.ihi.or.tz/ ); the St. Francis referral hospital ( http://www.ifakara.org/en/st-francis-hospital/hospital.php ), the Tanzania Training Center for International Health - TTCIH ( http://www.healthtrainingifakara.org/ ); and the St. Francis Univeristy Colleage and Allied Sciences - SFUCHAS ( http:// www.sfuchas.ac.tz/ifakara/ ). Being a small rural town, Ifakara is in rapid transition, attracting people from different corners of the country either for business, cultivation or professional development. Also the ongoing building of a bridge over the Kilombero River between Ulanga district and Ifakara town is expected to bring rapid changes in terms of social, economic and the accompanied health changes. There is also a railway line in the area that goes from Dar es Salaam to Zambia through Kilombero district with railway stations along the way in Msolwa, Mang'ula, Kibelege, Ifakara, and Ruipa within the district. Most of the roads from Ifakara town to the villages and hamlets are difficult to pass, especially during the rainy season. The distance from Morogoro region to Kilombero district is 230kms. Although this may not seem very remote to Western standards, Kilombero is actually quite a rural district due to the quality of the roads. Of the 230 kms that lie between Morogoro town and Kilombero district, 120 kms are on tarmac road from Morogoro region to Mikumi junction, (about one and a half hours drive), the highway to the southern parts of Tanzania. Of the remaining 110 kms (Mikumi to Ifakara), 85 kms are bumpy, dirty narrow road that make the trip to Ifakara a drive of about two and a half to 4 hours depending on the season. 43 Methodology, research area and study populationThere are 54 health facilities in the district, including two hospitals (the St. Francis referral hospital and another private hospital owned by the Kilombero Sugar Company), four government health centres and 48 dispensaries, some of which are owned by the government, and some of which are privately owned. Additionally, there is one diabetes clinic in the district and it is located within the premises of St. Francis referral hospital. Traditional healers of various types such as divine healers, herbalists and spiritual healers are also found almost everywhere in the district [3]. Seeking health care services from outside the district such as travelling to Morogoro region could mean not only additional costs to the patients in terms of return bus fair, travel time and accommodation in Morogoro, but also the additional complication of the lack of reliable and suitable transport for the sick due to road conditions. Malaria is an important cause of ill health in the district [2, 4-6] and it affects people of all age groups. Together with other infectious diseases such as HIV and AIDS [7] and tuberculosis [8], diabetes is one of the emerging concerns among other NCDs [6, 9]. This context of higher prevalence's of acute infectious diseases such as malaria amidst a socio-economic development that is rapidly taking place provided the study with a unique opportunity to understand people's health-seeking behaviour and their illness experiences of a newly emerging condition. Two villages with a total population of 21 270, Viwanjasitini and Namwawala (see Figure 3.1), were purposively selected for the study with the help of District Council Health Management team members. The criteria for the selection of the villages were based on their proximity to St. Francis referral hospital. This hospital, where the diabetes clinic is situated, provides various health services, including those for malaria. To allow the study to capture a wider range of community perspectives on malaria and diabetes, the study villages had both semi-urban and rural characteristics. The semi-urban village (Viwanjasitini village) was located less than 5 km from Ifakara town, while the distance between the rural village (Namwawala village) and the town was 43 kms. The majority of the villagers in both places had no more than a primary school level of education, and were small-scale farmers who grew mainly rice and maize. The main sources of health services for the residents of Viwanjasitini, the semi-urban village, are a laboratory facility and four dispensaries, all of which are privately owned, and which diagnose and treat malaria, along with other infectious diseases. There are also 14 drug shops located in the village, which sell a variety of medicines including anti-malarial drugs. The village has no government-run health facilities. As they live close to Ifakara, the residents of this village can also access a number of drug shops, laboratory facilities and dispensaries located there and have easy access to diabetes services through pharmacies or the diabetes clinic at St. Francis referral hospital. By contrast the rural village of Namwawala had one 44 Chapter 3private laboratory facility that provides diagnostic services only, and a government-run village dispensary. This dispensary provides both diagnostic tests and treatments for malaria and other infectious conditions. The inhabitants of this village can obtain anti-malarial medicines, among others, from the four drug shops located in their village or from several other shops in the adjacent villages. They also have the option of travelling to Ifakara to access treatments or purchase medicines, but the drive to Ifakara takes about one hour or more depending on the season. Diabetes services could also be accessed from Ifakara through pharmacies or the diabetes clinic at St. Francis referral hospital, as these services are not available in their village. There is no privately-owned health facility in this rural village. It is important to emphasise that despite the categorization of the recruitment sites as semi-urban and rural villages, the research site as a whole should be considered as a rural area due to the remoteness of the district to surrounding bigger cities like Morogoro (4 hours drive) and Dar es Salaam (8 hours drive). The diabetes clinic at St. Francis referral hospital in Ifakara, which is the only public health facility providing diabetes services in the district, provides the services to people both within and outside the district. This clinic was involved in the study to provide access to diabetes patients from the surrounding rural villages who were visiting the clinic for their monthly routine check-up. 3.3 Study design This study was divided into two main parts, a narrative review and primary data collection. The narrative review aimed to review literature to provide a general perspective on the NCD situation in Tanzania and the responses engaged. This review was also the start of a larger project where four PhD candidates worked on different aspects of the epidemiological transition, including issues of policy formulation and epidemiology of the diseases, health system operations, and community perspectives on the transition. Due to the holistic nature of the review topic, which includes policy, epidemiology, health system and community perspectives, a narrative review approach was chosen rather than a systematic review, because such an approach is well suited to present the broader perspectives needed for a newly emerging topic [10, 11]. The primary data were collected to get in-depth understanding of the meanings associated with malaria and diabetes and the reasons attached to behaviour and or actions in response to these diseases. An interpretative approach was used to enable identification of the issues from the study participants' own perspectives [12]. This study approach aimed at getting the 45 Methodology, research area and study populationemic perspectives from the people themselves, to reveal their perceptions and opinions about malaria and diabetes, how they make sense of the emerging symptoms, and to hear about the typical behaviour associated with the diseases and the underlying reasons for such practices. Qualitative data collection methods such as focus group discussion (FGDs) ( see section 3.6.2.1 ) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) ( see section 3.6.2.2 ) were used in collecting the primary data. 3.4 Pilot study and implications of its findings for the study design The focus group discussion guides (FGD) were piloted in August, 2012. The pilot study was conducted in two villages (a rural and a semi-urban village) that would not take part in the main study. The pilot activities aimed at observing the practical application of the FGD guides in the field and whether the proposed topic guides would yield the intended information. The exercise also aimed at orienting the research team into the guides and at getting practical experience in administering them. The results of the pilot study helped to refine the final FGD guides that were used in the actual data collection, and also shaped the focus of the study in terms of the study sites and the type of participants involved in the study. Initially, the plan of the study was to involve the general community members from Viwanjasitini (semi-urban village) and Namwawala (rural village) to participate in the malaria and diabetes FGDs. However, the main finding of the pilot study suggested limited awareness and knowledge about diabetes signs and symptoms and experiences on the condition among the members of the general community. Although this was an important finding as such, it meant that including members of the general community in the FGDs would not reveal any relevant substantial information about health-seeking behaviour in relation to diabetes. Therefore, instead of involving the general community members in the diabetes FGDs, diabetes patients, their neighbours and/ or relatives were involved. The diabetes clinic at Ifakara town was used as a site to recruit diabetes patients from different surrounding rural villages for the FGDs, replacing the rural village Namwawala for ease of accessibility of participants: many patients came to Ifakara from surrounding villages for their monthly check-ups. Viwanjasitini village remained as a site to recruit neighbours and or relatives of diabetes patients for the diabetes FGDs for the same reason: its semi-urban characteristic permitted easy recruitment of potential participants by walking around the village, identifying patients or relatives of patients. The plan regarding diabetes IDIs, of engaging diabetes patients and their family members, remained unchanged. However, the IDIs with diabetes family members engaged participants from Viwanjasitini, the semi-urban 46 Chapter 3village only because it was not easy to recruit diabetes patient family members from the diabetes clinic at St. Francis referral hospital in Ifakara town as during their visits to the clinic the diabetes patients were unaccompanied by their family members. The sites for malaria FGDs and IDIs remained as originally planned. 3.5 Recruitment of participants The study participants for FGDs ( section for and IDIs Participants for malaria FGDs and IDIs ( see table 3.1 ) were purposively recruited with the assistance of the village leaders. The general criteria for inclusion in both FGDs and IDIs were being an adult member of the community (above 18 years), and being a permanent resident of the study district. An additional criterion for inclusion in the malaria IDIs was having a recent experience of malaria (14 days before the date of the interview). Separate FGDs were conducted for men and women. 3.5.2 Participants for Diabetes FGDs and IDIs Participants for diabetes FGDs and IDIs ( see table 3.1 ) were purposively recruited with the assistance of the village leaders (Viwanjisitini) or the clinic nurse (diabetes clinic in Ifakara town). Recruitment of the relatives of diabetes patients for the IDIs from Viwanjasitini village was done purposively with the help of the patients. The general criteria for inclusion on either FGDs or IDIs were being an adult member of the community (above 18 years), and being a permanent resident of the study district. Patients recruited were included in the diabetes FGDs only if they had been diagnosed with diabetes and were included in the diabetes IDIs only if they had at least 6 months' experience with diabetes diagnosis prior to the interview. As described earlier ( section 3.4 ) at Viwanjasitini village, diabetes FGDs were conducted with neighbours and relatives of diabetes patients; while the IDIs were conducted with diabetes patients and their relatives. At the diabetes clinic in St. Francis referral hospital at Ifakara town, FGDs and IDIs were conducted with diabetes patients living in the surrounding rural villages. As for the malaria FGDs, the diabetes FGDs were conducted separately for men and women.47 Methodology, research area and study populationTable 3.1 Focus group discussions and in-depth interview participant characteristics and study focus Health condition Malaria Diabetes ParticipantsGeneral community membersPatients PatientsNeighbours/relatives and family members Method usedFGD IDIs IDI FGD IDI Study site Viwanjasitini 4 5 7 Namwawala 4 7 9 n.a n.a n.a: Not applicable 3.6 Data collection methods 3.6.1 Narrative review The documents on the narrative review were obtained through searches of English literature from electronic data bases such as PubMed and google scholar with full text retrievals from HINARI. The search was done using a set of comprehensive topic-related search terms. Inclusion criteria in the narrative review were English - written articles on original work conducted in Tanzania. To ensure that the retrieved articles reflected the current and most recent responses, the search period was restricted to the work conducted between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012. Exclusion criteria were systematic or narrative reviews, opinion papers, documents including expectant women as participants, and articles on drug evaluation and diagnostics. The reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched for additional relevant articles. In addition, grey literature from websites of organizations active in the field of NCD was searched, including the government of Tanzania and the WHO ( for a detailed search strategy see chapter four ).48 Chapter 33.6.2 Primary data The primary data were collected using qualitative data collection methods such as focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs). The strength of the qualitative data collection methods is their ability to examine feelings and meanings that people attach to their experiences, the interaction between knowledge, experiences, motivations and actions and the social factors that shape these processes [12, 13]. Such methods generate rich, detailed and valid process data that leave the study participants' perspectives intact. To allow a better exploration of ideas and issues coming out of the discussions, the data collection activities were organized in two rounds, building on the strengths of each of the data collection methods employed. The first round of data collection involved the use of FGDs to collect general opinions and views on malaria and diabetes. Results from these FGDs were used to fine-tune and sharpen the IDI data collection guides ( see appendix 3, malaria patients IDI guide; appendix 4, diabetes patients IDI guide; and appendix 5, diabetes family member IDI guide ). These IDI guides were used during the second round of data collection to guide in-depth interviews for in-depth understanding of the issues at the individual level. The combination of the FGDs and the IDIs in the study contributed into a more thorough exploration of the issues that emerged [14]. The use of multiple qualitative data collection methods have been advocated for enhanced analysis of the phenomenon and for its broadened conceptualization [14, 15]. 3.6.2.1 Focus group discussions The first round of data collection engaged participants in focus group discussions (FGDs). FGD is a qualitative data collection method well accredited for its strength and ability to provide a wealth of insights into collective views, attitudes, perceptions and group feelings about the phenomenon [12, 16, 17]. They are \"naturalistic\", as they are capable of providing the social contexts of meaning making and the general contextual factors surrounding the phenomenon under study [18]. Building on their ability to capture nuances of cultural meanings and behaviour, FGDs were used in the study to gain a wide-range of views and opinions on how malaria and diabetes are perceived in the community; community opinions and beliefs on their causes; shared experiences with the conditions; to ascertain their health- seeking behaviour and the typical behaviours associated with both malaria and or diabetes (see chapter one, research questions 2; 3; 5). In total, 17 FGDs (8 FGDs focusing on malaria aspects with 59 participants and 9 FGDs focusing on diabetes aspects with 58 participants) were conducted separately for each specific disease. Participants in the malaria FGDs were people from the general community in Viwanjasitini and Namwawala villages, while participants in the diabetes FGDs were diabetes patients and neighbours or relatives of diabetes patients ( see table 3.1 ) recruited at the diabetes clinic in Ifakara town and 49 Methodology, research area and study populationViwanjasitini village respectively. The discussions with participants recruited in the village were held under natural settings convenient to participants within the respective villages and the discussions with participants recruited through the diabetes clinic were held in a private area within a canteen nearby the St. Francis referral hospital. The number of the participants in the discussions ranged from 6 to 9. The FGDs lasted from one hour to one hour and a half. FGDs guides ( appendices 1 and 2 ) were developed to guide the discussions. The researcher facilitated all FGDs in Swahili, the most familiar language to people in the study setting and to the researcher. One research assistant was engaged in each of the FGDs for taking notes and observing the non-verbal communications. These FGDs started with a brief introduction of all people present and a re-introduction of the study objectives. Then, followed by a general discussion of the perceived common diseases in the community, the cultural meanings associated with them, and the perceived adult susceptibility to the conditions. To get more insights into how the cultural context informs health-seeking behaviour practices at the community level, FGD participants were questioned on their opinions about malaria and diabetes, specifically regarding how they respond when they face such conditions, and the reasons for the responses they make. With the use of open-ended and non-leading probes in a group setting, group members engaged freely by discussing and sharing their opinions, ideas, and experiences of malaria and diabetes, and of their health- seeking behaviour in general. The use of probes provided the opportunity for a detailed exploration of the components in the conceptual framework ( section 2.4 ). Furthermore, to capture the diversity of opinions, ideas, free expressiveness and gender dynamics in the community, these FGDs were held separately for men and women. Each day that we conducted FGDs was concluded with an evening debriefing session. In these debriefing sessions the digitally recorded FGD files were replayed and summary notes were written for reflections. Some of these reflections were useful in identifying issues that needed more information or further probing, and these were then considered during the next FGDs. When during these reflections we could not identify additional information on each of the specific diseases and among men and women, data saturation was confirmed [19] and this determined the number of the FGDs. All 17 FGDs were digitally recorded with the consent of the participants and transcribed verbatim into electronic versions within 48 hours of the time they were conducted. Ideas, opinions, and issues generated from the FGDs were used to fine- tune and sharpen the IDI guides that were used for in-depth exploration of the aspects at the individual level. 3.6.2.2 In-depth interviews In-depth interview (IDI) is a qualitative data collection method that involves an interviewer and interviewee into discussing specific topics in depth [12]. This method was used to collect 50 Chapter 3primary data during the second round of the data collection. Different from FGDs, IDIs are acknowledged for their strength in providing a \"deeper\" understanding of the social phenomena that can rarely be achieved through the other data collection methods [16]. The potential of IDIs lies in their great emphasis on discovering an individual's own feelings and emotions, his/her beliefs and perceptions about diseases and illnesses , the practices and actions they account for in their illness experiences and what opportunities and obstacles they face [12] in responding to their health conditions . In-depth information on more sensitive personal issues and feelings can also be revealed in an IDI [12, 20]. The assumption with this method of data collection is that if the data collection guides are correctly designed, the participant's expressions of their experiences will reflect their reality [14, 21, 22]. The IDIs were used in the study to gain an in-depth understanding of the individual perceptions on malaria and / or diabetes, their illness experiences, and the decision making processes in seeking care for the conditions (see chapter one, research question 2; 3; 5) . In addition, the IDIs also aimed at getting a \"deeper\" understanding from the diabetes individuals themselves; of the behavioural practices shaping their experiences with diabetes medication use and continuity of use (see chapter one, research question 4) . A total of 41 in-depth interviews were conducted with adult community members. IDI participants were either people who had a recent malaria episode - 14 days prior to the interview (15) - or had more than six months' experience of living with diabetes (19), or were family member of diabetes patients (7) (see section 3.5). IDIs with participants recruited from the villages Viwanjasitini (malaria and diabetes) and Namwawala (malaria) were conducted at the participants' household and those of the participants recruited through the diabetes clinic at Ifakara town were conducted at a private area within a canteen near to the St. Francis referral hospital. IDI topic guides ( appendices 3 - 5) were developed to guide the interviews. As with the FGDs, the researcher conducted all the interviews in Swahili. An in-depth interview lasted between 45 minutes and 1 hour. All interviews were digitally recorded with the verbal consent of the participants, and a research assistant made a verbatim transcript of the interview within 48 hours of its completion. The interview process started with a general introduction of the researcher and the research. The actual interviewing started after the individuals had given consent. It first started with the participants' background information and thereafter, with the participants narrating their stories on how the illness started, the meanings ascribed to their symptoms, followed by a description of their actual health care-seeking process, their medication use experiences, and their day-to- day life experiences with the illness. With the use of probes, the different components from the conceptual framework ( section 2.4 ) were explored. This method of data collection gave participants ample time to answer specific questions by detailing the actual accounts of their 51 Methodology, research area and study populationillness, the actions employed when responding to the symptoms and the reasons for taking those actions; their real life experiences with medication use and the daily experiences of living with an illness. During the IDIs the research process was highly flexible to allow continuous probing as matters arose in the discussions. Similar to the FGDs, each day that we conducted IDIs ended with a debriefing session in which the digital recorded IDI files were replayed and summary notes were written for reflections. Some of these reflections helped to identify aspects that needed further information or clarity and these issues were then considered during the IDIs that followed. When these reflections identified no new information from the IDIs on the specific disease and among men and women, data saturation was confirmed [19] and this determined the number of the IDIs. 3.7 Research team The research team comprised the researcher and two research assistants who had a social science background at a post graduate level. The research assistants had a one-day intensive training on the study. The researcher provided an overview of the research and the overall aim of the study, followed by a description of the study design and an elaboration of the study objectives to the research assistants. Afterwards, the training concentrated on orienting assistants to the specific data collection guides rather than to the modalities and technicalities for conducting the actual field activities as they were all considered competent in that area. Both of the research assistants had more than five years' experience in conducting qualitative data collection activities with community members in different areas within Tanzania as well as in the writing of transcriptions. The researcher facilitated all the FGDs and the IDIs while the assistants were responsible for note taking and transcribing the digitally recorded files. 3.8 Data analysis The data analysis processes started with the researchers' familiarization with the data. Although I facilitated all the FGDs and IDIs myself, I read through all the transcribed files to match them against an audio file to ensure the transcripts' authenticity and quality before importation to NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia), that was used to facilitate the analysis. Through the processes of re-reading and listening to the audio files, I became familiar with the data in a more in-depth way. This was followed by the generation of the codes, and then the code book, i.e. a list of ideas about what was in the data and what was interesting about the data and its descriptions. The codes for each data set (FGDs or IDIs) were developed separately following the same principles. These codes included both inductive and deductive codes, all of which were then shared among the principal researcher and her 52 Chapter 3three supervisors, one from Tanzania, and two from the Netherlands. Discrepancies were minimal and were reconciled through discussions prior to the finalization of the codes and the code books and to the coding of the data and the analysis. This reconciliation led to shared understandings that were critical for the analysis, to minimize possibilities of systematic biases and distortions during data analysis [23]. The last task entailed integration of the two data sets and categorization of the codes into themes and family codes following principles of the grounded theory [12], a process that continued until no new themes or categories emerged. This was followed by the writing of the descriptive reports. Most of the themes represented new concepts that emerged inductively from the data (self-medication; access to health services; and illness experiences), while the family codes reflected the HBM components that informed the data collection topic guides ( see example figure 3.2 ). Family codes are thus at a higher level of abstraction than the themes. The emergent concepts suggested a need for additional theoretical concepts to further conceptualise and aide explanations of the actions on self-medication and treatment; the context on access to health services; and the illness experiences that go beyond the individual beliefs and perceptions, as the later could be well explained by the former theoretical concepts. In the specific chapters, the additional theoretical concepts of self-care ( chapter five ), 5A's access to care dimensions (chapter seven ) and explanatory model of illness ( chapter eight ) were adapted to aid interpretation of the emergent concepts. Figure 3.2, gives an example of how the codes were categorized into themes, as well as how the family codes were linked to conceptual/theoretical concepts in different chapters. 3.9 Ethical issues The study was approved by ethical committees of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, University of Groningen in the Netherlands; the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania; and the National Tanzanian Medical Research Co-coordinating Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) at Dar es Salaam. Getting entry into the community involved introducing the study and its objectives to the District administrative authorities for permission to conduct the study in the district. With the help of the District Council Health Management team, the study villages were chosen. The District Authority provided an introductory letter to the villages. The village leaders were informed about the study and its objectives by the research team upon their arrival in the village. The same procedure was followed to gain entry into the diabetes clinic. After the introduction to the director of St. Francis referral hospital and introducing the study and its objectives, the director introduced the team to the diabetes clinic authorities. All study participants were thoroughly informed about the study and the risks and benefits involved were elaborated. Participation was 53 Methodology, research area and study populationvoluntary and participants were informed of the right not to answer any question or withdraw their participation at any point in time without giving explanation. Each study participant provided verbal consent for their involvement in the study and the digital recording before participating in either FGDs or IDIs. Specific to the low literacy in the setting, verbal consent was the most suitable form of consent taking and this was recorded. To ensure confidentiality, participants in the FGDs were discouraged from discussing each other's views outside the FGD settings. To maintain anonymity, all participant identifiers were removed from the data and only their opinions are presented. The audio files were anonymized and coded by the principal researcher to identify the area, the focus of the discussion/interview and not the individuals involved. All the transcribed data have been carefully kept under secured files and are used only for academic purposes.

During the fieldwork, the research team position was both a challenge and a benefit to the study. Introducing ourselves as affiliated to Ifakara Health Institute (IHI), an institution that is well recognized in the study settings for its contributions to improving the health of the local community through interventions on prevention and control of infectious diseases was an advantage to the team, providing a smooth entry into the study settings. In both villages and at the diabetes clinic, study participants were eager to share their opinions and stories regarding malaria and diabetes. It seemed from their expressions that participants had a general trust and confidence in sharing their information with the research team due to the goodwill that has been created between IHI and the communities within the Kilombero district. IHI has worked intensively on interventions research for prevention and management of malaria as well as other infectious diseases in the district. Such a background shaped some of the study participants' expectations from the research, a main challenge to the study. Participants frequently demanded the team to provide them with information regarding diabetes signs and symptoms, causes, preventive measures and how the condition is treated and or could be cured. The team had to explicitly re-explain to the study participants about the research objectives and the intended outcome of the study in terms of academic qualifications, and explain the fact that they had no medical background. In addition, at the end of the discussions, a list of resources on where participants could get professional information was provided. Participants were also recommended that they seek help from the medical professionals at the diabetes clinic. Another challenge was specific to the diabetes in-depth interviews. As the interviews advanced, I felt compassion towards some of the participants as they narrated the emotional struggles they encountered during the process of being diagnosed to have diabetes and the fear they expressed in facing the possible consequences of living with the condition. One female participant started crying when she shared with me the struggle she is experiencing due to the fact that she has to change her lifestyle and ensure continuous use of the diabetes medications despite the severe social and economic consequences experienced on her end. It was important for me to show sympathy and responsiveness and at the same time stay focused in the questions I was asking, and striking this balance proved challenging. Being a Tanzanian, conducting this research in my own country was an advantage because of the shared insights with the participants' perspectives and understanding of the verbal and non-verbal languages. The study participants appreciated me as an insider. This reduced tension and motivated them to talk freely and to share their opinions, views and experiences. 55 Methodology, research area and study populationMy sociological background enhanced my skills in engaging the participants about issues central to their well-being like diseases and the illness experiences; while at the same time keeping participants contented. I was keen to ensure that participants were comfortable airing their opinions and views about malaria and diabetes and in recounting their illness experiences. In the FGDs, I paid quite a bit of attention to how my appearance and vocabulary could influence participants' responses and impact their comfort in expressing their views and opinions. Although I had to pay attention to the same factors during the IDIs, there I also become more sensitive to the participants' illness status. In so doing, I was able to gain trust and form a good rapport among the participants and this proved to be a key to the deeper understanding of malaria and diabetes health-seeking behaviour that was achieved in the study.

J., Dieleman, M., Haisma, H., & Geubbels, E. (2014). Public policy, health system, and community actions against illness as platforms for response to NCDs in Tanzania: a narrative review. Global health action, 7. EM, BM, MM and DJN claim equal authorship.58 Chapter 4Abstract Background: Most of the Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) are facing a rise of the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) alongside the persisting burden of infectious diseases. This narrative review aims to provide an inventory of how the existing policy environment, health system and communities are addressing the NCDs situation in Tanzania and identify gaps for advancing the NCD research and policy agenda. Methodology: A literature search was performed on PubMed and Google scholar with full text retrieval from HINARI on English language articles published between 2000 and 2012. Documents were read to extract information on what Tanzania actors were doing that contributed to NCDs prevention, treatment and control and a narration was written out of these. Reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched for additional relevant articles. Websites of organizations active in the field of NCDs including the Government of Tanzania and WHO were searched for reports and grey literature. Results: Lack of a specific and overaching NCD policy has slowed and fragmented the implementation of existing strategies to prevent and control NCDs and their determinants. The health system is not prepared to deal with the rising NCD burden although there are random initiatives to improve this situation. How the community is responding to these emerging conditions is still unknown and the current health seeking behavior and perceptions on the risk factors may not favor control of NCDs and their risk factors. Conclusion and recommendation: There is limited information on the burden and determinants of NCDs to inform the design of an integrative and multi-sectorial policy. Evidence on effective interventions for NCDs services in primary care levels and on community perceptions on NCDs and their care seeking is virtually absent. Research and public health interventions must be anchored in the policy, health system and community platforms for a holistic response. Key words: NCD, policy, health system, community response EM, BM, MM and DJN claim equal authorship.59 Platforms for responses to NCDs in Tanzania4.1 Background Tanzania's population of 44.9 million in 2012 is more than three times the 12.3 million estimated in 1967 [1]. The population growth rate is estimated at 2.7% annually with a crude birth rate of 12.9 per 1000 inhabitants. The fertility rate at 5.4 children per woman in 2012 is a drop from the 6.5 and 6.3 children per woman estimated in 1988 and 2002 respectively, but is still very high and contributes to the rapid increase in population [1]. The Tanzanian demographic profile, like that of other Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), is largely young, with 42.5% of the population being younger than 15 years, 51.9% is between 15 and 59 years, and 5.6% is aged 60 years or older [1]. The increasing life expectancy at birth from 50 years in 1988 to 55 years in 2010 [2] is however changing this picture by slowly increasing the middle-aged and older populations. This improved survival has been attributed to improved health standards hence reduced mortality [3]. Eighty percent of Tanzania's population lives in rural areas [1] and the adult literacy level was 71% in 2010 [4]. Tanzania's Gross National Income per capita was USD 551 in 2010 [4] making it one of the poorest countries worldwide. Health sector spending amounted to 7% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 [5] with the Government contributing to 53% of all health expenditure in 2010/11 fiscal year [6]. Tanzania has for decades struggled with the burden of infectious and deficiency disorders along with poor maternal and child health indicators. Successes have been documented in form of a steady decline of the maternal mortality ratio from 529 deaths in 1996 to 452 deaths per 100, 000 live births in 2010 [4]; and the under-five mortality ratio from 137 in 1978 to 81 deaths per 1000 live births in 2010 [4]. Malaria attributable child mortality decreased from 53 in 1999 to 36 in 2007/8 [7, 8], a reduction in HIV prevalence among persons aged 15 to 49 years was seen from 7% in 2003/4 to 5.1% in 2012 [9, 10], and evidence of the impact of antiretroviral treatment on population mortality has been documented [11]. Although these efforts are ongoing amidst resource constraints [2] the rising prevalence of degenerative non communicable diseases (NCDs) is exerting further strains on the meager resources. In 2010, NCDs were responsible for 27% of all deaths in Tanzania [12], a figure that is comparable to that of neighbouring countries like Mozambique [13]. As in the rest of the world, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, diabetes, and chronic obstructive respiratory diseases (CORDs) have been highlighted as main contributors to premature mortality [14]. In 2012, the prevalence of hypertension in Tanzanian adults of 25 to 64 years of age was 26% and that of raised fasting blood glucose in the same population was 9.1% [15]. Findings of a study conducted in selected rural and urban communities in Tanzania in 2003 found that 60 Chapter 4crude yearly stroke incidences were 95 per 100,000 and 107.9 per 100,000, respectively [16]. Despite this shrinking rural-urban difference in burden, it has been found that the availability of NCD diagnostic and management services is twice as much in urban compared to rural areas [17]. National representative data on heart diseases, cancers and CORDs could not be obtained. These NCDs are reported to share four main risk factors: poor dietary habits, excessive alcohol use, tobacco use and lack of physical exercise [18]. The health system is anchored on 5,416 health facilities, at an average ratio of 1.5 facilities per 10,000 persons, with dispensaries being the point of first contact for the majority of the population. Two thirds of facilities are Government-owned and 236 of the facilities are of hospital level and above [19]. The provider to population ratio in 2012 was 7.1 per 10,000 population including only professional health workers. Efforts to tackle infectious diseases have been targeting the health system, policies and the community which are important constituents of any health sector response. This paper is an inventory of how the policy environment, health system and communities are addressing the NCDs situation. It highlights the ways to adapt these platforms for responses to the increasing burden of NCDs and identifies the knowledge gaps for advancing the research and policy agendas for NCDs in Tanzania. 4.2 Methodology A literature search was performed using a set of comprehensive topic-related search terms. Inclusion criteria were English written articles on original work conducted in Tanzania. We excluded systematic or narrative reviews, opinion papers, documents including expectant women as participants and articles on drug evaluations and or diagnostics. The search was restricted to publications between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2012 to ensure that the retrieved articles reflected the current situation and most recent responses. The search was performed on PubMed and Google scholar, with full text articles retrieved from Hinari. We also undertook targeted grey literature search, focusing on large institutions like WHO, NCD interest groups in Tanzania and documents and reports of the Government of Tanzania. Articles selected included primary research articles, evaluation and situation analyses reports. The references of retrieved articles were manually searched for additional material. The search terms were based on key terms aligned to policy, health care system and community, the important constituents of a health sector response [20]. The terms were combined by Boolean operators \"AND\" to narrow the search appropriately and \"OR\" to expand it with similar terms. The search strategy included the following strings: \"non- diseases\" OR \"non communicable diseases\" OR \"non-communicable diseases\" OR \"non communicable \"non communicable diseases\" OR AND policy AND Tanzania. The search resulted in 10,594 articles as depicted in figure 4.1. Ten thousand, four hundred and seventy three of these were excluded for reasons including title not focused on NCDs, language other than English, or publication date was out of target. One hundred and twenty one titles were found to be relevant to our subject area and their abstracts were retrieved and screened to determine if they matched our criteria. Fortyone abstracts were excluded based on content relevance to our topic and study design. From this step, 80 abstracts were identified to be relevant and their full text versions were retrieved from HINARI. Bibliographies of retrieved documents were also searched for relevant papers. Six documents were identified this way, three of which were peer reviewed articles, and the other three were reports. When our initial search yielded only two papers on community responses to NCD, we expanded our inclusion criteria to include articles on health seeking for HIV, TB or malaria. We obtained 18 relevant publications based on this expansion. Analysis was done based on pre-determined themes on NCD policy prevention and control, health system financing, NCD health services and human resources of health regarding NCD services and community health - seeking behaviour and practices. These themes were pre- determined taking into account the review objectives and focused on the main health sector response constituents. Documents were handled manually in that no data management software was used during the analysis . They were read to extract information on what Tanzania actors were doing that contributed to NCDs prevention, treatment and control and a narration was written out of these responses. There were discussions among the first four authors on content of the results and in case of disagreements resolution was by consensus. 4.3 Results This review included 49 documents that were comprised of 26 peer-reviewed articles which were mainly cross-sectional studies published between 2006 and 2012. Three of the 26 articles are included in the policy section, one in the health systems section and 22 in the community section. The other 23 documents were grey literature mainly from the Tanzanian government and WHO sources, published between 2001 and 2012. Six of these documents were reviewed for the policy section, 17 for the health system and none was reviewed for the community section. Three of the 6 documents obtained through searching the reference lists 62 Chapter 4 6 documents included from reference lists Database searches using NCD related search strings 10,594 records (1494 PubMed; 9100 Google scholar) 10,473 records excluded based on titles review 121 abstracts retrieved 41 documents excluded based on abstract 80 full text documents retrieved 18 articles included on community Response to HIV, Malaria or TB 20 documents included from grey literature 75 documents excluded based on fully text review 23 documents remaining 49 documents included in the results Reasons for exclusions: Publication date Settings other than Tanzania Study design Content not relevant Non-English publications Figure 4.1 The process of selecting articles63 Platforms for responses to NCDs in Tanzaniaof retrieved articles were peer-reviewed articles, the remaining were grey literature. In these results the NCD-related policy environment is described first and then the preparedness of the health system for the rising NCD burden. This will be followed by an inventory of community responses to NCDs. 4.3.1 Policies and strategies on NCDs and their determinants in Tanzania The Government has established a unit at the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to steer formulation of NCD policies and guidelines [21]. It has also included prevention and control of NCDs as strategic objectives of the health sector [7]. This National Strategy for NCDs 2008 - 2013 identifies primary, secondary and tertiary prevention as important components in addressing NCDs [7]. The strategy is integrated and generic and addresses NCDs only from the health sector perspective [7, 12]. There was neither an overarching national NCD policy nor evidence of harnessing of non-health sectorial policies in the current response to NCDs despite the multi-faceted aetiologies of these diseases. Regarding addressing of the four main risk factors of NCDs, by 2011, Tanzania had integrated strategies for alcohol, smoking, physical inactivity and unhealthy diets, overweight, and obesity [12]. The government signed (in 2004) and approved for implementation (in 2007) the WHO's Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) [22]. This convention clearly presents both demand and supply reduction provisions for controlling exposure to tobacco, among other provisions [23]. Fortunately, some of its demand-reduction provisions such as the introduction of excise taxation on tobaco were already in place [24] but still more actions are needed considering that smoking tobacco costs the nation more than 30 million dollars annually in treatment of tobacco-related cancers [25]. In 2011, it was reported by WHO that Tanzania had implemented none of the 5 tobacco (m)POWER measures to the highest level of achievement [12]. Concerning control of the use of alcohol, Tanzania's alcohol policy includes excise taxes on alcohol, a minimum drinking age of 18, a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving, regulations on alcohol advertising and sponsorships, and restrictions for on- and off-premise sales of alcoholic beverages [26]. The scope of the current Tanzania National Nutrition Strategy states: the strategy seeks to ensure the nutritional status of all citizens of Tanzania throughout their life cycle [27] . However, the strategy focuses more on women of reproductive age and children under five years of age with special emphasize on children less than two years because malnutrition's most serious and lasting damage occurs during pregnancy and the first two years of life. None of the targets set are related to NCDs or their dietary risk factors.64 Chapter 4There was no policy on physical exercise that was found other than a reference to a policy on physical education in schools [28]. 4.3.2 Health systems and the response to NCDs in Tanzania In Tanzania, health services for NCDs are mostly provided from district hospitals to higher level health facilities [29]. In 2010, the public health system had only two out of eight NCD- related screening and diagnostic tests nationwide (cervical cancer screening and breast cancer screening) at primary level facilities [21]. In regards to medications, by 2009, the problem of stock-outs for all drugs including for NCDs was persistent and was associated with poor health outcomes especially for those who could not access services in the private facilities [30]. In 2010, 15 out of 17 NCD-related drugs were available in public health system [21]. The Human Resource for Health (HRH) deficit in Tanzania stood at 65% in 2008 [7, 19]. With the projected increase of the NCD burden, the government is re-thinking its HRH management strategies [7, 19]. The immediate strategy involves capacity building of HRH for NCD care in the form of in-service trainings offered by various disease-interest groups [29, 31] like the Tanzania Diabetes Association which has trained staff from even lower level facilities in the Lake Region ( Zachariah Ngoma, personal communication, March 26 2013 ). The introduction of NCD prevention and control modules into courses in local training institutions [32] is availing the training to a wider pre-service trainee population, which may help to build the HRH pool of different cadres for the future. The Association of Private Health Facilities in Tanzania (APHFTA) has conducted in-service trainings for diabetes and hypertension care in 18 out of 27 regions of Tanzania [33]. In the public health system, comprehensive clinical guidelines have been developed only for diabetes and hypertension [21] but evidence for their distribution, training and utilization is limited. Currently, both health facility and population based information systems reflect limited measurement of NCD-related variables [34, 35]. The standards of Health Management Information System (HMIS) in Tanzania are slowly improving with efforts underway to minimize the existing challenges in quality and utilization of health information and to expand information sources such as the Cancer registry [36]. For population based NCD information to inform policy and other interventions, t he MoHSW resorted to search for evidence on NCDs and their risk factors through projects. The National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) conducted WHO STEP wise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance (WHO STEPs survey), to quantify the risk factors and burden for NCDs [15] 65 Platforms for responses to NCDs in Tanzanianationally. Variables for NCD risk factors have been included in the Tanzania DHS tool [34] and into the MZIMA adult health community cohort [37]. There is lack of literature on utilization of even wider existing platforms like the sentinel Panel of Districts (SPD) [38]. Underfunding of health services is a persistent challenge contributing to a myriad of other malfunctions in the system [39]. As a signatory of the Abuja declaration 2001 which required Governments to allocate at least 15% of its annual budget to health sector, Tanzania allocated 8.9 % for 2011/12 fiscal year [40]. Financing of health care is through among others health insurance mechanisms including community health funds that are being rolled out though uptake is reported to be low [41]. Integration of services is one way to deal with NCDs proposed in the Health Sector Strategic Plan III and provides a cost-efficient means of quality service delivery [7]. The government has collaborated with other stakeholders in a private hospital in Dar es Salaam whereby NCD services were introduced in the HIV clinic and staff trained in management of co-morbidities. In 2011 this initiative was evaluated and results showed that 15% of its 3400 patients on antiretroviral therapies had co-morbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and other metabolic disorders [42]. Other NCD-related programs that attest to advantages of private-public partnership include the ocean road cancer institute (ORCI), and the APHFTA [33, 43]. 4.3.3 Communities in preventive health and health care-seeking In public health, community involvement is key to achieving the goals of preventive and promotional health programs [44]. In Tanzania the importance of involving communities in effective disease control interventions for various infectious diseases has been well documented [45]. This practice was associated with increased access and acceptance of palliative services [46], effectiveness and efficiency of disease-control interventions [47], as well as equity, sustainability and communities' self-reliance [48]. Private facility initiatives like those under APHFTA through their NCD program, involved primary schools and communities around health facilities reached by their program in healthy lifestyle teachings including healthy eating and physical activities [33]. The impact of these interventions is however, not yet known . Factors contributing to development of NCDs include social determinants which are highly linked to complex socio-cultural practices and beliefs, making it challenging to effect lifestyle changes [49]. For example, fatness was associated with beauty and economic prosperity of the household [50] and excessive alcohol intake was fuelled by cheaply available local brew, and the need for entertainment and relaxation on the part of users [51]. 66 Chapter 4Literature suggests that where illness symptoms were thought to have spiritual aetiology, traditional healers became the preferred source of treatment [52-54], because they were perceived to have \"appropriate skills\" for managing diseases considered as out of order [55]. Socioeconomic determinants have been shown to influence the timeliness of peoples' responses to the utilization of emergency and in-patient services [56] and the initiation and continuation of treatments for chronic illnesses [55], all of which influence patient outcomes [57]. Studies revealed that services at health care facilities are only sought when chronic illness symptoms persist or worsen, after using over the counter medicines [58, 59]. In addition, accessibility to health facilities has been shown to facilitate prompt care seeking [60] and continuity of care for chronic illnesses [61]. Several factors influence adherence to treatments to infectious disease in Tanzania including; people's perceptions of the illness and quality of medicines [62], fear of side effects [63], patient- provider relationships, cultural pressure, cost and availability of medicines [61] and the patient's understanding of the medication schedule [64]. Others include poor access of re-filling prescriptions, inadequate nutrition especially for medicines perceived to increase hunger [63] and long hours of absence from home [65]. Adherence to medications was reported to also be influenced by gender [65]. 4.4 Discussion Our findings have shown that there is no existing NCD policy in Tanzania. For clarity of vision and purpose and coherence of interventions, a national policy is important [66, 67]. Reasons for lack of a policy include the lack of evidence to inform such a policy [67]. There are several opportunities in available guidelines and strategies for controlling exposure to the major NCD risk factors, which implementation of which is partly hampered by lack of an NCD-policy. Being multifaceted in their aetiology, NCD policies being designed must as well be multi-sectorial. In Tanzania, there was no evidence of including other sectors such as education and agriculture in policy development for NCD prevention and control. The country could learn from experiences shaping the HIV response where multi-sectoral approaches have been adopted in prevention and communication activities [68]. Regarding prevention of exposure to NCD risk factors, the adoption and implementation of FCTC is a positive step towards tobacco control. However more effort is needed towards fully implementing the convention through the mPOWER measures. Although some aspects of alcohol policy are in place, implementation of these especially in rural areas where local brew is mostly produced and consumed will be a challenge [68]. 67 Platforms for responses to NCDs in TanzaniaAddressing diet related NCDs in the national nutrition strategy without setting targets related to NCDs or their dietary risk factors indicates that over nutrition is not yet prioritized. Whereas there are still no policies focusing on physical activity, it has been proposed that the policies will have to address activity at work places, leisure activities and means of transport [69]. Physical activity policies should also be sensitive to socio-cultural differences across Tanzania. As policies are being developed to tackle the rising NCD burden, the health system in Tanzania must gear up for roles in primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of NCDs. Concentration of the NCD services at higher level health facilities leads to late diagnosis and delayed access to appropriate treatments especially in rural areas [70]. Accessibility of NCD services also entails availability of diagnostic and treatment services at the primary level facilities. Lack of screening and diagnostic tests at primary level facilities creates a challenge for NCD care especially the long term patient monitoring and management. Whereas the WHO observatory indicates that NCD medication availability was impressive, it is the consistent medical supply of affordable medicines that contributes to favourable health outcomes. A recent national survey in Tanzania showed that, only 9% of rural and 20% of the urban health facilities provided diabetes diagnosis and management services and only half of these had the staff, drugs, diagnostics and guidelines to actually provide the service on the day of the survey [17]. Generally the health care system is not prepared to tackle the rising burden of NCDs [17, 71]. The HRH crisis hinders quality preventive, diagnostic and treatment service provision for NCDs close to the community and requires creative thinking on how to more efficiently use the existing HRH. The pre-service and in-service training efforts, though prudent, do not completely address the shortage of competent cadres in lower level facilities in the country. Creativity including task-shifting where lower cadres of HRH are prepared for NCD prevention and management could ease this crisis as has been done elsewhere [72]. Availing tools like clinical guidelines has facilitated task-shifting and could be adopted in Tanzania's primary care facilities [72] The rising burden of NCDs will increase the financial strain on the health system because of their chronic nature, and hence, new approaches to minimize costs of interventions must be embraced. Integration ensures that, \"clients receive a continuum of preventive and curative services, according to their needs over time and across different levels of the health system\"[73]. Various integration models are possible, but little has been documented on pilot projects. The benefits of integration of services that have been observed in the Tanzanian example have been demonstrated in other settings where chronic diseases clinics have been piloted [74]. This idea of chronic disease clinics could be replicated in primary care settings where HIV prevention, care and treatment services are offered. 68 Chapter 4Improvement of HMIS would positively influence quality of care for NCD patients and overall health system functioning [75]. Systematic information concerning public awareness and practices regarding NCD risky behaviours as well as factors that shape risky lifestyle is still limited. Existing population survey platforms such as the demographic surveillance system and SPD could be adapted to fit chronic disease surveillance by introducing outcome measures that realistically measure morbidity burden of NCDs. Mortality outcomes may not capture true burden of NCDs whose onset and course is insidious. The financial strains caused by NCDs are also experienced by patients and their families. Ensuring effective implementation of the policy on health-care fee waivers which exempts patients with chronic diseases from user fee charges will improve accessibility and equity in utilization of NCD services. However, this has implications to the government resources and may necessitate government's re-allocation of its financial resources to the health sector. Considering that NCDs are insidious in their onset, slow in their progression and long-term, communities have to be involved in their prevention and control [76]. Community involvement has been shown to be effective in other chronic diseases prevention and control efforts [77, 78]. This involvement has also been recommended in the Tanzania HSSP III as an objective in the NCD control strategy [7]. Since community responses, including lifestyle changes, are shaped by socio-cultural aspects and health system factors, effective mitigation of NCDs will therefore have to integrate community based and individually targeted interventions [79] that are sensitive to variations in gender and cultural norms, for them to be acceptable [80]. Knowing that health services are commonly sought when illnesses persist or worsen, after failure of self-medication, interventions to promote prompt health care seeking must be designed. Self-medication may present a challenge when it comes to NCDs, most of which are initially asymptomatic and symptoms indicate worsening of disease intensity. Information is lacking on NCD self-treatment patterns and their motivations, which may hinder the possibility of addressing any undesirable patterns in the community. As NCD medication use is long-term, it is important to understand how socio-cultural aspects shape people's sustained compliance to medicines . Compliance to long-term medication has been studied for infectious chronic diseases [81, 82] however community perceptions towards infectious disease and NCDs may not be the same. Therefore application of the findings from these studies to NCDs medication may not be valid. Exploration of the aspects that might shape sustained compliance to long-term NCDs medication would inform designing of strategies that foster compliance to long term treatments. 69 Platforms for responses to NCDs in TanzaniaThe knowledge gaps for both research and policy agendas regarding responses to the rising NCDs burden in Tanzania include inadequate information on the epidemiological patterns of NCDs and their determinants across Tanzania and the limited awareness of the local context to inform the design of an integrative and multi-sectorial policy. Apart from better understanding the epidemiological pattern of NCDs, it will be important to project the implications of the current dual burden on population life expectancy, taking into account not just the health systems and policy environment, but also the wider demographic and development indicators. There is limited evidence on effective interventions for NCD services in primary care levels and information on community perceptions on NCDs and their care- seeking is virtually absent. 4.5 Limitations and strength of the review This review included mainly published documents and thus omitted insights from non- published developments. Through the inclusion of only English-language documents we might have missed relevant results published in Kiswahili. However, a Kiswahili language research journal does not exist in Tanzania and English is one of the country's official languages. We therefore think that this has not resulted in non-inclusion of formal government- produced documents nor of research publications. The search terms did not include \"chronic disease\" because not all chronic diseases are NCDs. We thus may have missed articles that used only \"chronic disease\" as a term to describe NCDs. Nevertheless, the holistic nature of the information reviewed provides a broader view of the NCDs situation and the responses in Tanzania. The narrative review approach was chosen rather than a systematic review, because it is well suited to present a broad perspective on a newly emerging problem [83, 84]. 4.6 Conclusions and recommendations NCDs and their risk factors are largely lifestyle related, making multi-sectorial responses unavoidable. These conditions are posing a critical challenge to the government, health system and communities that have to face both communicable and NCDs. There is limited context-relevant information on the burden and determinants of NCDs which may hamper the design of effective interventions, especially for prevention. The existing research platforms such as the health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS), DHS and SPD can be leveraged to address these NCD knowledge gaps.70 Chapter 4Current efforts to address NCDs in Tanzania are fragmented due to lack of a NCD policy. The success of NCD prevention and control requires such a clearly defined NCD policy to provide a roadmap for implementation of multi-sectoral strategies and plans. For effective interventions targeting NCDs risk factors at local level, empowerment of local government authorities tasked with implementation of existing policies in the country is needed. The country's health system is not adequately prepared to accommodate the requirements of NCDs. There is an urgent need to design and evaluate low-tech, low-cost interventions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and continuity of care that can be scaled up at primary care levels. This may necessitate the adoption of an integrated health care model to address both NCDs and other chronic communicable diseases as a strategy to address the HRH and financing challenges. Also, supporting informed decision making for NCDs at clinical and policy levels requires accurate clinical record keeping and diseases registry maintenance for NCDs and their risk factors. Information on community awareness and practices in prevention and health care seeking regarding NCDs is limited. The role of the community in NCD development, prevention and management must be explored by understanding the motivations for health seeking, self- medication practices and aspects shaping continuity of care in their particular contexts. Main findings There is limited context-relevant information on the epidemiological patterns of NCDs and their determinants across Tanzania, this may hamper the design of effective interventions, especially prevention. Current efforts to address NCDs in Tanzania are fragmented due to lack of a NCD policy The county's health system is not adequately prepared to accommodate the requirements of NCDs and the information on community awareness, practices in prevention and health care seeking regarding NCDs is limited. Key messages for actions The existing research platforms such as the health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS), demographic health surveys (DHS) and the sentinel panel of districts (SPD) should be leveraged to address the knowledge gaps in the epidemiological patterns, in best practices in health care and in community roles in prevention and management of NCDs in Tanzania.71 Platforms for responses to NCDs in Tanzania Considering the multifaceted nature of NCD risk factors and causation, there is a need to formulate a clear, multi-dimensional policy on NCDs prevention and management. There is an urgent need to design and evaluate low-tech, low-cost interventions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and continuity of care that can be scaled up at primary care levels. This may include the adoption of an integrated health care model to address both NCDs and other chronic communicable diseases as a strategy to address the HRH and financing challenges.

Malaria J, 13, 249.\"We have become doctors for ourselves\": motives for malaria self-care among adults in southeastern Tanzania*5 78 Chapter 5Abstract Background: Prompt and appropriate treatment of malaria with effective medicines remains necessary if malaria control goals are to be achieved. The theoretical concepts from self-care and the health belief model were used to examine the motivations for malaria self-care among the adult population. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted through eight focus group discussions with adult community members to explore their general opinions, views and perceptions of malaria and of its treatments. These groups were followed by 15 in-depth interviews of participants with a recent malaria experience to allow for an in-depth exploration of their self-care practices. The analysis followed principles of grounded theory and was conducted using Nvivo 9 qualitative data management software. Results: The self-treatment of malaria at home was found to be a common practice among the study participants. The majority of the participants practiced self-medication with a painkiller as an initial response. The persistence and the worsening of the disease symptoms prompted participants to consider other self-care options. Perceptions that many malaria symptoms are suggestive of other conditions motivated participants to self-refer for malaria test. The accessibility of private laboratory facilities and drug shops motivated their use for malaria tests and for obtaining anti-malarial medicines, respectively. Self-treatment with anti- malaria monotherapy was common, motivated by their perceived effectiveness and availability. The perceived barriers to using the recommended combination treatments/ artemether-lumefantrine were related to the possible side-effects and to uncertainty about their effectiveness, and these doubts motivated some participants to consider self-medication with local herbs. Several factors were mentioned as motivating people for self-care practices. These included poor patient provider relationship, unavailability of medicine and the costs associated with accessing treatments from the health facilities. Conclusions: Malaria self-care and self-treatment with anti-malarial monotherapy are common among adults, and are motivated by both individual characteristics and the limitations of the existing health care facilities. There is a need for public health interventions to take into account community perceptions and cultural schemas on malaria self-care practices. Key words: Malaria, Self-care, Adults, Qualitative methods, Self-medication, Tanzania79 Motives for malaria self-care5.1 Background Globally, malaria remains a menace. An estimated 219 million cases are reported annually worldwide leading to 660,000 deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounting for 90 percent of the cases [1]. Malaria is an important cause of death in SSA [1] where 75 percent of 650 million people reside in malaria transmission areas. In Tanzania 10 -12 million clinical malarial cases are reported annually by public health facilities, with the disease contributing to more than 40 percent of visits to health facilities [2]. A recent disease-specific mortality estimate estimates the cumulative probability of dying from malaria in Tanzania at 81.1 per 1,000 population [3]. Under-five children and pregnant women are the most susceptible to malaria transmission and its subsequent effects. Although the overall malaria burden is generally decreasing throughout Africa [4-9], a shift in the burden to adults is reported [10]. Thus, in this paper the focus is on adults and their motives for malaria self-care practices . As malaria is preventable and curable [1, 5] large-scale anti-malaria interventions have been initiated by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). Currently, four main malaria control interventions are being pursued: improved malaria case management, intermittent malaria treatment in pregnancy, malaria epidemic prevention and control, and integrated malaria vector control activities. These interventions are aimed to reduce the incidence of malaria by at least 75 percent and to nearly eliminate the number of malaria- related deaths by 2015 [11]. The scaling up of these interventions has already led to a decline in the malaria burden in areas where the disease is endemic [1, 12]. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends prompt and appropriate management of all malaria cases with efficacious medicines [1]. Most SSA countries have started to use arteminisinin combination therapy (ACT), which is efficacious in the management of uncomplicated malaria cases. In Tanzania, a fixed-dose combination of artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) has been used since 2006 for treating such uncomplicated malaria cases . The use of ACT replaced Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine (SP) that was hitherto used for treating uncomplicated malaria cases on children above two months of age and or weighing above 5kgs and all adults except in last trimester pregnancy cases, and lactating mothers whose babies are below two months of age [13, 14]. To enhance access to these ACTs, ALu is also made available at subsidised prices in the private retail sector, which is dominated by accredited drug dispensing outlets (ADDO) in Tanzania. The ADDO initiative is aimed at improving the quality of care in the private drug retail sector [15]. Other anti-malarial drugs, particularly monotherapy, are also readily available in these outlets. 80 Chapter 5People in different communities may have different opinions about illnesses, which inform their schemas and perceptions of the efficacy of various medical options. Indeed, cultural norms and beliefs tend to shape treatment-seeking practices [16-18], including perceptions about susceptibility to malaria, the consequences of the disease and the effectiveness of various malaria treatments [19-21]. Self-medication for malaria using retail drugs has been found to be common [22], in SSA in general [23-27] and Tanzania in particular [28-31]. Thus in this paper the focus is to understand the malaria self-care practices and motives for the choice of drug store services . 5.2 Self-care as a concept The concept of self-care in public health can be traced back to the 1960s [32]. It has been defined as a process in which individuals undertake disease prevention, detection and treatment on their own without consultation to healthcare providers; it entails self-diagnosis and use of remedies previously prescribed for similar illness and/or the purchase of medications without professional advice [32-38]. Segall and Goldstein describe self-care as comprising potential behavioural practices such as health maintenance, disease prevention, assessment of symptoms, self-diagnosis, self-treatment (non-medication treatments and self- medication), self-referral, consultation with non-medical (alternative) care practitioners, and the use of specialised medical care [34]. WHO acknowledges self-care as a key aspect of public health, which plays a pivotal role in the health care system [22], despite the attendant risks, including those associated with incorrect diagnosis and use of non-prescribed medicines [39]. In public health research, theories and models on health-seeking behaviour help explain the underlying motivations for often multifaceted and complex people's care-seeking decisions [40]. In particular, the health belief model (HBM) is widely applied to explain health-seeking behaviour. This model centres on four concepts: the perceived susceptibility to a disease, the perceived severity of the disease, the perceived benefits of the treatment actions, and the perceived barriers to adopting proposed measures. The model posits that what triggers individuals' decisions regarding health-seeking behaviour are general health motivations, including internal cues (i.e. symptoms), and external cues (i.e. interpersonal interactions and media communications) [41]. Subsequently, the concept of self-efficacy was added to the model to refer to an individual's perceived ability to adopt and perform specific actions successfully. This individual-centred model is aimed at assessing the decision-making processes employed by individuals in need of healthcare . 81 Motives for malaria self-careThe HBM concepts are also pertinent to self-care decisions. In this regard, an individual's perceptions of his or her susceptibility to malaria and the perceived severity of the condition will inform his/her perceptions of the threats associated with leaving the condition unattended to. This study has combined the theoretical concepts from Self-care and HBM, to argue that self-care practices are more likely to be informed by individuals' knowledge of malaria and perceived susceptibility to the condition. Moreover, individuals' perceptions regarding the severity of the disease and the perceived benefits associated with different treatments options for restoring health will inform their self-care therapy choices. 5.3 Self-care in Tanzania Studies on health care-seeking behaviour in response to malaria among Tanzanians [42-46] shows that adults reportedly turn to professional healthcare only when the symptoms persist or worsen [43, 44, 46]. Research suggests, however, that the medicines bought in drug stores are often of poor quality, and are not used rationally in many developing countries [47], including Tanzania [28, 48, 49]. Concerns that most malaria self-treatment practices are inadequate, inappropriate and ineffective have been expressed in relation to Tanzania [29, 30] and elsewhere [25, 50, 51]. In fact, self-care increases the chances of using unnecessary medicines while delaying seeking of appropriate treatment of the illness, which may exacerbate and complicate the disease. In this regard, the role of self-care in the development of drug resistance, especially to anti-malarial drugs, cannot be underestimated [23, 24, 50-53]. In this paper the specific attention is on why people choose self-care practices in malaria treatment, and the motives for the choice of drug store services. Gaining such an understanding of the motives behind malaria self-care is critical in developing strategies for promoting the use of appropriate medicines in the community. This study was conducted as part of a larger project that investigated health- seeking behaviour among adults in the context of the epidemiological transition, with a focus on malaria and diabetes. The results from other parts of the project will be presented separately . 5.4 Methods 5.4.1 Study area and population. This study was conducted in Kilombero, one of the six districts of the Morogoro region, located in the southeastern part of Tanzania. Kilombero district has a total area of 14,018 sq km and a population of 407,880 (202,789 men and 205,091 women) [54]. There are 54 health facilities in the district, including two hospitals (a designated district referral hospital and a 82 Chapter 5hospital owned by a private organization), four government health centres and 48 dispensaries, some of which are owned by the government, and some of which are privately owned. The Kilombero district has long been known for its malaria intensity [55, 56], and although the incidence of malaria has been reduced, the disease is still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the district [8]. The districts' ecological and climatic condition is suitable for both high and perennial malaria transmission [57].The malaria control programmes of the district have benefited for more than 50 years from the malaria research activities of the Ifakara Health Institutes, as well as from the efforts of several other malaria control stakeholders in the district. Two villages were purposively selected for the study with the help of district council health management team members. The criteria for the selection based on their proximity to the designated district hospital. The semi-urban village was located less than 5 km from Ifakara town, while the distance between the rural village and the town was 43 km. This discrepancy provided the opportunity to capture semi-urban and rural perspectives regarding self-care practices. The total population of the two villages is 21,270: 12,823 people live in the semi- urban village and 8,447 people live in the rural village. The majorities of the villagers have no more than a primary school education, and are small-scale farmers who grow mainly rice and maize. The main sources of health services for the residents of the semi-urban village are a laboratory facility and four dispensaries, all of which are privately owned, and which diagnose and treat malaria, along with other health problems. There are also 14 drug shops located in the village that sell a variety of medicines, including anti-malarial drugs. The village has no government-owned health facilities. As they live close to Ifakara, the residents of this village can also access a number of drug shops, laboratory facilities and dispensaries located there. By contrast, the rural village has one private laboratory facility that provides diagnostic services only, and a government-owned village dispensary. This dispensary provides both diagnostic tests and treatments for malaria and other conditions. The inhabitants of this village can obtain anti-malarial drugs from the four drug shops located in their village or from several other shops in the adjacent villages. They also have the option of travelling to Ifakara to access treatments or purchase medicines. There is no privately owned health facility in this village. 5.4.2 Study design and participant recruitment This is a qualitative, exploratory study in which the views of adults were examined through focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) conducted between October 2012 and March 2013. The purpose of the FGDs was to elicit a broad range of views and opinions on malaria, malaria self-care practices and motives for utilization of drug shop 83 Motives for malaria self-careservices. The goal of the IDIs was to explore in greater depth individual perceptions and experiences with malaria, and the decision-making processes involved in malaria self-care practices. The age range of the participants was 25-81 years. Of the 74 study participants (35 women and 39 men), 59 were involved in eight FGDs (with each made up of seven to nine participants), and 15 participated in the IDIs. In order to capture a wide range of opinions and ideas, and taking into account the gender dynamics in the community, FGDs were held separately for men and women. The number of discussions and interviews was determined after data saturation had been reached. The FGD participants were purposively selected among the adult residents of the community. The FGDs participants' inclusion criteria considered gender, being an adult and a permanent residency in the study villages IDIs were conducted with adult individuals who had direct experience with malaria 14 days prior to the date of the interview. These individuals were purposively selected from the community with the help of the village leaders and none of them were involved in the FGDs. In determining eligibility for participation in the study, the research team visited individuals in their villages, asking them about their fever history over the previous two weeks, and using screening questions to determine the individuals' beliefs about the causes of the fever. After it was established that malaria was the cause of an individual's fever, and that the individual met the study's inclusion criteria, the person was given detailed information about the study, and was asked whether he/she was willing to take part. If the individual expressed an interest in and a willingness to participate, appointments for discussion were made based on his/her availability. Most of the discussions took place two days after the appointments at the participant's household. 5.4.3 Data collection Two research assistants with a social science background at postgraduate level were trained to conduct the study. Together with authors, these assistants piloted the data collection guides. The results from the pilot helped the team to refine the guides before they were used in the main study. The data collection took place in two separate rounds. The first round involved FGDs. The results from this round were used to sharpen the IDI topic guides before they were used in the second round of data collection, which consisted of the IDIs. All of the FGDs and the IDIs were facilitated by the authors. In each of the FGDs, one of the assistants took notes. Both FGDs and IDIs were conducted in Swahili, a language which was spoken by a majority of the participants. These discussions were recorded, and verbatim transcriptions of the recordings were undertaken within 48 hours of the time they were conducted. The transcripts were reviewed and cross-checked for quality by the authors before they were imported to NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia). All the transcripts were 84 Chapter 5analyzed in their original language. The analysis process took place at two levels. The first level entailed the development of inductive and deductive codes. This was followed by a second level, in which the codes were categorized into themes and family codes based on the principles of the grounded theory and the concepts of the HBM. After the deductive (HBM) and the inductive concepts were combined, the following themes emerged: (i) knowledge and malaria awareness; (ii) malaria self-care practices; (iii) self-diagnosis and use of pain killers (iv) self-diagnosis and the prescription of anti-malarial drugs (v) self-referral for a malaria test (vi) self-medication: a preference for monotherapy; (vii) motives for using drug shop services; and, (viii) self-medication with alternative medicines. 5.4.4 Ethical approval The study was given ethical approval by the institutional review boards of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, the University of Groningen in The Netherlands, the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania, and the National Tanzanian Medical Research Coordinating Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR). Study participants in both FGDs and IDIs provided verbal consent. To ensure the anonymity of the study participants, all identifiers were removed from the data, and only the opinions of the participants are presented. 5.5 Results 5.5.1 Knowledge and malaria awareness Levels of knowledge and awareness of malaria shape people's perceptions regarding their susceptibility to the disease, and are key factors in health care-seeking practices. In this study, the majority of the participants displayed a basic knowledge of malaria, including the possible consequences of the disease and its link with mosquitoes. In the FGDs, participants described malaria as a major health problem in the community and as a threat to the lives of the majority of people. In general, the participants agreed that everyone in the community was potentially susceptible to the condition, regardless of his or her age. The high levels of knowledge and awareness of malaria observed in this setting reflect the prevention efforts of the malaria control organizations in the Kilombero Valley. These organizations conduct intensive media campaigns on malaria, which include road shows, posters and leaflets. Recently, radio and television have been used for malaria control education, albeit mainly in urban and semi-urban areas. However, radio, and especially the local radio station Radio Pambazuko Kilombero , is a key source of malaria information in rural areas. The following explanation of how media raises community awareness of malaria and its link to mosquito was offered in an IDI:85 Motives for malaria self-care\"Yeah, it is what we are told everyday mosquitoes are the ones causing even in the radios, hospital there...there are advertisements/posters on mosquitoes causing malaria... every day you will hear mosquito is a dangerous insect ...it causes malaria... malaria is dangerous present quickly in the hospital to get service when you think you have malaria.\" Ashura female, 53 years a, b In all of the discussions, malaria, or homa ya malaria , was said to produce a wide range of symptoms, including high fever, coldness, tiredness, headaches, yellow vomit, dizziness, joint pain, loss of appetite, yellow urine, and diarrhea. These symptoms are in line with clinical descriptions of the disease. However, the participants observed that these symptoms are not always taken seriously as signs of malaria due to their perceived non-specificity. During the interviews, most of the participants said they did not become convinced that the symptoms were suggestive of malaria until after they had used a painkiller and found that the symptoms persisted. Participants considered a malaria test to be important in confirming their self- diagnosis, due to similarity of symptoms to typhoid and other diseases. 5.5.2 Malaria self-care practices In this study, malaria care seeking is seen as a process that entails different activities at different levels. The participants expressed concerns about the cost of using health care facilities, frequent shortages of medicines, and the attitudes and practices of health care workers; noting that factors such as these affect their health-seeking behaviour and discourage them from using the services of health care facilities. In outlining their perceived malaria symptoms, the participants reported several self-care strategies ( see Table 5.1 ) based on their evaluation of the severity of their symptoms. They also considered their perceptions regarding their ability to use self-care strategies successful, and their perceptions of the benefits of employing such strategies. A close analysis of the data revealed that the care-seeking behaviours of the participants were similar in both the semi-urban village and the rural village, and among men and women. There were no apparent gender differences in the self-care practices, though affordability was more of a concern among women than men. In elaborating on the malaria self-care practices identified in this study, the following sections are structured according to the theoretical concept of Segall and Goldstein [34] explained earlier in the paper. 5.5.3 Self-diagnosis and use of painkillers A majority of study participants reported engaging in self-diagnosis and self-medication of fever and pain using painkillers such as Panadol (see Table 5.1 ). Participants perceived that the symptoms resulted from normal tiredness due to hard work or working in the sun, and that the painkiller would help. The perceived benefits of the painkiller in reducing fever and 86 Chapter 5alleviating pains were also cited as motives for self-medication. Most of the painkillers used were either leftovers of medication used to treat previous illnesses, or they were bought from general shops. The participants explained that when the painkiller did not provide them with relief from their symptoms, they then started to consider further options.

The decision to wait was based on the expectation that the symptoms would subside after the use of the painkiller. It was not until participants perceived their symptoms as more severe, which also increased their perception of susceptibility to malaria, that they reported taking further action. \"It took like two to three days ... because I was thinking it is just a normal tiredness due to work but after observing I have used Panadol with no success it is when I thought I better go for testing so that I know for sure what exactly is the problem\" Xemp, male, 46 years The general use of painkillers observed in the study may have been shaped by an individual's long history of treating febrile conditions, and his or her perceptions of the benefits of painkillers in alleviating fever and pain. The long-term impact of such practices on the health of a user is of concern, but addressing this issue was not possible in the current study. 5.5.4 Self-diagnosis and the prescription of anti-malarial drugs A majority of the participants had been residents of the study communities for many years. As malaria has been endemic in the region, the people have learned to live with it by developing cultural schemas for self-care. This could be seen in the IDIs, in which some participants reported self-medicating with anti-malarial drugs as soon as they had symptoms, based on their strong perception that malaria was the cause. Participants described their decision-making process regarding the use of anti-malarials as follows: \"When I had that fever I knew completely it is malaria due to how I was feeling eeh... that cold, headache and joint pains all these were severely paining, I knew it will only be malaria and nothing else... eeh so I decided to use anti malaria and I am doing well.\" Salome, female, 66 years Individuals' previous experiences in managing similar conditions seem to have informed their self-medication decisions. There appears to be a large reservoir of medical knowledge in the community on malaria and its treatments. This might be due to the social marketing 88 Chapter 5interventions in the area, coupled with individuals' multiple exposure to bouts of the disease and to its treatments. Thus, self-diagnosis and self-prescription were often reported by the study participants: \"...so after feeling that condition... I thought it is better I buy that amodiaquine because it is a medicine that I am used to and whenever I have a malaria condition like now ...when I just use it my condition becomes better. I could have bought other medicines but there was no need because my medicine which I am used to was available.\" Mchome, male, 50 years 5.5.5 Self-referral for a malaria test The perceived severity of symptoms and the increased susceptibility to malaria triggered the need for a test. Majority of IDI participants indicated they obtained malaria tests from private laboratory diagnostic facilities. Only a few of the interviewees went to a health care facility for a laboratory test after painkillers failed to relieve their pain. These private laboratory facilities are found within the catchment area of the study communities, and are managed by trained laboratory practitioners equipped to diagnosis conditions such as malaria using a blood sample, and examination of other illnesses using urine and stool samples. At the time of this study, most of these facilities were using microscopic diagnostic tests for malaria that cost 0.64$ (Tshs 1,000). The interviewees reported referring themselves to these facilities to confirm their self-diagnosis before deciding on which medicine to use. The perceptions that some malaria symptoms resemble those associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI) or typhoid were among the reasons cited for choosing to take a malaria test. The participants observed that self-diagnosis could lead to the wrong choice of medications, leaving the true cause of the condition untreated, and thus prolonging the duration of the illness: \"...It does happen even though not to myself but you may hear someone has taken malaria medicines even for three times but the fever do not stop... when they go for checking [testing] they find the person has typhoid while he was treating malaria... that is why he was not getting cured so a situation like that does exist and that is why it is important to test first before taking any medicines to be sure which medicines you use for what disease...\" Gift, female, 51 years The high levels of awareness of malaria and of testing options found in this study can be attributable to the behaviour change and communication (BCC) activities regarding prompt 89 Motives for malaria self-careand effective malaria treatments that have been undertaken in the district. Some of the participants made reference to the instructions and information people receive from different media channels on malaria treatment. The following statements describe in detail some of the cues and motives for taking a malaria test: \"Because information is already going around... people are being instructed... the media as well... is saying '...people you should not just start taking medications before testing to know what disease is disturbing because sometimes you may be suffering believing it is malaria while it is not...it is just another disease ... now when you use anti-malaria medicines you cannot get cured as a result you just hurt yourself' ...so we listen to them that is why we test first for malaria before using anti malaria medicines... we want to know if it is malaria, how many parasites are there and if it is not malaria what is the problem that disturbing...\" Daima, male, 65 years 5.5.6 Self-medication: a preference for monotherapy Despite the changes in malaria treatment guidelines in Tanzania that recommend the use of combination therapy, other anti-malarial treatment, many monotherapy, are widely accessible through the private sector. The results of this study show that a variety of anti-malarial medicines were used in managing participants' recent malaria episodes. The use of monotherapy was reported by the majority, leaving less than half of the participants using the combination treatment/ALu that is recommended as the first-line anti-malarial in Tanzania. However, a number of participants reported using a variety of monotherapies in managing their recent bouts of illness, including Metakelfin\u00ae, Fansidar\u00ae, Malafin\u00ae, Orodar\u00ae and amodiaquine. These medicines were obtained from drug shops. Most of the interview participants reported choosing anti-malarial brands after the drug shop clerk or service provider asked them: \" What anti-malarial medicine do you normally use? \" The perceived benefits and effectiveness associated with specific medicines prompted their choice. The individuals' previous experience with using the same medication to manage similar conditions may have motivated their decision: \"Aah that one... I just decided myself to use Orodar because that is the medicine I normally use when I get malaria... eeh if I use that Orodar it does not disturb me I just become well and continue with my normal activities.\" Ashura, female, 53 years A number of participants reasoned the length of the treatments and the need to take multiple tablets as some of the barriers for using ALu therapy. In elaborating on this, participants 90 Chapter 5gave examples in which they compared the ease of using some monotherapy, especially single-dose, with using ALu, which must be taken over three days: \"...the problem with Mseto/ALu is those tablets ... they have made so many tablets ...when the patient sees them ...he gets scared ...because I don't know they are like how many ...eeeh 24 tablets something like that... and you are supposed to take all of them... that also I think is not good... because when one is sick first of all you just don't like medicines... now when the dosage has many tablets it particularly disappoints you... I think it is better they reduce the number of tablets a bit ...it will easy its use (will you use it?) no honestly I like the one to use only once, these one [ALu] I think... I will fail completely... I will just ask the doctor to prescribe me another one to use once ...isn't it that there are just various malaria medicines...\" Uzuri, female, 26 years However, the quality of medicines purchased in drug shops, and specifically the monotherapy may be questionable, and their use may prevent malaria sufferers from using more effective combination treatments. 5.5.7 Motives for using drug-shop services Drug shops play a major role in managing malaria illness in the community. In this study, all of the participants except one said they had obtained their anti-malarial medicines from drug shops, regardless of where the diagnosis was made. These shops are widespread and easily accessible in the study villages. The privately owned shops offer various types of anti-malarial drugs, usually with or without a prescription. The majority of the clerks in these shops are government trainees certified to sell a set of essential drugs, including the combination treatment/ALu. When asked why they chose to use drug shops, many participants cited the cost of going to health care facilities. During group discussions, participants reported that when they think of visiting health care facilities, many negative associations came to mind. For example, one participant said a person would have to ask himself/herself: \" Do I have enough money to get treatments there? \" before visiting such a facility. This concern was explained in detail in the interviews, in which participants reported not seeking care from the health facilities because of limited funds: \"Eeeh due to the financial position one has, one may have 500 shillings only at hand, when you go there at the health facility you are asked 1,000 shillings for registration 91 Motives for malaria self-careright... you are not yet given medication... you are told to go and buy from the drug shop... now it is better I take a short cut to buy medicines from the drug shop and use... it is not that we fail to go for testing there ... it is a result of the financial ability... eeh.\" Barua, male, 65 years Participants reported taking such shortcuts to obtaining medical services through providers such as drug shops, because they knew visiting health care facilities would entail more expense, i e, for consultation, testing and medicines, which they believed they could not afford: \"...as a result of the amount of money I had... I thought if I go there at the dispensary it won't be enough to buy medicines because I have to pay for consultation first... that is why I decided taking short cut to buy medications straight away and use.\" Easter, female, 34 years Members of the discussion groups complained that in most cases the health care facilities do not have malaria medicines on the premises, and that when they visit such a facility they have to pay for consultations with a practitioner who provides them with a paper prescription, which they then have to take to the shop to be filled. Participants voiced their concerns that drug shortages, coupled with the procedures patients have to follow at the health care facilities, forces patients to perform the double role of both patient and doctor. Thus, the study participants reported that taking responsibility for one's own diagnosis, prescription, outcome evaluation, and re-diagnosis is the norm. Health care facilities are seen as a last resort when self-care options have failed. \"...to a big percentage... we have become doctors for ourselves because we are tired of going to the health facilities. When one feels headache, leg pain, high fever... you will hear saying go and buy me Mseto/Alu... he buys it and use, if he still feels fever he goes to buy tablets for ... for Amoeba believing that may be this is Amoeba, when he uses it and find still not yet ...will go to maybe to his/her neighbour ...the neighbuor will tell him perhaps it is urinary truck infection [UTI] so he will go to the drug shop, buy medicines and use. Now after seeing he/she have used all these medicines and the condition is still persisting ... it is when another person will come and tell him maybe it is Typhoid, so now with Typhoid he/she will go for testing... currently people are tired of going to the health facilities... we have become doctors ourselves because drug shops are many and sometimes when you go to the drug shop they advise ... use this medicine ... so you feel it is better I go to the shop rather than wasting all my 92 Chapter 5time going to the health facility, pay for consultation and waste the a full day there at the end being told to go to buy medicines from the shop...isn't it better going to the shop directly?\" Female FGD1, 25 - 51 years, semi-urban village The participants also reported that the attitude toward patients of the typical health care provider was among their motivations for seeking care from the shops. They said they believed they were not getting enough attention during health facility consultations, or that they had to wait to receive services: \"Others [doctors] when you get there he just asks you one question...'what is the problem'...now as you continue explaining your problem just at the middle of the explanation he gives you a book [a prescription] saying 'go and buy these medicines...' you see...now this medicine I am going to buy is for what? I haven't yet explained my problem well for him to hear now he has the prescription already ... then when a person sees that... would he really go to the health facility again? You will go to the health facility to do what? Then it is when you think you better go to the drug shop and explain to that seller s/he would advise.\" Female FGD4, 25 - 46 years, rural village 5.5.8 Self-medication with alternative medicines Self-medication using alternative medicines was mentioned in both the FGDs and in IDIs as representing a common practice in the study communities, although none of the participants indicated that they had used such medicines in managing their recent malaria episodes. Alternative medicines such as neem tree roots and leaves ( mwarobaini ) were frequently mentioned as being used for treating malaria in the community. Among the alternative medications mentioned were aloe vera and mlonge ( Moringe oliferus ) leaves. It is widely believed that the use of local herbs can significantly delay the recurrence of malaria. The participants cited the perceived benefits and efficacy of the herbs as motivation for their use as self-medication by the majority of people in the community: \"Aah, it is just many [people] who use local herbs and if you use the tree [Neem tree] you stay for a very long time ... can be even six months before getting malaria fever again... that is real a medicine as what the elders just said ... that tree is very helpful\" Male FGD2, 43 - 80 years, semi-urban village The perceived benefits related to availability and efficacy of local herbs was also cited as reasons why they are used instead of western medicines. In many cases, local herbs can be 93 Motives for malaria self-careaccessed at zero cost, as people can just pick leaves or roots from the specific trees available in the vicinity. The perceived benefits that local herb do not have side-effects was cited as another motive for their use. In addition, participants noted that many people doubt the efficacy of the recommended treatments for malaria, and thus prefer to use local herbs. The presence of various anti-malarial drug brands on the market and the changes in anti-malarial treatment policies were cited as signs of the government's uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of anti-malarial medicines, and were thus seen as cues for favouring the use of local herbs: \"I think there are two things... first treatment costs ...if you don't have money what will you go for at the health facility?... you will not get any help... secondly the government is not sure of what is doing... as it is making changes on malaria treatment medicines from time to time... this becomes like they are not yet certain on what medicine to use ... instead they are deciding to do research on us... so who wants to be researched on? That is why people do not go there [the health facility]... they don't like those medicines they believe it is better to use local medicines because first of all... these local medicines do not have side effects ...\" Mfuko, male, 46 years Two of the interview participants reported that they often self-medicate using herbal remedies when they feel unwell, even though they did not do so in the most recent episode. A number of participants expressed the belief that herbal medicines are preferable to conventional medicines when a disease is still in its early stages. They stated that alternative medicines act more slowly on the human body than western medicines, and are thus more effective in managing mild conditions: \"...what caused me not to use local herbs ...is that local herbs treat slowly... I mean... One should not wait until a person becomes completely serious then you start giving him/her local herbs... that is not right because at that stage you cannot give the medication since local herb treatments delays but these medicines of our colleagues... western medicines ...treats quicker. For instance if a person is dehydrated you cannot be saying bring him local herbs and start administering... you will welcome death. So my condition was a bit worrying and had not yet prepared the medications ... I thought I use first these western medicines then I see how it goes.\" Xemp, male, 46 years94 Chapter 5Several participants also said that alternative medicines could be useful in preventing diseases in some instances. The Swahili term mwarobaini translates as 'of forties'. This 'forties' concept is reflected in the widely held perception that mwarobaini can treat more than 40 diseases. As a consequence, many community members believe that when this medicine is used, other health problems that may be present in the body will also be eliminated: \"...for us who use this mwarobain we know that it treats many diseases... so you can use it ...if there is another health problem in the body then it clears as well. Sometimes you may find maybe rashes coming out from the body ...so when you have rashes in the body ...there is another tree that you can use...and that mwarobain you can as well take, boil and bath with...all the rashes will disappear.\" Kapera, male, 60 years Despite their use in managing malaria in the community, the long-term impact of alternative medications on the health of the users is not clear, and might need further exploration. 5.6 Discussion Successful malaria treatment depends largely on early recognition of the disease symptoms and the subsequent treatment through the use of effective anti-malarial medicines. The current study reveals that care seeking is a complex process characterized by multiple layers of actions. The perceived susceptibility to the disease and the meaning people attach to their symptom experiences underlie many of the actions taken. Self-medication with painkillers leftover from the treatment of previous illnesses or bought from drug shops as an initial response to illness was found to be common. Perceptions regarding the mildness of the symptoms and the perceived benefits of using a painkiller to relieve the condition motivated the decision to self-medicate. Individuals decided whether to seek additional help after observing the progress of the illness, and their decisions were motivated by their perceptions of the severity of the condition and of their susceptibility to the disease. The higher awareness on malaria seen in the study could be a possible explanation for the observed consistency in self-care practices among men and women. The current study focused on malaria self-care practices among adults. The results are comparable to those of the studies conducted in other parts of Tanzania [46, 49] and other malaria endemic regions [25, 58, 59] where self-medication was the first response employed to malaria. This practice is unsafe as it may delay effective treatment and prolong the sufferer's illness. The failure to seek prompt and effective treatment within 24 hours of the onset of malaria symptoms can prevent communities from reaching malaria control goals set by the government and global malaria control organizations. 95 Motives for malaria self-careThe correct diagnosis of malaria is indispensable in ensuring that malaria sufferers are treated appropriately. The government, in line with WHO's recommendations [60], advises people who suspect they have malaria to take a malaria test before receiving treatment, in the form of either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test. The results of this study showed, however, that the majority of people wait to take anti-malarial drugs until after they have taken a malaria test to confirm their self-diagnosed condition. The failure of the initial self-medication practices to produce relief, the perceived severity of the symptoms and the perceived degree of susceptibility to the condition motivated the study participants to take a malaria test. A preference for testing before taking anti-malarial drugs has also been reported in other settings [18, 42]. Although a malaria test before the use of anti-malarial drugs is recommended [60], the quality of the malaria test services offered, especially in the private sector, is questionable, and the use of such tests can lead to the over-diagnosis of malaria [61]. The over- diagnosis of malaria has considerable implications for malaria control, as it triggers the unnecessary use of anti-malarial drugs, which can increase the chances of developing drug resistance [62], and can exacerbate the suffering that comes from untreated illnesses. In light of the preference for a malaria test expressed in the study, and of the need to safeguard the efficacy of anti-malarial medicines, as the recent WHO's T3: Test Treat Track initiative for scaling up diagnostic tests indicated, it may prove necessary to implement quality controls and follow-up surveillance of malaria treatments. Despite the shift to ACT in the country's malaria treatment policy, self-medication with monotherapy was found to be common among study participants. The participants expressed a preference for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, sulfamethoxypyrazine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine medicines over the recommended combination treatments/ALu. Individual participants' experiences in managing a similar condition and their perceptions of the benefits and effectiveness of specific brands strengthened their confidence in their self-treatment choice. These perceptions were often reinforced by the ease of using monotherapy, which are administered as single doses. The continued use of monotherapy, despite the recommendation that combination treatments be used, has also been reported in Ghana, where chloroquine, artemether, amodiaquine, quinine, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine are used by the majority of malaria sufferers [59]. The ongoing use of these brands for malaria management might seriously impair malaria control efforts, as anti-malarial monotherapy is known to cause resistance to malaria parasites [27, 62-64]. Thus, their use may contribute to the increased resistance of malaria parasites to effective anti-malarial medicines. Recent reviews [23, 27] have shown that drug shops are the main source of malaria medicines used for self-treatment. The same observation was made in the current study. The cost of 96 Chapter 5medication and services, shortages of medicines, waiting times for receiving services, and the attitudes toward patients displayed by health care workers were cited by participants as motives for accessing drug shops directly. These findings are comparable to results previously reported for the research district [56, 65] and for other settings [66]. Although many people obtain medicines from shops when self-medicating for malaria [28, 30, 31, 49, 56, 67], the quality of those medicines is worrying [48, 68, 69]. The use of ineffective treatments can lead to avoidable morbidities and deaths, and to the continuing spread of disease parasites in the community. To improve the quality of the medications dispensed in drug shops, the ADDO programme was implemented in Tanzania in 2006 [15]. The continuous monitoring of the quality of the medicines sold in drug shops, and of dispensing behaviour in these shops, would be beneficial. The availability and accessibility of more effective anti-malarial drugs such as ACT in drug shops need to be assessed. In addition, community members should be informed of the potential benefits of ACT, and encouraged to use them. The use of local herbs in self-treatment of malaria was reported as a normal practice in this study. The participants indicated that they perceive local herbs, or mwarobaini , as having no negative effects on the user and as being effective in curing multiple conditions. Although the use of local herbs for malaria management is not new in Tanzania [19, 21, 70, 71] or in other parts of SSA [72-74], the motives for the practice appear to be changing. Previous studies have found that many people associate severe malaria with degedege , which may lead them to choose traditional/local medicines [16, 18, 19, 21, 70, 75]. The results of this study indicated that local herbs are perceived as being effective in treating mild conditions. A lack of faith or uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the recommended combination treatments/ALu was among the reasons cited by participants for the use of local herbs. The availability of various anti- malarial drug brands in the market, coupled with frequent policy changes regarding treatments, has led many members of the community to question the efficacy of the recommended treatments. However, it is not clear whether the use of local herbs can lead to a concentration of toxins that could be harmful to the human body. Currently, little is known about the ability of local mwarobaini herbs to treat malaria, or about their safety in humans. This study was conducted in a district with a long history of malaria disease, including communities that have been intensively involved in several malaria control and management interventions [68, 76]. The finding that self-care is practiced widely in this particular setting suggests it is also practiced elsewhere. However, as the study was conducted using a small group of people in a specific setting, the results should be viewed as contextual, and any generalization of the findings should be limited to this kind of setting. Nevertheless, the study's results provide valuable insights into the motives for malaria self-care among adults 97 Motives for malaria self-carein the community. This is important, as it can help to inform policy decisions regarding the planning and implementation of programmes aimed at improving the effective and appropriate management of malaria. 5.7 Conclusion This study has shown that malaria self-care among adults is motivated by people's perceptions and schemas on the disease and the health care options available to them. The actions taken by the study participants reflect the economic inequalities that exist in the community. Though there have been sustained malaria interventions in the region the access to appropriate treatment has been limited. There is a need for public health interventions to take into account community perceptions and cultural schemas on malaria self-care BCC: Behaviour change communication; NMCP: National malaria control program Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

BMC public health, 15(1), 2246 \"In a situation of rescuing life\": meanings given to diabetes symptoms and care-seeking practices among adults in Southeastern Tanzania: a qualitative inquiry*106 Chapter 6Abstract Background: Diabetes mellitus is an emerging public health problem in Tanzania. For the community and the health system to respond adequately to this problem, it is important that we understand the meanings given to its symptoms, and the care-seeking practices of individuals. Methods: To explore collective views on the meanings given to diabetes symptoms, we conducted nine focus group discussions with adult diabetes patients and members of the general community. To gain a better understanding of how the meanings in the community inform the care-seeking practices of individuals, 19 in-depth interviews were conducted with diabetes patients. The data were analyzed using principles of grounded theory and applying cultural schema theory as a deductive framework. Results: In the communities and among the patients, knowledge and awareness of diabetes are limited. Both people with diabetes and community members referred to their prevailing cultural meaning systems and schemas for infectious diseases to interpret and assign meaning to the emerging symptoms. Diabetes patients reported that they had initially used anti- malarial medicines because they believed their symptoms - like headache, fever, and tiredness - were suggestive of malaria. Schemas for body image informed the meaning given to diabetes symptoms similar to those of HIV, like severe weight loss. Confusion among members of the community about the diabetes symptoms instigated tension, causing patients to be mistrusted and stigmatized. The process of meaning-giving and the diagnosis of the diabetes symptoms was challenging for both patients and health care professionals. Diabetes patients reported being initially misdiagnosed and treated for other conditions by medical professionals. The inability to assign meaning to the symptoms and determine their etiologies informed the decision made by some patients to consult traditional healers, and to associate their symptoms with witchcraft causes. Conclusion: The meanings given to diabetes symptoms and the care-seeking practices described in the study are shaped by the prevailing cultural schemas for infectious diseases and their treatments. Efforts to educate people about the symptoms of diabetes and to encourage them to seek out appropriate care should build on the prevailing cultural meaning system and schemas for diseases, health and illness. Key words: Diabetes, Cultural meanings, Traditional healers, Witchcraft, rural.107 Meaning given to diabetes symptoms6.1 Background The surge in the number of diabetes mellitus cases has become a major public health concern worldwide. There are currently around 382 million people with diabetes across the globe, and this figure is projected to rise to 592 million by 2035. An estimated 80% of these cases are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1]. For Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 14.7 million diabetes cases were reported in 2011. Thus, around 3.8% [2] of all people with diabetes are currently in this region, and the number of individuals with diabetes in SSA is expected to double by 2030 [3]. As in other countries currently undergoing the epidemiological transition, type 2 is the dominant form of diabetes in the SSA countries [4, 5]. In Tanzania, more than one million people had diagnosed diabetes in 2006 [6] and the diabetes prevalence rate had reached 9.1% by 2012 [7]. However, it has been estimated that 80% of Tanzanians with diabetes are undiagnosed [8], possibly due to low levels of awareness and knowledge of the signs and symptoms of the disease [9-12]. Many people with diabetes likely die undiagnosed, and prematurely since they cannot survive long without treatment [9]. Diabetes is increasing in Tanzania at roughly equal rates among men and women and among urban and rural areas [7]. Currently, however, little is known about how diabetes is perceived by Tanzanians, including about the meanings people ascribe to the emerging symptoms, or the care-seeking practices of individuals with symptoms. The increasing number of diabetes cases is placing additional burdens on the already strained health care systems in the majority of the SSA countries, including in Tanzania [13, 14]. Meanwhile, communities with high diabetes rates are struggling to handle the accompanying social and the psychological challenges. The health care systems in these regions have been far more focused on combatting acute infectious conditions like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDs [15, 16] than on treating chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These health services generally lack the types of medical supplies and laboratory equipment needed to diagnose and detect NCD conditions and their complications, and the levels of awareness of the signs and symptoms of these conditions remains low [9-12]. While dealing with infectious diseases remains a priority, addressing emerging NCDs is equally important. Diabetes is a chronic and potentially life-threatening health condition [17]. When diabetes remains undiagnosed, untreated, or inadequately treated, it can develop into serious and potentially fatal conditions, including kidney failure, heart attack, stroke, ulcers requiring limb amputation, erectile dysfunction, and neuropathy [17]. Diabetes is also associated with increased susceptibility to other communicable [18, 19] and non-communicable diseases [20, 21]. The early detection of diabetes symptoms and the initiation of appropriate treatments can help to prevent or delay such complications. Whether people suffering from diabetes seek 108 Chapter 6prompt and appropriate care depends in part, on how their communities interpret and ascribe meaning to the symptoms. Across the globe, different communities have different traditions for interpreting and assigning meaning to symptoms when people are ill [22, 23], which in turn affect the care- seeking practices of individuals [23]. How disease symptoms are interpreted, defined, and labeled is shaped by each community's cultural meaning system [24-27]. According to D'Andrade [28], a community's cultural meaning system consists of shared cultural schemas, including mental constructs for identifying and responding to new and familiar phenomena [28], such as diseases. These cultural schemas prescribe how people should act in or respond to specific situations [29, 30], including being ill. These schemas are therefore the theoretical structures that facilitate the attribution of meaning to and the characterization of objects and actions. They \"form the reality-defining system of the human and provide information about what states of the world can be and should be pursued\" [28]. The wider community's cultural schemas inform individuals' beliefs, feelings, and perceptions regarding meaning in their lives. The schemas also shape people's actions and experiences, including those related to health and illness, and thus to how they seek care when symptoms appear. In this article, we use the cognitive anthropological perspectives of the cultural meaning system, or the \"cultural schema,\" in investigating the meanings given to the symptoms of diabetes in the communities studied, and how these meanings shape the care-seeking practices of individuals. Few existing studies have examined the meanings people attribute to the symptoms of emerging conditions - in this case, diabetes - and their initial efforts to seek care, especially in rural areas of countries undergoing the epidemiological transition, like Tanzania. The current study contributes to filling this research gap. Our findings can help to explain how the meanings assigned to disease symptoms in the community shape the care-seeking behaviors of individuals. Our results can also be used in shaping strategies for improving public awareness of diabetes symptoms which can encourage those with symptoms to seek prompt and appropriate care and help them to make informed decisions regarding the treatment and control of diabetes. 6.2 Methods 6.2.1 Study area and population This study was conducted at the village of Viwanjasitini and at the diabetes clinic both in the district of Kilombero. This district has a population of 407,880, and is located in the southeastern part of Tanzania, 420 km from Dar es Salaam. 109 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsViwanjasitini is a semi-urban village located 5 km from the diabetes clinic. The village has a total population of 12,823 (6,359 men and 6,464 women) residing in 2,175 households. The majority of the village residents have no more than a primary school education. Small-scale farming (primarily rice and maize) and animal husbandry (primarily pigs and chickens) are the villagers' main economic activities. The results of our pilot study clearly showed that awareness and knowledge of the diabetes signs and symptoms were virtually non-existent in the general community. The diabetes clinic, which is part of designated district referral hospital, is the only clinic in the district that provides diabetes services primarily to people from rural and semi-urban areas. The inclusion of the clinic in the study provided us with an opportunity to recruit diabetes patients from rural areas and examine their care-seeking practices. The district faces a burden of infectious diseases such as Malaria [31, 32] HIV and AIDS [33] and tuberculosis [34]. Whereas for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes the district also faces an increasing prevalence. An ongoing adult observational cohort study has reported that diabetes prevalence among women aged 60+ years in the district is 12% [35]. The current study was conducted concurrently with another study that assessed the care-seeking behaviors of adults with malaria; the results of this second study are presented separately [36]. 6.2.2 Study design and methods To explore collective meanings assigned to diabetes symptoms in the community and by the people with diabetes we conducted nine focus group discussions (FGDs) with 58 adults (21 men and 37 women) between October and November 2012 ( See Table 6.1 ). Of the 58 participants, 32 were people in the community and 26 were people with diabetes. To examine the care-seeking practices and how the meaning-giving system in the community shaped how individuals sought care we conducted 19 in-depth interviews with adults (10 women and 9 men) between February and March 2013. 6.6.3 Participant recruitment The FGDs with people in the community involved individuals who were purposively recruited from the village with the help of village leaders. These individuals were either neighbours or relatives of diabetes patients . Some FGDs also included people living with diabetes who were purposively recruited from the clinic. The recruitment of the participants for the FGDs ended when data saturation was reached. All of the IDIs were conducted with diabetes patients who had been living with the condition for at least six months prior the date of the interview. The IDI participants from the semi-110 Chapter 6urban village were purposively selected from the community with the help of village leaders. We visited households in the community and asked whether anyone in the household had diabetes. To avoid recruiting people of the same social network, different entry points were used. The IDI participants at the diabetes clinic were purposively selected from the clinic attendees with the help of a clinic nurse. The researcher explained the purpose of her presence at the clinic to the patients and people with diabetes from rural areas were identified taking into consideration their age, gender, and years since diagnosis. After verbal consent was given interviews were conducted at a canteen located close to the designated district referral hospital. The recruitment of the IDIs participants ended after data saturation was reached. Some participants who came from rural areas were paid a small amount to help cover their transportation costs. 6.2.4 Data collection and analysis The data collection team consisted of the first author and two research assistants. The data collection guides were piloted by the team, and the pilot results were used to refine the final guides employed in the study and to determine the FGD recruitment criteria. The actual data collection took place in two separate rounds. The team first conducted the FGDs. The results from the FGDs were used to improve the interview guides. The first author facilitated all of the discussions. One research assistant was engaged for note-taking in each of the FGDs. All of the FGDs and the IDIs were conducted in Swahili, a language spoken by the majority of people in the study communities and also by the first author. These discussions were digitally recorded and verbatim transcriptions were made within 48 hours of the time they were conducted.Table 6.1 Participants information for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews ActivityAge rangeGenderLevel of Education No. of People through the communityNo. of People through the diabetes clinicTotal Male Female FGDs 25 - 80 21 37 0 - form IV 32 26 58 IDIs 25 - 80 9 10 0 - form IV 10 9 19 77111 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsThe transcripts were reviewed and cross-checked for quality by the first author before they were imported to NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia). All of the transcripts were analyzed in their original language. The analysis process had two levels. The first level of analysis involved developing inductive and deductive codes and writing thick descriptions. Both the inductive and the deductive codes were developed by the first author. The codes were shared and discussed among the first three and the last author, and any discrepancies were reconciled among the four authors. The second level of analysis involved categorizing the codes into themes and family codes following principles of grounded theory. This paper presents results from the FGDs on the meanings assigned to diabetes symptoms in the community and the IDI findings on how these meanings shape the individual care-seeking practices of the diabetes patients. While the data provided by the patients' FGDs and IDIs were fairly consistent, in the results section, these findings are not presented separately by method, but are instead used to describe different themes that emerge from the data. 6.2.5 Ethical approval The study was approved by institutional review boards of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, University of Groningen in the Netherlands; the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania; and the National Tanzanian Medical Research Co-coordinating Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR). All participants were thoroughly informed of the study and then verbal consent was taken before the beginning of the IDI and FGDs. Specific to the low-literacy setting verbal consent was the most suitable form of consent taking. To ensure anonymity of the study participants, all of their potential identifiers were removed from the data, and only their opinions are presented. 6.3 Results Five themes emerged from the data: (1) knowledge and awareness of diabetes signs and symptoms, (2) meanings given to diabetes symptoms, (3) the use of anti-malarial medicines (4) seeking diagnosis and treatment from health facilities, and (5) relatives' advices and traditional healers' consultations. 6.3.1 Knowledge and awareness of diabetes signs and symptoms Several symptoms of diabetes were mentioned in the study ( see Table 6.2). In the group discussions with people from the community, addressing this issue sometimes required considerable probing. The diabetes patients reported having experienced one or several symptoms before they were diagnosed with the condition. However, none of these patients said they had initially understood that the symptoms they were experiencing were indicative 112 Chapter 6of diabetes. Some of the diabetes symptoms mentioned by the study participants overlap with the general symptoms identified for diabetes by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), [37] while others do not ( see Table 6.2 ). Irrespective of their gender and place of residence, the study participants generally described diabetes as being a new disease in the community, and the majority of the people from the community appeared to lack knowledge and awareness of its signs and symptoms. Most of the participants in the group discussions with people from the community reported having heard about \"Kisukari\" - meaning \"a sugary disease\" - but they could not describe its symptoms. Similar statements were made in the discussions with the diabetes patients. These patients reported that they had not recognized the condition before they were diagnosed. In the in-depth interviews, the patients said that when the symptoms started they did not associate them to diabetes because those symptoms were not familiar to them: \"When it (diabetes) started I failed to define it because its symptoms were new\"i Male patient, 75yrs. 6.3.2 Meanings given to diabetes symptoms Some patients reported attributing some of the diabetes symptoms they experienced - like loss of strength, frequent urination, and excessive thirst - to witchcraft, because they could not assign meaning to the symptoms or explain their etiologies. Since diabetes was a relatively new disease to the community when the individuals started experiencing the condition, they drew upon their knowledge of infectious diseases from the existing cultural models and schemas in seeking to interpret and understand the new symptoms. When the prevailing cultural models for diseases in the community were not able to provide explanations for the symptoms they were experiencing, the patients often attributed their condition to external causes: \"The feelings of being bewitched were completely there. You think ... for sure I have been bewitched, this must be witchcraft, it is not a disease from God. Those thoughts will always be there because first you are amazed that a person can fill a bucket in just a single night, and can drink so much water. I mean one bucket of water is not enough... you may even think you have been attacked by demons because that is not a normal condition\" Female patient, 52yrs. When the community members were interpreting and assigning meaning to the symptoms people with diabetes were experiencing, some attributed the symptoms to different diseases113 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsTable 6.2 Diabetes symptoms as identified by the study participants and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Symptoms identified by study participants Symptoms identified by the IDF Frequent urination especially at night Frequent urination Extreme thirsty Excessive thirst Blurred vision Blurred vision Feeling hungry all the time Increased hunger Extreme tiredness Tiredness Severe loss of body weight Weight loss Loss of memory Lack of interest and concentration Numbness in the toes/feetA tingling sensation or numbness in the hands or feet Falling ill frequently Severe headache Being quick-tempered A dry mouth/throat Reduced body strength Excess sweating Pain all over the body Hallucinations Itching around genital areas High fever Frequent infection Slow-healing wounds Vomiting and stomach pain114 Chapter 6or to economic status. In the group discussions with people from the community, a number of participants said they see diabetes as a disease of rich people, as only the rich can afford to eat \"good food\" and sweet things. Interestingly, during the patient discussions, the participants noted that while diabetes was once seen as being \"a disease of the rich,\" it is starting to affect a majority of community members regardless of their wealth: \"Previously they were calling it a disease of the rich, but nowadays it is a disease of all people\" Male Patient FGDs It was spontaneously reported by participants in the study that diabetes patients are sometimes labeled as being HIV positive by members of the community because diabetes patients like HIV patients, often suffer a severe loss of body weight prior to treatment and are intermittently sick. The diabetes patients reported that people in the general community often doubted they had diabetes, and instead believed they were HIV positive. In elaborating on the meanings assigned to some of the symptoms diabetes patients' experience, and how they are interpreted in the community, one of the participants in the patient group discussions reported having been confronted directly and asked: \"Why is your health so unstable... have you been tested (for HIV)?' Even when you say I have been tested and I am just fine, you still hear: 'You had better get another test at another place because sometimes they can miss it, if the second test shows you are ok, then you can be completely sure'\" Female patient FGDs . The interpretations of and the meanings given to these symptoms were embedded in the community's cultural meaning system regarding body image, and were specifically affected by the cultural value that a healthy person should look \"fat.\" The community's system of assigning meanings to symptoms of disease appeared to inform the individual patients' schemas and their own self-image: \"...this is not the body I had ... I had heavy weight... so when I found my body weight decreasing day after day ... I thought I had HIV/AIDS... actually many other people thought so as well\" Male patient, 42yrs . The above comment indicates that the patients' interpretations of and the meanings they ascribe to their symptoms are shaped by their wider community's cultural schema for infectious disease symptoms. Labeling people with diabetes as HIV positive creates tension in the community, and can cause them to be mistrusted and stigmatized. A number of the 115 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsdiabetes patients in the study said that being labeled HIV positive undermined the sense of trust between themselves and their family members. In the in-depth interviews, some of the patients reported that they had to undergo multiple HIV tests just to convince their relatives that they did not have AIDS: \"...when I became thinner my mother said I must have been infected [with AIDS]. She told me to go to the hospital and find out; I told her I had taken all the tests, and that the tests showed that I am not infected. She said 'I don't believe you, let us go together.' I had to go with her to the hospital. I was tested and I told them not to give me the results, but to instead give them to her. Another day there were experts walking through the streets testing for HIV/AIDS. I went and had another test and instructed them to give the results to my mother so she would be satisfied. When she got the second set of results she was finally satisfied.\" Female patient, 40yrs In describing the stigma diabetes patients face when they are labeled by the community as being HIV positive, the patients reported that they sometimes found that other people in the community were openly gossiping about and pointing fingers at them: \"They were saying it openly... you find them sitting and saying 'That one is infected she is not well'\" Female patient, 36yrs The high rates of infectious diseases in the community appear to have permeated people's cultural meaning systems, leading them to interpret and label new disease symptoms accordingly. When the prevailing cultural frameworks and disease schemas were no longer useful in helping communities assign meanings to the symptoms observed, there was confusion among both the wider community and the specific individuals who experienced those symptoms. Even in cases in which the existing cultural frameworks were not able to explain the emerging conditions, the prevailing cultural schemas continued to be used, affecting the reactions of the individuals and of the community in general: 6.3.3 Use of anti-malarial medicines Because of the lack of familiarity with diabetes symptoms and the prevailing community schemas regarding body weakness and malaise, the emerging diabetes symptoms were often initially interpreted as being associated with malaria, a common febrile condition in the study area. A majority of the patients who were interviewed in-depth said that when they initially started feeling unwell they used malaria medicines, because they thought their symptoms - e.g., tiredness, fever, and headache - were caused by malaria. They explained 116 Chapter 6that when these anti-malaria treatments did not alleviate their symptoms they sought additional care. This process reflects the cultural dominance of the infectious disease treatment framework in the wider community, which appears to have shaped the individuals' care-seeking strategies: \"I was struggling ...Sometimes I bought malaria medicines from the shop and used them ...When I found they did not help I decided to go to the health facilities... I went to a number of small dispensaries, trying every possible medicine but my condition remained the same... And this was before the sugar was diagnosed... Then I thought maybe I should go directly to the big hospital... So I went there for testing.\" Male patient, 57yrs The above comment indicates that this patient was looking for a cure of the kind that might be expected when using treatments for infectious conditions such as malaria. The expectation that these treatments will provide a cure explains the patient's care-seeking patterns. These practices mirror the existing cultural schema of the wider community regarding recovery from illness and the care-seeking practices associated with curable conditions. This situation might have informed the decisions of the individual patients, who likely were reluctant to assume that their symptoms were indicative of a non-infectious chronic condition. The idea of having a chronic and incurable condition did not seem to fit people's cultural models of health and illness: Some of the diabetes patients indicated that when they failed to properly interpret the symptoms and could not assign meaning to what they were experiencing, they became confused, and thought they probably had a disease that would clear up on its own. These patients reported that they then did nothing, used painkillers like \"Panadol,\" or drank plenty of water: \"I did not have any dose... eeh.. my dose was just water and Panadol because I was confused... I did not know what to do. I thought probably it will end by itself but to my surprise it did not stop and I continued losing weight... So I decided to go to the health facility.\" Female patient, 40yrs 6.3.4 Seeking diagnosis and treatment from health facilities The process of interpreting and assigning meaning to the diabetes symptoms, and then obtaining a diagnosis of the condition, was seen as challenging by the majority of participants in the study. A number of the diabetes patients said they faced problems in getting a diagnosis even after they sought care in modern health care facilities. During the patient group 117 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsdiscussions, the majority of participants reported that when they went to the health facilities they were initially diagnosed and treated for other diseases, like urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sexual transmitted diseases (STDs), because of their frequent urination and itching around the genital area. Other patients said that when they visited the health facilities and explained to the clinician how they felt, a malaria test was ordered; and that when malaria was not detected they were sent home with painkillers only. Several of the patients reported that they were given a number of different tests before the provider finally prescribed a test for diabetes. This apparent tendency among health care workers to misdiagnose delayed the identification of the problem, and complicated the care-seeking responses of the patients and their ability to manage their condition. Figure 6.1 below depicts a case study of the process that one of the diabetes patients who was interviewed in-depth reported going through before she was finally correctly diagnosed.

This implies that among a majority of the health care workers responsible for diagnosing and treating patients, the cultural models of illness and the dominance of infectious diseases in the community shaped their initial interpretations of and the meanings they assigned to diabetes symptoms. 6.3.5 Relatives' advices and traditional healers' consultations Some of the patients who participated in the in-depth interviews reported that when their symptoms persisted due to misdiagnosis, they turned to friends and relatives for assistance in assigning meaning to the symptoms they were experiencing, and for advice on how to treat their condition. Some participants reported being advised to taste their own urine to see if it contained sugar: \"I felt very thirsty, urinated frequently, and was drinking plenty of water. And when I urinated I would see ants following the trail. I did not understand what all this meant. I waited around 10 days and then I decided to go to a health facility to find out. I saw two doctors who worked there. I explained the problem to them and I had a blood test, but they did not diagnose it ...instead they gave me Panadol. I went home and saw one of my relatives. When I explained to him what happened he said ... 'This could be diabetes. If you want to find out take a few drops of your urine and taste for sugar.' I followed his advice and tasted the sugar. I went back to the clinicians and told them that I have discovered I have diabetes. They asked, 'How did you know?' I said, 'I tasted my urine.' Then they referred me to the diabetes doctor... He ordered a test and found out I indeed have diabetes. Since then I have been having diabetes treatments.\" Male patient, 75yrs Some of these patients reported that when their relatives were not able to help them in interpreting or attributing meaning to their symptoms, or in labeling their condition or determining its etiology, their family members advised them to visit local healers for more help. The decision to visit local healers was described as being a situation of rescuing life. A participant in one of the group discussions with people in the community explained the appeal of traditional healers: \"You know what causes all this [going to traditional healers] it is that people get sick and don't get better... They think they have used medicines for malaria, typhoid and 119 Meaning given to diabetes symptomswhatever ... but have seen little improvement. When they become thinner every day and their body continues to weaken then they want to try traditional healing. They think they must be bewitched or something like that. So one goes there [to traditional healers] in a situation of rescuing life.\" People in the community FGDs Different reasons for consulting traditional healers were given in the focus group discussions with diabetes patients. A majority of participants in these discussions said people consult traditional healers in response to the symptoms they are experiencing, especially when they cannot interpret or ascribe meaning to their symptoms, or when health facility visits do not help them in interpreting the symptoms and diagnosing the problem. Others said that a visit to a traditional healer may be initiated when patients do not understand what is happening to their body, particularly when some of their symptoms are terrifying: \"When I contracted diabetes I was very fat. I had a big belly, but it disappeared after only three days. I mean everyone who saw me was surprised, saying, 'It has only three days!' That is why I went to the traditional healer. I was afraid because I had changed a lot; it was a big change for just three days. I thought I was bewitched...\" Diabetes patient, FGDs Although a number of participants reported consulting with traditional healers as a response to the diabetes symptoms they were experiencing, none of the participants claimed that these consultations provided a cure. The diabetes patients reported that when they visited the traditional healers they were diagnosed as being bewitched. Some of these patients said they used various concoctions, but continued to get worse. They then stopped seeing the healers and again sought help from health care facilities: \"Honestly, after using all those medications I did not find relief in any of them... I was surprised... All of them (the healers) said I was bewitched... I used lots of medications, but was surprised that the condition kept getting worse. That is when I thought, No let me just visit the health facility.\" Female patient, 58yrs. 6.4 Discussion This study was conducted in order to provide insights into the meanings assigned to diabetes symptoms in the community, and how these meanings shape the care-seeking practices of individual patients. The results showed that among members of the community, awareness and knowledge of the diabetes signs and symptoms appear to be very limited, and people 120 Chapter 6with diabetes knew little about the disease before they were diagnosed. These findings are in line with those of earlier studies for Tanzania [11] and other SSA countries [38-42]). The failure of individuals to correctly interpret, label, and assign meaning to their diabetes symptoms is indicative of the general lack of knowledge about diabetes in the community, and this has implications for the awareness of diabetes signs and symptoms and the care-seeking responses of patients. The low levels of awareness and knowledge of diabetes signs and its symptoms explain why patients were late in visiting health care facilities [43], and suggest that patients may find it difficult to recognize further risks associated with their condition. As diabetes is relatively new to the community, the prevailing cultural meaning system for acute infectious diseases is used to interpret the symptoms, assign meaning, and label the condition. The study participants reported that diabetes symptoms are commonly misidentified as being those of malaria and HIV. The community's cultural schema for body image - i.e., the assumption that a healthy body should look \"fat\" - appears to have informed this interpretation. The severe loss of body weight is a sign which is interpreted and imbued with meaning. The tendencies to ascribe certain meanings to diabetes symptoms and to interpret them as being those of HIV have also been reported in other African settings [44, 45]. These perceptions can discourage undiagnosed individuals with diabetes from seeking care for fear they will be labeled HIV positive and stigmatized. The threat of social stigma can therefore have negative consequences for public health. Communities need to be informed about diabetes and its symptoms, and educated that a severe loss of body weight can be a sign of diabetes, as well as of HIV/AIDS. The majority of the diabetes patients in the study reported having initially interpreted their symptoms as being indicative of malaria, a reported common illness in the district studied [46-48]. The misinterpretation of diabetes symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis and the inappropriate use of treatments, and can thus increase patients' risks of developing long-term and potentially devastating complications [13, 49]. The study found that both members of the community and health care professionals misinterpreted and misdiagnosed the symptoms of diabetes, as was observed during patient discussions. It led patients to be treated for other conditions. This may be the result of the prevailing cultural schemas for interpreting, diagnosing, and treating infectious illnesses that continue to dominate the health care systems in most of the SSA countries [5]. It also reflects the low levels of awareness of diabetes signs and symptoms among medical professionals and the poor quality of the diagnostic tools used by the majority of health facilities in Tanzania [11]. 121 Meaning given to diabetes symptomsThe majority of health care professionals in Tanzania are insufficiently equipped to diagnose and treat chronic diseases like diabetes, especially when working in rural and remote areas [11, 50] where these conditions were once rare [16]. As chronic and lifelong conditions are becoming more prevalent among both rural and urban populations [7], it is important that health care professionals increase their knowledge and awareness of the signs and symptoms of these chronic conditions, and that the diagnostic capacity of health facilities be enhanced. In addition, the provision and delivery of health services in both urban and rural areas should be adapted to account for these emerging conditions. It was the sweetness of their urine that helped patients to self-diagnose their condition, and people referred to diabetes as \"Ki-sukari\", meaning a sweet disease. This is also known from other settings. For example, among Cameroonians, the cultural schemas and meanings attributed to diabetes have led into describing the condition as \"a disease that is sweet\" [51]. This description appears to have informed individuals' responses to the condition and their subsequent care-seeking practices. In Ghana, diabetes, or \"sugar disease,\" is seen as a disease of wealthy people who can afford foods high in fat and sugar [52, 53]. In Zimbabwe [54] and Uganda [44], the cultural explanations for and meanings ascribed to diabetes have often been related to supernatural forces, leading those suffering from the disease to seek care from traditional healers. These observations illustrate how cultural schemas for diseases and the meanings attributed to these conditions in the communities shape how individuals respond to their illness and seek care. The inability of the community's cultural meaning system to help individual patients in the study in interpreting their symptoms and giving meaning to what they were experiencing prompted these patients to attribute their symptoms to witchcraft. This finding is similar to observations made in Zimbabwe [54] and Uganda [44], in which diabetes patients reported they believed they were bewitched when they initially experienced symptoms. Attributing diabetes symptoms to witchcraft may lead patients to delay seeking appropriate care for their condition, and could result in complications. The influence of family members and relatives on the care-seeking practices of patients with acute [55] and chronic [56] conditions has been widely reported. The patients interviewed in this study mentioned seeking care from traditional healers after being advised to do so by their relatives, especially when their family members could not help them in interpreting, labeling, and assigning meaning to their symptoms; and after they experienced no relief from their symptoms despite having visited a health care facility. Some study participants reported that they were motivated to seek out traditional healers because diabetes symptoms are associated 122 Chapter 6with witchcraft. This finding is in line with the results of other studies for SSA which showed that healers are commonly consulted for conditions perceived as having witchcraft or spiritual associations [44, 57]. These perceptions are part of the prevailing cultural schemas that inform the interpretation of illnesses, especially where the existing level of community knowledge cannot assign meanings and labels to the symptoms. In this study, patients reported consulting traditional healers when they could not make sense of the symptoms they were experiencing. As this was a conscious choice, this finding diverges from those of studies which showed that traditional healers were consulted mainly when conventional health services were unavailable or too far away [10, 58]. Our results suggest there is a need to look at the role of traditional healers in interpreting and assigning meaning to diabetes symptoms, and in care-seeking behaviors. Programs that raise awareness in the community and involve traditional healers in encouraging people to visit conventional medical facilities have been shown to be successful in treating infectious conditions like malaria [59, 60]. The care-seeking practices observed in this study reflect the fact that in Tanzania acute infectious diseases such as malaria have been dominant, while chronic diseases have been relatively rare. Our study results indicate that prior to diagnosis the diabetes patients were expecting to receive medication that would ameliorate their symptoms and cure them. This tendency to search for a cure for their symptoms explains the care-seeking patterns observed in the study. Diabetes is a chronic and lifelong condition that cannot be cured, but which can be treated to minimize its effects and prevent potentially devastating complications [17, 61]. Community members need to be informed about the difference between chronic and acute illnesses. This study provides very important findings on the initial responses to the appearance of diabetes symptoms among people living in rural communities. However, as the study was restricted to a particular group of people who were purposively selected, the results can only be generalized to settings with a similar context. Although these findings are specific to the site of the study, it is likely that similar processes exist in other parts of Tanzania. However, the results of this study could be used as a basis for a larger survey which could attempt to confirm them in a broader setting. 6.5 Conclusion This study showed that there is a lack of awareness about diabetes signs and symptoms in the communities investigated. As a consequence, the prevailing cultural schemas for infectious diseases in the community influenced the interpretation of diabetes symptoms by both 123 Meaning given to diabetes symptomspatients and health professionals and shaped the care-seeking practices of individual patients. The misdiagnosis of diabetes led patients to use anti-malarial medications, to consult traditional healers, and to attribute their diabetes symptoms to witchcraft. In educating communities about emerging chronic diseases, building on the prevailing cultural meaning system and schemas for diseases, health, and illness is recommended.

BMC health services research, 15(1), 111.7 \"It is the medicines that keep us alive\": lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuity among adults in Southeastern Tanzania*130 Chapter 7Abstract Background: Diabetes is a chronic condition which requires many patients to use medications for the remainder of their lives. While this regimen is demanding, little research has been done on the experiences individuals have with diabetes medication use and the continuity of use, especially patients from rural areas of Tanzania. This study explores the lived experiences of diabetes medication use and the continuity of use among adult diabetes patients from rural communities with limited access to diabetes medicines. Methods: We conducted 19 in-depth interviews to explore patients' experiences with diabetes medication use and the continuity of use. We employed the 5As of access to care to situate the behavioral practices surrounding diabetes medication use in the study settings. The data analysis followed grounded theory principles, and was conducted with the help of NVivo 9. Results: Study participants expressed positive attitudes toward the use of diabetes medicines, but also concerns about affordability. The patients employed two main strategies for dealing with the cost. The first was to increase their available funds by spending less money on family needs, selling household property, asking family and friends for money, or borrowing cash. They also reported sourcing medicines from pharmacies to save on consultation and laboratory costs. Second, participants reported using less than the recommended dosage or skipping doses, and sharing medicines. The geographic accessibility of diabetes service providers, the availability of medication, and the organization of the diabetes services were also cited as barriers to taking medications and to using them continuously. Conclusions: The strategies employed by the people in this study illustrate their resilience in the face of poverty and failing health care systems. More comprehensive strategies are therefore needed to encourage consistent medication use among people with chronic conditions. These strategies could include the reduction of prices by pharmaceuticals, the strengthening of community risk-pooling mechanisms and sustained health campaigns aimed at patients and the community. Key words: Diabetes, medication use continuity, access, rural areas and Tanzania.131 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuity7.1 Background Diabetes is a global pandemic, and increasingly affects the people of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [1, 2]. The increasing prevalence of diabetes among other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is shaped by the demographic and the epidemiological transition, which is characterized by rapid urbanization [2], the aging of the population, and changes in behavioral and dietary practices associated with economic development [1, 3, 4]. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes. It usually occurs in adults, but is increasingly observed in children and adolescents as well [1]. More than half of all diabetes cases in Africa are in Tanzania, South Africa, Nigeria, and Ethiopia [1]. Tanzania alone had more than 1.7 million people with diabetes in 2013. Type 2 diabetes is associated with overweight, and weight reduction through diet or exercise or in combination with medication can help to control the condition [5]. Many diabetes patients have to take medication for the rest of their lives to improve their insulin uptake and to prevent or delay the development of complications and premature death [1]. For rural areas of SSA, especially of Tanzania, information about the behavioral experiences related to long-term medication use among NCD patients has so far been limited. The main challenge in managing diabetes in SSA is providing accessible care and appropriate medications to patients who need them [6]. The delivery of diabetes services and the resources for managing the condition compete with the need to combat infectious conditions such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria [2, 6-8]. In response to the scarcity of resources and the disease patterns, SSA health systems have focused on providing episodic care for acute symptomatic conditions [9, 10] and services for maternal, infant, and child health [7]. The episodic model of care is not suited to managing NCDs, which involves continuing care [11, 12]. Many people with NCDs, including diabetes, are unable to obtain continuous appropriate care [6, 8, 13] due to problems related to quality and access [3, 6, 8, 14]. Lack of access to continuing diabetes care is associated with poor health outcomes and/or premature death [15]. However, there is a lack of in-depth knowledge about how people with diabetes in SSA manage their prescribed medicines. This information can be used to better plan and tailor interventions for facilitating continuity of care for patients with chronic conditions. In Tanzania, the establishment in 2003 of a network of diabetes clinics markedly improved the access to and provision of diabetes treatments and services. Before the network was created, diabetes services were offered at regional hospitals through outpatient care by general practitioners, and at specialized referral hospitals [16]. Although access to diabetes services has improved, these services are mainly provided at the district, regional, and referral hospitals levels ( see Figure 7.1 ), and are thus primarily available in urban areas. 132 Chapter 7According to a recent national survey, diabetes services were available in 20% of urban and 9% of rural health facilities, but only half of these facilities had the diagnostic capabilities, the drugs, the medical personnel, and the guidelines needed for diagnosis and patient management on the day of the survey [17]. Systematic reviews of diabetes medication use have reported that non-adherence [18-20] is common. This paper explores how access to diabetes services in rural areas shapes individuals' behavior and their experiences regarding medication use and continuity. 7. 2 Access as a concept The concept of access has been defined in different ways [21-23]. This study will use the definition by Peters et al. [23] \"the timely use of service according to the need\" [23]. Access to care becomes one of the major concerns when time is an important factor in the utilization of health services [24]. Penchnasky and Thomas 1981 defined five specific areas, referred to as the 5As of access, to indicate the \"degree of fit between the patient and the health care system\" [22]. The 5As of access to care ( see Table 7.1 ) are among the dimensions which influence the initiation and utilization of health services when and where the services are needed [23, 24].A Services providedLevel of health services delivery Referral and specialized hospital Regional hospital Health center Dispensary level Health postDistrict hospital B Diabetes services are not providedKey: A - - Diabetes services are providedB Figure 7.1 Structure of the Public health service delivery in Tanzania133 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuityTable 7.1 The 5As access to care dimensions Dimensions of access Description AcceptabilityThe relationship between clients' attitudes about the service characteristics AffordabilityThe relationship between the price of the services and the clients' ability to pay AccessibilityThe relationship between the location of the service and the location of the clients taking into account client transportation resources, travel time, distance, and cost AvailabilityThe relationship between the amount and the type of the existing health services and the clients' needs AccommodationThe relationship between the manner in which the services are organized and clients' expectations Source: Penchnasky and Thomas 1981. The literature has shown that the majority of diabetes patients in most resource-poor countries are dying because they cannot access insulin [13, 25, 26]. The availability of diabetes medications [13, 14, 27] and their affordability [2, 25, 28] are the main barriers to medication use and continuity among diabetes patients. Lack of access to these treatments, service disparities between urban and rural areas, high costs, perceptions of symptoms, and satisfaction with the quality of services provided are among the obstacles to diabetes self-care, including to continuity of medication use [15, 29]. Although the access to care dimensions are well-suited to and have been widely used in assessing barriers to health care service utilization in low-income countries [23, 24, 30] and elsewhere [21, 31], in this article we use the dimensions to situate the behavioral practices surrounding diabetes medication use and continuity in a rural setting. Only a few existing studies have looked at the medication use experiences of patients, especially of those with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes. The current study, which aims to fill this gap, is timely because SSA countries, including Tanzania, are experiencing rising burdens of non- communicable conditions. Thus, there is a need to examine continuity in medication use. 134 Chapter 77.3 Methods 7.3.1 Study setting The study was conducted in the village of Viwanjasitini and at the diabetes clinic in the Kilombero district in the Morogoro region of Tanzania. Viwanjasitini, a semi urban village, is one of 102 villages in the Kilombero district. The village had a total of 12,823 inhabitants (6,359 men and 6,464 women). The village was included in the study in order to gain access to people living in the community who were diagnosed with diabetes. The only diabetes clinic in the district, situated on the premises of the designated district referral hospital, is less than five kilometers away from the village. The clinic provides diabetes services to residents of the district and of the neighbouring areas. The clinic does not provide medications, but instructs patients to buy them from the hospital pharmacy. The costs of the medications are covered by the patients themselves or by health insurance, which is generally available to government employees only. The diabetes clinic is staffed by three clinicians (a consultant physician, and two assistant medical officers), a nurse assistant, a nursing officer, and two medical attendants. At the time of the study, more than 497 diabetes patients were registered at the clinic and were scheduled for routine monthly visits for the monitoring of their condition and the refilling of their diabetes medications. The clinic was included in the study in order to gain access to people who were living in remote villages. This study was part of a bigger qualitative study on health care-seeking behavior among patients with diabetes or malaria. In this paper, we present results from the interviews on diabetes, as we are interested in exploring the lived experiences of individuals. 7.3.2 Study design and recruitment of participants A qualitative research design employing in-depth interviews was chosen in order to collect information on personal experiences related to the continuity of diabetes medication use. The interviews were conducted by a team of three social scientists, including the first author and two trained research assistants. The study participants were adults who had been diagnosed with diabetes more than six months prior to the time of the study. The participants from the semi-urban village were purposively selected with the help of the village leaders. The researchers visited household in the village, asking whether anyone in the household had diabetes. To avoid recruiting people of the same social network, different entry points were used. If an individual reported that he or she had a diabetes diagnosis, his or her clinic or medical card was reviewed for confirmation. Participants from the remote villages were selected from among the clinic attendees with the help of a clinic nurse. During a visit to the clinic, the researcher - in consultation with the clinic nurse - purposively identified individuals 135 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuitywho came from rural areas, after the patients were registered and their blood pressure and weight were measured. The participants recruited through the clinic were paid a small amount to reimburse them for their transportation costs. The recruitment of participants at both sites ended after data saturation was reached. 7.3.3 Data collection and analysis Data collection was conducted between February and March 2013. In-depth interviews were conducted in Swahili with 19 adult diabetes patients. Of these patients, nine were male and 10 were female. The in-depth interview guides, which were refined following the analysis of the pilot study, were applied during the interviews. The interviews were 45-60 minutes long. The transcripts were anonymized and cross-checked for quality by the first author before they were imported to NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia). All of the transcripts were analyzed in their original language. The analysis process had two levels. The first level involved developing inductive and deductive codes. The second level involved categorizing the codes into themes and family codes following principles of grounded theory. After linking the emerging concepts and the 5As access to care dimensions, the following themes emerged: (i) perceptions of the chronicity of diabetes and of the acceptability of medications, (ii) affordability, (iii) accessibility, and (iv) availability and accommodation. 7.3.4 Ethical approval The study was approved by institutional review boards of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, University of Groningen in the Netherlands; the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania; and the National Tanzanian Medical Research Co-coordinating Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR). Each participating individual provided a verbal consent to participate. 7.5 Results 7.5.1 Perceptions of the chronicity of diabetes and of the acceptability of medications The participants demonstrated that they understand that diabetes is a chronic disease, with several stating that diabetes is not a curable disease, but a lifelong condition: \"...Diabetes is not a curable disease. Rather, the medicines we are using are just for relief; that is what we were told at the clinic one day.\" Female 03, 58 yearsi136 Chapter 7As they were aware of the chronicity of diabetes, participants expressed despair and hopelessness about regaining their level of health prior to the onset of diabetes: \"...These medications are not a cure... they only reduce the severity of the disease so that one can continue living... being cured from this disease is a dream that will never be realized.\" Female 13, 40 years Most participants nonetheless had positive views of diabetes medications, citing their benefits: \"...I mean when you are taking the medications you don't feel a difference... you feel normal... eeh I mean for those of us with diabetes it is the medicine that keeps us alive ...if you use your medicine as instructed... you will have energy and may perform your activities as usual.. no one will know what you are suffering from...\" Male 04, 52 years In addition to having a positive opinion of diabetes medicines, some participants reported using local herbs, such as Moringa oliferus, aloe vera, lime leaves, and herbal mixtures. Information from relatives/colleagues and/or advertisements from local herbalists on the effectiveness of herbal treatments in managing the condition were cited as motivations for using them. Other participants expressed doubts about the long-term use of the diabetes medications, and some noted that taking the medicines while drunk and/or on an empty stomach can have negative effects. Forgetting to take medicines when the condition is less severe has been shown to contribute to interrupted use. Overall, the study participants acknowledged that taking their diabetes medications continuously is the best way to manage their condition. Among the main reasons participants gave for taking their medications as prescribed was the reduced severity of their symptoms, such as frequent urination, fever, and fatigue. While the participants accepted the medicines and were willing to use them, lack of access remained a barrier to continuous use. 7.5.2 Affordability Several participants said they were unable to afford their consultation, laboratory, and medication costs. On average, diabetes patients reported monthly costs of Tshs 5,000 (USD 3.2) for consultation and laboratory tests, and of Tshs 4,600 - Tsh 52,000 (USD 2.9 - 33.7) for medicines, depending on whether they were using oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin. The minimum monthly wage of a public employee in Tanzania is Tshs 265,000 (USD 171.521). However, based on estimates of monthly expenditures made by researchers 137 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuityworking in the field, the average monthly income per person in the district is Tshs 14,946 (UDS 9.6). Having to rely on erratic sources of income, such as income from subsistence farming, made paying for the medications especially difficult: \"...Most of us are jobless; we depend on farming to earn a living. We use the hand hoe and depend on whether it rains or not. If it rains you are thankful because you can harvest something to sell and get enough money for even a half dose. If it does not rain you get nothing... and there is nothing you can do.\" Female 15, 36 years Under the cost-sharing policy in Tanzania, individuals with chronic diseases like diabetes are exempted from paying for medical treatments at public health facilities. However, because of the poor quality of public services - and because public services are unavailable in most areas of the country - these individuals had to use private health services, and thus had to cover the costs themselves or to go without medications. People who lived in remote villages reported finding the high cost of medications and related services especially challenging. When they needed to refill their prescription, they had to cover not only the consultation and laboratory costs, but also the costs of transport, lodging, and food: \"I need to have enough money for a return transport, accommodation, and food before I can think about going to the clinic - and that doesn't include the money for laboratory tests and medicines... my financial resources are low... I just leave it to God - if I have money I go to get the medicines, and if I don't, I stay home and go without...\" Female 06, 41 years The participants reported using several strategies for getting the money they needed to adhere to their medication regimen. To pay for diabetes services, some participants said they spent less money on family needs, such as sending children to school. In some cases, people had to sell assets, which then pushed them and their families further into poverty: \"...Because ...you need medicines... you have to sell whatever you have in the household to meet medical-related costs ...and in most cases the money you get... buys some medicine ...but only enough for a certain amount of time. Then do you think it will be easy to replace what you sold? ...What will you do after you sell everything? ...With this disease you need enough money to pay for medicine until the day you go to the grave.\" Male 08, 57 years138 Chapter 7To avoid the costs associated with clinical consultation and laboratory tests, some participants reported buying medications directly from pharmacies. To obtain medications from a pharmacy, patients presented their prescription book, which contains the relevant medical and drug histories. A number of participants also reported asking family members for financial support, including husbands, wives, and children; while some reported borrowing cash from friends. In addition, some participants said they decide whether they need to take their medication, or whether they can skip it, based on a self-evaluation of their condition: \"...We are supposed to use these medicines every day, but when I look at the real situation... I wonder where the money for buying enough medicine to use every day would come from. If I feel a little better on a certain day I keep the medicine so that I can use it on another day.\" Male 11, 73 years Participants reported using less than the recommended dosage to delay having to refill a prescription: \"...Medicines are very important for treating this disease...That is why you find people using a half of the dose and saving the rest for the days ahead, because you do not know how it is going to be tomorrow... [Have you experienced that situation?] Yes...sometimes instead of injecting myself twice in a day I inject myself only once... At least when I do this the medicine for a month can last me two months.\" Male10, 75 years Some participants said they went without medications when they could not afford them. Others reported sharing their diabetic medicines with other diabetes patients in the neighbourhood when one of them ran out. This type of sharing appears to reduce the risk that an individual will miss a dose. 7.5.3 Accessibility Inadequate access to diabetes medications and services appears to have negatively affected medication use and the continuity of use among the participants, especially among those living in remote villages. Residents of the district have access to diabetes services at the district diabetes clinic of the district referral hospital ( see Figure 7.1 ), located in Ifakara town. Thus, the participants who were living in remote villages reported having to travel to town to access the services. Lack of a reliable means of transport, long waiting and journey times, 139 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuityand high transport costs affected access to care. To save on transportation and related costs, some participants admitted giving their diabetes book and money to buy medications to people who were going to town. Travel time and costs were reported to double during the rainy season, a period when some people were unable to access care of any kind: \"...During the rains it is very difficult to come to the clinic because our roads are impassable, and cars are unable to reach the village... This is why even I could not come to the clinic last month...\" Male 09, 58 years 7.5.4 Availability and accommodation The availability of diabetes services, including medicines, was cited as another barrier to continuous use. Although lack of money appeared to be the main barrier to accessing these medicines, the participants also mentioned that the medicines were not always available at lower-level health facilities ( see Figure 1 ), and that the supply of medications at the district diabetes clinic was unreliable: \"...The problem comes when you need medicines but you cannot find them... If you are in the village and run out... you cannot get them there...You must come here [town] to collect them...\" Female 07, 54 years \"...For instance, last year diabetes medications disappeared for almost three weeks ...I could not find them anywhere in Ifakara ...and during that time I didn't have a single medicine from the hospital... That it is when you find us in these other places (local healers/herbalists).\" Male 18, 56 years In addition, participants expressed concerns about the structure and organization of diabetes services in the district. For example, participants reported that patients are advised to fast in preparation for fasting glucose measures, and to arrive at the clinic early for the tests. However, after reaching the facility, they often found that their consultation with the diabetes specialist was delayed as doctors made morning rounds in the wards before going to the diabetes clinic. Thus, participants reported having to wait six to eight hours for their consultation and prescription refill before eating. The inconvenience and discomfort associated with having to wait so long while hungry to access the services therefore appear to contribute to interruptions in medication use. 140 Chapter 77.6 Discussion Our goal in this study was to explore lived experiences with diabetes medication use among adults living in rural areas. The participants were found to have positive perceptions of medications based on their efficacy, and to be aware that they need to take these medicines regularly. Thus, access to diabetes medications was shown to be the main barrier to use. The insufficient availability of diabetes medications [13, 14] and their high costs [2, 25] continue to make diabetes management in SSA, and in Tanzania in particular, [6, 32, 33], challenging. In the study area, diabetes medications often were not available, accessible, or affordable; especially for rural residents served by the primary health care facilities. There is a strong need to realign the health care services so that they cater to diabetes patients, as well as to those seeking episodic care. The inclusion of some of the diabetes medicines in the national essential medicine list (NEMLIT) for Tanzania [34] is an indication that the government recognizes that these medicines are needed at primary-level facilities, and would be willing to improve the availability and the accessibility of diabetes medications. However, the inclusion of these medicines in the NEMLIT has so far not translated into improvements in drug supplies in health care facilities. This failure to ensure that facilities have adequate supplies of diabetes medicines forces many patients to access the medicines through the private sector, which imposes very heavy cost burdens on the patients and their families. To improve the availability and the accessibility of the diabetes medicines in the community, the government should take action to ensure the effective implementation of the NEMLIT. Consistent adherence with the prescribed medication regimen is one of the critical factors in glycemic control [15, 28] and the prevention of further clinical symptoms. In this study, participants reported that the high cost of clinical services and medications was the main reason why they sometimes failed to take their medications as prescribed. To delay having to refill their prescriptions, participants admitted they sometimes took a smaller dose than recommended or skipped a dose altogether. A similar pattern of failing to adhere to a medication regimen due to cost has also been observed among hypertension patients in other SSA countries [35, 36]. The lack of adherence with medical recommendations may increase the risk of developing chronic complications [15]. Reductions of medication prices by pharmaceuticals could help to improve diabetes medication use and continuity. In addition, there is a need for ongoing health education campaigns which alert people with chronic, non-communicable conditions to the importance of taking their medications as recommended. 141 Lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuityIn line with observations made in other African settings [37, 38], the study participants reported selling family assets to cover their medication costs. But in order to sell assets, a household has to have saleable property and access to potential buyers. The sale of assets to cover medical bills has been associated with the depletion of a household's physical resources, and thus with an increased risk that the family will fall into poverty [24]. In turn, the consequences of poverty might even be greater for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, who have additional expenses associated with long-term medication use. Ensuring that people have access to the health care services they need, and providing them with protection from financial risks, are steps toward ensuring universal health care coverage [39]. The current community health insurance schemes in Tanzania which aim to reduce direct out-of-pocket payments have so far mainly served people with episodic illnesses [40]. These schemes need to be strengthened to accommodate access to NCD health services, including access to medication. Other strategies based on social protection mechanisms - such as public subsidies for free care of the kind provided to patients with HIV/AIDS - could help to protect people with non-communicable diseases from financial risks, and encourage medication use and continuity of use. Having social support from friends and family was shown to contribute to the resilience of the participants and to the likelihood that they were taking their medications as prescribed. These kinds of support with diabetes management appear to be associated with increased patient self-efficacy, medication regimen adherence, and better health outcomes [41, 42]. It is therefore crucial to involve and educate household members in the management of diabetes care. This study provides very important findings on experiences related to diabetes medication use and continuity of use from the perspectives of people living in rural areas where access to medications is limited. Recruiting study participants from the diabetes clinic allowed us to gain wider perspectives on experiences with continuous medication use from people in different rural areas. Although the study involved a particular group of people, it is likely that similar patterns of continuous medication use experiences exist in other rural parts of Tanzania and elsewhere in SSA, as inadequate availability of diabetes services and out-of- pocket payments are features of many SSA health systems [2, 13, 14]. The study findings can provide useful insights for developing strategies to improve and support access to diabetes care and treatments, to enhance self-management activities, and to encourage appropriate use and continuity of use of medications among patients.142 Chapter 77.7 Conclusion The study found that perceptions of diabetes medications were positive, but that the cost of the medications was a major barrier to their consistent use. Among the strategies the participants reported using to raise money to pay for diabetes medications were spending less money on family needs and selling household assets. A number of participants also reported sourcing their medicines from pharmacies to save on consultation and laboratory costs, asking family and friends for financial support, and borrowing cash. In addition, some participants admitted using less than the recommended dosage or skipping doses, and sharing medicines with other diabetes patients. However, these coping strategies may prove ineffective, and could compromise the health of the patient. More comprehensive strategies are therefore needed to encourage consistent medication use among people with chronic conditions. These strategies could include the reduction of prices by pharmaceuticals, the strengthening of community risk-pooling mechanisms (such as the introduction of a national or a social health insurance program, or of community health funds), and sustained health campaigns aimed at patients and the community.

Illness experiences of diabetes in the context of malaria in settings experiencing double burden of disease in Southeastern Tanzania, and is under revision at an international peer-reviewed journal.Illness experiences of diabetes in the context of malaria in settings experiencing double burden of disease in Southeastern Tanzania*8148 Chapter 8Abstract Background: Tanzania has a double burden of non-communicable and infectious diseases. However, information on illness experiences in the co-existence of these conditions is limited. This study used Kleinmans' explanatory model of illness (EM) to assess the illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria as a predominant condition in a rural setting. Methods: We conducted 17 focus group discussions with adult members of the general community, diabetes patients, neighbours and relatives of diabetes patients to gain insight into shared experiences. To gain in-depth understanding of the individual illness experiences, we conducted 41 in-depth interviews with malaria or diabetes patients and family members of diabetes patients. The analysis followed grounded theory principles and the EM of illness was derived from the emerging themes. Results: The EMs showed that malaria and diabetes are both perceived to be severe and fatal conditions. However, people have learned to live with malaria and the condition is relatively manageable compared with diabetes. In contrast, diabetes was perceived as a relatively new disease with serious life-long consequences. Uncertainty and fear of those consequences and the increased risk for severe malaria and other illnesses impacted diabetes patients and their families' illness experiences. Unpredictable ailments, loss of consciousness, memory, libido, and functional incapability were common problems reported by diabetes patients. These problems had an effect on their psychological and emotional health and limited their social life. Direct and indirect costs of illness pushed individuals and their families further into poverty and were more pronounced for diabetes patients. Conclusion: The EM revealed both malaria and diabetes as distressing illnesses, however, diabetes showed a higher level of stress because of its chronicity. Strategies for supporting social, emotional, and psychological well-being that build on patient explanatory model are likely to improve illness experiences and quality of life for the chronically ill patient. Key words: malaria, diabetes, illness, double burden of diseases, explanatory model149 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria8.1 Introduction Most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are experiencing a double burden of disease with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) emerging alongside the persisting infectious conditions [1]. While malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS continue to threaten the population's health in this region as they have for decades, other conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic obstructive respiratory diseases are emerging to be major disease burdens in the region, as well [2]. For example, in the year 2013, the African region experienced 128 million infections of malaria [3], and the number of people living with diabetes reached 19.8 million in the same year [4]. SSA countries account for 90 per cent of the global deaths due to malaria [3], and 8.6 per cent of all deaths among adults aged 20 - 79 years in the African region are attributed to diabetes [4]. Similar to the rest of Africa, infectious and non-communicable diseases coexist in Tanzania [5, 6]. Tanzania is the third on the list of the African countries with the highest population at risk of malaria after Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo [7]. Recent reports indicated a decline in malaria prevalence from 18 per cent in 2002/08 to 9.2 per cent in 2012 [8]. Indeed, despite a recent decline [9-11] malaria is still a major cause of illness in both children and adults in the country. About 10-12 million Tanzanians experience clinical malaria illnesses yearly, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the annual visits to public health facilities [12, 13]. Estimates suggest around 60,000 - 80,000 malaria deaths occur annually among all age groups in Tanzania's mainland [13]. Although children under five years remain the most susceptible age group to malaria, the recent literature shows that the level of malaria infection is shifting to the older age groups [14, 15] due to the intensification of the malaria control interventions and the population getting older. The observed changes in mosquito biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor biting [16] are also thought to increase adults' susceptibility to the condition. As communities are still struggling with the persisting infectious diseases, diabetes is increasingly emerging, among other NCDs. The prevalence of diabetes in Tanzania has reached 9.1 per cent among adults aged 24 - 65 years and at roughly equal rates between men and women and in urban and rural areas [17]. Diabetes is one of the top ten leading causes of death in hospitals among Tanzanians aged five years and over [18], however, this can be an underestimation of the real contribution of diabetes to mortality rates, since only 1 in 16 deaths among Tanzanians age five years and over takes place in hospital [18]. Population- based surveys reports that most people diagnosed with diabetes were not aware of their illnesses [19, 20]. In this context, therefore, malaria can be understood as an important cause of illness [10, 11] and diabetes as an emerging epidemic [21]; previously termed \"an epidemic in full flight\" [22], it is one of the major contributors to ill-health and premature death [21].150 Chapter 8While malaria and diabetes have different aetiologies, meaning that they manifest differently and require different treatment and management models, it has been shown in other SSA countries that both illnesses occur in the same communities and sometimes co-exist in the same individuals and or households [23-26]. The coexistence of these conditions adds stress to the already stressed individuals, families and the communities in general, in terms of the resource allocations for their management and the increased burden of care to the households and their families. This in itself also increases the emotional, psychological and physiological pain of the sick individuals and their family members. Unlike many of the infectious diseases, NCDs such as diabetes, once manifest clinically, are not curable; rather, the patients have to live with the condition throughout their lifetime. Therefore, there is a need to document the lived illness experiences of NCDs in the context of existing infectious diseases, as these are not well understood. Such knowledge can be useful for practitioners and policy makers concerned with the management of these conditions for an enhanced quality of care of all people. Understanding of the illness experiences requires looking into people's narratives involving the illness - their illness explanatory model. The explanatory model of illness provides emic perspectives on how the patients' illness experiences are shaped by their social and cultural context [27]. Explanatory model (EM) originates from the work of anthropologist Arthur Kleinman [28], who was interested in understanding how chronic illnesses are experienced by the people. In his monograph, \" The illness narratives,\" Kleinman posits that when speaking of illness, we must include the patient's judgments about how to best cope with the distress and with the practical problems it creates in daily living [27]. Kleinman [29] reasoned that health professionals need to understand how their patients conceptualize their illnesses in order to be able to provide effective care [29]. To understand patient illness experiences, Kleinman [29] recommended eight targeted questions as a framework for eliciting patient explanatory model. Those questions included: (i) What do you call your problem? (ii) What do you think has caused your problem? (iii) Why do you think it started when it did? (iv) What do you think your sickness does to you? (v) How severe is your sickness? Will it have a short or long course? (vi) What do you fear most about your sickness? (vii) What are the chief problems your sickness has caused for you? And (viii) What kind of treatment do you think you should receive and what are most important results do you hope to receive from this treatment? Although Kleinman's EM were originally developed for use by clinical and public health practitioners [30], they have been widely used in gaining insights into: chronic disease aetiology [31, 32]; experiences with hypertension self-management [33]; understanding youth violence [34]; lay accounts of depression [35]; and cross-cultural conceptions of schizophrenia [32], to mention a few. In this study, the EM was used to elicit and clarify the illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria as a predominant condition.151 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariaAccording to Kleinman [27], illness is a social experience entailing the dynamic processes of how the patient and his/her family or social network perceive, live with and respond to symptoms and disability [27]. As such, the experience of illness signifies the subjective state of the sufferer in his/her social context. It involves the fluctuations in bodily functioning and how the disease is understood in one's daily life [36]. Whereas disease and illness are often used interchangeably [37], the two are not the same. Disease refers to the malfunctioning or maladaptation of biological and psychophysiological processes in the individual that may result in potential reduction of physical capabilities or of life expectancy [38]; illness, however, denotes the individual, relational and cultural reactions to the disease [39]. Illness is formed by the cultural characteristics that shape perceptions, classifications, descriptions, and evaluation of the upsetting experiences [27], a process that is embedded in the intricate interweaving of family, social and cultural ties. Therefore, the experiences of illness are better viewed from the perspective of illness than the perspective of disease because the latter perspective is not conducive to dealing with such personal, cultural and social aspects [39]. These concepts were applied in the study to elucidate the illness experiences of chronic NCDs in a geographical area dominated by acute infectious conditions. Although illness is an inevitable fact of human life [40], illness experiences are discomforting and can interfere with many facets of life. The experience of illness from an acute infectious condition might not be the same as that of a chronic non-communicable condition, especially considering their differential nature in chronicity. Literature suggests that the illness experiences involving chronic conditions are surrounded by long-term courses, unpredictability of symptoms, disabling effects that are often accompanied by minimally effective treatments, social stigma, and isolation [30, 31]. Unrelenting illness uncertainties [32-34], limited social life [35], increased risk to infections [41] and functional limitations [42], are among the common experiences reported among people with chronic illnesses including diabetes. Insofar as an illness experience reflects a patient's subjective viewpoint, it may thus bear limited relation to the clinical aspects of the disease. Therefore, illness experiences might have considerable implications for how people deal with the conditions, which in turn would impact the illness outcomes and social wellbeing. The consequences of the double burden of diseases to the lives of the patients and their families can be burdensome. Living with a chronic, non-communicable illness is costly since once the disease manifests clinically, its treatments are expensive [43]. Chronic, non- communicable illnesses require management and continuity of care over many years, in contrast to most of the shorter-lived acute and infectious conditions. In low resource settings, households are sometimes forced to make difficult choices between getting medications for a 152 Chapter 8chronically ill person and or getting relief for a household member suffering from an infectious disease [44]. Sometimes, the same choice has to be made for individuals who might be facing the two types of illness conditions simultaneously. This situation increases the burden of care for the families, perpetuates poverty and pushes people further into the vicious circle of poverty and diseases [45]. In reality, the double burden of disease not only challenges the household resources in responding to the conditions but also exposes patients and their families to continuous financial, social and emotional obligations regardless of their financial capability and social wellbeing. Unfortunately, an in-depth understanding of the illness experiences in the context of the double burden of disease in rural settings is limited, but such an understanding is crucial not only for targeted treatment and care, but also for informed decision-making and the designing of interventions for emotional and social support to patients for a better illness outcome. The current study uses the Kleinman's explanatory model of illness to better explain the illness experiences of diabetes in the context of malaria from the participant's own point of view. Studies using the explanatory model of illness experiences in rural settings experiencing a double burden of disease are limited, particularly for SSA and Tanzania. The current study is part of a larger study designed to ascertain health-seeking behaviour among adults for malaria and or diabetes in rural communities of Tanzania. The results of this study will contribute to informing the designing of context-adaptive intervention measures for disease prevention and management; they will also contribute towards the efforts to determine how best to address the personal, social and emotional challenges posed by the emerging NCDs in the context of the infectious diseases as predominant conditions. 8.2 Materials and methods 8.2.1 Study area and population. This study was conducted in Viwanjasitini and Namwawala villages and at the diabetes clinic in Kilombero district. Viwanjasitini and Namwawala villages (total population of 21, 270) were purposively selected for the study based on their proximity to St. Francis referral hospital where the diabetes clinic is situated. This hospital provides various health services, including those for malaria. To allow the study to capture a wider range of the illness experiences on malaria and or diabetes, the study villages had both semi-urban and rural characteristics. The semi-urban village (Viwanjasitini) was located within 5 kms from St. Francis referral hospital, while the rural village (Namwawala) was 43 kms away from the hospital. The main finding of the pilot that we conducted in preparation of this study 153 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariasuggested limited awareness and knowledge about diabetes signs and symptoms and their experiences among the members of the general community. This meant that engaging general community members in focus group discussions on diabetes would not reveal any relevant substantial information about the shared illness experiences on the condition. The diabetes clinic, the only one in the district, was involved in the study to provide access to diabetes patients from the surrounding rural villages who were visiting the clinic for their monthly routine check-ups. Malaria is endemic in Kilombero district [46, 47] and despite the recent recorded decrease [9], it remains a common cause of illness to people of all ages. The prevalence of malaria in the district is 14 per cent [48] higher than the national prevalence rate of 9.2 per cent [8]. The climate of the district is conducive to both high and perennial malaria transmission [47, 49]. Alongside other predominant infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS [50] and Tuberculosis [51], diabetes is of emerging concern in the district [20, 52]. The HIV prevalence rate in the district is 6.5 per cent and that of diabetes is 12 per cent [20]. Information on the true burden of TB in the district is lacking; however, there are reports that TB cases are on the rise in the district [53]. As the epidemiological transition progresses in this setting with chronic NCDs such as diabetes on the rise and alongside the higher prevalence of acute infectious conditions such as malaria, it provided the study with the opportunity to explore the illness experiences of a newly emerging non-communicable condition in an environment dominated by acute infectious conditions. 8.2.2 Study design and methods To explore collective illness experiences we conducted 17 focus group discussions (FGDs) involving 117 adult community members between October and November, 2012. Among the participants, 59 were engaged in 8 FGDs (4 FGDs with men and 4 FGDs with women) that focused on the shared experience of malaria and included people from the general community. The remaining 58 participants were engaged in 9 FGDs (5 FGDs with women and 4 FGDs with men) that focused on the shared illness experiences of diabetes and they included diabetes patients and either neighbours or relatives of diabetes patients. Between February and March 2013, we conducted 41 in-depth interviews (IDIs). These IDIs focused on gaining depth understanding of the individual illness experiences and included 15 IDIs that focused on malaria and 19 IDIs that focused on diabetes. Other IDIs, 7 IDIs, focused on getting insights on the issues raised by diabetes patients and engaged diabetes patient family members. 154 Chapter 88.2.3 Recruitment of the study participants Participants in malaria FGDs from Viwanjasitini and Namwawala villages and on diabetes FGDs from Viwanjasitini village were purposively selected with the help of the village leaders. The malaria FGDs involved general community members and the diabetes FGDs involved neighbours or relatives of diabetes patients. Other FGDs on diabetes involved diabetes patients and these patients were purposively recruited from the diabetes clinic with the help of the clinic nurse. The malaria IDIs were conducted with people who had had a recent malaria experience (14 days prior the interview date -15IDIs) and were purposively recruited with the help of the village leaders in both Viwanjasitini and Namwawala villages. The diabetes IDIs involved diabetes patients with not less than six months' experience since a diagnosis of diabetes. These participants were purposively recruited with the help of the village leaders (9 IDIs with diabetes patients in Viwanjasitini village) and the clinic nurse (10 IDIs with diabetes patients recruited through the diabetes clinic). Since the patient IDIs aimed at gaining insights into the lived illness experiences, a period of fourteen days for malaria and or six months for diabetes was considered enough for participants to have had gained such experiences. Other IDIs (7 IDIs) involved diabetes patient family members who were purposively recruited with the help of the diabetes patients. We visited households in the villages and asked about adult household members' information on malaria and or diabetes illness experiences. We observed the treatments used and records related to the participants' recent fever management to rule out non-malaria fevers. More than half of the 15 IDIs on malaria had a blood slide that confirmed malaria. Sometimes we were referred to people who were believed to have diabetes in other households; we then visited those households and asked the same question. References of this kind facilitated the recruitment process, and were especially helpful given the lack of familiarity with the condition to the general community. To avoid recruiting people of the same social network, and to ensure that the study captured wider perspectives on illness experiences, different entry points were used. Once the individuals confirmed that they had diabetes, their clinic or medical cards were reviewed to confirm their diagnosis. After it was established that malaria and or diabetes were the causes of the illnesses experienced, individuals were given detailed information about the study and asked whether they were willing to participate. The diabetes IDI participants were asked to identify their family members or individuals who were taking care of them. Some of these individuals were purposively recruited to take part in the diabetes family IDIs. After providing consent, the FGDs in the villages (Viwanjasitini and Namwawala) were conducted at convenient places selected by the participants themselves, while the IDIs 155 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariawere conducted at the participants' households. At the diabetes clinic, both IDIs and FGDs were conducted at a canteen near to St. Francis referral hospital. When the FGDs and the IDIs yielded no new information at the level of specific disease and among men and women, data saturation was confirmed and this determined the recruitment of the study participants. 8.2.4 Data collection processes The data collection team consisted of the first author and two research assistants with a social science background at postgraduate level who had had extensive experience in conducting qualitative research. Following the research training, the team piloted the data collection guides. The results from the pilot were used for refining the final guides before their use for data collection in the main study. The data collection took place in two separate rounds. The first round involved FGDs. The results from this round were used to sharpen the IDI topic guides that were used during the second round of data collection. The first author facilitated all the FGDs and the IDIs. In each of the FGDs, one of the assistants took notes. The group discussions lasted between one hour to one hour and a half while the in-depth interviews lasted between forty five minutes to one hour. All FGDs and IDIs were conducted in Swahili, a common language in the study setting and to the research team. The discussions and the interviews were digitally recorded with participants' consent and transcribed verbatim within 48 hours of the time they were conducted. Only the research team had access to the information provided. All of the personal identifiers were removed from the data. The transcripts were reviewed and cross-checked for accuracy by replaying the audio files while reading the transcripts by the first author before importing the transcripts into NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Australia) a program that was used to facilitate the analysis. All the transcripts were analysed in their original language and only the quotations are translated into English. The analysis process had two levels. The first level of analysis involved developing inductive and deductive codes. Both the inductive and deductive codes were developed by the first author. These codes were shared and discussed among the first three and the last author. Discrepancies were minimal and were reconciled through discussions prior to the finalization of the codes, and to the coding of the data. After consensus on the codes was reached, the first author coded the data and the coding was reviewed several times by the second and the last authors. The data coding continued until no new codes emerged. The second level of analysis involved categorizing the codes into themes and family codes following principles of grounded theory. This process continued until no new themes or categories emerged. The validity and usefulness of the themes and the family codes were regularly assessed by the second and the last author to ensure consistency 156 Chapter 8and coherency. This process was followed by the writing of the descriptive reports. The explanatory model of illness was derived from the emerging themes. 8.2.5 Ethical approval The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, University of Groningen (RUG) in the Netherlands; the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania (IHI/IRB/No. 19-2012); and the National Tanzanian Medical Research Co-coordinating Committee of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/ HQ/R.8a/Vol.1X/1389). All participants were thoroughly informed about the study and then verbal consent was requested before beginning each of the IDIs and FGDs. Considering the low-literacy setting of the research and to avoid rising tension and discomfort among study participants, verbal consent was the most suitable form of consent-taking. The consent was digitally recorded prior to the initiation of the interviews or discussions. This type of consent- taking was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of IHI and RUG and the national ethics committee of NIMR. To ensure anonymity of the study participants, all of their potential identifiers were removed from the data, and only their opinions are presented. 8.3 Results The study results are presented on some of the emerging themes via the explanatory model of diabetes. Those themes include: (i) illness severity and longevity, (ii) impact of the illness, (iii) psychological and emotional problems (iv) physical health problems, and (v) economic problems ( see table 8.1 ). These themes as linked to the Kleinman's framework of eliciting patient's explanatory model of illness ( see table 8.1 ) were the main themes that shaped illness experiences as embedded in their social and cultural context. The remaining themes - meaning giving to symptoms; causes; onset of the illness; fears about the sickness, and treatments and outcomes expected ( see table 8.1 ), have been published in other articles [52, 54]. 8.3.1 Illness severity and longevity Participants in both FGDs and IDIs expressed contrasting opinions regarding the severity and longevity of the conditions. Malaria was reported as a serious illness but acute and relatively shorter in duration. Conversely, diabetes was perceived as an emerging, life- threatening illness of great length and severity: \"...this disease ...is not like any other disease we know ...it is a life-threatening disease, ...once you have \"kisukari\" that is all... you have to live with it throughout your life until when God wishes... there is nothing you can do to cure it...\" PIDI5Di 157 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariaTable 8.1 Kleinman's framework of eliciting patient illness explanatory model and the emerging themes in the study s/n Kleinman's framework/questions Emerging themes in the study 1 What do you call your problem?

Participants were of the opinion that it is easy for a patient to forget the sufferings from an ailment like malaria due to its shorter duration, but that was not the case for a severe, long-lasting condition like diabetes. Diabetes patients indicated that the obligation to take diabetes medication daily was a constant reminder of the severity and the longevity of the illness in their lives. 8.3.2 The impact of the illness The research setting has a long history of malaria and had benefited from more than 50 years of intensive malaria prevention and control activities on the part of the Ifakara Health Institute alongside the efforts of several other malaria control stakeholders in the area. The 158 Chapter 8study findings suggested that this knowledge on malaria prevention and control has led to greater understanding of the disease, which in turn shaped the illness experiences and was reflected in the patients' health-seeking behaviour. Participants cited malaria as a fatal disease but one which could be successfully treated in a short period of time and in most cases people opted for self-medication and treatment, with consultations only made to medical professions when the disease symptoms worsened. Some participants reasoned that because of its prevalence, the condition had become a normal phenomenon: \"...here in our place, we are living with it [malaria]... it is not that we hear of people suffering from malaria somewhere. No... we know it ourselves because we get sick from malaria so often that now it becomes a normal thing\" FGDFM11 In general, the explanatory model of malaria suggests that people have learned to live with the condition and its impact is relatively bearable compared to diabetes. Diabetes, on the other hand, was indicated to cause serious life-long consequences to the patients and their families. The explanatory model of diabetes was shaped by psychological, emotional, physical health and economic problems as consequences attributed to the condition. 8.3.3 Psychological and emotional problems The explanatory model of diabetes illustrated that the illness had contributed to psychological and emotional problems in patients' daily life. In their accounts, diabetes patients reported that the illness had interfered with the ability to live well by putting them into a perpetual state of tension and uncertainty about their current and future life. This state of mind was often reported to escalate into anxiety among patients family members that the patient might die at any time: \"...normally she [her daughter] doesn't say anything to me but when she looks at me ...I just see she is very nervous... her eyes are full of fears and I know she is worried that I might die at any time...she knows that with this diabetes \"kisukari\" life is not certain...\" PIDI4D The psychological consequences that diabetes patients and their families experienced were characterized by persisting depression, stress and tension. It was a common concern in the study that the disease made most of the patients' lives miserable due to uncertainties surrounding their condition, and this misery extended to the family members and caregivers as well: 159 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria\"when you have a diabetes patient at home there is no happiness at all, you are stressed all the time... when you see the patient being a little more quiet than usual you start being sceptical/ uncertain ... I don't know, perhaps s/he is not feeling well, or I don't know what ... I mean the way the patient is unhappy it is even more so for the family members because they know with this patient if we just do some little thing wrong ...anything can happen...\" FGDFD5 In elucidating the depressive situation and the worries that diabetes exerted upon the family, one of the family members said: \"...although it is not only diabetes that is a life-threatening disease...diabetes is more shocking... you find the family is always stressed... To the extent that a person dares to think that our fellow here [patient] ...might die any day ...we will not have him any longer... it really brings worries and grief, especially considering it is someone who is very dependable in the family\" FMIDI6 The worries and grief of living with a patient ill from a chronic, lifelong disease such as diabetes can have potential psychological consequences for the family members. As one participant whose husband had diabetes and high blood pressure poignantly articulated: \"I feel very sad really... I find it is as if this family is only me and my six children... his condition is undetermined ... it is very much like being half-dead ... as I am here... deep in my heart I know I am not with him anymore, as anything can happen at any time...\" FMIDI7 It can also have negative effects with respect to the broader community, such as changing the individual/family identity and devaluing the patient by labelling him/her a useless member of the community; but these issues were not explored in the current study. Some of the diabetes patients on insulin expressed concerns about what might happen to them with the recurring fainting they experience, especially if they have no one there to help. These patients reported to regain their consciousness state after being fed sugar syrup by their family members: 160 Chapter 8\"this issue of fainting is a little frustrating... I mean it is difficult to understand and describe but it has happened to me several times ...these days I am getting worried as to where the disease is taking me... and what if she [wife] is not around?\" PTIDI10D Emotional problem is another characteristic that shaped patient explanatory model of diabetes. The emotional problems were indicated as a consequence of the patients' failure to provide for themselves and the dependency to their families and relatives. This situation made some of the patients regard themselves as becoming a burden to their families: \"... sometimes I feel sad, asking help from others. I am always asking help from my husband and daughter, and even though they don't seem to mind helping me, I feel dejected. I feel like am becoming a burden on them...\" PTIDI7D The majority of the diabetes patients reported becoming too emotional and getting quick tempered as a new experience since the diagnosis, exhibiting something unfamiliar to their pre- diabetes personality. To lessen conflict possibilities within their families, some of the participants reported informing their family members explicitly about their personality change: \"I told everyone in the family about my condition...They need to take me as I am, I get angry faster now and sometimes I fail to control myself ...I am thankful to God that they understood and are tolerating my condition...\" PTIDI3D 8.3.4 Physical health problems The accounts of diabetes suggested that diabetes weakens patients' systems and makes them more susceptible to malaria episodes and to other illnesses. Some participants in this study had diabetes and other chronic conditions like blood pressure, heart problems and strokes. In both FGDs and IDIs, participants claimed that diabetes made most of the patients get ill frequently and in most cases their illness conditions became seriously severe. Some diabetes patients mentioned frequent and severe malaria attacks: \"...I get malaria frequently...and because of this sugar, the malaria becomes so severe - maybe because my body is already weak...\" PTIDI2D Another of the family members said: \"This whole month he [the diabetes patient] has been in the house, just sleeping ...he was complaining of pains all over the body, dizziness, numbness and burning legs and 161 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariaarms ... he could not get outside, everything was inside: I had to put a tin for him to urinate there... I mean it is a problem because he gets sick pretty often... it has been like every disease is his now ...\" FMIDI4 Female diabetes patients voiced their concerns on the frequency of yeast infections they experience: \"...Frequently I get yeast infections and that thing itches a lot...\" PTIDI3D The risk of frequent bouts of malaria and other diseases as a physical health problem exacerbated by diabetes can negatively impact not only the patients' health but also the social and the psychological wellbeing of their family members. While elaborating on the chief problems the illness has caused, most diabetes patients reported that diabetes made their health condition unpredictable and challenging most of the time. Many of these patients claimed that \"the condition of the diabetes patient's health could change at any time\" -having good and bad days were thus common experiences with diabetes. Good days were those where patients experienced fewer symptoms, and bad ones were those days where patients experienced more health problems and became weak/sick. Diabetes patients complained about this unpredictability of their condition as preventing them from being able to plan in advance and organize their days: \"...with diabetes you cannot know how it is going to be to plan your day... because sometimes you feel better and can work well but other times you become unable even to help yourself\" PTIDI1D The unpredictability of the diabetes patient's health condition was indicated to contribute to their failure to make joint activity plans with their family members. This was also shown to contribute to some community members' doubts about diabetes patients' physical health problems, as most of the time these patients did not have any observable symptoms. Other patients complained that diabetes triggered the abrupt loss of memory and or poor concentration: \"It happens that you sometimes forget even what you are doing... You may be talking to someone but after few hours you don't even remember having met ...\" PTIDI16D162 Chapter 8Some diabetes patients reported decreased sexual desire/libido as a physical health problem they experience with diabetes. Some male patients affirmed to have experienced erection problems shortly after they were diagnosed with diabetes. \"When this disease started, it was a little better ... but then it did not take time... it became completely impossible... whatever I do, that thing [penis] fails... it does not come up [erect]... I mean, I cannot do anything [perform sex]...\" PTIDI18D Complaints of dryness and lack of interest in sex were expressed by female diabetes patients. These patients were of the opinion that with their diabetes health problem, staying married required them to have a husband with a great heart: \"With diabetes your husband needs to have a great heart... he has to understand ... in marriage... you cannot perform..., you fail completely to satisfy him... I mean you don't feel it...actually it becomes very dry and you hate doing that thing [perform sex]... if the person does not understand, he may divorce you...\" PTIDI3D The effect of diabetes on patients' sexual desire/ libido can thus contribute to potential family problems such as separation or divorce and frequent misunderstandings and arguments; however, this would clearly need further exploration. 8.3.5 Economic problems All participants reported that illnesses either of malaria or diabetes caused economic problems to the patients and their family, but these issues were more pronounced for diabetes because of the recurrent costs involved. The cost of treating a single malaria episode for an adult in the study district using the recommended anti-malaria medicines could be Tsh. 1500/= (USD 0.96), while a monthly medication for diabetes patients could range from Tsh. 4600 to Tsh. 52000 (USD 2.9 - 33.7), depending on whether one uses oral hypoglycaemic medication or insulin, respectively. The continuity of care required for diabetes and the related costs were often reported to have exhausted not only the patients' savings but also that of their families. Most of the patients claimed that diabetes contributed to their loss of income, as it prevented them from engaging in income-generating activities. They emphasized that the failure to earn an income was not only a problem in managing their daily life and affording their medications, but it also made them completely dependent on their family members: 163 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria\"Before I got this disease I was earning an income... I was working as a driver... but ... since I got this disease that was the end of me... I became completely dependent and my life has been horrible... getting food here is a big problem ... I have to wait for the children to provide... my main job has been just sitting at home... I cannot do anything...this is real a problem...\" PTIDI10D The accounts on diabetes suggested that because of the condition, some of the diabetes patients family members refrained from engaging in income-generating activities in order to be available to take care of them. They then indicated that this worsened the family economic situation. Such circumstances were especially severe for the families who started off poor even before they had a diabetes patient. \"... when I was very sick my wife had to stop her business to take care of me...and because of the real situation she used the capital to pay for the bills... since then she has never been able to go back ... That is why I say this Kisukari has brought poverty upon us and there is no hope that this situation will change...\" PTIDI119D Most of the family members complained that they had frequently reallocated their family income to meet the requirements of the diabetes patient and the related expenditures. This situation reportedly frustrated the family's economy and their plan for development activities: \"Honestly, you get to a point where you completely fail to invest in other things,... simply because of the need to take care of this patient... sometimes you plan that you will do this and that for your own development but unluckily, you suddenly find her condition is not good ...then you become forced to stop your other plans and take care of her because you cannot leave the patient just like that... as a result, you find that ultimately all the money is going towards her care...\" FMIDI2 Some of the diabetes patients in both FGDs and IDIs asserted that, because of their loss of income, in most cases, their families were forced to sacrifice other household necessities such as of house renovation, sending children to school, and buying clothes to be able to take care of their illness. Female diabetes patients reported that diabetes affected their functional capability, making it difficult to perform not only income generating activities but also their household responsibilities: 164 Chapter 8\"Sometimes even washing and cooking at home happens to be difficult. I feel ill and weak all the time and my body is weaker. So I just lie down a lot waiting for my daughter to help me with all that...\" PTIDI13D These concerns were reflected in the discussions with the diabetes patients' family members, who saw diabetes as a strange illness that could cause functional incapability: \"...she is not able to do anything tough ...I mean she's turned into someone we have to look after like a child... you have to find food and cook for her... only on rare occasions can she cook for herself but you need also to make sure everything is closer to her... Honestly, this is a very strange/bad illness... it can make a person completely disabled\" FMIDI2 The prolonged illness and the increased functional incapability caused by diabetes put pressure on other family members, who, in addition to performing their routine activities, also had to unceasingly assume the responsibilities of the sick individuals. The study revealed that patients are not passive agents; rather, their illness experiences shape the way they perceive themselves, evaluate and interpret symptoms, and respond to them. Diabetes patients indicated modifying their pre-existing behaviour - thereby shaping what we have termed their 'illness behaviour' as outlined in the following section - to accommodate social expectations, their own expectations and their current health status. 8.3.6 Illness behaviour In both FGDs and IDIs, participants reported that diabetes made patients monitor their bodies, which is essentially specific illness behaviour. Diabetes patients in the study reported modifying their eating habits by becoming conscious not only of what to eat and drink; but also of the amount and the combination. Some of these patients claimed to have experienced difficulties in refraining from eating their traditional diet - which they referred to as \"good food\". Despite that, they were obliged to obey the recommended modified diet. For example, most of the patients claimed to consistently avoid eating sugary foods so as to limit the rise of their blood sugar levels: \"...the main challenge I see is getting used to the food ...myself, I have diabetes and BP. I was advised to stop salted and sugary foods ...so you can imagine this is something that I had never thought about... but I had no choice ... at first it was really difficult; I could not manage it and as a consequence I was always sick ... the 165 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariasugar was very unstable and the BP was rising all the time...\" PTIDI5D Some diabetes patients reported challenges with their household budgeting because they not only had to budget for the family food but also for the costly recommended diet suitable to diabetes patients: \"The fact that we have to differentiate my food from that of the rest of the family is already a challenge on our budget on food. It does not only mean cooking of two pots but also the type of food that I am recommended to use is not easily accessible and again it is very expensive compared to that of the rest...\" PTIDI2D The above excerpt indicates that meeting the recommended modified diet for diabetes patients not only challenged the families' ability to acquire the foods but also to prepare them. This suggests that the family members responsible for preparing the meals needed to allocate more time to manage the cooking for the family and also accommodate the patient's needs. Limited social life was indicated in the study as a common experience among diabetes patients. Most of these patients reported being unable to engage actively in social gatherings and parties due to their restricted diet, fatigue, and the frequency of having to urinate. This practice may contribute to group isolation for diabetes patients in the community. Despite malaria being highly prevalent in the community and actually affecting people possibly more than any other disease, participants reported malaria as causing them less restriction, shame and stigma problems. This could partly be explained by the wider knowledge and the experiences involving malaria that people have acquired over time - they have learned to live with the condition. The association of malaria to external causal agents - \"mosquitoes\" - might also have made the condition more socially acceptable. 8.4 Discussion This qualitative study provides important insights into illness experiences in the context of the double burden of diseases. Malaria and diabetes were perceived as distressing diseases in this research setting, similar to other SSA countries experiencing the double burden of diseases [21, 45]. As both of these conditions are present in the country, it is not surprising to find them co-existing in a single patient. The accounts of diabetes voiced concerns regarding the frequency and severity of malaria episodes diabetes patients' experience. The likelihood of diabetes patients being susceptible to severe malaria infections has also been reported elsewhere [23, 24].166 Chapter 8Although malaria and diabetes are treated and managed differently, the illness experiences of the diabetes patients suffering from malaria have been reported as particularly challenging [23]. Quinine treatments - one of the most efficacious anti-malaria treatments - are known to induce a release of insulin in the body, leading to hypoglycaemia [55]. As a consequence, the use of quinine in treating malaria on insulin-dependent diabetes patients is highly risky [56]. It has been shown that the effects of the falciparum malaria parasites and that of the antimalarial quinine on glucose homeostasis complicates the treatment processes in patients with co-existing conditions of diabetes and malaria [23, 57]. The chronicity and severity of the diabetes patient's condition dramatically impacts the family members and the frustration they experience, for living and caring for the patient can be as debilitating as the illness itself. This finding suggests that health practitioners need to counsel diabetes patients and their family members about the consequences of malaria - namely that it can be more severe for diabetes patients than for non-diabetes patients. In contrast to malaria, the accounts of diabetes were associated with the patients' increased risk to other illnesses, both infectious diseases and NCDs. The association of diabetes and the increased risk of contracting infectious diseases such as pneumonia [58], bacteraemia [59, 60], tuberculosis [61] and non-communicable conditions like cardiovascular disease [62] and renal disease [63] is well documented. Recent literature, including systematic reviews and meta- analysis, reported diabetes doubles or triples the risk of patient's developing active tuberculosis [61, 64-66]. In other parts of Tanzania, diabetes has been reported to be a risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis [67] and a stronger predictor of mortality during tuberculosis treatments [68]. The patients' increased risk of contracting other illnesses could mean more suffering for the patient's family in terms of the costs involved, social and the psychological pains of consistently caring for the sick. Medical professionals need to inform diabetes patients and their family members about the patients' high risk level with respect to other illnesses. Our findings suggest that preventing diabetes and its complications will save patients and their families a lot of stress [69]. However, because the development of diabetes is insidious, strategies for its effective prevention should reach into community life well before the individuals in the community realize they are ill or even vulnerable to diabetes. This also goes for all NCDs, and would require not only economic resources but political backing. The explanatory model of diabetes ranged from the unpredictability of the patients' health to uncertainty about the patients' day to day life because of not knowing what the following day would bring. Unpredictable health and uncertainty about the future has been described as a defining feature of people with chronic illnesses [33, 34, 70]. In this study, diabetes patients indicated a failure to plan in advance and organize their days due to the unpredictability of 167 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariatheir health condition. Aujoula and colleagues [32] similarly reported that the majority of the people with cancer, asthma and diabetes experienced difficulties in planning for both short- and long-term projects because of their uncertainty regarding the future course of their illness. Life uncertainty due to unpredictable health problems can lead to a loss of hope for the patients' survival, which consequently impacts the patients' health outcomes as well as his/her family's efforts against the illness. Medical practitioners could elicit discussion about the uncertainties associated with their patients' condition and help them to identify coping strategies, thus contributing to the improvement of their emotional, social and psychological well-being. The explanatory model of diabetes revealed patients' decreased sexual desire accompanied by performance problems. Sexual dysfunction and its related psychological effects have been reported as health problems to pay attention to when aiming at improving the psychological well-being and the quality of life of diabetes patients [71]. Erectile health problems have been negatively associated with a range of psychological issues [71] such as severe depression, increased anxiety and poor self-esteem [72]. Sexual dysfunction has been recognized as a serious health problem among diabetes patients but has so far received little attention [72]. Decreased sexual desire among diabetes patients can negatively interfere with personal relations in their families as well as their identity within the community. The findings of this study suggest that establishing patient-centred interventions on psychosexual and relationship counselling among diabetes patients could improve their psychological well-being and health outcomes in general. In the study, diabetes was associated with a more prolonged functional incapability than was the case for malaria. Diabetes patients reported that the inability to function and attend to their responsibilities was triggered by bodily weakness and exhaustion due to their diabetes. Functional incapability has been reported as a common health problem among people suffering from chronic illnesses [73] and diabetes in particular [42]. The experiences of functional incapability in this study made some patients see themselves as a burden on their families. The feelings associated with \"becoming a burden\" can impede patients' agency with respect to their own life, as well as raise negative attitudes or habits of self-deprecation that can be depressing to the caregivers/family members who are trying to be supportive and understanding. There is an urgent need of interventions to delay or prevent the health problems associated with functional incapability among diabetes patients. Participants expressed that illnesses are costly experiences, infringing not only upon the patients' economy but also that of their family, albeit more so for chronically ill patients. 168 Chapter 8Chronic non-communicable diseases like diabetes, once established, limit the productivity of most of the patients and their family members over the remaining time of the patient's life, which puts great strain on the family economy. These economic problems have been reported as being overwhelming [74]. In the current study, the family members' intermittent withdrawal from income-generating activities to take care of the diabetes patient seriously contributed to their family economic problems. The prioritizing of the patients' needs over other household necessities contributed to complicating the family's economic situation. It is important to ensure that people with chronic NCDs such as diabetes are treated properly, despite the costs, to at least be able to remain socially and economically active. Emotional problems related to feelings of helplessness and being reliant on others, as well as quick tempers and a limited social life appeared to shaped diabetes patients' accounts in this study. In contrast to malaria patients, diabetes patients reported a failure to engage in regular social activities due to the frequency of needing to urinate, fatigue, and the restrictions imposed on their diet. These study results are in line with observations made elsewhere on diabetes and other chronic illnesses [35]. The emotional issues of diabetes patients and the related failure to participate in social activities may lead to stigma and social isolation in the community. Social isolation has been reported to contribute negatively to physical and psychological health [75]. Stigma can have negative consequences on different dimensions of the disease like the illness experiences, care-seeking and limited supportive services from within and outside the families. Public health practitioners could consider counselling patients on the emotional and psychological aspects of the disease in order to elicit their concerns and facilitate the development of coping strategies to adjust to their condition. Participants in the study believed that sugary foods contributed to the cause of diabetes and or its related complications. Similar observations were also made in another east African country [76]. The association between excessive sugar intake and the development of chronic conditions such as diabetes is well documented [77]. These study findings can benefit public health professionals in the design of behaviour-change interventions such as nutritional and dietary programmes in the community [78]. Explanatory model is the theoretical representation useful in understanding how illness experiences are embedded in the context of the individuals' lives [29, 79]. The use of the explanatory model facilitated the study to shed light on chronic non-communicable disease experiences in communities dominated by acute infectious conditions. The data gained in this research provide a unique, socio-cultural understanding of diabetes patients' illness experiences and the meanings given to the condition in their day-to-day living with the 169 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malariadisease. These findings provide a better understanding of the decisions that patients make about their illness as well as their behaviour; as such, this research thus illuminates the importance of considering patients' explanatory model of illness experiences in provisions of health services for improved health outcomes. Whereas disease perspectives are better viewed from the health professionals' EM, the subjective experiences of the conditions are better viewed from the patients' EM. Negotiations between these two models would help improve care and contribute to a better understanding between patient and health professionals. The study findings can contribute to informed decision making for public health practitioners, policy makers and those concerned with devising mechanisms for enhancing quality of care and improved well-being of all people. Although most participants in the study, including diabetes patients, had personally experienced several bouts of malaria in their life time, some of the participants had no real- life illness experience with diabetes. However, the inclusion of the non-diabetes participants in the study was critical for a deeper understanding of how the condition is seen and experienced in the community. Conducting this study in a setting with a long history of malaria, a district that had therefore experienced intensive malaria prevention and control interventions, was vital in understanding how the illness experiences of the emerging conditions are framed in the context of familiar diseases like malaria. Although the findings should be generalized with caution, the illnesses experiences detailed in the study are most likely to be similar in other settings because the predominance of malaria and the emergence of diabetes is a shared theme throughout Tanzania as well as the rest of SSA [1, 2, 21]. The study findings can provide us with a dynamic view of the social dimensions of illness and the behaviours that illness precipitates. 8.5 Conclusion and recommendations The EM we elicited in this study revealed that illness is a distressing experience regardless of whether it is malaria or diabetes. However, the accounts on diabetes seemed to portray a more severe picture than that of malaria because of the severity and longevity of the condition after its clinical manifestation. Uncertainties about current and future life and the increased risk of contracting severe malaria and other illnesses impacted diabetes patients' and their families' illness experiences. Unpredictability of health conditions, decreased sexual desire, and functional incapability were physical health problems pronounced more for diabetes than for malaria patients. Feelings of helplessness, quick temper and limited social life were common illness experiences among diabetes patients. Health-care practitioners need to consider the patients' accounts of their illnesses if they are to provide care that is responsive 170 Chapter 8to the patients' needs and help them to cope with their illnesses for improved health outcomes. Strategies building on patients' explanatory model to design interventions to support their social, emotional, and psychological well-being are likely to improve the illness experiences and quality of life for the chronically ill. An assessment of the interlinkage between malaria and diabetes could provide more evidence on how these conditions and their treatments influence each other. Such information could yield useful insights for the public health arena and could contribute to shaping support programmes to lessen the consequences of the disease(s) to the patients and their families.

A narrative review was conducted to provide an inventory of how the country's public policy environment, health system and the community's actions against illness can be used as platforms for addressing the emerging non communicable diseases (NCDs) as a consequence of the epidemiological transition. In addition, primary data was collected to gain emic perspectives from the people themselves about their illness experiences with malaria and diabetes and the meanings they attach to the diseases. A main goal was to understand how people respond to the illnesses in terms of their health-seeking behaviour and the reasons for the practices they employ. In this chapter, a summary of the main research findings is presented, followed by theoretical and methodological reflections. The chapter concludes with a discussion of implications of the study findings and recommendations for health policy and public health and suggestions for community initiatives and future research directions. 9.1 Summary of the main findings 9.1.1 Platforms for response to NCDs in Tanzania (Research question 1) The narrative review on how public policy environment, health systems and community actions against illnesses can be used as platforms for NCD responses revealed that Tanzania had been fighting - already for decades - the burden of infectious diseases such as malaria, TB and AIDS, on top of poor maternal and child health conditions. As presented in chapter four, the long dominance of these conditions and their consequences in the communities explained the focus of the existing platforms on the prevention, management, and control of the conditions. Success has been seen in terms of decreasing morbidity and mortality trends for the most infectious diseases such as malaria [1] and HIV/AIDS [2]; as well as in terms of improvements in maternal and child health [3]. However, these conditions continue to be major causes of suffering in the country and the main focus for disease prevention, treatment and control strategies. Our narrative review gave an overview of the challenges posed by the emerging chronic non- communicable conditions to the government, health system and communities. It was evident in the narrative review that the lack of a national NCD policy in the country has led to fragmented efforts in the prevention and control of the conditions. The review demonstrated the absence of systematically coordinated efforts on NCD prevention and control across different sectors despite the acknowledged multifaceted nature of the NCDs conditions. This 180 Chapter 9narrative review showed inadequate preparedness of the health systems to accommodate the requirements of the emerging NCDs, especially the primary-level health facilities that were characterized by insufficient availability of trained personnel, diagnostic equipment and treatments. The findings of this review suggested that the use of over-the-counter medicines for self- medication and treatment of chronic infectious disease was common and people consulted the health professionals only when the illness symptoms worsened. Our narrative review could not find evidence of the role of self-care, management and medication use and continuity of use with respect to NCDs. There is limited information on community involvement in the prevention and control of NCDs, of community perceptions of NCDs, and of people's health-seeking behaviour. This narrative review identified a need for anchoring research and public health interventions in the policy, health system and community platforms for a holistic response against NCDs. The results of the narrative review helped in the analysis and synthesis of the primary data. The sub-sections below are organized according to the research questions and they represent the sequences of the different chapters in the thesis. 9.1.2 Motives for malaria self-care (Research question 2) This study explored how the underlying cultural motives shape the individual decision- making process in their choice of malaria self-care practices. In chapter five , the theoretical concept of self-care was adopted in addition to the Health Belief Model (HBM) components (see section 2.2.1 - 2.2.7 ) in order to better explain the actions shaping self-care practices. Self-care in the study is defined to include: assessment of symptoms, self-diagnosis, self- treatment (including non-medication treatments and self-medication), self-referral, and consultation with non-medical practitioners and medical professionals as previously described by Segall and Goldstein [4]. In assessing the motives for self-care practices, the study focused on malaria, a common infectious illness in Tanzania [5, 6]. The biomedical knowledge of malaria's signs and symptoms were found to be acculturated into the community's cultural meaning system and schemas about the condition. This cultural meaning system informed the individuals' perceived susceptibility (see section 2.2.1 ) to malaria and triggered their self diagnosis, self-medication and treatment practices. The shared schemas on malaria in the community and the individual experiences of the condition triggered these self-care practices. However, the persistence and the perceived severity of the symptoms prompted individuals to consider other self-care options. 181 General discussion and recommendationsThe cultural schemas on malaria symptoms and the perceived susceptibility to other, non- malaria fevers such as typhoid and or urinary tract infections motivated individuals to self- refer to malaria tests in the private facilities before administering anti-malaria medicine. It was the individuals' perceived benefits ( see section 2.2.4 ) of specific anti-malarials, their perceived self efficacy, and people's preferences for single doses that shaped their choices of anti-malarial monotherapies over \"ALu\", the recommended anti-malaria combination therapy. However, the individuals' assessment of the perceived benefits and perceived barriers associated with accessing services from the public health facilities, as well as the perceptions on the quality of those services, motivated the use of private facilities (such as the drug shops for sourcing anti-malarials and the private laboratory facilities for malaria tests) and their self-care practices in general. 9.1.3 Meaning giving to diabetes symptoms (Research question 3) Considering the acuteness and chronic nature of malaria and diabetes, health-seeking behaviour for diabetes may display a different pattern from that observed with malaria. To explore health-seeking behaviour on diabetes, in chapter six the underlying cultural context that informs the meanings given to the emerging diabetes symptoms and shape the individuals health-seeking behaviour was examined. Knowledge and awareness about the diabetes signs and symptoms was limited among the communities in the study settings. The prevailing cultural meaning system and schemas on infectious diseases such as malaria and HIV and AIDS in the communities were found to inform the meanings given to and the interpretations made on the emerging chronic diabetes symptoms. Schemas on body image informed the meaning given to diabetes symptoms similar to those of HIV/AIDS because of the severe weight loss. The community's cultural meaning system about malaria signs and symptoms (such as headache, fever and tiredness) informed individuals' perceived susceptibility ( see section 2.2.1 ) to malaria and the perceived benefits ( see section 2.2.4 ) of their initial use of anti malarial medicines. Misdiagnosis of diabetes symptoms was found to be common; not only did the patients not recognize the symptoms but the health care professionals also frequently misdiagnosed the condition. Patients reported being misdiagnosed and treated for urinary tract infections and or typhoid before they were actually diagnosed with diabetes. When the cultural meaning system could not aid in assigning meaning to the diabetes symptoms experienced, it informed the individuals' decision to consult traditional healers and or associate the symptoms to witchcraft causes. The use of the prevailing cultural meaning system and schemas on infectious diseases in assigning meaning to the diabetes symptoms contributed to delays in prompt diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate treatments.182 Chapter 99.1.4 Lived experience of medication use and continuity (Research question 4) A further exploration of the health-seeking behaviour for diabetes was conducted in chapter seven, specifically examining diabetes patients' medication use and continuity of use in a setting with limited access to diabetes services. In defining access in this study, the Peters et al.,[7] definition \"the timely use of services according to the need\" was adopted. In explaining the context-shaping diabetes patients' behaviour on medication use and continuity; the HBM components of perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers were combined with Penchacky and Thomas's 5A's of access to care dimensions[8]. As linked to the HBM (see section 2.2) , the perceived severity of diabetes ( see section 2.2.2 ), and the perceived benefits ( see section 2.2.4 ) associated with the use of the diabetes medications shaped diabetes patients' acceptability for using the recommended diabetes medications. However, the perceived barriers ( see section 2.2.5 ) associated with the affordability of the medications limited patients in their medication use and continuity. Geographical accessibility and availability of diabetes services, including the availability of diabetes medicines at the primary level health facilities, were the other perceived barriers that hindered medication use among the diabetes patients, especially those from rural villages. The accommodation of the diabetes services in the district in terms of their organization and provision were additional perceived barriers that contributed to intermittent use of the medications and the general diabetes services. However, due to the individuals' perceived severity of diabetes when not on medications, diabetes patients reported several behavioural practices as coping strategies to perceived barriers to affordability to ensure their use of medications. Those included: spending less on their family needs; selling their farm produce and or other family property; requesting advances; and using less of the required dosage and or dose omission, as well as sharing the medicines amongst themselves. 9.1.5 Illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria (Research question 5) In chapter eight the illness experiences of chronic NCDs such as diabetes in the context of malaria as a predominant condition were explored. In describing the illness experiences, the concept of Cultural Schemas was combined with the Kleinman's patient explanatory model of illness to aid explanation of how the illness experiences are embedded in the social and the cultural context of the individuals. According to Kleinman, patient explanatory model (EM) provides emic perspectives on the patients' understanding of the illness and their experiences as shaped by their social and cultural context [9]. The cultural meaning system and schemas on acute infectious illnesses such as malaria shaped the individuals' perceived severity of malaria and diabetes. These perceptions in turn informed the explanatory model of illness in terms of severity and chronicity of both conditions. However, malaria was indicated as being relatively bearable because of its acuteness and shorter duration compared to diabetes. 183 General discussion and recommendationsDiabetes was shown to have large impact on the individuals' daily life due to its chronic nature and the perceived severity after the clinical manifestations of the condition. Uncertainties about current and future life and the increased risk of severe malaria and other illnesses impacted diabetes patients' and their families' illness experiences. Unpredictable health conditions, decreased sexual desire, and functional incapability were health problems pronounced more for diabetes than for malaria patients. Feelings of helplessness, quick temper and limited social life shaped most of the accounts on diabetes patients' illness experiences. 9.2 Concluding remarks on the main findings The findings of this study show that cultural, individual, and health facility aspects shape health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes. The communities' schema on health and illness are used to inform and shape practices engaged when the need for seeking health service is realized. When looking at malaria beliefs and perceptions as well as at the malaria self-care practices employed, the same codes emerged from Viwanjasitini, the semi-urban village and from Namwawala, the rural village, as well as among men and women. This consistency in malaria self-care in the various study sites could be explained by the higher awareness of this condition and its treatments. Regarding diabetes, the different nature of the participants in semi-urban and rural areas (i.e. involvement of diabetes patients and their neighbours and or people related to diabetes patients from Viwanjasitini, the semi-urban village, and of patients from the rural villages as recruited through the diabetes clinic at Ifakara town) limited the study's ability to gauge differences between the semi-urban versus rural community perspectives on the disease. The reason for this different recruitment strategy was that the pilot revealed that awareness on diabetes was non-existent in the general community and therefore recruiting general community members would not provide any insights on perceptions of the disease and how people would assign meaning to the symptoms. However, the issue of unavailability of the diabetes services and the accompanying economic challenges in accessing these services was evident among all diabetes patients, and was more pronounced among the rural patients, especially women.184 Chapter 99.3 Theoretical and the methodological reflections 9.3.1 Theoretical reflections The study applied the Health Belief Model (HBM) [10] and the concept of Cultural Schemas [11] to guide the line of inquiry on health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes among adults in rural settings of Tanzania. The use of the concept of Cultural Schemas enabled the study to elicit insights into how the cultural meaning system and views about disease and illness in the wider setting shaped the individuals' health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes. According to D'Andrade (1992), the cultural meaning system of the community is formed by the individuals' shared schemas [11]. These schemas motivate individual behaviour and provide direction as to how they should behave when they face familiar and new things [11] including diseases. The schemas about diseases and illness in the broader community informed individuals' perceptions and beliefs about signs and symptoms of the diseases and about the perceptions of the health services and their quality. The HBM was applied in the study in order to facilitate the understanding of individual risk perceptions and decision-making processes. The HBM is one of the most commonly used behaviour change models to explain health-related behaviours [12, 13]. This model was originally developed by the US Public Health Department in the 1950s in an attempt to understand why people did or did not use preventive health services that were provided for free, namely screenings for tuberculosis [14]. The assumptions of the model are that people are more likely to change their behaviour 1) if they believe they are susceptible to a disease, 2) that the disease is severe and 3) that the behaviour change will help to cure or prevent the condition [15]. The HBM consists of the following components: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action and self-efficacy. Being a psychological health behaviour change model, its strength lies in the ability to explain the individual decision-making processes that are involved in adapting health behaviours [12]. Although many studies that have used the HBM used the components of this model as a whole to understand health behaviour change, in this study, the different components of the model are applied separately to assess individual risk perceptions and the decision-making processes. In chapter five and six, risk perceptions are examined through the assessment of the individuals' perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of malaria and diabetes. This assessment provided in-depth information on participants' awareness and knowledge about signs and symptoms of these conditions . In chapters five and seven, the decision-making processes are assessed by eliciting individuals' perceived barriers and perceived benefits for adopting specific health-seeking behaviour on malaria and diabetes. This helped clarify the 185 General discussion and recommendationscontext that informs the individual decisions and shapes the health-seeking actions. In chapter five, six and seven, cues to action are assessed through the inquiry into what information participants had about malaria and diabetes, and the sources thereof, whether internal (symptoms, past experiences) or external (advices from health care worker, friend, relatives, mass media). This allowed insight into the aspects that informed individuals' risk perceptions and prompted their decisions regarding seeking health care and continuing medication. In chapter five, individuals' self-efficacy is assessed through the examination of their own perceptions of their ability for employing specific health care-seeking practices. This elicited insightful information on specific individual aspects that motivated them to seek health care services for malaria and diabetes and to continue medication use. Despite its wide application in public health to investigate health behaviour [12], HBM is criticised for its focus on individuals while ignoring other social and cultural aspects that shape the way people think and act [16, 17]. To accommodate the social and cultural aspects that shape individual behaviour, the concept of Cultural Schemas has been adopted in this study. The application of this concept served as a lens for the HBM components, allowing them to be seen as being culturally embedded, to reflect the realities of the social context. This could not have been achieved if the model were used on its own. The combination of the concept of Cultural Schemas and the HBM components strengthened this study by providing noteworthy insights into the intricate relationship between the cultural meaning systems (macro level) and the individual perceptions (micro level) vis-\u00e0-vis health and illness. 9.3.2 Methodological reflections The theoretical concepts explained above, Cultural Schemas and the HBM, shaped the study's research objectives and questions and informed the conceptual framework ( see section 2.4 ). This framework was critical in shaping the design of the data collection trajectory, namely the decision to conduct focus group discussions (FGDs) first, followed by the in-depth interviews (IDIs). The HBM components that were part of the conceptual framework were operationalized into questions and probes that formed part of the topic guides. These topic guides were used to collect data during the focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The study was divided into two rounds of data collection. The first round involved conducting focus group discussions, the results of which were used to sharpen topic guides that were used during the second round of data collection involving the in-depth interviews. The study participants were purposively recruited with intentions to capture semi-urban and rural perspectives in the district. However, due to the remoteness of the district, in this study 186 Chapter 9the research site as a whole is referred to as rural. The purposive recruitment technique used to recruit study participants provided the opportunity to identify a diverse set of participants that included people with diabetes and or recent malaria patients, general community members, neighbours and or relatives and family members of diabetes patients. The use of FGDs and IDIs to collect data for this study uncovered unique perspectives on health-seeking behaviour and revealed in-depth information on the topic. The data collection trajectory made the study methodologically strong: the plan of first conducting FGDs, followed by a detailed exploration of the issues through IDIs, broadened the richness of the findings by fully utilising the strength of each method. The saturation points that were achieved when no new information was yielded in each specific disease and among men and women during the data collection provided evidence that the number of participants recruited and the data collected was adequate. The conceptual framework guided the research not only in the design and data collection phase, but also in the analysis. The integrated application of the concept of Cultural Schemas and the HBM facilitated in-depth explanations on how the community's cultural meaning system (Cultural Schemas) informed the individuals' perceptions (the HBM components) of malaria and diabetes: the perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and their perceived benefits and the perceived barriers: to adopting particular health-seeking practices. During data analysis, inductive and deductive codes were developed. The code development process involved sharing the emerging codes between the researcher and the three supervisors who were based in Tanzania and in the Netherlands and the process continued until no new codes emerged. After developing codes, the next step was to code the data, followed by code categorization. The coding and categorization of the codes into themes and family codes continued until no new themes or categories emerged. Most of the themes represented new concepts that emerged inductively from the data while the family codes reflected the components of the HBM that informed the data collection topic guides. The new concepts of self-medication and treatment, access to health services, and illness experiences emerged as important aspects that shaped individuals' health-seeking behaviour, beyond their own beliefs and perceptions. These emergent concepts suggested a need for additional theoretical concepts, as these issues could not be explained adequately by the former theoretical concepts. Additional theoretical concepts such as self-care (chapter five) , the 5As of access to care dimensions (chapter seven), and the explanatory model of illness (chapter eight) were adapted to aid interpretation of the emergent concepts.187 General discussion and recommendations9.4 Concluding remarks on theoretical and methodological reflections To my knowledge, this is the first social science study to combine the theoretical concepts of Cultural Schemas and the HBM to assess health-seeking behaviour with respect to malaria and diabetes among adults in rural communities of Tanzania. The use of these theoretical concepts and the conceptual framework that was developed enabled the study to gain in-depth information on how the wider community aspects (macro level) interrelate with the individual aspects (micro level) to shape the observed health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes in the communities. The additional theoretical concepts that were applied broadened the explanations of the individual actions, contexts and experiences beyond their beliefs and perceptions. Methodologically, the use of FGDs and IDIs in studies of health- seeking behaviour is not new. However, the methodological trajectory of combining cognitive behavioural concepts, Cultural Schemas and the HBM, and the theoretically informed data collection guides in health-seeking behaviour studies is new, especially in the context of epidemiological transition and specifically in the setting of rural Tanzania. This trajectory makes a unique methodological contribution to health-seeking behaviour studies. The grounding of the data collection guides and the research methods into theories contributes to increasing the credibility and validity of the study findings. 9.5 Some considerations on the choice of study site The initial plan of this study was to engage adult community members from the general population in the FGDs about diabetes and the related health-seeking behaviour. However, the main finding from the pilot study suggested limited awareness and knowledge about diabetes signs and symptoms among the members of the general community in both the semi-urban and the rural villages. This observation led to changing the type of participants for the diabetes focus group discussions; we therefore had to change the site for participant recruitment, as well. To ensure participants were aware of the condition and for easy follow-up during the discussions, neighbours, diabetes patients and or people related to diabetes patients were recruited for the focus group discussions instead of the general community members. Although this change meant a shift to those who were aware of the condition, it gave strength to the study by getting the intimate opinions and views about the condition from participants who had directly or indirectly experienced the diabetes condition. To capture the rural perspectives on diabetes, the diabetes clinic in Ifakara town was involved as a replacement for the rural village in order to provide access to diabetes patients who were coming to the clinic from the surrounding rural villages for their monthly clinic visits. Findings were reported to represent the perspectives on diabetes based on the views, opinions and experiences of the diabetes patients themselves and their neighbours and /or people related to them and their family members.188 Chapter 9This study was conducted in a district with a long history of malaria infections [18-20] and more than 50 years exposure to intensive malaria prevention and control interventions [20-22], by the Ifakara Health Institute among other malaria control and prevention stakeholders. The district is also experiencing emerging conditions of diabetes, among other NCDs [20, 23]. This setting provided a unique opportunity to see how cultural aspects in such a context shaped disease perceptions and the related health-seeking behaviour, especially with the decreasing malaria trend and the emerging NCDs such as diabetes. While the characteristics of the study settings are unique, the health-seeking behaviour and the illness experiences reported in the study are likely to be relevant to other rural settings in Tanzania and SSA because of the shared strains of malaria and diabetes. Using the findings from this study to develop a survey would be recommended. 9.6 Implications of the findings, recommendations, and future research directions This section is divided into three sub-sections examining how the study findings could make important contributions to inform current efforts towards strengthening health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes and thereby improving the patients' wellbeing in Tanzania. These include health policy implications and recommendations; public health implications and recommendations, and implications for community initiatives and future research directions. 9.6.1 Health policy implications and recommendations Tanzania adopted a new malaria treatment policy in 2006, like most of the SSA countries, to respond to the increasing antimalarial treatment resistance. The new policy is in line with the WHO recommendations on the use of arteminisinin combination therapy (ACT), the efficacious antimalarial medicines, in the management of patients with uncomplicated malaria illnesses. A fixed dose-combination of artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is recommended in Tanzania for treating such uncomplicated malaria cases. However, the findings of this study showed that the recommended anti-malarial treatments are not used because of the perceived fears about side effects from the new treatments and because of the preference for \"single doses\". Future anti-malarial treatment policy changes can consider providing continuous information about the safety of the new treatments in the community and take into account the communities' preferences for dosage durations. Taking people's perspectives into account in the treatment policy changes is more likely to strengthen the uptake of the new treatment recommendations in the community.189 General discussion and recommendationsThe narrative review findings in the study showed that NCD prevention and control efforts in the Tanzania are fragmented due lack of an overarching national NCD policy. The findings of this review demonstrate the multifaceted nature of the NCD risk factors and their social determinants and underline the need for a national policy on NCDs that would acknowledge the multifaceted nature of the NCD conditions and promote a multi-layered approach to their prevention and control. The narrative review results show that most of the NCDs risk factors are modifiable behavioural risk factors (such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and alcohol abuse) and indicated the need for an NCD policy that could provide room for community empowerment and engagement throughout the process of NCD prevention and control. 9.6.2 Public health program implications and recommendations The study findings showed that communities' cultural meaning system and schemas about malaria motivate malaria self-medication and treatment practices with the use of anti malaria monotherapy treatments. The continued use of the anti malaria monotherapy treatments in this study has implications for inappropriate use of anti-malarial medicines that could undermine treatment outcomes by stimulating development of drug resistance and treatment failures, as well as prolonged illnesses. This study finding suggests a need for public health programs on malaria control to consider community schemas vis-\u00e0-vis malaria self-care practices and to continuously emphasize the advantage of taking the recommended treatments. Such efforts are likely to contribute to informed decisions about which antimalarial treatments to use and will encourage the uptake of the recommended treatments in the community to improve patients' health outcomes. The findings of the study showed that awareness and knowledge about diabetes signs and symptoms is limited to the community and that the prevailing cultural schemas on infectious diseases are used to interpret and assign meaning to the emergent diabetes symptoms. This contributed to misdiagnosis of diabetes by the patients themselves and informed them to use anti-malaria medications, to consult traditional healers, and to attribute the emergent symptoms to witchcraft causes, and to HIV and AIDS. Furthermore, health professionals were misdiagnosing the condition, which contributed to a delay in the initiation of appropriate treatments. The findings of the study demonstrated the role of cultural schemas with respect to diseases in the community, insofar as they clearly shape individuals' attitudes and responses, including health-seeking practices. Public health programmes could capitalize on the existing cultural meaning system and schemas on diseases, health, and illness, and empower communities by 1) raising their 190 Chapter 9awareness and knowledge about signs and symptoms of diabetes and the NCDs in general; 2), addressing the associated stigma by explaining how NCDs such as diabetes differ from the infectious conditions like HIV and AIDS in their symptoms, and 3), engaging traditional healers by raising their awareness about diabetes signs and symptoms and seeking their collaboration in referring patients with such conditions to the formal health care facilities. Such programmes could be accompanied by strengthening of the health professionals' knowledge on diabetes signs and symptoms and the integrated and improved availability of the NCD services including those of diabetes at primary level health facilities. This is because the higher awareness of diabetes and the NCDs in general may trigger higher demand of the related health services due to patients' increased use of the primary level health facilities. These efforts could in general encourage prompt and appropriate health-seeking behaviour, enhance the quality of the services patients receive and minimize the delays experienced in diagnosing their conditions and initiating appropriate treatments and care. Additionally, public health programmes could consider implementing intensive health promotion interventions on lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes/NCDs and their related complications. Changing dietary practices was encountered as a belief among participants in this study, as a way to delay and /or avoid complications from diabetes. Public health programmes could build on this existing knowledge by promoting healthy food patterns in the community with the aim of enhancing the adoption of preventive measures against diabetes/NCDs. The inclusion of some diabetes medicines in the national essential medicine list (NEMLIT) (chapter seven ) [24] suggests the governments' intention to improve general access to these medications in the primary level health facilities, specifically for the rural populations. Notwithstanding this implication, in this study it was found that diabetes medicines and the services in general are [still] not available in the rural areas. This study finding underlines the need of the government to improve availability of these medicines in the rural areas by taking actions to ensure effective implementation of NEMLIT. The findings of this study showed that the affordability of the diabetes medications is the main challenge to diabetes patients' medication use. Several behaviour strategies (such as dose omissions, using less of the required doses, sharing medicines among patients, borrowing cash and using up family assets) are employed as coping mechanisms by diabetes patients to ensure the continuity of medicine use. These practices can be detrimental not only to the patients' social and economic welfare but also to their health. This study finding suggests a need for ongoing public health education programmes to empower people with diabetes to 191 General discussion and recommendationsmake informed decisions on the use of their medication by elaborating on why patients need to take their medication: as per the medical professional recommendations, in order to prevent and /or avoid the associated complications. Efforts could be devoted to strenghtening community risk pooling mechanisms such as community health insurance schemes and or public health subsidies for free care for patients with NCDs. This could contribute to reducing patients' out-of-pocket payments to access their medications and thus ensure their likelihood of actually continuing the use of medicines as needed. The study findings showed that the accounts on illness experiences regarding the day-to-day living with a chronic NCD such as diabetes is shaped by unpredictable health outcomes, functional incapability, frequent loss of consciousness, libido and memory, limited social life, and increased stress and tension. This study finding suggests that public health interventions targeting the improvement of patients' quality of life could learn from the patients' perspectives through the patients' explanatory model of illness in order to achieve a better health outcome. At the individual level, clinicians could be more attentive to the patients' emotional, psychological, economic and physical health experiences, as these can influence the way patients respond to the illness. 9.6.3 Implications for community-driven initiatives and future research directions Community participation in health promotion is one of the important aspects of improving community health and wellbeing and is a key aspect for the success of primary health care initiatives. However, effective community-driven initiative programmes require effective advocacy strategy to encourage communities to play an active role in disease prevention, management and control. The findings of this study could contribute to shaping such advocacy programmes for community initiatives to prevent and control malaria and diabetes conditions. The perceptions associated with diet, for example, in the development of diabetes and its complications could inform advocacy activities for promotion of healthy eating in the community. The findings on the use of medications and continuity of care could be used to inform advocacy strategies for the development of community care and support groups in the treatment and management of the conditions. The current initiatives in the country to use Community Health Workers (CHWs) to provide maternal and child health services could be strengthened to incorporate the provision of diabetes services such as blood sugar monitoring and medication refills. These CHWs could also act as a bridge between the community and the primary health facilities by raising community awareness on signs and symptoms of diabetes among other NCDs, encouraging prompt and appropriate care seeking and use of the medications, and encouraging practices leading to lifestyle and behaviour change in the community. 192 Chapter 9The public health challenges that we face in the 21st century in terms of the infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases are complex and require a broadened approach in their prevention and control. Engaging community perspectives and voices and encouraging community partnerships and actions in identifying mechanisms and ways to solving the health problems could be among the important aspects for such approaches. With respect to this study in particular, it would mean that policies and public health programmes for strengthening health-seeking behaviour would need to: Promote informed decisions on the choice of which anti-malarial medication to use and encourage the people to use them in the correct way, taking into account the existing cultural knowledge and behaviours in which these choices are embedded. Improve the general understanding of the differences between the symptoms of infectious diseases versus chronic non-communicable diseases, as well as their manifestation and management. This could also help communities broaden their understanding of the risk factors associated with these conditions and develop locally embedded programmes for their prevention and control. Empower people with diabetes to make informed decisions on their use of medications and continuity with care. This should be accompanied by a strengthening of the diabetes health services by ensuring their affordability and their consistent availability, especially in the rural settings Consider patients' accounts on emotional, psychological, economic, and physical health vis-\u00e0-vis their illness experiences when tailoring interventions to help patients and their families cope with their illness conditions The depth of understanding of health-seeking behaviour of malaria and diabetes in this study raises some concerns that could guide future research directions. Specifically, there is a need for (i) understanding the underlying motives for people's choice of specific anti-malarial medicines for self-medication and treatment. Such information would contribute to tailoring targeted interventions for encouraging the use of appropriate and effective anti-malarial medicines; (ii) assessing how the medical professionals diagnose diabetes among their patients. This assessment could help in identifying knowledge gaps on diabetes' diagnosis and treatment among the medical professionals and contribute to developing specific interventions for strengthening early diagnosis and treatment of the condition; and (iii) assessing how chronic NCDs such as diabetes impact families' relationships, function and 193 General discussion and recommendationseconomic well-being as well as how different socio-cultural factors impact the illness experiences. Obtaining this information could help in developing context-specific strategies for making living with diabetes less challenging and for improving the relations, functional and economic well-being of the patients and their families. 9.7 Concluding remarks on study implications This study provides important findings for a greater understanding of the decision-making processes and health-seeking behaviour for diabetes in the context of infectious conditions like malaria as a predominant illness in rural settings. Such information is important for policy makers and for public health practitioners and those concerned with improving the quality of life for all people. It can also contribute to designing interventions that could help people with chronic illnesses live a better life. In general, the findings of this study can contribute to shaping context-specific interventions for (1) strengthening peoples' decision- making process for malaria self-care practices; (2) raising awareness about the emerging signs and symptoms of diabetes and NCDs in general; (3) strengthening the behavioural practices that shape the experiences of medication use and the continuity of care; and (4) improving illness experiences of people with chronic NCDs such as diabetes for improved health and well-being. The findings of this research thus make an important contribution to future research and policy formulations. References 1.

J., Dieleman, M., Haisma, H., & Geubbels, E. (2014). Public policy, health system, and community actions against illness as platforms for response to NCDs in Tanzania: a narrative review. Global health action, 7.Summary / Samenvatting218 SummarySummary Tanzania is experiencing the epidemiological transition and the resultant challenge of the double burden of disease. Whereas infectious conditions such as malaria remain major public health concerns, the incidences of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes are rising at an alarming pace. Malaria and diabetes have different aetiologies, manifesting differently and requiring different models for their treatment and management, but their coexistence in Tanzanian rural communities compounds the physiological, social and psychological suffering of the individuals and their families. Information on health-seeking behaviour in contexts where both infectious and non-communicable diseases are occurring in the context of an epidemiological transition is limited. Such information could be a useful contribution towards the efforts to support and encourage people to make informed decisions in seeking prompt, appropriate and effective care, and to determine the uptake of the disease control and management interventions that are already in place. The overall objective of this study was to explore the cultural aspects shaping health-seeking behaviour for malaria and diabetes among adults in Tanzania, a country that is undergoing the epidemiological transition. Several specific objectives and research questions followed from this overall objective: 1. To provide an inventory of how the existing policy environment, health system and community platforms are addressing the NCDs situation in the country, a narrative review was conducted guided by the following research question: How can the existing public policy environment, health system and community actions against illnesses be used as platforms for NCD responses in Tanzania? (Chapter four) 2. Studies on communities' responses to illnesses such as malaria suggest that self-medication and treatment with medicines bought at a drug shop is a common initial action when individuals experience ill-health. To gain deeper insight into why people choose self-care for malaria treatment and the motives for the choice of drug shop services, the following research question was developed: How do the underlying cultural motives shape adults' decision-making processes in their choice of malaria self-care practices? (Chapter five)219 Summary3. The new challenges in public health have arisen with the emergence of chronic non- communicable diseases such as diabetes. The following research question was developed in order to grasp - via an emic perspective - how the communities assign meanings to the emerging symptoms, and the intricate relationship these meanings form to shape individuals' health-seeking behaviour How does the underlying cultural context inform the meaning given to the emerging diabetes symptoms and shape the individuals' health-seeking behaviour practices? (Chapter six) 4. To gain insight into behavioural aspects shaping diabetes medication use experiences and continuity of use, the following research question was developed: How do the underlying cultural motives shape diabetes patients' decision-making processes and their experiences regarding diabetes medication use and continuity of use? (Chapter seven) 5. Despite their differing nature in aetiology and management, malaria and diabetes occur in the same communities and sometimes coexist in the same households and or individuals - hence, the term, double burden of disease. To better understand the illness experiences of diabetes in a context of malaria as a predominant condition, the following question was formulated: How is diabetes experienced in the context of malaria as a predominant illness? (Chapter Eight) The research objective described above and the research questions outlined formed the basis of this thesis. Theoretical framework The Health Belief Model (HBM) was applied in the study to guide the inquiry into individuals' health-seeking behaviour for both malaria and diabetes. Originating in the 1950's, this theory was constructed by the US Public Health Service Department to explain why public health preventive services were not successful. The theory was later expanded for insight into compliance with medical prescriptions. The HBM components are perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits and perceived barriers. To increase the 220 Summaryapplicability of the HBM components in guiding the understanding of how cultural aspects shape individuals' health-seeking behaviour, D'Andrade's concept of Cultural Schemas was adopted in the study. These two theories, the concept of Cultural Schemas and the HBM, were used to construct the study's conceptual framework. The conceptual framework formed the basis for designing the topic guides that were used to guide data collection activities and the subsequent analysis. Study design, data collection and analysis The study was divided into two main parts: secondary data analysis and primary data collection. Secondary data analysis involved conducting a narrative review of the published and grey literature on how the existing policy environment, health system and communities are addressing the NCD situation in Tanzania. Primary data were collected in Kilombero, a rural district in Tanzania involving: (i) people in the community (ii) malaria and /or diabetes patients, (iii) neighbours and /or people related to diabetes patients, and (iv) family members of diabetes patients. The data collection team comprised the researcher and two research assistants with social science background and experienced with qualitative data collection activities. The data collection activities were organized into two rounds: round one involved conducting FGDs between October and November 2012; round two involved conducting IDIs between February and March 2013. Data analysis followed grounded theory principles and was assisted by NVivo 9, qualitative data management software. During the data analysis, different theoretical concepts such as the concept of self-care, the 5A's access to care dimensions and the explanatory models of illness were applied to aid data interpretation. Key findings This section summarizes the key findings of the study. These findings are presented following the sequence of the chapters in the thesis and follows the order of the research questions. Chapter four present results of our narrative review on how the existing policy environment, health system and community actions against illness can be used as a platform for NCD responses in Tanzania ( research question 1 ). The narrative review findings showed that the disease prevention and control efforts in Tanzania are focused more on infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. This focus reflects the dominance of these conditions and their consequences in the community. The emergence of NCDs challenges the government, health system and communities that have to face both the infectious and the emerging non communicable conditions simultaneously. It was evident in the narrative 221 Summaryreview that a lack of a national NCD policy in the country led to fragmented efforts in their prevention and control. This narrative review showed inadequate preparedness of the health system to accommodate the requirements of the emerging NCDs, especially in the primary level health facilities that are characterized by insufficient availability of trained personnel, diagnostic equipment and treatments. We found no evidence of community involvement in the prevention and control of NCDs, nor of community perceptions of NCDs, especially among the rural communities. This is the focus of the current study. In chapter five, results of the primary data are presented, detailing how the underlying cultural motives shape adults' choices regarding malaria self-care practices (Research question 2). The study findings indicate that the biomedical knowledge about malaria signs and symptoms have been acculturated into the community's cultural meaning system and schemas about the condition. This cultural meaning system was seen to inform the individuals' perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of malaria and their self-diagnosis, self-medication and treatment practices. The shared schemas on malaria in the community and the individual experiences of the condition triggered these self-care practices. The perceived benefits associated with specific antimalarial treatments informed the use of anti- malaria monotherapies and the preference for single doses in the study. Perceived barriers associated with the fears of side effects from the recommended first-line anti-malarial combination treatments hindered their use. Chapter six provides an account of the findings on how the underlying cultural contexts inform the meanings given to the emerging diabetes symptoms and shape the individuals' health-seeking behaviour (research question 3). The study findings show that diabetes is a relatively new condition in Tanzania and the knowledge and awareness about its signs and symptoms is limited among the communities in the study settings. People used the prevailing cultural meaning system and schemas on infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV and AIDs to inform their interpretation of the emerging chronic diabetes symptoms. Schemas for body image informed the meaning given to diabetes symptoms similar to those of HIV/AIDS because of the severe weight loss. The community's cultural meaning system about malaria signs and symptoms such as headache, fever and tiredness informed individuals' perceived susceptibility to malaria as well as their perceived severity, and consequently they usually chose to self-medicate with anti-malarial medicines. Misdiagnosis of diabetes symptoms was common, as not only the patients but also the health care professionals were unable to recognize the symptoms. When the cultural meaning system could not aid in assigning meaning to the emerging diabetes symptoms, it informed the decisions of some patients to consult traditional healers and/or associate the symptoms to witchcraft causes.222 SummaryChapter seven presents results on the lived experiences of diabetes medication use and continuity of use in a setting with limited access to diabetes services (Research question 4). In the study, the perceived benefits associated with the use of diabetes medications in reducing the perceived severity of the symptoms informed patients' acceptability of the medicines. However, affordability, availability and the physical accessibility of the diabetes services, including the medicines, were the perceived barriers to their use and continuity of use among patients. These issues were more pronounced among rural diabetes patients because diabetes services were completely unavailable in the rural and remote areas. Because of the perceived severity of diabetes when patients are not using medicines, diabetes patients in the study reported engaging in several behaviour practices as coping mechanisms to offset the perceived barriers and ensure their use of the medications. Such practices included: dose omission, using less of the required dose and or sharing their medications among themselves. Chapter eight provides findings on the illness experiences of diabetes in the context of malaria as a predominant condition (research question 5). The study findings demonstrate that the cultural meaning system and schemas about acute infectious illnesses such as malaria shaped the individuals' perceived severity of malaria and diabetes. These perceptions in turn informed the individual accounts of the illness experiences on the severity and chronicity of the conditions. However, the illness experiences of malaria were indicated as being relatively bearable because of the acuteness and shorter duration compared to the experiences of diabetes. The accounts of diabetes illness experiences were characterized by serious, lifelong consequences such as unpredictable health conditions, loss of consciousness, memory, libido, functional incapability, limited social life, and increased stress and tension. Conclusion This study provides important findings for a greater understanding of the factors shaping health-seeking behaviour with respect to common infectious conditions such as malaria as well as the emerging chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes. This information is useful for policy makers and for public health practitioners and those concerned with improving the quality of life for all people and it can contribute to designing interventions for informed decisions regarding seeking treatment for the illnesses. In general, the findings of this study could contribute to the development of context-specific interventions for strengthening peoples' decision-making processes in terms of malaria self-care practices; raising awareness on the emerging signs and symptoms of diabetes and NCDs in general; strengthening behavioural practices with respect to medication use; and improving illness experiences and day-to-day life for people with chronic NCDs such as diabetes. The study findings also make important contributions to future research and policy formulations.223 SummarySamenvatting Ziektegedrag onder volwassenen in de Zuidoost Tanzania, met speciale aandacht voor malaria en diabetes In Tanzania is op de epidemiologische transitie die bepalen met betrekking tot malaria en diabetes onder volwassenen Tanzania, een land dat hand te nemen en 224 wat hun motivatie is om te kiezen uit onderliggende culturele hoe be\u00efnvloedt dit het ziektegedrag van (Hoofdstuk 5) 4.
