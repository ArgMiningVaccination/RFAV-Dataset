A: Apply to the affected area and let it sit for 10 - 15 minutes. Wipe off. Reapply as needed if the spot is still irritated. If you would like to keep it on longer (may be necessary with splinters), cover with a bandage to prevent mess. Q: What can I use this for? A: Bug bites, stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, acne, splinters. Some people even use it after being forced to receive a vaccine \u2014 right on the injection site. Q: Why is this so messy? Can't it be some other color? A: Unfortunately, the 'mess' is what makes it work! Charcoal makes it black and is a key ingredient to 'draw out' the toxins. We recommend covering with a bandage and washing with soap and water after use. Q: Is this the 'black salve' that the FDA warned against? Is this even safe? A: This is a totally different product. That 'black salve' is a bloodroot salve that is used for cancer, and caution is warranted. This is bentonite clay and charcoal and is perfectly safe! Q: I'm allergic to lavender, but I need this! What do I do? A: We recommend trying our [Pit Detox Mask](https://earthley.com/product/detoxifying-pit-mask/) instead! It will work similarly but does not contain lavender.
