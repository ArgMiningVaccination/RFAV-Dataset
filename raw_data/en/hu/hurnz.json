Instead of devoting one big chunk of time to physical activity, consider fitting in smaller intervals throughout the day. Use these tips to add physical activity to your day or when you're having a tough time getting in a full workout. Exercise first thing in the morning. Set your alarm a few minutes earlier and have your sneakers and sweats ready. A quick 15-20 minute walk or jog is a great way to begin the day. Take a hike. Park farther away from your office, or try 10 minutes of brisk walking during your lunch or other break. Use the stairs. Take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever you can. Play outside with your kids. Everyone will love spending time together and getting the benefits of being active.Q I've already slipped on my New Y ear's resolution to exercise more. How can I possibly fit it into my busy schedule? Try desk exercises. Take breaks from the computer throughout the day to stretch and do some strengthening exercises. You'll return to work with more clarity. Desk squats are great strengtheners and raise your heart rate. Don't sit still. While watching TV or doing other sitting activities, draw the alphabet in the air with one foot. See how far through the alphabet you can go. Try it with the other foot. See if you can add a letter every day or two. Walk your dog. Your dog will love it, and you may too! Build up your legs. Instead of \"plopping\" into a chair, slowly lower yourself down, and then linger for a few seconds, halfway before sitting down. Over time, all of these small changes will add up and you'll begin to see positive results.

Commitment to Care. 3 as healthcare recognizes the union of body, mind and spirit, so does the practice of faith commu-nity nursing. Providing healthcare in a religious atmosphere joins two sources of health and healing: the faith community and the medical environment. Recent research indicates that your state of well- being influences your immune system, affecting your overall quality of life. Prayer, grief and forgiveness also have measurable effects on your immune system. Faith community nursing came to Charlotte in 1988 and spread to Concord in 1997. A group of chaplains began the Parish Nursing program at NorthEast Medical Center, now Carolinas Medical Center-NorthEast. Today, this program includes more than 55 faith communities in Cabarrus, Rowan and Stanly counties and is expanding to include faith communities in Mecklenburg County. CaR IN g fo R aL L The Faith Community Health Ministry teams affiliated with Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) serve these faith communities to promote health, wellness and healing through education and spiritual support. Led by trained faith community nurses or faith commu- nity health promoters, patients learn that self-care and help-ing others are parts of responsible stewardship. In this role, nurses help them communicate with their doctors, other healthcare providers, religious leaders and their families. Patients are encouraged to learn how to manage chronic medical conditions, prevent illness and enjoy a healthier lifestyle. Since many people regularly attend Reaching out to our neighbors Faith Community Health Ministry meetings within their faith community to seek a better life through fellowship, these meetings are also natural missions for wellness. \"Our healthcare system faces many challenges, includ- ing caring for an aging population with growing medical demands on top of a struggling economy, so healthcare dollars are in short supply,\" says Pam Hurley, RN, director of CHS's Faith Community Health Ministry. \"We provide a way for people to connect with the resources they need along the continuum of care.\" hE LPIN g Th oS E I N N EED Faith community nurses have several roles: health educator, advocate, referral source and integrator of faith and health. They train volunteers to take on vari-ous roles with the health ministry team. Every faith community with a health ministry has unique programs that address its particular needs. \"It's an idea that makes a lot of sense,\" says Carol Hovey, RN, BSN, health ministry coordinator. \"Prevention has to take place out-side of the hospital. The hospital doesn't usually have the long-term relationship with patients that a faith community has with its members.\" LE ND a ha N D fo r information about creating a health ministry in your faith community, call 704-403-4484 or visit www.carolinasmedicalcenter.org/faith to watch a video about the program . maKINg a C o NNECTI o N: s is m ills, rn , B s , me d, faith community nurse (r), meets with one of her members, s andra s tarr.Spring 2011 | carolinas Health | www.cmc-northeast.org 4Derek Raghavan, MD, PhD, a world- renowned cancer expert, started his new position as President of Levine Cancer Institute in early April. Levine Cancer Institute was established in October 2010 with a $20 million grant from the Leon Levine Foundation. For the past six years, Dr. Raghavan has been Chairman and Director of the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute in Ohio. He served a concurrent appointment as the M. Frank and Margaret Domiter Rudy Institute Distinguished Chair in Translational Cancer Research. Q Carolinas h ealthCare System (C h S) is honored to have you join the family. What attracted you to Levine Cancer Institute? a Several things. I respect strong and effective leadership. I think what Michael Tarwater, Joseph Piemont, Paul Franz and their teams have achieved in the past two decades is spectacular. I also like their vision of returning something to the com-munity and focusing on community-based cancer prevention, diagnosis, care and research. The fact that cH S is prepared to invest half a billion dollars in this system, while creating a new six-story center that will link to more than 30 community hospi-tals, is a superb opportunity for defining a new cancer-care model. cH S facilities care for more than 10,000 new patients a year, which provides a wonderful opportunity to make significant contri-butions to the national cancer treatment and trials effort. Generally speaking, we don't have enough patients involved in high-quality clinical trials in the United States. Q What will be the first item on your agenda? a I'll engage the outstanding cH S medical community to identify common interests and areas of coopera-tion and collaboration. Our team will be planning and implementing the new building; we'll be recruiting key physicians to complement the established clini-cal strengths in ch arlotte and beyond; and we'll be developing our portfolio of laboratory, translational* and clinical research projects. *Translational research converts scientific discoveries into real-life clinical applications to help cure cancer. tu rning a vision into reality Dr. Raghavan speaks about his new role as President of Levine Cancer Institute Uncompromising Excellence. Commitment to Care. 5 Q What one thing do you suggest an individual start doing today to prevent cancer? a Stop smoking! Stop smoking! Stop smoking! Eating a heart-healthy diet, exercising, keeping your level of sun exposure sensible and being cautious about industrial pollution are important lifestyle changes. Q What advances do you expect to see in cancer research and technology in the next five to 10 years? a With our new understanding of molecular biology; and the relationship between the lab and the clinic, we will improve our ability to design and carry out important clinical trials: We're making progress faster than ever. Twenty-five years ago, I was part of the large team that participated in changing the natural history of metastatic testicular cancer from a real killer to a reliably curable disease, and I've watched colleagues do similar things for other tumors. Ultimately, before I retire, I expect to see further improvements in cure rates and survival, reduction in treatment toxicity and improvements in preventing cancer and supporting our patients. Q D uring your tenure at the Taussig Cancer Institute, its ranking as one of the top cancer centers in U.S. News & World Report's ratings jumped dramatically from No. 46 to No. 9. To what do you attribute this success? a A superb team of committed and caring doctors, nurses, support staff, front-line personnel and admin-istrators in the cancer center, who provide the best care possible. This can only work in a system that enables interaction between clinical management and leading-edge research programs. My focus was to set that structure into place. The motto, \"patients first,\" guided our treatment philosophy at the Taussig ca ncer Institute. This approach will translate perfectly at Levine ca ncer Institute. Q your accomplished career spans more than 30 years. What are you most proud of? a I've been very fortunate to work in outstanding centers with some extraordinary colleagues. When I started in oncology, I wanted to make a difference\u2014to provide new treatments that would improve cure and survival rates, to train superb and empathetic doctors and leaders in medicine, to be involved in research, to develop effective medical business models that make sense and aren't wasteful and to give something back to the community, especially in the area of cancer-care disparities. I've been extraordinarily lucky to achieve some of my goals in each of these areas. Q Why is it important for patients to receive care locally? a It minimizes disruption during a critical time in patients' lives. Patients need fine medical care and support and a defined medical plan and expectations. When these are close to a patient's environment, healing is easier. For more complex procedures, we may have to arrange care at our ch arlotte facility, but we'll always try to get patients back home as soon as possible. We must be prudent about high-end expenditures and can't place every piece of sophisti-cated equipment in every center. Quality care directly relates to a provider's experience in using complex equipment and the number of patients seen.turning a vision into reality BREaK IN g gRoU ND: Guests of honor at the le vine ca ncer in stitute groundbreaking included (l-r): mi chael ta rwater, c eo, cHs; de rek ra ghavan, m d, Phd, President, le vine ca ncer in stitute; le on le vine; sa ndra le vine; Jeffrey Kneisl, m Blumenthal ncer ce nter; and ch ief op erating of ficer, cHs.Images on pages 1, 2 and 7 \u00a9 2011 ThinkstockSpring 2011 | carolinas Health | www.cmc-northeast.org 6When adults are ailing, they can usually describe their symptoms to their doctor. Children, however, can't always tell someone where it hurts, so it's important for them to see health-care providers who have the knowledge and expertise to recognize their often-subtle signs of discomfort. a S KILLED aN D CaR INg T Ea m Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital at Carolinas Medical Center-NorthEast has two highly skilled and caring pediatric surgeons on staff. J. David Hoover, MD, and Srikumar Biswanath Pillai, MD, are experts in a wide range of pediatric surgical procedures. Small patients, big challenges \"Children are resilient, but they can't tolerate intense pain for a long time,\" says Dr. Hoover, medical director of the Pediatric Pavilion at Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital. \"If you don't intervene in time when they become criti-cally ill, you may miss the opportunity to have a good outcome.\" Dr. Hoover's special interest is neonatal surgery, including correcting congenital disorders. Many con-genital disorders are diagnosed prenatally, while others aren't found until after birth. A team of neonatologists, obstetric hospitalists, anesthesiologists and a 24-hour Level IV neonatal intensive care unit support the surgeons. a S ERI oU S CaS E Three-month-old Ayden Gheen of High Rock Lake was in constant pain, suffering from constipation and a distended abdomen, when he was diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease. A rare congenital disorder, it's caused by the absence of nerve cells in the rectum and/or colon that prevents the evacuation of stools. Dr. Hoover performed laparoscopic surgery through four tiny incisions to remove the diseased segment of his colon. The proce-dure created less internal scarring than traditional surgery would have, and in a few weeks, Ayden was a happy 4-month-old. \"It was comforting to know that we finally discovered what was wrong, but I had mixed emotions about sur-gery,\" says Ayden's father, Brandon Gheen. \"Having the surgery at Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital, just a short drive from home, made the experience much easier for the entire family,\" Brandon says. \"Dr. Hoover was great! I knew Ayden was in good hands.\" hav INg SomE f UN: J. d avid Hoover, md , and a yden Gheen enjoy a happy moment.

To meet this need, the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors approved a large expansion of the state's public medical schools. Last fall, the UNC School of Medicine formally announced the establishment of a regional clinical campus coming to Carolinas Medical Center (CMC). CMC has played an active role in providing clinical education for third- and fourth-year UNC medical students for more than 40 years. Those students have completed rotations at CMC in a wide variety of medical specialties as part of their overall training. \"The establishment of a medical school campus here in Charlotte recognizes the importance of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and surrounding regions to the University of North Carolina and the state,\" says William Roper, MD, MPH, dean, School of Medicine, vice chancellor for Medical Affairs and CEO of the UNC Health Care System. \"This city has experienced vibrant growth recently and includes a strong community of support, which features many healthcare providers, a growing patient population and a strong interest in local health education.\" According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the estimated physician shortages beginning in 2015 may be 50 percent worse than originally anticipated. Projections before healthcare reform showed a shortage of around 40,000 doctors in 2015; however, current estimates bring that number to more than 60,000, with worsening shortages foreseen through 2025. The expansion plan will also include a regional campus in Asheville, NC, at Mission Health System. New signage was unveiled at Carolinas me dical Center (C mC ) last fall. CmC will spend $4 million to renovate its me dical Education Building. "}
