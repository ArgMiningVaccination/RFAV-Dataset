My mission is to heal your connection with this potent personal resource and to provide tools to maintain health, depth and meaning in your life. My Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture (TCM) practice has served the Brentwood and Los Angeles communities for 18 years. As an acupuncturist, I specialize in treating stress-related illnesses and chronic medical conditions; pain and otherwise. As a Master herbalist, I use custom-designed formulas to address chronic and complex issues not responding well to Western treatments. As a Healer, I apply my years of clinical experience, self-study in yoga, meditation and eastern philosophies treat a patient's five bodies: the physical, energetic, emotional, mental and spiritual bodies simultaneously. This is the most healing and transformative work that I do. My newest offering is my Journey to Joy Workshops, a 100-day adventure of Self-discovery, which give people the tools to create a road-map for living that connects them to their potent authentic self. Put on hold during the pandemic I'm am looking for new ways to offer this material to interested people. In my clinical practice I regularly treat insomnia, anxiety, depression, fatigue, memory confusion, abnormal menstrual cycles, menopausal symptoms, nausea, metabolic disorders, irritable bowel, miscellaneous rashes, as well as various types of acute and chronic pain. Recently, I have also had miraculous success with PMDD and provided meaningful support for Dysautonomia/POTS patients Blessings to you, Candace "}
