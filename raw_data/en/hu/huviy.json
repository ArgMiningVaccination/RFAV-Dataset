THE TRANSCRIPT OF THIS PRACTICE CAN BE FOUND BELOW: Use this practice anytime you need to center yourself quickly. Start by sitting comfortably, and closing your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. Take a deep, full breath in, and a deep breath out. And now, with me, to the count of four, inhale for one, two, three, four. Hold for one, two, three, four. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two, three, four. Hold for one, two, three, four. Exhale one, two, three, four. Inhale one, two, three, four. Hold for one, two, three, four. Exhale one, two, three, four. Now breathe normally and think of a word, just one word that you need to call into your energy space for the rest of this day. What energy do you need? For the rest of this day, pick a word. And now for the next several breaths, I want you to imagine that you are literally inhaling the energy of this word. Like you are breathing it in and it's healing you, every crevice of your inner and outer body gets bathed and soothed by its energy. Every worry, every doubt, gets soothed and cleared and healed by the energy of this word. The word can turn into a color or a texture as you do this, just breathe and fill yourself up. Let's do it together. Inhale deeply, exhale, let it out. Inhale, call in your words. Exhale, let them permeate through you. Inhale, take in what you need. Exhale, let it move through every spot of your body. Inhale, on your own now. Calling in your word. One last time. Now, just place your hands over your heart, right over the center of your chest if you've moved them. And I want you to use your word in an I am statement, so if your word was joy you would say I am joy, but you fill in the blank with your word. Go ahead and do this in your mind now. I am. Repeat that in your mind a few more times. And commit to bringing this energy to your day. You got this. Get Updates From Justin Join the newsletter to get love notes, free practices, and more.
