Under Dr. Sher- man P. Vinograd's guidance, the Nationai Aero- nautics and Space Administration brought together a group of leading medical scientists of the nation. These leaders applied their varied specialized compe- tence toward solving the potential problems that han would face as he left his earth bound environment and moved into space, bringing their interdiscipli- nary and their interdepartmental viewpoints together It wa?i a challenging project. to develop a research and development program that could point the way toward man's ultimate conquest of the space environment. The Mce of Space Medicine within NASA, and indeed the entire scientific community concerned with the medical behavioral sciences, is indebted to Dr. Vinograd and to iiir group of wieiitists who gave 3 willingly of their time and effort toward furthering the national goal of space exploration. JACK BOLLERUD Brigadier General, USAF, MC Acting Director, Space Medicine Manned Space Flight THE SPACE MEDICINE ADVISORY GROUP (SPAMAG) is a group of consultants representing varied disciplines in the life sciences who met eight times to be briefed on the current status of the space program and to consider the various aspects of a pro- posed biomedical program of an orbiting research laboratory. This group was asked to consider the support recommendations under three broad categories: (1 ) life support, those environmental factors which are to be controlled or considered to be constant; (rj experiments in which environmental factors might be varied in a significant way in order to test the response in the space environment; and (3) research laboratory decision items which are related to the requirements for its design. The initial challenge to the Group is part of this report and lists the variety of environmental factors md ORL decisions which were discussed. In each of these areas, the Group was furnished a format as guidance in life support or experiment decisions. Additionally, the Space Medicine Advisory Group was divided into task groups so that they might address themselves to the spec& areas in which they had competence. These task groups are listed in the separate sections of the report. Priority assignment, in the context of this report, is an evaluation by the group for administrative purposes. The priority assessment is given on the basis of the degree to which consideration of the experiment was necessary in design of the research labora- tory and the degree to which the experiment required preliminary ground-based experi- mentation. Leadtime in terms of experiment design as well as the personnel involved is also a factor. In this respect it will be clear that the Group felt that all of the experi- ments were in a high priority category; that is, the experiments were necessary for con- sideration in design requirements as well as experimental planning at this time. A priority related to importance of the problem must be made at a later date. Phase I on life support recommendations covers six categories: (1) hazards, (2) atmosphere, (3) living conditions, (4) meta- bolic factors, (5) group integrity, and (6) medical considerations. Under each of these categories the groups made recommendations concerning the spacecraft, research and development necessary for design of the spacecraft, ground-based experiments which were necessary for the design requirements, and, in some cases, experiments which should be accomplished in space flight preceding the orbiting research laboratory. The hazards section considers the toxicological and general housekeeping problems in the spacecraft. The atmosphere section prescribes the ideal atmosphere for a research laboratory and indicates the necessity for being able to change the atmosphere for experi- mental purposes. The living conditions section deals with general body functions and hygiene, decor, illumination and work schedules as well as volume requirements in the spacecraft. The metabolic requirements section sets forth the present day estimate of the food, water, and waste requirements. The group integrity section discusses those factors which are involved in efficient and harmonious group functioning; however, it does not consider in detail the previously well-studied topic of individual performance. The section on medical considerations addresses itself to recommendations concerning flight crew medical selection and considerations of illness and injury among the crew as well as recommendations for medical safety monitoring. The report is given in three phases. V PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED. vi MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY These 6 sections represent a grouping of the some 15 items which were presented ' Phase I1 is concerned with the experiments. for discussion and considered individually. These experiments fall into three major categories; the first of which are those related to general medical and physiolog- ical measurements. Although a number of specific experiments are designed to test the characteristics of physiological and psychological systems, certain observations are rec- ommended on a continuous daily basis to provide data which may be used in a number of data acquisition and reduction procedures. These also will serve for the general medical monitoring in the spacecraft. Physiological tests cover experiments which are designed to test the characteristics of the cardiovascular system and the respiratory system. Additional experiments are designed to test and give indications of functions of overall metabolism, metabolism of bone and muscle and metabolism as related to hematology. A group of experiments which assess the neurologic function and miscellaneous experiments on the cellular level are also included. Although several stress factors were listed by the group for consid- eration, the experiments given are directed toward weightlessness and total combined flight stress. This does not negate the importance of the interaction of these factors, but it emphasizes the unique factor of weightlessness. Psychological experiments are devised to test the emotions, performance, reaction to frustration, and spontaneous activities. For Phase I11 on the design and operational recommendations, the ORL require- ments were gathered from a free discussion by the Group and relate to specific space- craft requirements, requirements for personnel in the spacecraft, and requirements for specific equipment in laboratory facilities on the spacecraft. The factors presented under the three phases of this report represent the present best opinion of the group with respect to the decisions and areas of emphasis for orbiting research laboratory considerations and give a general presentation which should be con- tinuously reevaluated and revised.

Studies of the med- ical aspects of the Orbiting Research Laboratory con- cept were initiated within NASA, and were supple- mented a short time later by contracted industrial par- ticipation. As the feasibility of an Orbiting Research Laboratory grew apparent, so grew the opportunity to tap one of our richest national resources, the scientific CGIXImUnitY. These representatives of American medi- cine were invited to participate not only to provide maximal expertise in the structuring of a specific na- tional space effort of the future, but also because it was recognized that in doing so they would at the same time be contributing strongly to the direction of space medical investigation as a whole. This participation was realized with the formation of the Space Medicine Advisory Group, a group of 20 distinguished consultants representing some 16 specialties and subspecialties in medical and medically related fields. The group was organized and its meth- odology established in accordance with certain objec- tives, predetermined in order to enhance the effective- ness of its work. Foremost among these objectives were : . (1) The establishment of SPAMAG as a working group rather than a reviewing committee to enable recommendations to be made on the basis of \"shirt- sleeve\" familiarity with the conditions of manned space flight and with the several disciplines both within and without the broad field of medicine which are necessarily involved in these recom- mendations. (2) The composition of a group of a majority of members who had not been previously active in the space program together with a strong minority of those who had. This made it possible to obtain a fresh evaluation while preserving the continuity of familiarity with manned space flight, all by highly competent scientific authority. (3) The clear statement of methods, goals, and anticipated end products of the work of SPAMAG from the outset of its activity was regarded impor- tant for obvious reasons. 'While the goals and end products were set forth with some degree of rigid- ity, the methodology was only offered. However, it too was accepted with small modification after minimal discussion. (4) The establishment of a program of orientation to space flight and its technology to take piace throughout the series of meetings. This was deemed necessary if recommendations were to be made on a realistic and current basis. (5) Provision for frequent updating of the orig- inal report in the light of new research and tech- nology, and even of \"second thoughts\" or future SPAMAG meetings. This principle of a dynam- ically oriented effort was served, at least in part, by the initial presentation of this report in loose leaf form. IN DECEMBER, 1963, after the first meeting had already been scheduled for January 1964, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) study program was as- signed to the US. Air Force. Consistent with the NASA/DOD policy of close coordination, the Air Force, through General Benjamin A. Strickland, was then invited to participate with NASA in this en deavor. In response, the Air Force assigned a CO- chairman, Colonel Andres I. Karstens, and two observers to the SPAMAG meetings. The Group met on two consecutive days each month for a total of eight meetings. The first morning of each two-day session was devoted to briefings on vari- ous developmental and operational aspects of space flight given chiefly by NASA personnel. Additional indoctrination was provided by convening two of these meetings at operational centers, Cape Kennedy and the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston. Both of these were three-day sessions, the third day of which was devoted to a tour and discussions of fad- ities at each of these two sites. The remaining meet- ings were held in Washington, D.C. The Group was in every sense of the word a working groip; through diligent effort and by means of strict adherence to a very tight schedule, it managed to complete the very large task undertaken within the given time schedule. 2 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY Prior to the first meeting in January, 1964, a 14-page general format was devised, which the Group agreed to adopt with minor revisions at the time of the first meeting. The full format, included in this report as Tables I through XII, specifies the aims and meth- ods of the work of SPAMAG. The total study of the ORL concept from the med- ical standpoint was seen as consisting of three major phases or tasks. These are shown in Table I. The first task was to make recommendations con- cerning specifications for the environmental factors which are to be supplied the flight crew. Although the format shows this section (Phase I, \"Life Sup- port\") as consisting of nine subtask areas, evaluations and recommendations were made by five panels, one of which submitted two reports, namely \"Living Con- ditions and Standards\", and \"'Medical Safety Mon- itoring.\" Consequently, Phase I consists of six panel reports. The second task or phase was to define the medical experiments and measurements to be performed aboard the ORL. These were devised on the basis of need rather than available space, and needs were determined by means of carefully examining the interfaces be- tween single and combined environmental factors on the one hand, and bodily functions on the other. In order to accomplish this, the Group as a whole first generated a list of potential single and multiple stress factors (Tables I1 and 111) , then reviewed and revised a comprehensive outline of body functions (Table IV). They then separated into three panels which examined the interfaces relevant to their assigned areas of body function, and devised experiments and meas- urements in accordance with the method and outlines shown in Tables V and VI. The reporting of SPAMAG experiments, measurements, and recom- mendations was done according to the outlines shown in Tables VIII, IX, and X. Upon closer scrutiny, it may be recognized that these are, in reality, check lists of information required. It was thought logical that only after thorough con- sideration had been given the first two phases could reasonable recommendations be made concerning the third phase, that of general ORL recommendations. The questions to which these recommendations were addressed are shown under column 111, \"ORL Recom- mendations\" (Table I), more particularly those listed under point 5. It can be seen that this phase is, in effect, an operational and engineering translation of the first two phases, and, as such, can provide the most direct guidance to designers and engineers. Phase 111 was discussed and recommendations were made by the Group meeting in general session. Finally, the anticipated end products of this entire effort, as shown in Table XII, have, in fact, been accomplished. Among these products, the areas of prerequisite space flight experiments, prerequisite ground-based experiments, and prerequisite research and development warrant particular mention since these comprise the skeletal structure of an overall in- tegrated program of space flight medical investigation. Since publication of this report follows its comple- tion by more than 18 months, a few of the concepts presented may now be considered dated in light of more recent findings. Yet these instances are sur- prisingly few. This report is presented primarily for those who have a scientific interest in the field. At the same time, those who are interested in pro- grammed research, or in the historical or adminis- trative aspects of the field may also find it of some value. The Space Medicine Advisory Group met this heavy challenge with diligence, enthusiasm and skill. Their generous and able participation is most sincerely appre- ciated not only by those of us whose privilege it was to work with them but by all who are concerned with national progress in space medicine. 0 S.

In terms of personnel, time, equipment size, weight and power, etc., ORL experiments are to require the least to provide valid and reliable results. Suggested altema- tive experiments or additional measurements beyond minimal should be categorized as \"minimal,\" *'desirable- 1,\" \"desirable-2,\" etc. 6. Consider all stresses, functions, measurements, proce- dures, life suppport requirements, equipment function, storage, animal housing, etc. in terms of behavior in wcightlcssness. 7. Consider the basic question to be the means by which prolonged manned interplanetary and orbital missions can be achieved in terms of the well-being of maa. Therefore, in general, MOL environmental conditions my h set up paralieiing those anticipated onboard an interplanetary or orbital vehicle rather than Earth. 8. Adopted the general philosophy that man is to be sup- ported in the best manner possible by life support sys- tems. \"Best manner\" means preservation of psychophysi- ological integrity. 9. Keep in mind throughout this exercise the possible uses of space for studying and perhaps treating various path- ological states. 10. Bear in mind MOL (two-man) constraints.

PHASE1 THESE RECOMMENDATIONS are based upon the concept that the unique property of the near-Earth orbital flight environment which cannot be duplicated on Earth is weightlessness. The physiological and behavioral effects of this variable should then be studied under conditions that simulate Earth as closely as possible. Where interactions h-een w~ight!~~s~~ess d C'k,ei ~~ii&h -e siispted to exist, tbese &odd be controlled in the experimental sense, if possible; if the interacting variable is not con- trollable, it should be monitored precisely to provide a full description of the experimental conditions. Engineering exigencies should not dictate the envimnment-the environment must be supplied to provide the best medium for the experimental effort. ATMOSPHERE RECOMMENDATIONS Life Support Factors Atmosphere 1. Ideally the atmosphere should be identical in pres- sure and composition to Earth's atmosphere between sea level and not greater than 5000 ft altitude. The altitude of 5000 ft is arbitrarily chosen. The consensus is that short- or long-term residence at this altitude does not constitute a practical significant physiological stress. At- mospheric pressure and composition may ultimately be con- sidered as experimental variables. If this ideal cannot be met, the atmosphere should be a mixture of 6, N,, and rare gases; the rare gases should be present in the same molecular ratios relative to Nz found in the atmosphere of Earth at sea level. Until experiments prove otherwise, it must be assumed that the remaining gaseous constituents of the atmosphere are necessary. A chemically inert gas is not necessarily physio- logically unimportant. If the ideal atmosphere cannot be provided, the re- quirements for preflight ground-based experiments will be greatly increased and the entire program may be slowed. The oxygen partial pressure should be within the range of 150 mm of Hg (2.9 psi) to about 185 mm of Hg (3.6psi). The minimum value of 7 psi is the nearest approach to nor- mal which may carry an acceptable degree of risk against (I) occurrence of bends on rapid decompression to suit pres- sure, assumed to be 31/2 psi (additional ground-based exper- iments are required to determine the actual risk) ; (2) fire hazard (additional experiments are mandatory to be certain of the acceptability of the fire hazard risk associated with this atmosphere); (3) hazard of pulmonary atelectasis (addi- tional experiments are mandatory to define the degree of this risk) ; and (4) the risk of hematological disorders, e.g., pos- sible hemolytic anemia (this risk also requires further inves- tigation). The total pressure should be between 360 mm of Hg (7.0 psi) and the ideal 760 mm Hg (14.7 psi). This requires that the partial pressure of Nz be approx- imately 180 mm Hg (3.5 psi) to 610 mm Hg (11.8 psi) if the ideal (Earth) atmosphere is selected. 2. The maximum partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO,) should be 8 mm Hg with less than this value desirable. This recommendation is based on the work of Schaefer (ref. 21) in which older work is summarized which indicates that above 3% COS them is a deterioration in performance. Above CCh there may be difficulty with small adaptive processes. The permissible level of 0.5% to 0.870 CO, sug- gested is the general equivalent of 8 mm Hg. 3. Carbon monoxide (CO) concentration should be below 0.001%. This concentration of CO is that which would be in equilibrium with the normal car- boxy hemoglobin content of the blood of a nonsmoker. There is evidence of change in visual threshold at blood concentrations of 3 to 5% carboxy hemoglobin, 13 14 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY which is equivalent to CO concentrations of about 0.0126 to 0.021 mm Hg in inspired air. 4. Rigorous control of all gaseous and particulate con- taminants of the system must be established. Partic- ular attention must be directed to removal of ozone and prevention of atmospheric contamination by or- ganic compounds which may be in the environment. The chronic toxicology of such compounds must be investigated. The standards for maximum accumulated concentration of substances in the atmosphere should be expressed in absolute terms. Preliminary working standards should be obtained from the current toxicology literature. 5. Relative humidity should be in accordance with the ASHVE standards for comfort at 1 atmosphere. These values should be confirmed by simulation of the at- mospheric conditions, including ventilation, composition, and pressure which are finally selected. 6. Temperature should be adjusted to the thermal comfort zone determined by studies with simulation of the chosen atmosphere. Some range of adjustment of temperature should be under the control of the crew. 7. Air processing rate must be adequate to maintain the specified atmospheric composition. The distribu- tion of air flow throughout the environment must be such as to assure bodily comfort. Space Suits 1. From the point of view of the primary function of the ORL, suits should be considered only as emer- gency devices. A \"shirtsleeve\" environment is con- sidered essential for the performance of the primary mission. 2. Suit requirements which are laid down by other operational aspects of the ORL program, e.g., reentry or extravehicular maneuvering, should be made com- patible, if possible, with the secondary use of the suit to meet emergency conditions. Ground-Based Experiments Prior to Launching the ORL Pulmonary Atelectasis Problem It has been demonstrated by Rahn and others that the susceptibility to pulmonary atelectasis is increased when pure or practically pure oxygen is breathed. Apparently this susceptibility increases in inverse pro- portion to the atmospheric pressure and in direct pro- portion to the metabolic rate. For instance, it is esti- mated that lung collapse would occur in approximately 70 seconds if a man with a normal metabolic rate breathing oxygen at a total atmospheric pressure of 3 psi were to hold his breath for 90 seconds. If his metabolic rate were greatly increased by strenuous effort, such a phenomenon could occur inadvertently if the individual closed his glottis during a period of maximal muscular effort lasting less than 30 seconds. Furthermore, evidence from centrifuge studies indi- cates that atelectasis occurs during exposure to levels of acceleration encountered in the launch and reentry phases of space flight. Theoretically, it would be ex- pected that susceptibility to atelectasis would be in- creased when oxygen was breathed simultaneously, particularly under reduced pressure. It is a matter of record that atelectasis has been demonstrated roent- genographically after exposures to acceleration while breathing 0, both in aircraft and in the centrifuge (refs. 11, 23). The incidence and degree of atelec- tasis detected after such exposure was increased when antiblackout suits were used. (ref. 11) Proposal Experiments designed to elucidate the mechanism of this occurrence of atelectasis and the associated pulmonary arterial venous shunts (ref. 23) during exposure to acceleration should be carried out and the relationship of the susceptibility to these pulmonary derangements to the pressure and composition of the gas mixture being breathed should be delineated. Oxidative Hemolysis Certain data suggest that shortened red cell life span may be induced by chronic exposure of man to oxygen tensions above normal. To date, there have been no experiments directed specifically toward elucidation of this phenomenon. What is known suggests that the hemolytic process is mild, self-limited and achieves a steady state within 7-14 days. Strong analogies exist with G6PD deficient red cell hemolysis in these and other respects. It is recommended that this phenomenon be investi- gated in ground-based experiments to (1) determine the time-concentration relationships which may effect red cell life span shortening, (2) insofar as possible, determine individual differences in susceptibility, and (3) develop an in vitro predictive test of this sus- ceptibility . These studies should be carefully controlled for blood loss, blood sampling, and change in red cell (. PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 15 - mass, blood volume, and red cell life span. Studies of pigment metabolism, erythropoietic response and iron metabolism are of secondary, but substantial, interest. If possible, experiments should be run long enough to involve a complete turnover of the It is probable that the hemolytic state which may accompany high oxygen tensions is not a serious en- vironmental hazard. Nevertheless, elucidation of this phenomenon is deemed important in order to be sure of its magnitude as a hazard and as a basis for inter- pretation of other experiments on board an ORL which might b;: af3ected by the occurrence of hemolysis. Effect of Atmosphere Composition on Hazards of Dysbarism red cell pass. Essential to the establishment of firm life support criteria for atmosphere selection are further ground- based studies to clarify the potential incidence of dysbarism following either premeditated operational or emergency decompressions to the 3.5 psi (absolute) pressure suit atmosphere. Most critically needed are experiments on men decompressed to the 3.5-psi atmosphere following varying periods of equilibra- tion to approximately a 7S-psi atmosphere, MOOJO 0% and 60% N2. The goal is to develop the relation of incidence of dysbarism vs time of equilibration at operationally important atmospheres and to determine what equilibration time is needed to reduce essen- tially to zero the probability of a dysbaric event. Secondly, when dysbarism occurs under these experis mental circumstances, the efficacy of simple recompres- sion to the original intravehicular atmosphere should be evaluated as a countermeasure. In addition, once the detailed atmosphere pressure and composition history of any mission is determined, consideration should be given to experiments tailored to the specific mission in order to establish firmly the dysbarism hazard for that mission. Research and Development Prior to Launching the ORL Flammability in Various Atmospheres Atmospheres which support life may introduce a fire hazard. Research is necessary to determine the extent of risk with various combinations of inert gas with oxygen in the pressure range of 3.5 psi to 14.7 psi. Since gravity dependent factors are involved in fire, the critical tests will necessarily require valida- tion in the weightless state. These are engineering tests rather than biomedical, but they are essential for certain decisions concern- ing atmosphere. Further studies of materials with primary interest in vapors and flammability are important. References 1. Ader, H. F.: Dysbarism. USAF school of Aviation Med., unpub. rept., 1950. 2.

The diet should be as simple as possible with emphasis on maximum use of natural foods which will provide balanced nutritional compo- nents, and which is either in a liquid formula form or one which can be readily reconstituted into a semiliquid or a liquid form to be con- sumed in space. A formula diet is required for accurate estimation of intake and to provide adequate measurements for any balance studies. Natural foods will assure balance of amino acid components and micronutrients. 2. For purposes of planning a schedule of activity for a 24-hour day is suggested as follows: Activity hours Sleep 8 Exercise 2 Rest and Relaxation 4 Eating 2 Work Program 8 This is an estimated schedule to evaluate activity for purposes of calculation of energy requirements and to maintain physical fitness. man, the following caloric requirements are thought reasonable: Sleeping ........... 70 cal/hr or 280 Btu/hr Eating ........... 1.5 X basal or 420 Btu/hr Exercise .......... 2.5 X basal or 700 Btu/hr Rest and Relaxation. 1.5 X basal or 420 Btu/hr Work Program : Flight Control .... 2 X basal or 560 Btu/hr or Repair ............... 2.04.0 X basal or In a suited environment 560-700 Btu/hr 420-700 Btu/hr 560-1120 Eating 50 Exercise 50 R&R 50 Work 50 e PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 17 For extravehicular work, a mean rate of 2000 Btu/hr may be required. This level of expen- diture is possible for only limited period of time. These figures presented for panel refer- ence are the best available. 4. The dietary component should consist of natu- ral foods of low fiber and low laxative nature. No adjustment of bacterial flora should be attempted. bowel activity aad to avoid alterations in micro- nutrient production by normal bacterial flora. 5. The administration of diet should be by liquid or liquid reconstitution with coded cubes which are preweighed to facilitate adequate recording of food intake for purposes of balance studies. 6. An oral exercise medium such as a gum or other suitable device should be provided for oral hy- giene purposes. This is especially necessary if liquid formula diets are to be used. Tf?k ranmend2tinn is zi!3e:d at X32iziaizir.g 7. Composition of the diet should be as follows: k High quality protein 12.5 Carbohydrate 52.5 to 57.5 Fat 35 This ratio will be used to provide 27053200 cal/day (10,800-12,800 Btu/day) with an RQ at 0.8 to maintain a CO, 0, ratio which would spare the CO, scrubbing requirements of the environmental control system. 8. The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat in the diet will be dependent upon the conditions of preservation of diet during the flight pro- gram and the method chosen for reconstitution of the diet for feeding in space. Because of their lower melting point, poly- unsaturated fats lend themselves to easy recon- stitution for use in space. 9. Recommendations concerning mineral and vita- min requirements are as follows: Calcium-O.8 gram/day Phosphate-1.2 to 1.5 grams/day Sodium as NaCl for individuals who are ac- climatized to the environment-4.f to 5 grams/day For those not acclimatized, add 1 gram of sodium as NaCl for each liter of water con- sumed per day over 4 liters. This figure is tentative, and the suggestion is made that in view of the possibility of adrenal stress, the potential use of 10-15 grams of sodium chloride per day be considered; a corre- sponding reduction of potassium to ap- proximately 1 gram/day might serve as a protective device for the adrenal glands. Accordingly, the water intake may need to be increased to 4 liters or more per day. This would also be useful for maintenance of heat b2x,ce. Vitamin D-1000 units/day Other vitamins-In flights of under 2 weeks there should be no vitamin problem, but for extended flights the use of a standard minimum daily requirement type of poly- vitamin preparation in no greater quantity than the minimum daily requirement as rec- ommended by the NAS-NRC (Nat. &ad. of Science-Nat. Research Council) is ad- vocated. The one exception to the above is ascorbic acid with consideration for use of as much as 150 mg/day to compensate for the stress of flight. Minerals-Trace mineral supplements are strongly advocated if food used is proc- essed by chelation. This is one of the strong reasons for the recommendation for the maximum use of natural foods. Water-2.5 liters/day (1 cc/calorie of food). Water intake should be sufiicient to main- tain the urine at a specific gravity of 1.015 or less or a volume of at least 1 to 1.5 liters/day to avoid the development of uri- nary gravel. Water should be consumed in definite quantities on a programmed sched- ule. Daily measurements of body mass should be used to adjust water intake. These estimates are based upon the best available in- formation regarding nutritional requirements. 10. Because of power, weight, and volume require- ments, recycling of water is not considered prac- tical for flights of less than 30-day duration, but it should be considered for flights in excess of that period of time. Water sources for reclaim- ing include metabolic water and that produced by the fuel cells. The recycling of urine is con- sidered to be costly in both energy and volume- weight requirements. Ion-exchange or milli- pore filters appear to be simple devices for re- 18 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY claiming metabolic and fuel cell water and con- verting them to a potable supply. Metabolic water can be reclaimed easily for hygienic use. This recommendation is based upon presently available engineering estimates. 11. On each voiding, the total volume of urine must be accurately recorded and an aliquot separated for study. Aliquots according to aeromedical requirements can probably be stored in the walls of the cabin to provide additional radiation shielding until they are returned for analysis. Cryogenic preservation is recommended. Any meaningful study of metabolic activity is depend- ent on accurate measurements of urine components. Adequate preservation is required to prevent loss of labile chemical constituents. 12. To reduce the quantity of fecal material, a low residue diet is recommended. Samples should be collected, adequately identified, and stored in sealed containers for analysis (as with the urine). Desiccation and cryogenic storage, utilizing the conditions of space, might well be employed to facilitate this program. It should be borne in mind with reference to the storage of feces that drying without either freezing or sterilization may well introduce the danger of bacterial con- tamination of the atmosphere. 13. From the standpoint of metabolic considerations, medical selection for the ORL program should attempt to rule out those who have a tendency toward nephrolithiasis. It is also important to record any food intolerances and idiosyncrasies of flight crew candidates. To minimize medical problems of space Bight, all fac- tors which would predispose a medical problem should be screened carefully. Research and Development Prior to Lazlnching the ORL 1. A study of nutritional acceptability and palata- bility for extended periods of such potential foods as algae, reconstituted liquid or semi- liquid diets of natural products should be made. It is recommended that an investigation be made as to the possibility of exteflding a natural diet by means of a concentrated, high-density, syn- thetic diet which can be consumed periodically during the flight program. As it may be necessary in extended flights to use high caloric density foods, preliminary data are required to . assess the potential use of such food sources. 2. Continued work in the field of food packaging to enable the accurate measurement of intake of food constituents is important. Any metabolic experiment depends on accurate meas- urement of food components consumed in the daily diet. 3. Continued development of improved urine and fecal collection devices to improve both meta- bolic balance studies as well as improving sani- tation for the pilot is necessary. 4. Further research and development on the recy- cling of water, with purification to acceptable standards of potability for human use, should be made. For extended space flight the conservation of any water supply may be essential. Ground-Based Experiments and Flight Crew Training Prior to Launching the ORL 1. The study of calcium metabolism at various phases of training under various conditions dur- ing preflight to establish baseline levels for each potential astronaut is recommended. Each man must serve as his own control in addition to furnishing data for statistical evaluation of space flight. 2. Extensive training in the handling of special foods, containers and reconstitution techniques during the flight training program as well as familiarization with the taste and digestive prob- lems associated with special foods should be provided. Preflight orientation will minimize inflight problems. 3. A study of the effects of centrifuge simulation of the flight launch profile on the antidiuretic hor- mone activity and other urinary secretion con- trol factors to provide parameters for compari- son with both 1 G and zero G observation should be made. Adequate ground based experiments are required to assess the effects of gravity on urinary secretion mecha- nisms. 4. The preconditioning of the ORL crew members to a low caloric intake is recommended, and body fat stores should be normalized prior to flight. Metabolic studies to determine the caloric cost of activity should also be done. PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 19 + In the event there is a space and weight limitation on the food available, conditioning programs are necessary. Space Flight Experiments Prior to Launcbing the ORL 1. To fly an animal metabolic cage to determine the effect of weightlessness on metabolism (by means of oxygen consumption and carbon diox- ide output determination), on H20 balance, and calcium balance. The effects of weightlessness on peristalsis and muscle deterioration are also in need of exploration by means of animal flights. This is an endorsement of the Biostat program to en- courage updating as soon as possible. 2. The determination of ADH activity during manned space flights by means of urinary assays. This determination relates not only to fluid re- quirements, per se, under weightless conditions, but also to blood volume and cardiovascular ef- fects of weightless flight. References 1.

LIVING CONDITIONS RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations are given on the basis of clinical judgment and experience. Life Support Factors Body Functions and Hygiene 1. A high standard of personal appearance, dress, and tidiness of the cabin must be maintained. 2. A means of nonaqueous body hygiene should be available. The use of an oil for cleansing the skin may be desirable. Droplet contamination of the at- mosphere by the cleansing material is to be carefully avoided. 3. The control of body odors is imperative. 4. Shaving should be by mechanical razor (spring- wound or turbo-driven). An electric razor should be used if the atmosphere provided does not impose the danger of spark-induced fire. 5. Haircutting and nail paring should be done by methods which avoid particulate contamination of the atmosphere. 6. A laundry facility or substitute, such as an ade- quate supply of disposable clothing, must be pro- vided. This area is in need of investigation. Decor and Illumination 1. The decor and illumination should be chosen not only for its present effect but should be such as to provide visual orientation as well. In the case of a rotating spacecraft (for artificial G) this should in- clude indication of the direction of the centripetal force and direction of rotation of the spacecraft. 2. Recommendations for the illumination of wall surfaces, colors, and design of lighting are offered in references Morgan, C. T., 1963, Meaker, P., 1955, and General Electric Company, 1960. 3. Recommendations for the illumination of displays are offered in Morgan, C. T., 1963, pages 78 to 122. Here it must be borne in mind that the contrast be- tween display light and background light is impor- tant. Special cases meriting consideration are the following: (1 ) the light required for a visual warn- ing, (2) moving types of displays, and (3) visual displays requiring dark adaptation, i.e., radar dis- plays, etc. General Conveniences and Diversions 1. Ground-based radio and TV should provide the crew with periodic (daily) broadcasts of news and special events as well as personal messages. 2. Facilities for diversion should be available. These might include a small microfilm library, a TV or radio for use when orbital position permits, and a source of music such as a tape recorder. Personal earphones will permit the use of these without dis- turbance of other crew members. 20 MEDiCAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY 3. Each crew member might be given a certain weight and volume allowance for recreational mate- rials such as playing cards and other games. Game equipment will have to be designed for the gravity- free state. Early ground experience with flight crews working together would lead to joint selection of these materials. Schedules ( Work-Rest-Sleep Cycles) 1. A work-rest-skep (W-R-S) cycle of 24-hour du- ration is the most suitable schedule. An 8-hour on and 16-hour off schedule is recommended. If the crew is large enough, the possibility of setting up two teams operating twelve hours out of cycle may provide a regular individual schedule yet round-the- clock hours for crew duties and maximum utilization of the facilities. Man is fairly well accustomed to a sleep-wakefulness cycle of 24-hour duration. He has diurnal variations in both performance and physiological functioning which are adapted to this rhythm. When an atypical cycle is imposed, his physiological rhythms may be expected to show some adap- tation to the non-24-hour periodicity, but the adaptation is not likely to be complete nor to be equal for all individuals. 2. Should limitations on crew size and operational constraints require the imposition of a non-24-hour work-rest-sleep cycle, the consistent day-to-day ad- herence to a stable W-R-S cycle is recommended. The maintenance of a stable W-R-S cycle (as indicated by a superimposable body temperature curve peaking during wakefulness, and dropping during sleep) serves a dual pur- pose: (1) it makes for alertness and efficiency during work- ing hours and (2) it insures an easy onset of sleep. 3. A review of existing literature seems to indicate that where \"watches\" are required, individuals ad- just more favorably in groups where a 4-hour on and 4-hour off schedule is used than those where other schedules are used. Work-rest-sleep cycle total durations based on 12-hour (Mills, 1950; Mills and Stanbury, 1951), 8-hour (Stein- kamp, et al, 1959), and 6-hour (Adams, et al, 1961) time periods have all been studied extensively. These studies favor the above statement. The most common division of standing watch, used in the United States submarine fleet, is the 4-hour on and 8-hour off schedule, which is in operation on an artificial 12-hour cycle. Reports in the literature indicate that while the du- ties of a submariner may be satisfactorily carried out on such a schedule, efforts to establish a 12-hour physiological rhythm in man have been uniformly unsuccessful on sub- jective, biochemical, and hematological bases. (refs. 9, 10, 5) 4. Thought should be given to the type of duty * scheduled during the wakefulness period regardless of the W-R-S cycle used. Kleitman (1962) has reported that efficiency of perform- ance during a normal 24-hour cycle varies rhythmically throughout the course of the day. Efficiency was low upon arising, showed an initial ascent phase, a plateau in the middle of the day, and a terminal descent phase. Viaud ( 1945, 1947) has noted that performance immediately upon getting up from a period of sleep was often poorer than it was just before retiring. Kleitman, in tests with very small numbers of subjects on a 4-hour on, 4-hour off sched- ule, reported a \"very low\" capacity for work during the 4-hour interval separating the two sleep periods. Husband (1935) has reported similar findings using a 3-hour sleep, 3-hour awake cycle. 5. If an atypical schedule is to be used, it is recom- mended that preflight presynchronization periods be employed to provide for crew adaptation. 6. Preflight presynchronitation should be accom- plished in accordance with the ability of each indi- vidual member of the crew to adapt (those who adapt least well should be kept close to their typical schedule). 7. Where synchronization is found to be difficult, sedative and stimulant drugs may be used as an aid. Since this method is generally considered undesirable, it should be used only if the rapid adaptation of a particular individual is highly important and very difficult. 8. Local adaptation to an atypical cycle can be accom- plished by new crew members as they arrive aboard the ORL if they are not required to go on duty im- mediately upon arrival. Volume (Space) Requirements 1. As a minimal requirement for a +month mission there should be sufficient space for arms outstretched plus 1 foot, and the \"ceiling\" should be 1 foot higher than the astronaut's head. 2. Insofar as space is available, areas for on-duty ac- tivities and relaxation should be separate.. An area of privacy away from the others must be provided in- dividual crew members. 3. As space available is increased, assuming a step- wise approach to progressively larger orbiting labora- tories, more normal room proportions should be achieved and space provided for exercise and group activities such as a \"ward room.\" I PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 21 Research and Development Prior to Launching the ORL 1.

GROUP INTEGRITY RECOMMENDATIONS Life Support Factors Although group integrity presupposes individual in- tegrity, especially in those activities involving all members of the group, competent and well-moti- vated individuals do not always form a cohesive, harmonious, and efficient group. Further, initially well-organized groups can deteriorate with time, as G~~~~ integrity implies efficient and harmonious group functioning. In the context of space explo- ration it implies two or more astronauts working together, living together, and depending on each other for the efficient execution of the space mission. s PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS continued stresses lower the anxiety and frustration tolerance levels of the weakest members. This re- port, then, will consider the problems and methods involved in obtaining and maintaining group integ- rity. It will ah concern itself with the factors re- lated to individual integrity and efiiciency insofar as these are related to harmonious group functioning. However, it must be borne in mind that many con- siderations of individual functional integrity remain. These prablems have been well-studied in the past and are documented in available sources. These considerations are not dealt with in detail in the text, but references are appended. With the forthcoming multicrea-men program, new problems emerge which were not present or planned for in the one-man missions. Group inter- actions, involving added adjustments and integration of effort, create new situations needing evaluation as to their effect upon the success of the mission. An additional vector, one which may well compound the problems involved in group interaction, is the ex- tended time required for the completion of the mis- sion. These factors, extended time and group inter- action, pose questions quite different in character from those encountered in the one-man, short-dura- tion flight. The effects of these two new variables upon the selection, training, and in-flight aspects of the program must be considered. Selection Any negative effects of group interaction prob- ably will not play a significant role in the currently planned two-week duration missions, In the first place, considerable attention has been paid to the emotional stability and adjustment capability of the candidates in the current selection process. Sec- ondly, the excellent motivation and morale of the astronauts would minimize any tendencies toward group disintegration on a short mission. Finally, the mission will include relatively intense activity sched- ules wherein the crewmen will be involved primarily in task-oriented, rather than interpersonal-oriented behavior. This report, therefore, is directed toward extended mission requirements such as are pertinent to the ORL or lunar-based missions. Recommendations 1. Expand the present psychological selection test battery to include tests and techniques which will 23 evaluate candidate potential for positive group inter- action. Areas of interest and need include: a. group efficiency measured both in terms of group output and each individual's contribution to the team effort, b. adaptation of the individual to group stresses, c. flexibility of adjustment of an individual to different groups, d. adaptation of the group, as a group. to the stresses of confinement, environmental and social monotony, and basic anxiety and frustration over an extended time period, e. deterioration of morale and group efficiency over time under the continued stresses of extended space flight, and f. leadership potential and decision making ability. The additional dimension of group interaction over extended time periods under confining and frustrating conditions in- troduces additional complexities which may contribute di- rectly to mission success. As a specific instance, locomo- tion and control of intracapsule objects under conditions of weightlessness will involve a learning experience which can- not be simulated or practiced to any extended degree before the mission and thus may engender a degree of annoyance and hostility, especially in the early mission phases. 2. Introduce into the selection battery a series of psychological measures which have been demon- strated to be sensitive to temporary or long-stand- ing impairment of cerebral functions. During the last 20 years a considerable number of tests have shown excellent validity for this purpose. Spe- cifically, the Category Test and Tactual Performance Test (Halstead), (refs. 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 22), various tests of rhythm and sound discrimina- tion and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Milner), (refs. 11-14), the Continuous Performance Test (Rowold), (ref. 23), the Psychomet apparatus (Birren), (ref. I), and the Trail-Making Test and the Picture Arrangement, Block Design, and Digit Symbol tests of the Wechsler Scale (Reitan), (refs. 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 18, 19, 20, 21), should be studied with regard to their contributions to a core-battery. The inclusion of the evaluation of \"those abilities yhich are specifically related to ceiebial functions which are par- ticularly susceptible to variations\" will provide for the sys- tematic collection of data which may prove highly significant in (a) the assignment of crewmen to future missions and (b) the selection of future astronauts. The selection data collection plan should include consideration of the ability to conduct in-flight evaluations which will yield data di- rectly comparable with preflight information. The purpose 24 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY of this recommendation is to complete a systematically de- signed matrix of information on cerebral functions. Findings to date suggest that the higher mental functions (excluding primary sensory and motor functions) group themselves into the areas of: (1) concept formation or ab- straction abilities, (2) visuo-spatial and temporal patterns of organization, and (3) language and related symbolic rep- resentations for communications purposes. The corre- sponding regional areas of the cerebral hemispheres, in which intactness of function appears necessary for mainte- nance of the above abilities are, respectively: (a) one or both frontal lobes, (b) the right temporo-parieto-occipital area, and (c) the left temporo-parieto-occipital area (and probably including the posterior-inferior left frontal area). Other aspects of higher mental functions (4) perceptual awareness and (5) the ability to sustain high levels of vig- ilance over fairly extended time periods appear to be related morphologically to (d) overall, general cerebral function- ing rather than to specific areas of the brain. Classification of the tests into the above psychological functions (1 through 5) and the corresponding regional or general areas of cerebral functions (a through d) would best be stated in a preliminary fashion as follows: Function 1-Halstead Category Test, Trail-Making Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; Function 2-Milner's tests of rhythm and sound discrimination as perceived through the left ear, the Picture Arrangement and Block Design subtests from the Wechsler Scale, the Tactual Performance Test score with the left hand, and comparatively poor performance on Part A as compared with Part B of the Trail-Making Test; Func- tion 3-Milner's tests of rhythm and sound discrimination as perceived through the right ear, comparatively poor per- formance on Part B as compared with Part A of the Trail- Making Test, and possible analysis of the inflight verbal communications of the astronauts for indications of deterio- ration of language functions; and Functions 4 and 5-Ros- vold's Continuous Performance Test, the Psychomet appa- ratus, and the Digit Symbol Test of the Wechsler Scale. Although real-time data are not currently envisioned as necessary, provision for telemetering of data should be in- cluded to avoid loss of inflight data points in the event of landing malfunction. Training As a general principle, the training of astronauts should provide an opportunity for extending and supplementing the selection procedure. This is an endorsement of the current concept that the training program is actually a \"selection-in-depth\" process. In particular, when group interactions within the crews during the latter phases of the training become well enough established, the data could be very use- ful in the final selection of compatible and efficient crews for a particular mission. In addition to the training required to prepare for and complete a successful mission, training tasks should include a number of basic psychophysiolog- ' ical activities which would sample sensory, percep- tual, sensory-motor, learning, and thought and deci- sion processes which underlie ordinary human behavior. These data would provide essential base- lines for the evaluation of in-flight performance and for the analysis of possible change due to extended flight experience. Recommendations 1. a. During the training procedures, special atten- tion should be directed to identify those individuals whose behavior and performance reduce group effi- ciency. Specific interactions between two or more members bringing about deterioration of group per- formance should also provide criteria for proper as- signment of crew members. The above recommen- dations could be more easily implemented if \"good\" and \"poor\" crews, representing the extremes of effi- ciency, were subjected to careful psychological analy- sis. b. The crews in training should be systematically re- constituted in order to (1 ) test hypotheses regard- ing crew efficiency, (2) promote flexibility and adaptability in group interactions, and (3) meet the possible contingency of a last-minute replacement of a crew member for an actual flight. With the anticipation of multiman crews numbering four or more members, it will be virtually impossible to \"scrub\" an entire crew in the event that one member is unable to participate in the flight mission. It therefore becomes im- portant to determine the effect of crewman substitution on the morale and efficiency of the basic crew. This recom- mendation is applicable to prerequisite R&D work and ground-based experimentation (discussed under those sec- tions) and also to the systematic manipulation of astronaut crew members into different groups during their training experiences. 2. Ideally an actual mission should be preceded by a simulated flight of intense realism and of equal duration with astronauts as crew members. This procedure would serve as an analogue of the \"shake- down\" cruise and would provide a realistic basis for devel- oping appropriate countermeasures for possible failures in equipment or crew integrity. It is recognized that the prac- ticality of this recommendation is problematical, also the predictive values of simulated missions are yet to be estab- lished. Meanwhile, this recommendation will serve to (I ) provide the most adequate substitute for the in-flight situa- tion, and (2) provide the basis for validating the simulation by means of the in-flight mission itself. If the ideal situa- tion is impossible, it is recommended that the simulation . PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS ~ 25 be completed with as many mission similarities as are practical. The use of astronauts in the simulated mission would make possible direct inferences to the astronaut population. he- ficial but less valuable results would be obtained from \"astro- naut-like\" crew members. The value and pertinence of data from simulations with non-astronaut-like crew members, e.g., college students, etc., are highly questionable. The same type of thinking applies to simulation itself. The more realistic the simulation, the greater is the applicability of the data to the space flight situation. 3. At selected intervals during the training period, sensory and perceptual functions, sensory-motor and learning activities, and higher thought and decision processes should be tested to provide individual base- lines of performance for each astronaut. More specifically there should be tests of visual and audi- tory acuity, near and far depth perception, motor coordina- tion, speed and dexterity (gross and fine), visual form and motion discrimination, temporal orientation and dixrimi- nation, kinesthesis and appreciation of body/limb position- ing and interaction. vigilance, span of attention, continuous digit span, speech production and perception, pdlem solv- ing (numerical and verbal), and logical analysis. In large part, the functions measured by these tests are related to the problems of maneuvering in a weightless environment and to the problems of \"docking\" and so have a decidedly practical orientation. Many of the tests involve standard test equip- ment (of the Republic and North American Aviation re- ports, 24-25); others need no special equipment, as in the case of evaluating speed of \"suiting,\" quality of writing, and intelligibility of speech. The apparatus tests should be packaged into a Behavior Reaction Panel to conserve space and permit automatic recording. Since these functions will be utilized in space, both within the capsule environment and outside the capsule, they need to be evaluated periodically throughout an extended space mission. Theoretical and practical considerations demand such a program. From a theoretical viewpoint it would be extremely important to know whether weightlessness has an effect on any of these functions. (Simulation would con- trol for confinement, monotony, and group interaction ef- fects on those functions). Practical considerations require that these functions be under continuous surveillance to as- sure integrity during the course of the mission. Post-testing on these same functions would provide an overall estimate of the changes induced by the entire mission. Retesting at intervals during the training period not only provides a more stable baseline but yields an estimate of expected variability within each function. Research and Development Prior to Launching the ORL Much information concerning the influence of variables encountered in space can be determined by performing ground-based experiments. With the exception of the effects of weightlessness and the actual psychological stress of space flight, both as single and as interacting variables, all of the known perttioent variables of inmediate concern can be in- vestigated as to their effects on the astronaut. Par- ticularly, it would appear that most of the variables of interest in the selection process associated with preserving group integrity under a variety of expo- sues to both physical and psychological space fac- tors are amenable to ground-based experimentation and identification. Once these variables have been identified, then appropriate tests can be either se- lected or developed to identify the desirable and undesirable factors in the astronauts and selection made accordingly. 1. Expand psychological test battery to include tests and techniques which will evaluate candidate poten- tial for positive group interaction. Develop pnxe- dures (tests, ratings, etc.) to evaluate: a. group efficiency, b. adaptation to group stresses, c. flexibility to adjustment within different groups, d. deterioration of morale and group efficiency over time, and e. leadership potential and decision making ability. No tests or valid measures of the variables of interest here have been standardized. Test construction and validation is time consuming and must be started without delay. With- out such tests, no measurement in the areas of interest will be available, and then not only the selection process but the comparison methods of training will be handicapped. 2. Introduce into the selection battery psychological measures which have been demonstrated to be sensi- tive to temporary or long-standing impairment of cerebral functioning. Develop instruments and/or test procedures to make in-flight measurements of cerebral deficit or deterioration which are directly comparable to ground-based measurements. Category Test and Tactual Performance Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Continuous Performance Test, Psycho- met apparatus, Trail-Makmg Test, and Picture Arrangement, Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests of @e Wechsler scale, miniaturized EEG and Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) equipment are recommended for initial consideration. 3. During training procedures, special attention should be directed to identify those individuals whose behavior and performance reduce group e&- ciency. Develop a program to identify which spe- cific crew characteristics serve as criteria for \"good\" 26 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY and \"poor\" crews (the extremes of efficiency in performance). 4. At selected intervals during the training period, sensory and perceptual functions, sensory-motor and learning activities, and higher thought and decision processes should be tested to provide individual base- lines of performance for each astronaut. Many of the tests for the various sensory, perceptual, and higher thought processes are described in the North American and the Republic Aviation reports. These should be evaluated for reliability and repeatability and, where necessary, revised for adequacy and feasi- bility. Many psychomotor tests and most tests of higher mental ability which are presently available are not designed for repeated valid administration. The need for repetition of the tests over an extended time period will be necessary in the in-flight evaluation of astronaut performance. In ad- dition, preflight and postflight performances will need evalu- ation. This problem (repeated measurement) requires re- search for the development of appropriate tests, multiform if necessary. Ground-Based Experiments Prior to Launching the ORL 1. Selected tests to measure cerebral functioning. a. Conduct an evaluation program on tests or tech- niques which will detect even a slight trend to- ward cerebral impairment as a result of psychological concomitants of confinement as well as physiological changes, which is designed to: (1) establish sensitivity of tests to space capsule conditions, and (2) collect normative data under these conditions. With the systematic variation of such conditions as (1) confinement and monotony, (2) time, (3) atmosphere com- position, (4) atmospheric pressure, (5) contaminant level, and (6) other variables representing a threat to crew and individual integrity, these objectives can be met. Such tests will aid in the selection of crews with high tol- erance for changes in environmental space variables and will, under repeated administration, permit in-flight evaluation of changes in the astronauts' physiological and psychological integrity. The test developed in response to the above recommenda- tions must be capable of repeated valid administration. Fur- ther, the data yielded by the tests must + capable of imme- diate evaluation so that their usefulness in early detection will permit immediate remedial measures to be initiated. b. Utilize any space and time facilities in other ear- lier manned experiments. c. Develop flight-type instrumentation with which to make in-flight measurements directly comparable * to measurements secured during ground-based exper- iments. Through such measurements, it will be possible to compare the astronaut in flight with his baseline as secured on earth. Further, experiments performed on earth will have the po- tential of transposability and generalization of results to the in-flight situation. 2. Conduct simulations of specified missions manned with astronauts or astronaut-like crew members for durations equal to mission time. Measurements re- lated to human reliability regarding flight control and allied mission tasks should be made. Also of prime importance are measurements regarding the nature of group dynamics and the effects which may be generated as a result of these interactions. In addition, the tests of the sensory, perceptual, and high mental processes should be conducted as they would on an extended space mission. Such simulated missions will provide full rather than part task training. The confinement variable plus the problems associated with group interaction can only be discovered prior to actual flight in such real, time-full task simulation. 3. Perform a habitability experiment which will an- swer the qeustions: a. What are the psychological effects of prolonged spatial confinement with its concomitant social restriction ? b. What are the psychological effects of restricted exercise ? c. What are the psychological effects of crowding? All of the variables can be investigated in an experiment where exercise, spatial confinement, and number of individu- als confined in a given-sized volume are the independent variables and performance on a battery of psychomotor tasks (as measured by a performance panel), critical flicker fu- sion, a form of the Categories Test, performance of opera- tional procedures, and measures of group and individual interaction are measured as dependent variables. As space flights continue, the time spent in such flights will increase. Because of engineering limitations, the space trav- elers will be faced with confinement to small spaces, re- stricted socially, crowded by other crew members, faced with a monotonous existence for long periods of time, and have reduced possibility for normal exercise. The effects of these variables on astronaut performance need to be understood. Space Flight Experiments Prior to Launching the ORL 1. The currently scheduled Gemini and Apollo mis- sions provide the opportunity to study (in retro- spect) the group interactions which may occur dur- PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS ing space flight. It is recommended that an appro- priate debriefing form be constructed to elicit this in- formation once the astronauts have completed their missions. The purpose of such a study would be to note : a. any atypical interpersonal behavior and to eval- uate its effects on group efficiency (positive or negative) b. any deviations in group efficiency and to deter- mine if ~~pica! kt~~~i~~iid !xh~v..;i~t SC- companied such changes. A distinct advantage of this procedure is that data from an actual flight mission will be available for evaluation. 2. Every opportunity should be exploited to utilize as many behavioral procedures as feasible during the Apollo flights. These need not be complex; for ex- ample, simple motor dexterity (e.g., tapping) need take little time and can be correlated with other si- multaneously monitored physiological indices (e.g., breathing, pulse rate, etc.) to study mobilization of effort under conditions of weightlessness. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

HAZARD RECOMMENDATIONS Life Support Factors Radiation (Electromagnetic Spectrum) In order to consider exposure limits to ionizing radiation, several assumptions must be made regard- ing the flight profile. It is assumed for the present that the Orbiting Research Laboratory will be at an altitude of about 200 to 300 nautical miles at a 30' inclination from the equator. This flight trajectory will be protected from solar flare events since it is within the confines of the earth's geomagnetic force field and avoids exposure at the polar region. The primary radiation hazard, therefore, will be princi- pally the electrons of nuclear fission origin that are encouraged at these flight altitudes. Traverse of the South Atlantic geomagnetic anomaly will cause sev- eral small radiation pulses to occur each day. A sec- ondary radiation hazard will be the primary cosmic radiations. Though dose rates from the latter will probably not exceed 0.5 rad/week, this cannot be easily modified. and will contain a significant por- tion of extremely high LET radiations. Since the biological effectiveness of these radiations is not thoroughly understood, continual surveillance for early damage to the eye and brain, for example, should be maintained. Extremely eccentric orbits that might cause brief traverse of high-energy proton fluxes probably will not occur. It has been indicated that an associated drop in perigee altitude would induce atmospheric drag to foreshorten the useful life time of the mission. It is additionally assumed that no effective means of prophylaxis and/or treatment of ionizing radia- tion injury will be available to the flight crew. Two exposure limits are given: (1) an allowable upper limit for prompt or brief exposures selected to avoid injury manifesta- tions (2) an allowable accumulated dose for a 1-year flight mission assuming a nearly constant, low, daily dose rate. It is extremely unlikely that the suggested exposure limits will be reached since the flight profile does not cause potentially hazardous ionizing radiation parameters to be presented. Should they be reached, however, recovery of the crew can probably be ac- complished within 24 hours. The expected time to recovery must be considered due to the varying la- tent periods for the diverse clinical manifestations of radiation injury. When time to recovery may be days to weeks, then the allowable exposure limits should be lowered. 1. Zonizing radiation: Upper limit dosage of 200 rad for a single exposure; 300 to 350 rad for accu- mulated exposure in a 1-year mission. These doses are based on present clinical experience and Group judgment relative to lens opacities. These are mini- mum cataractogenic doses (refs. 5, 11, 17). 2. 1Tltraviolet radiation spertrunz (14 to 400 mili- micron) : All wave lengths below 400 millimicrons should be screened out. (1 X 105 ergs/cm2/24 hr . PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 29 . or 0.0024 cal/an2/24 hr maximum tolerable for wavelengths of 220 to 320 miuirhicrons). These doses are based on present clinical and animal re- search experience and Group judgment relative to harmful photobiologic effects to the eye (refs. 6, 11, 19). 3. i'iJibie radiation specrnrm (400 to 780 mdlimi- cron): The range of 0.2 to 2.0 cal/cm*/sec should be considered the maximum. Retinal damage is unrelated, either quantitatively or quali- tatively, to any particular portion of the visible light wave- length band, but it depends merely on the concentration of energy incident in this region of the eye. The 0.2 to 2.0 cal/an*/sec limitation as the maximum allowable concentra- tion of visible spectrum radiation on the retina is also based on present clinical and research experience and Group judg- ment. 4. Infrared radidtim spectrum (0.78 to 6 micron): The maximum allowable concentration should be 0.2 to 2.0 cal/cm2/sec. At 0.8 micron, 78% of incident energy reaches the retina. At 1.5 micron, 20% of incident energy reaches the lens and 3% reaches the retina. At 3 micron and above, essentially all of the incident energy is absorbed by the cornea. How- ever, the band of greatest biological damage is from 0.8 to 1.2 microns. Because tissue damage is dependent on the concentration of energy absorbed by the portions of the eye upon which the infrared radiation is incident, criteria for maximum tolerable exposure of the retina should be essen- tially the same as that determined for the visible spectrum. In the absence of determinations for tolerable maximums of absorbed infrared radiation for the cornea, lens, and vit- reous, it is recommended on the basis of Group judgment that the same limitation be used for these tissues as defined for the visible spectrum incident on the retina, 0.2 to 2.0 cal/an*/sec (refs. 11, 16). 5. Radiofrequency radiation: The maximum allow- able exposure should be determined according to the following conditions which will modify significantly the effects of microwave radiation: a. the frequency or wavelength of the generating equipment b. the period of time of exposure in hours, min- utes, or seconds c. the irradiation cyde rate, referring to the indi- vidual ON-OFF periods during a unit time interval (1 min), when total time of irradia- tion per minute is kept constant d. air currents e. environmental temperature f. body weight, type, or mass and covering in re- lation to the exposed area g. orientation or position of an individual influ- encing resonant conditions and standing waves h. differences in sensitivity of organs and tissues i. effect of reflections (ref. 9) An exposure of 10 milliwatts/an* may produce dangerous tbnrnal effects under certain conditions (ref. 23). There is some evidence that microwave radiation is capable of in- ducing nonthermal effects as well (refs. 4, 15, 20). Skin 1. hizizg r~diztien: As a gmcid ccixideiztion, set the 1-year accumulated dose to the skin below 1000 rad at energies less than 100 keV. This dosage is selected on the basis of clinical experience for a single dose in radiation therapy (refs. 7, 25) : Erythema (hst-degree bum) 200 rad at energies less than 100 keV 400 rad at energies greater than 200 keV 500 rad at energies less than 100 keV Limit for higher energies automatically set by bone 2. Ultraviolet radiation: Wavelengths below 365 millimicrons (refs. 11, 24) should be screened out. Erythemal effect is produced by the wave band from 180 to 315 millimicrons with peak action in the region of 240 and 297 millimicrons. Tanning effect is produced by the wave band from 315 to 400 millimicrons. Antibacterial effect is produced by the wave band from 180 to 280 millimicrons with peak action at approximately 265 millimicrons. Anti- rachitic effect is produced by the wave band from 180 to 315 millimicrons by the production of Vitamin D in the skin; however, the minimum daily requirement is approximately one-tent!! the erythemal threshold. 3. Visible radiation spectrum: Essentially unexplored except in cases of photo-allergy ; other effects are not known. Therefore, in the opinion of the Group, no limitation criteria can be given. 4. Infrared radiation: The range from 0.2 to 2.0 cal/cm2/sec should be the limit. The band from 0.8 to 1.5 microns can penetrate to a depth of 3 cm if sufficient energy is involved. Penetration of n- diation with a wavelength above 6 microns is virtually nil. In the absence of determinations for tolerable maximums of absorbed infrared radiation for the skin, it is recommended on Group judgment that the same limitations be used for this tissue as defined for the cornea, 0.2 to 2.0 cal/anf/sec (refs. 11, 24). 5. Radiofrequency radiation: Observe the same rec- ommendations as those given for the eye. Bone Mawow Blistering (second-degree bum) marrow exposure limits. The ionizing radiation limits should be 150 rad as single exposure maximum and 300 rad as accu- 30 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY mulated exposure maximum in a 1-year time period. This dosage is selected on the basis of present human expe- rience (refs. 7, 25, 27). Testes The maximum tolerable limits for ionizing radia- tion are automatically set by those listed for skin and bone marrow. Gastrointestinal Tract The upper-limit for a single dose of ionizing radi- ation at the midline should be no greater than 100 rad. Any dose above 400 rad to the midline of the body is associated with a high probability of inducing nausea, vom- iting, and diarrhea with onset occurring within 4 hours of exposure. It is extremely difficult to establish a fixed limit below which the probability of gastrointestinal symptomatology will be nil since these manifestations of radiation injury are susceptible to individual variation, psychogenic factors, combined stresses, and radiation dose and dose rate. The exposure is set on the basis of present human experience (refs. 7, 25, 27). Ears The maximum noise level at the auricle should not exceed 85 decibels total average for all three bands of 300 to 600, 600 to 1200, and 1200 to 2400 cycles per second. Above this decibel level, ear noise guards should be worn (ref. 3). In the judgment of the Group, maximum prolonged noise level at the auricle within the spacecraft should not exceed 55 decibels because of associated hindrance to speed commu- nication. Atmospheric Contaminants Particulate Contamination 1. Size: It is recommended that no spicules larger than 50 microns in their longest diameter be allowed to remain in capsular atmosphere. This opinion is based on the clinical experience and judg- ment of the Group members. 2. Quantity: In the absence of determination for tol- erance maximums, it is the opinion of the Panel that the number of particulates per cubic meter should not exceed that which will induce ocular surface dis- comfort or pulmonary ciliary overload. An effort should be made to establish tolerance maximums for particles reasonably expected to become airborne in the spacecraft. 3. Quality: In the clinical judgment of the Group, the particles should be physiologically inert. The possibility of an \"inert\" particle absorbing or adsorbing a gas or vapor in concentrations sufficient to induce a toxic reaction should be evaluated. 4. General recommendations: Lint-free fabrics, non- flaking interior surface of capsule, scuff-proof shoe soles, and particle-retaining floor material should be used. If the proper precautions are taken before the flight, it prob- ably would not be necessary to monitor continuously the number and size of particles in the atmosphere. Gaseous Contamination Maximum acceptable or time-weighted mean con- centrations of exogenous toxic elements and com- pounds in the air for continuous (24 hours per day) exposure are not available for most toxic agents. Therefore, an effort should be made to establish such concentrations of the toxic agents most likely to be encountered in the atmosphere of the space- craft. Threshold limit values of some elements and compounds most likely to be present and to be possible sources of diffi- culty within the spacecraft chromium (as CrQ), 0.1 mg/cu m; copper (as fume), 0.1 mg/cu m; copper (as dust or mist), 1.0 mg/cu m; lead, 0.2 mg/cu m; mercury (inorganic), m; phosphorus (yellow), 0.1 mg/cu m; phosphorus (compounds), 1 to 3 mg/cu m ; zinc (oxide fume), 5 mg/cu m; carbon monoxide, 100 ppm; chlorine, 1 ppm; cyanide, 5 ppm; fluorine, 0.1 ppm; ozone, 0.1 ppm. Limits for other toxic agents which might be present in the atmosphere of the spacecraft also should be considered. Special consideration should be given to the fact that exposures will be to mixtures of several substances. Freon contamination should be com- pletely avoided (refs. 10, 14, 21, 26). In the opinion of the Group, all materials used in the capsule should be tested under simulated flight conditions for the presence of and the kinds of trapped gases and vola- tile materials as well as volatile deterioration products which may be physiologically active. Abnormal atmospheric con- ditions should be created with the compounds detected and tested for physiological effect. Additive or possibly syner- gistic activity of mixtures of compounds should be tested. Testing time for these contaminants should extend over a time period at least equal to that of the flight duration. 2. Aerosols and vapors: Based on its professional judgment, the Group recommends that, wherever practicable, no highly volatile chemical reagents or materials should be carried which could contaminate the atmosphere, e.g. : ammonia, HCI, alcohol, etc. . PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 31 3. Flatus: A diet should be selected that will pm- duce little or no gas. The volume of flatus reportedly varies from 500 ( k 5070) to 5000 (rt 50%) milliliters per 24 hours. The lower vol- ume is associated with a milk diet and the higher volume associated with a legume diet. The composition varies and generally consists of: Gas % co2 8 to 34 Methane Hydrogen iu'iirogru io io 64 0 to 56 (combustibles other than hydrogen) The higher percentage of combustible gases is associated with a legume diet (refs. 1, 2, 8, 13, 22). 4. General recommendations: The diet should be such that a minimum volume of flatus is produced from its ingestion. The atmospheric bitration sys- tem should be such that atmospheric contaminants are prevented from accumulating in the capsular atmosphere. Nutritional Contaminants Water 1. Insoluble contaminants: In the opinion of the Group, all abrasive contaminant materiafs such as particles (e.g. fiberglass) from the storage contain- ers or container wall degradation should be avoided. 2. Soluble contaminants: Based on its professional judgment, the Group recommends that ammonium, sodium chloride, potassium, and calcium salt con- centration combined should not exceed 100 parts per million. 3. Heavy metals, etc.: The maximum permissible concentration of various elements for potable water should be taken from U.S. Code, Title 42-Public Health, if listed therein (ref. 28). Examples of maximum recommended concentrations of ma- terials which might contaminate potable water in the space- craft arsenic, 0.01 mg/l.; lead, 0.05 mg/l.; and ffuoride, 1 mg/l. The limits for soluble salts of other metals such as antimony, beryllium, bismuth, mercury, and thallium should be in the order of I mg/l. (expressed as metal). Maximum values for other chemicals potentially present should be established. 4. Odoriferous contaminants: The concentration of such odoriferous materials as H,S or SO, should not exceed 10 ppm (ref. lo). 5. General recommendations: Supply anion-cation ion-exchange filter and activated charcoal filter for emergency use in case the water supply becomes contaminated so that condensate water may be used. A conductivity meter should be available for meter- ing the drinking water. Carboxylic acid soaps should be used for hygiene purposes to facilitate removal in the recycling process. Sulfonated deter- gents should be avoided. Food Food to be used in the capsule should not con- tain insecticides, other toxic elements, or microor- ganisms in excess of levels which are considered safe by the Food and Drug Administration (refs. 12, 18). Certain contaminants such as antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, cyanide, fluoride, lead, mercury, and thallium should be mentioned as po- tentially harmful in the spacecraft. A few milligrams of some of these agents ingested in a single dose or ingested repeatedly could cause toxic effects. It is extremely difficult to establish a safe maximum daily intake (expressed as mg/24 hrs) for these elements because the toxicity of each can vary many fold de- pending on the salt or compound ingested. Prevention and Control of Fire 1. Nonexplosive atmosphere. 2. All clothing should be flash- and fire-resistant. 3. No smoking and no open flame should be al- lowed in the capsule. 4. No readily combustible materials (e.g., matches) should be allowed onboard. 5. Explosion-proof circuitry throughout the capsule and wire insulation should be fire resistant. 6. Contact surfaces of the capsule interior, clothing, and shoes should be conductive so as to avoid static charge accumulation. 7. Capsule should be compartmentalized so that areas can be walled off by a fire-resistant curtain. 8. Astronaut shouid carry self-contained breathing apparatus with fire-resistant hood for emergency use in case of extensive fire so that the entire capsular atmosphere can be saturated with nitrogen and flushed overboard prior to replacement. Micrometeoroids Fire See Prevention and Control of Fire. Decompression The Group recommends developmental research and investigation to devise a sealant for capsule perforation. 32 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY Capsular Fragments (\"Shrapnel\") from Impact See Clinical Medical Support Panel report. Safety Contour Design of Capsule Interior and Exterior It is recommended by the Group that all sharp pro- jections be avoided in the design of the capsular interior and that no unanchored supplies or equip- ment be allowed to free-float in the interior of the capsule.

CLINICAL MEDICAL SUPPORT Life Support Factors Flight Crew Medical Selection The following recommendations are made for flight crew selection: 1. Since the avoidance of illness is best achieved by prevention, a rigorous program of selection should be set up. 2. In the selection process, every attempt should be made to bring to light a predisposition to both functional and organic illness which may inter- fere with in-flight performance. Among these are susceptibility to motion sickness, seizures, ab- normal behavior, functional bowel disturbance, allergies, migraine, Meniere's disease, gall blad- der colic, and kidney stones. 3. Excellent history taking is extremely important in this regard. The use of galvanic skin reflex apparatus in this activity is suggested in an at- tempt to validate the responses. Illness and Injury Among Crew Members 1. A physician is desirable as a crew member and essential in conducting physiological or medical experiments. In the absence of a physician aloft, one crew member should have medical experience in handling emergencies. 2. Illness of a short term or minor sort may be I treated aloft. Appropriate to the facilities and varied depending upon his medical background, the responsible crew member should be briefed regarding this prior to a mission. 3. A medical chest with drugs and supplies should be available for symptomatic treatment or spe- cific therapy of diseases likely to be encountered such as: a. respiratory illness b. urinary infections and stones c. gastrointestinal disturbances such as mucous colitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer, or diarrhea of infectious or other origin d. cardiac arrhythmias e. disturbed emotional state f. aspiration of foreign body g. minor trauma h. burns i. foreign body in the eye 4. Drugs used aloft should, if possible, have been tested in situations with similar atmospheric conditions. 5. A microfilm reader describing diagnosis and treatment of such disease would be especially important to include in the absence of a physi- cian for compiling data for transmission to a medical monitor on the ground. 6. The following suggestions are made with re- gard to the return of ill crew members to earth: a. minor or short term illness should remain aloft 34 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY b. serious illness should be returned to earth: (1 ) if something can be accomplished there (2) if the patient can withstand re- entry. The hazard of reentry should be balanced against the benefits to accrue. c. every attempt should be made to diagnose early and return to earth before a state de- velops that would prevent the trip. 7. In the design of the capsular interior, all sharp projections must be avoided and no unanchored supplies or equipment should be allowed to free- float in the interior of the capsule. 8. The danger of a shrapnel effect from microme- teoroid penetration should be investigated prior to flight. If the danger does exist, adequate pre- ventive measures must be developed. 9. If death occurs, the body should be returned immediately to earth or preserved for autopsy at a later date. Medical Safety Monitoring toring, see the Appendix at the end of Phase I. For detailed discussion of medical safety moni- Monitoririg of the Environmeizt* Cabin If the cabin is compartmentalized, these recom- mendations apply to all compartments. 1. Pressure (CD# and GT**): A fall in pres- sure below normal range should activate auditory and visual signals. 2. Wall temperature (CD and GT): Fire warning system to be decided. 3.

A \"sig- nificant\" deviation from the normal range should activate a visual signal to astronaut on watch. 4. Atmospheric contaminants (CD) 5. Circdation of air (CD): Failure should activate 6. Force environment (GT) a visual signal to astronaut on watch. 'Onboard intercommunication (voice and video) and maximal in- tercommunication spacecraft and ground station are assured. #CD: continuous onboard display. **GT: spacecraft to ground telemetry. 7. Radiation: a. Environment: Methods and location to be decided. b. Hazard: Solar flare warning system to be decided. Onboard as well as ground-based (refs. 1, 2, 9) detection facilities are re- quired inasmuch as ground-to-spacecraft com- munication will be intermittent. Suit The following recommendations are made for suit monitoring: 1. Inlet temperature, circulation, partial pressure oxygen, and carbon dioxide: Should be moni- tored and, within limits of feasibility, teleme- tered during launch and reentry. Decisions here are still to be made. 2. Relative humidity: Should be monitored but need not be telemetered. 3. Extravehicular circumstances: Methods to be decided. Monitoring Fitness of Astronauts The need for monitoring the nzedital and pro- fessional fitness of the astronaut during different stages of flight is discussed in the detailed report attached. On the principle that group safety takes precedence over individual safety, it is concluded that a launch abort cannot be justified on the basis of medical unfitness restricted to one astronaut; hence, monitoring physiological parameters during launch must be justified mainly on other grounds. It is further concluded that in orbital flight the big problem centers around the professional and medi- cal fitness of the astronaut for reentry. The impor- tance of taking advantage of \"naturally occurring opportunities\" aloft, including the use of the astro- naut as a \"biological sensor,\" is emphasized. It is assumed and advocated that one crew member will be a physician. For launch and reentry periods, see the detailed recommendations. The question of \"representa- tive\" monitoring of physiological parameters on one or two astronauts is still to be answered. (1 ) Daily evaluation and reporting of astronaut's fitness. (See suggested form in detailed report.) Emphasis is placed on the value of serial measure- ments as indicators of early trends (ref. 3). For the orbital period, there should be: - ~~ - . PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 35 . (2) Weekly evaluation (see form). A provocative test for physical fitness is emphasized. (3) Bimonthly evaluation (see form). A medical examination and provocative test of professional fit- ness is emphasized. Supporting Personnel It is suggested that one or more \"assistants\" be charged solely with the assignment for medical a plan and assigning values to stresses and proba- bility values to risks. This plan would undergo con- stant revision in terms of the great amount of new information becoming available and the changing requirements in terms of how safety monitoring in- terdigitates with plans dealing with other aspects of the mission.

Appendix to Phase I MEDICAL SAFETY MONITORING Medical safety monitoring is defined as the provi- sion of information throughout a mission to ensure, within an acceptable risk, the return of the astro- nauts in good health. In tackling the problem in advance of the final \"deadlines\" when all flight parameters are known and the latest flight experi- ence is available, it is important to reach agreement on the general concepts underlying safety monitor- ing in order to \"update\" tentative recommendations with the necessary facility. Accordingly, a limited analysis of the problem is outlined from which may be drawn certain generalities. Three important guidelines have been followed : (1) parameters of the flight insofar as they have been defined, including six months' exposure to weightlessness; (2) group safety takes precedence over safety of an individual; and (3) the safety in- formation coverage is for one flight with little or no regard for subsequent flights in the program. The analysis is considered from two related stand- points: (1) the astronaut at different stages of flight and (2) the classes of phenomena to be mon- itored and their relative significance. The astro- naut is at once a person with safety tolerance limits, an essential element in flight systems and operations, and an active or passive biological indicator. The three important stages of flight center around launch, orbit, and reentry. The Astronaut at Different Stages of Flight Launch Launch is further subdivided into three periods: Preparatory: During this period, vital serial base- line measurements on the astronauts are obtained for future comparison under resting, provocative testing, and simulated flight conditions. Countdown: Monitoring physiological parame- ters when it is still possible to delay takeoff and re- move the astronauts without risk requires different \"tolerance limits\" or standards than at later stages of flight. Power Phase (when frescape\" or \"abort\" entails a risk): At time of launch, the astronauts are demon- strably at peak fitness, and it is almost inconceivable that any diagnosis based on medical information ob- tained on an astronaut during this phase would jus- tify an abort with its conseqeunt risk to the entire group. Orbit In orbit, three periods might be defined: Transitional: Experience suggests that the transi- tional period will be well tolerated and that it will not last long. The astronauts should remain suited during the transitional period and until the Life Control Systems have been checked out. There- after, whether the astronaut on watch should remain suited to cope with an emergency is a matter to be decided on a \"probability-of-occurrence\" basis. The need for continuom monitoring of the astronaut on watch, whether in or out of the suit, is hardly justi- fied on his use as an indicator of hazard or danger. Intermediate: Safety monitoring during the inter- mediate period has daily, weekly, and bimonthly requirements which may vary depending on needs. ~ PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS It may be assumed that the risk will increase as a function of time in orbit even if no significant ef- fects appear ascribable to weightlessness. We can only speculate on which organs and systems may be significantly dected by zero G. At any given time, fitness far reentry is more critical than fitness to carry out the tasks aloft; hence, safety monitoring in orbit has as its main objective safe return to earth. Whether the astronauts should be fit at all times for reentry or whether special conditioning in the pre- descent period should be relied upon will be decided, in part, by reliability of LCS and, in part, by experience. Predesrent: The predescent period, unless short- ened by emergency, should provide ample time to conduct refresher training, which will also serve as a performance test, and to evaluate general fitness. A critical decision may arise as to whether to use \"unusual\" procedures to temporarily increase astro- naut fitness and whether special provisions (such as reducing elapsed time to pickup) should be made on the ground for the return of a sick or injured astronaut. It is assumed that one astronaut in the ferry vehi- cle may ride as \"passenger.\" Reentry A comparison of the situation at launch and reentry points up dramatic differences, Takeoff may be delayed indefinitely until all systems and all astronauts are \"go,\" whereas reentry is obligatory within a specified time period. Prior to launch the astronauts are superbly fit when subjected to \"full simulation\" tests, whereas at reentry they are not only less fit but \"full simulation\" tests may not be feasible. There is opportunity for abort during launch but minimal opportunity during reentry. Finally, launch ends in the comfortable lap of weightlessness while reentry ends in impact with survival hazards in prospect. Classes of Phenomena In discussing \"classes of phenomena to be moni- tored,\" two main categories will be considered: (1) environmental factors and (2) the astronaut. It is assumed that communications between space- craft and ground control will provide a full ex- change of information at monitoring stations. 37 Enlilronmental Fartors Environmental factors have been subdivided into \"hazards\" and \"known stresses.\" A hazard is de- fined as a stress which has only a probability of occurrence while, inevitably, known stresses will have to be borne. Six principal hazards have been considered : 1. Malfunction or failure of Life Control Sys- tems. Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters nf rpacwraft 2nd suit, whcx worn, provides not only the early warning signal to in- stitute countermeasures but also is tantamount to \"diagnosis\" in predicting effects on the astronaut. This is the most important area in safety moni- toring. Using the astronaut as an \"indicator\" is a secondary, but poor, line of defense and useful only in instances of minor malfunctions. 2. Monitoring the force environment during launch and reentry is not regarded as part of safety monitoring; however, the probability of hazards incidental to a tower escape or launch abort or an impact during the reentry period and survival is related to astronaut fitness. 3. The identification of possible contaminants in atmosphere, water, food, et cetera, represents a difficult and partly unsolved problem which overlaps the considerations of the Panel on Haz- ards. Because of the difficulties in recognition, a second defense line is needed, namely, diag- nosis of their effects on the astronaut. Medical toxicology, which is never easy, is doubly difficult under conditions aloft. 4. If there is a need for early recognition of geomagnetic storms and relativistic flares, the lat- ter, at least, should be monitored aloft. 5. Meteorites deserve special attention in terms of varying probabilities of hits under special astro- nomical conditions and the need for one astronaut to be suited at all times to cope with emergencies. 6. Survival hazards after impact cannot be monitored per se, but the most likely stresses should be considered in terms of astronaut fitness. The known environmental stresses fall into two categories, namely, those whose effects on the astro- naut are: (1) known or (2) unknown. 1. With regard to \"known effects,\" it is irnpor- tant to correlate the stress profile with the effects to determine if there is an unusual response. 2. Weightlessness is a \"known\" stress with 38 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY \"unknown\" effects. Prolonged exposure to weightlessness should be monitored in terms of inertial forces generated by the astronaut, re- straints which counter the effects of weightless- ness, and, possibly, librational forces, inasmuch as their long-term effects may be important. Inso- far as measurements on the astronaut are con- cerned, high reliability and good validity take precedence over feasibility, since it is better to forego a test than interpret an erroneous value. In addition to telemetered items, medical fitness forms which should be filled out daily are pro- posed for use aloft. The three forms are similar except for the inclusion of additional items at one-weekly and four-weekly intervals. The AJtronaut Monitoring the astronaut falls into two main cate- gories: (1 ) detection of physiopathological effects, and (2) evaluation of fitness. Fitness may be con- sidered under two headings, spontaneous illness and weightlessness. Spontaneous occurrence of serious diseases, while unlikely in young persons over relatively short pe- riods, cannot be neglected. The possibility of cer- tain injuries, infections, and functional disorders would seem to be slightly greater in weightlessness than under ordinary conditions. Accurate diagnosis is the basis for proper therapy, and early diagnosis may be important for safety if the astronaut could not be treated aloft. Weightlessness is the great independent variable around which the first ORL flight will be centered. It is essential to be on the watch for beneficial as well as harmful effects. American and Russian ex- perience points to an initial period of adaptation with respect to major bodily systems. The Russian experience suggests the possibilities of vestibular sickness, first stage heart block, and prolongation of mechanical systole; nearly every- thing else is speculation, including the possibility of disturbances in vision and sleep. The American ex- perience must be interpreted in the light of physical restraints and multiple stresses. Restraint would have greatly lessened the tendency to vestibular symptoms, and it is possible to account for the symptoms experienced or manifested on factors other than weightlessness. The findings from Project Mercury, nevertheless, when considered along with the results of simulation studies using bed rest and water immersion, suggest that, in the absence of countermeasures at least, special attention should be given to fluid electrolyte balance, reduced blood vol- ume, nitrogen loss, loss of endovascular control, dis- turbances in vision, sleep, and psychomotor re- sponses, muscular asthenia and fatigue, and possibly personality changes. The effects of prolonged weightlessness, possibly involving cellular and subcellular systems, might not give rise to familiar syndromes or illnesses, hence might be misdiagnosed, at least with respect to eti- ology and the time course of the effects in terms of adaptation or progressive deterioration. This points up the need for \"undirected\" monitoring. It is considered that monitoring the long-term effects of weightlessness is not critical over short periods of time and therefore need not be continuous. Monitoring astronaut fitness for space flight ac- tivities deserves the most careful and detailed con- sideration. It has important relationships with the monitoring of environmental factors and astronaut health. Monitoring astronaut fitness in orbit has limitations in terms of comparability with ground- based data, test equipment, and the condition of the astronaut at time of testing. This suggests that every element in fitness testing aloft be considered from the standpoint of prior ground-based testing which would serve a useful purpose. As pointed out earlier, since fitness for activities in orbit is less demanding than for reentry, this should serve as the reference criterion for validating fitness tests. Fitness for reentry falls into two categories: (1) fitness to withstand the environmental stresses and perform the work incidental to survival after impact and (2) fitness to carry out the professional astro- nautical tasks while undergoing the stresses. Fit- ness testing may be specific or nonspecific (per- formance or nonperformance). Every effort should be made to take maximal advantage of the astro- naut's activities aloft with regard to their value in estimating fitness for recovery. Simulation of the astronaut's professional tasks on reentry and haid physical work should be feasible. The fact that simulation of the force environment on reentry and transition from weightlessness to one G may not be feasible points up a critical deficiency. If an astronaut should become unfit for reentry in the conventional manner, such a decision would ' PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS 39 necessitate his return as a \"passenger\" with the aid of unconventional procedures. cumstances and especially in terms of any important action to be taken. Tolerance Limits S-rY Arbitrary \"tolerance limits\" may be misleading unless qualified. With regard to environmental parameters, \"tolerance\" may be exceeded with the appearance of a contaminant which may have little or great effect on the astronaut over the same pe- riod of time. Trends may appear before \"tolerance limits\" are approached. With regard to the astro- naut, tolerance limits may refer to \"comfort,\" \"in- efficient,\" or \"disability\" zones, and time is an im- portant dimension. For example, in a healthy per- son over a six-month period there is no upper tol- erance limit with respect to blood pressure per se; however, there may be if it is used as an \"indicator,\" and here the circumstances become important. The point to be made is that tolerance limits as usually presented may require interpretation in terms of cir- The foregoing remarks may be briefly summarized as follows: Safety monitoring fails into two main categories, environmental factors and astronaut pa- rameters. With regard to the former, monitoring malfunction or failure of LCS, which begins prior to takeoff and ends after impact, represents the most critical need. With regard to the astronaut, the problems incidental to launch and orbit are not as cirtical as those of reentry. Evaluation of astronaut fitness for reentry at periodic intervals is essential and, in addition, early recognition of symptoms or manifestations which might eventuate in \"unfitness\" will provide invaluable lead time. The following forms were developed as prelim- inary guidelines for developing appraisals of on- board physical evaluation techniques. 40 d MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY C .e - E PHASE I: LIFE SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS DAYS 7 AND 21 OF EACH MONTH 41 Body weight centrifugal or best substitutes Times V.

EE6 Changes During Arousal and Drowsing 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose Priority 2. To observe EEG changes during the phases of the work-rest-sleep (W-RS) cycle. From prior ground-based experiments, it seems clear that there is a continuum of EEG pat- terns which relate to levels of alertness and drowsing. Under the unusual conditions of the manned space flight system, peculiar work-rest- sleep (W-R-5) cydes may be imposed. There- fore, it is extremely important to monitor levels of alertness and concomitants of drowsing in order to increase understanding of these cycles aloft. The problem of adjustment from a 24- hour pattern to the cycles aloft has not yet been solved. 4. Justification 5. Experiment Hypothesis: Each member of the flight crew will have patterns of EEG activity typical of alertness or drowsing, and, if these are analyzed in sequence of real time, a continuum can be established. Such observations should be corre- lated with relevant psychological and other physiological experiments which are outlined elsewhere in this phase. Materials: 8-channel EEG system applica- tion. Telemetering capability is desirable. A considerable instrumentation development is also required in order to package satisfactorily for %ight. Subjects: The idight personnel. Records: A record should be made for a minimum of 15 minutes on each man during each phase of his W-R-S cycle. Men will serve as their own controls. Repre- sentative records could be taken on the ground before flight and presumably a comparable se- ries after recovery. 7.

Estimated Priority 5. Priority 1. 3. Purpose To determine the level of \"artificial gravity\" needed to maintain astronaut fitness, on the one hand, and minimize or prevent the side effects of a rotating environment (difficulty in walking, illusions, and canal sickness), on the other. In- sofar as feasible, advantage should be taken of the unique opportunity to study man's intrinsic and extrinsic behavior as a function of subgrav- ity levels of gravitoinertial force. 4. Justification Design engineers will require human perform- ance data to determine the configuration of a rotating spacecraft and some of its operational characteristics. If the rotating ORL under con- sideration is the first of its type, these \"data\" must be obtained from ground-based experi- ments. Investigations aloft are needed to \"per- fect\" the design of \"second generation\" rotating spacecraft. A very important phase of this uni dertaking is to determine the validity of ground- based experiments in order to minimize the need for investigations of an applied nature aloft. New information of considerable value should be obtained. Experiment Assumptions: In the following experimental design, it is assumed that the rotating ORL will be capable of generating a centripetal force of approximately one G unit in magnitude and that a counter-rotating facility will permit experi- mentation in weightlessness. At stations be- tween the \"core\" and periphery (or at varying velocities of the spacecraft), subgravity condi- tions would prevail. If this range is not avail- able, the experiments can be tailored accord- ingly. Although a single \"set\" of environ- mental conditions may subserve three cardinal purposes, namely, (1) to determine the one ideal force environment to preserve fitness, (2) to validate ground-based experiments, and (3) to determine the \"tolerance envelope,\" the main emphasis will be placed on the last inasmuch as it may prove to be the limiting factor in space- craft design for the near future. Subjects: The astronauts or \"space crew\" for the rotating ORL should be selected on the basis of (1 ) previous experience in space flight, (2) low initial susceptibility to stress in rotat- ing environments, (3) ability to adapt or habit- uate as manifested in training procedures, and (4) general suitability as subjects or experi- menters. The assessments covering medical, physiological, and psychological factors should be intensive and extensive, during the course of PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 55 which the subject should demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the technical procedures, and his responsibilities as a subject or experimenter in flight. At the end of this experiment NAVSCOLAVNMED 6500/ 24 is the Preflight Vestibular Evaluation form from the Navy school of Aviation Medicine. The Force Envkonments: The force uwiron- ments as represented by the vector sums of the forces generated by vehicie and subject wiii have been carefully estimated prior to going aloft on the basis of measurements made in the labora- tory. Nevertheless, it would be essential to re- peat, insofar as feasible, the measurements in actual flight and determine the dynamic effects in terms of stimulation of vestibular organs. The beneficial forces would be represented mainly by centripetal force and possibly Coriolis force, while the disturbing forces would be rep- resented by the multiplanar angular accelerations affecting the semicircular canals, the Coriolis forces, and the changing gradients of gastro- intestinal forces as the subject moves about the spacecraft. Apparatus: It is assumed that the ORL will be equipped to carry out all of the necessary procedures except those items related to the as- sessment of vestibular functions and the effects (or lack of interaction) between vestibular and other sense modalities. The apparatus needed to measure canal and otolith function has been briefly described in Experiment 3, entitled The Effects of Weightlessness and Subgravity States on the Function of the Otolith Apparatus and the Semicircular Camis (including Their Inter- relationships and Their Relation with Other Sense Modalities), although some newer pmce- dures under development may prove more sat- isfactory. As presently determined, the major items of equipment would include: (1) litter- chair, (2) nystogmograph, (3) camera and an- cillary equipment to measure ocular counter rolling, (4) helmet with self-contained device to measure egocentric visual iocaiization of up- down area, (5) device to measure nonvisual estimates of up-down which is under develop- ment. The litter-chair will operate in three modes: (1) oscillation, (2) rotating chair, and (3) rotating litter. Procedures: These fall into four categories: a. Measure the time course of adaptation to the force environment in the main portion of the spacecraft and compare with the findings obtained from subjects at other stations. It is expected that the astronauts, having been care- fully prepared, will not be affeaed to a si@- cant degree. Nevertheless, the force environ- ment will be different from anything they have the force environment may influence the symptomatology . b. Exploration studies utilizing the independ- ently rotating center portion of the space- craft and a litter-chair which should be capa- ble of rotating, when desired, either clock- wise or counter-clockwise up to 60 rpm with controllable levels of acceleration. (1) Definition of the \"symptom or toler- ance envelope\" covering angular velocities greater than that of the ORL. With some reservations, involving Coriolis accelera- tions, the data obtained would be valid to rotating environments with greater radii. The apparatus described in Experiment 1, entitled EEG Changes During Arousal and Drowsing, would s&ce. (2) Explore the best procedure for tran- sition from a stationary to a rotating envi- ronment. (3) Define the best procedure of precon- ditioning a subject for transition to a sta- tionary environment. This involves not only the symptomatology incidental to a change in force environments but also the possible loss of fitness due to the small magnitude of the inertial forces. There are several possibilities here which need ex- ploration under terrestrial conditions. c. Explore alternative procedures for the maintenance of fitness by \"artificial gravity.\" One involves, solely, the generation of iner- tial forces by rotating the spacecraft, except for the initial period, at constant velocity. Another possibility is to supplement the con- ditioning provided by the constant velocity of the spacecraft through the periodic use of an onboard centrifuge which might consist of an independently rotating central portion of the rxyrririiced picvioudy, and f;rC?cis d.ki &ian 56 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY vehicle. Evaluation of medical and profes- sional fitness and especially physical fitness is the main requirement. It is essential to dis- tinguish between fitness for tasks aloft, dur- ing reentry, and postimpact. The procedures described under \"Safety Monitoring\" are ap- plicable and probably sufficient. d. Investigate sensory perceptions, particu- larly interactions of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory cues. 6. Experimental Controls Astronauts will serve as their own controls, but comparisons, insofar as possible, may be made with the experience of other astronauts under similar conditions and healthy subjects under simulated conditions. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Sta- tion Personnel A physician is highly desirable and almost es- sential for clinical aspects of the experimental program. One astronaut well-trained as a tech- nician is essential. The greater the sophistica- tion of the subjects the better. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required Described under 5. 9.

The \"explora- iory\" investigations would require the use of one subject for prolonged periods which are often measured in days rather than hours, but during this time he could be doing some type of useful work which did not require his pres- ence elsewhere. A total of one experimenter's time would be needed while the investigation is in progress; this work load could and should be distributed. 12.

These efforts fall into two interrelated categories, operational and experimental. The former includes studies which have fairly di- rect application to the selection, assessment, and training of astronauts in preparation for space flights in rotating spacecraft. The latter is an analytic and synthetic approach designed to provide experimental facts and. theoretical understanding of the role of the semicircular canals and otolith organs in man under all conditions. Analytic studies deal with: (1) the analysis of gravitoinertial force environments; (2) the mechanics of the semicircular canals and otolith organs as transducer mechanisms; (3) the ef- fects of different force environments on sensing elements in the canals and otoliths; (4) the central nervous system mechanisms concerned with the integration, modulation, and adapta- tion to sensory inputs from the canals and oto- liths; (5) the responses evoked by usual and unusual patterns of stimulation to canals and otoliths; (6) the individual roles of canals and otolith organs and their interrelationship; and (7) the prevention of illusory phenomena and functional disturbances. The synthetic approach deals with (1) an un- derstanding of the mechanisms underlying the useful contributions of the canals and otoliths to the human economy in health and under ordi- nary living conditions, (2) an understanding of the disturbances in homeostatic mechanisms, re- sulting from disease, functional disorder, or in- jury of the canals and otoliths and their restora- tion and (3) the level of inertial force which should be generated in a rotating spacecraft to prevent loss of fitness. Not essential. Compared with the organ of Corti, our knowl- edge of the semicircular canals and especially the otolith apparatus is far in arrears. (See 15.)

I I I 1 ~ EXPERIMENT 3 1, The Effects of Weightlessness and Subgravity States on the Function of the Otolith Appara- tus and the Semicircular Canals {including Their Interrelationships and Their Relation with Other Sense Modalities) Priority 1. To measure changes with time under the force conditions aloft in the function of the otolith organs and semicircular canals and determine their role in lowering the efficiency of astro- nauts in flight and post impact. Deafferentation of the otolith apparatus and other gravireceptors has precipitated the most clear-cut first order symptoms experienced or 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification manifested in weightlessness. Second order ef- fects may have contributed to fatigue and a broad spectrum of mild functional disturbances. While it is expected that adaptation will occur within a short period of time, long-term effects might result either from alterations in end or- gans or changes in CNS \"sensitivity\" to der- ent impulses or both. The astronauts serve as their own controls, and comparative measurements are made before, dur- ing, and after flight. The principal measure- ments, in the light of present knowledge, would fall in four categories: 5. Experiment Otolith function: a. Compensatory eye movement response to linear oscillations. Different orientations of 68 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY head (body) to the rectilinear accelerations desirable. Litter-chair device could be driven with clock mechanism. Subjective sensations, electrooculography and cine photography would be used. Threshold and supra threshold responses would be obtained at periodic in- tervals to determine changes with length of exposure. Introduction of active rotary move- ments of head to observe superimposed nystag- mus might yield worthwhile information on combined canal and otolith function. If litter mode is available, compensatory eye move- ments might be obtained at constant rotation with selective prepositioning of subject. Time (T) inflight 45 to 90 minutes. b. Egocentric visual localization of the hori- zontal (EVLH) (ref. 1). Otolith and, to a lesser degree, nonotolith gravireceptors af- fect the response. There is a \"shred\" of evi- dence that these two influences act differently using the A- and E-phenomena as indicators (ref. 2). At all events, with otoliths de- afferented the single influence of different contact (pressure) cues could be explored. Moreover, progressive differences under free floating and contact condition would point to relative roles of otolith and nonotolith influ- ences. Not only a wide variety of contact cues but also visual cues could be introduced to measure changes in the interaction of dif- ferent sense modalities. These tests are suffi- ciently interesting that they might come under the heading of \"diversion.\" (T, 2-10 min, depending on variety of measures). c. Before and after measurements, using tilt device (EVLH) and, if warranted, horizon- tal and vertical oscillations and human cen- trifuge (refs. 1, 3). Canal function: a. Before and after comparative measure- ments. Threshold and suprathreshold re- sponse to sion nystagmographic record- ings (ref. 4). (T--one ear, 13-20 min.) Might be tried aloft to determine if response due to endolymph flow in response to heat or cold. b. Response to angular and Coriolis accelera- tions, using illusions and ocular nystagmus as 5, 6). (T, illusions, 3 min; , nystagmus, 5 min) . Illusory effects: A special recording form can be devised to chart the changes in illusory phe- nomena. (T, 2 min.) Functional disturbances: Only when com- parisons are made between subjects with and those without vestibular organs can one gain a firm appreciation of the role of canals and otoliths in causing a great variety of functional disturbances over a wide range of severity (ref. 7). Too much reliance has been placed on nausea as an indicator whereas many persons have a variety of complaints before the nausea stage is reached. Moreover, the adaptation to nausea occurs more quickly, in some force envi- ronments at least, than to other symptoms. It would be difficult to attribute nonspecific symptoms to the vestibular organs if the sub- ject acts as his own control, but in a random group of astronauts carefully \"calibrated\" for susceptiblility to symptoms precipitated by se- lective stimulation of otoliths, significant dif- ferences in symptomatology might show up; subsequent adaptation would suggest that they are of vestibular origin. A brief questionnaire can be prepared for this purpose (ref. 8). (T, 3 min). Subjects serve as their own control, but some measurements on groups of normal subjects un- der terrestrial conditions needed for baseline normative data. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Sta- tion Personnel Any astronaut thoroughly trained in the proce- dure might serve as experimenter but someone with training in physiology preferable. If he also serves as one of the subjects, a second astro- naut should receive technical instruction. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required 6. Experimental Controls Centrifuge: To be decided. Litter-chair in lieu of centrifuge: TO be Horizontal oscillator: To be decided. Restraint devices: The one item which might not accompany any rotating device is restraint for head. Dental bite piece and thin partial decided. PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 69 plastic helmet should suffice. Nystagmograph: Any two-channel unit for amplifying recording and, if possible, display- ing changes in surface potentials with a capa- bility of high gain and low frequency (0 to 50 cps) response. Thermal stimulation unit: Present irrigation method probably unsatisfactory. Work in progress on more suitable devices. EI'LH decice: ne me ucder d~.~!opmmt for Gemini experiment (ref. 1) or a modifica- tion of it is satisfactory. Frenzel ienses: Weight of present model might be reduced by using plastic lenses. Power: Except for rotating devices, small battery(s) for EVLH and small requirements for physiological recorder. Consumable material: Tape for recorder un- less telemetered on \"paper\" for display. Weightlessness is an elegant method to pro- duce physiological deafferentation of the otolith apparatus. The effect of this deafferentation on the spontaneous discharge of receptor cells of macula and crista should be determined. Also the changes in the resting discharge with time and changes in response to stimulation of oto- liths and canals with time would be important to measure. This experiment would require a physiologist trained in these techniques unless the \"preparations\" were carried aloft which would limit the duration of the experiment. Major requirements are to be decided. Whether complete defierentation of otoliths leads to functional and pathological changes in peripheral receptors and cell stations in CNS could be determined in squirrel monkeys, pref- erably, or on lower animals. Comparison with animal freely moving would establish value of head movements in preventing alterations if they were manifested. Much additional infor- mation also could be obtained. Two small \"units\" each weighing about 50 lbs, occupying about 1 cubic foot, and requiring 2.5 to 5.0 watts during experimental periods would be the major requirements. If biosatellite experiments are conducted, improvement in present day re- quirement can be expected. 10. Summary of Other Living Forms 9. Summary of Animals A second. experiment which may be accom- plished long in advance of ORL concerns the important question of whether deafferentation alters the resting discharge of gravireceptors in parabolic flight. This might be accomplished with very small nonmammalian \"forms,\" but primates are desirable. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determjnatjons The experiments utilizing nystagmography are other investigative procedures involving the use of centrifuge or recorder. The approximate time for an experienced observer and subject has been indicated. The minimal total time for the subject on a complete series adds up to ap- proximately 90 minutes; the preparation would require, in some instances, a longer time unless integrated with another experiment; number of times would depend on the time-course of changes. 12.

Intraocular Arterial Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure under Conditions of Prolonged Whole Body Weightlessness Priority 1. To study the possible effects of weightlessness on the intraocular systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 4. Justification One of the possible major effects of weightless- ness on the human subject may be a decrement in cardiovascular reactivity. The effective arterial blood pressure in the eye is less than that in the brain because circula- tion in the retina is opposed by a normal intra- ocular pressure of approximately 18 mm Hg. It is also known that the application of 20 to 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 30 mm Hg positive pressure to the eyeballs lowers by 1G the positive centrifugal force necessary to produce visual blackout in the hu- man subject. When systolic blood pressure at head level is reduced below 50 mm Hg by positive centrifugal force, disturbances in vision occur although the human subject retains con- sciousness. Thus a loss in reactivity of the cardiovascular system under conditions of prolonged weight- lessness may well result in untoward variations in intraocular blood pressure which may threaten the limits of visual tolerance of the eye. Utilizing a plethysmographic goggle type of opthalmodynamometer the astronaut can conduct the experiment unassisted. Procedure: At regularly prescribed intervals 5. Experiment PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 71 (e.g.: within the first hour of weightlessness; after 2, 3, and 4 hours of weightlessness; after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 days of weightlessness; after 3, 6, and 12 weeks of weightlessness; and just prior to leaving orbit in preparation for reentry into the effective gravitational force of the earth) the astronaut should place the plethysmo- graphic goggles over his eyes. By means of a hand-operated bulb syringe, he can increase the positive atmospheric pressure force exerted on one eye to any level up to 200 mm Hg while the other eye remains at normal cabin atmos- pheric pressure. Measurements: While gradually increasing the atmospheric pressure on one eye during each test procedure, the astronaut is to fixate his eye undergoing the test on a visual target situated directly in front of him and at a distance of one to three meters. This visual target is essentially a visual field device containing a cen- tral fixation point and points of illumination 15', 25', and 50' from the central fixation point. As the pressure in the goggle increases, the astronaut will observe the gradual onset of \"grayout\" in the involved eye. When this point is reached, the astronaut will observe that his peripheral vision is reduced to a point where he has just lost awareness of the 15O (and beyond) points of illumination on the visual target area although he can still see the central fixation point. Since \"grayout\" approxi- mates the diastolic pressure level of compres- sion of the intraocular arterials, the astronaut can manually note this fact by a trigger mark- ing device. When the plethysmographic gog- gle pressure reaches that of systolic intraocular arterial pressure, \"blackout\" or complete tem- porary loss of vision occurs in the involved eye. The astronaut at this point is aware that the central fixation point in the visual target area has also vanished. He then trigger-marks the pressure record at that point and reduces the plethysmographic gaggle pressuie back to nor- mal cabin atmospheric pressure. A series of similar preflight tests should be car- ried out on the astronaut so that he can act as 6. Experimental Controls In addition, prefiight testing will enable the subject and the equipment to be checked out in regard to standardization of response, familiar- ity, and reliability. 7.

Harmonic and Other Analyses of Voice Charac- teristics for Possible Indications of Anxiety, De- pression, Hostility, and Other Emotional Reactions Priority 1. To develop a number of indices based on the analysis of voice for possible use in distinguish- ing between various emotional states; to evalu- ate the stability of such patterns over time. Voice communication between the astronauts in the capsule and the ground crews is a necessary medium for the transmission of essential mes- sages. Since emotional changes are reflected in a neuro-muscular discharge, it is reasonable to assume that the muscles of the larynx would be affected by the emotional condition of a sub- ject. Changes in the tension of selected muscles 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification and Rationale in the larynx should have a definite influence on a number of characteristics of the voice. It is felt that an analysis of the voice pattern (i.e. when saying the same word) would reveal criti- cal changes under different emotional conditions. Since voice communication will be involved in all orbital flights, no extra equipment would be needed aboard the capsule to conduct this experiment. And if the above hypothesis is correct, we would have a readily available method to objectively evaluate the emotional condition of the astronaut at every stage of his orbital flight. 5-22. Not applicable. 23. References Awaiting appropriate references to determine the feasibility of such analyses with the pres- ent quality of voice recordings obtained from astronauts while in flight. EXPERIMENT 6 1. Emotional Changes During Prolonged Space 3. Purpose 2. Estimated Priority Flight Priority 1. To determine what emotional changes occur in a space crew during a prolonged space flight and to correlate these changes with whatever ~ PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS . performance data are available at the time the emotional changes are reported. A number of investigations suggest that the confining and environmentally monotonous as- pects of extended space flight will tend to in- duce undesirable emotional and behavioral reac- tions (ref. 1). These in turn may lead to de- terioration of social and personal integrity. It has been conjectured that prolonged periods of weightlessness might generate anxiety and ap- prehension (ref. 2). Prolonged confinement is also considered to produce irritability, hostility, depression, and other negative attitudes (ref. 3) that could be disturbing and disruptive of group morale. Similar results are available from the psychometric studies on the long cruises of the atomic submarines (ref. 4). Deterioration of efficiency, morale, and motiva- tion may well accompany the undesirable emo- tional reactions mentioned above and such ef- fects could jeopardize the successful completion of any extended space mission. As a specific example, deteriorating attitudes and inadequate performance may bring about a lowering of standards in the execution of the reconditioning and retraining programs (for reentry) that will have to be periodically instituted aloft. Aside from such practical considerations, it is of inherent theoretical interest to study the na- ture of the changes in the emotional life of an individual exposed to the unique, intense, and focalized pattern of stresses experienced by an astronaut during a space mission. The long continued impact of this stressful experience should reveal changes that would not be observa- ble in a short flight. Experimental evidence, obtained from an orbiting laboratory, may pro- vide leads for developing countermeasures against any possible negative effects. 4. Ius tifiration and Rationale 5. Experiment Materials: Three types of measurements are needed to analyze the complex characteristics of what is called emotional behavior: psychologi- cal, physiological, and biochemical. a. Psychological: Rating scales (e.g., Nowlis Mood Scale) and sociometric devices. These procedures will help identify the psychological onset and the nature of the emotion experi- enced by the astronaut. An analysis of the discrepancy between self-ratings and ratings of self by others might provide indices of group cohesion. b. Physiological: Respiratory, cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate), eledromyo- graphic, and galvanic skin responses should be monitored. c. Biochemicd: Determination of catechol amines, ACTH, and adrenal steroids. Subjects: Assuming a complement of 5 to 6 men in an orbiting laboratory, the subjects of the experiment would consist of 3 to 4 men. The other members of the laboratory crew would be individuals who could be rotated after varying periods of time depending upon the training and experimental needs of the overall program. To control for weightlessness and the \"hazard\" effects that are unique in being aloft in an orbiting laboratory, a contrast group should be used in a ground-based simulator which would attempt to replicate the physical characteristics of the orbiting laboratory and the activity program of its members. Procedure: Part of this experiment could be embedded within a much larger experiment dealing with simulation of extended space flights. The data obtained could well serve as feed- back for restructuring the experiment in the orbiting laborato ry. Baseline data for all the measurements would be obtained at various time points in the train- ing of the crews for an orbital laboratory as- signment. From 4-8 time points should be in- corporated into the training procedure and at least the same number should be utilized in the experiment proper. The number of time points will be determined by the time characteristics of the extended space mission. The minimal experimental mission should last 30 days, followed by extensions to 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 360 days. If no detrimen- tal effects are in evidence at the lower time pe- riod, the experiment could be escalated to the next higher level. Should evidence of question- able deterioration appear, the experiment should be repeated with the presumed influences for the deterioration eliminated or counteracted. Such an escalated program should provide \"de- 74 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY velopmental\" data that would indicate critical phases in the developmental aspects of man's adjustment to conditions which an astronaut would experience on an extended space mission. T6e simulation (ground-based) group can serve as a partial control group for the effects of weightlessness and the unique stress conditions of orbital flight. The baseline data would serve as Earth-based standards against which the ex- perimental data can be evaluated. Such base- lihe data should have reached an asymptotic or \"homeostatic\" level in order to serve as a valid comparative standard. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Station Personnel In a group of five to six, three to four persons will comprise the experimental group. The two nonexperimenters should consist of a physi- cian and a trained astronaut who could be ro- tated for various other duties or experimental tasks. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required Amplifiers and multichannel recorders to indi- cate respiratory, cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate), electromyographic, and galvanic skin changes. Multiple purpose behavior panel which, in addi- tion to serving as a test instrument for various psychological processes, should provide a capa- bility for recording ratings (self and others) and sociometric data. 9. Summary of Animals None. 10. Summary of Other Living Forms None. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determinations Three determinations of each of the physiologi- cal indices at each time point. The number of time points for obtaining the whole set of psy- chological, physiological, and biochemical de- terminations will depend on the length of the extended space mission. For the shortest ex- tended mission (30 days), it is recommended that the testing take place at least once a week and at such times that will assure coordination with other psychological measures. 12. Summary of Laboratory Specimens to be Flown 6. Experimental Controls to Earth for Laboratory Examination Initially, it is anticipated that the biochemical specimens will have to be flown to Earth for analysis. These flights should be integrated with other experimental programs which might also require specimens to be returned to Earth. 13. Proposed Rendezvous Schedule for Rotation of Crew Rotation is necessary only for the \"adjunct\" crew of two members. The rate of rotation should be determined by the training and experimental requirements of the overall laboratory program. 14. Telemetry versus Onboard Recording Require- ments Test information can be stored in tapes pend- ing the relaying of this data to Earth. As fa- cilities and the state of the art develops, more and more of such data should be telemetered soon after it is obtained. The simulation portion of this experiment can also serve as a prerequisite ground-based experi- ment. None. Rating and sociometric devices. Miniaturization of the systems for the physiological recordings. As similar to Earth atmosphere as possible.

Evaluation of Spontaneous Activity (Initiative), GSR, and EEG as Indicators of Vigilance on a Prolonged Space Flight MiJsion Priori9 1. Inherent in the title of the experiment. Submarine research indicates that alertness, con- centration, and excitation levels tend to de- crease as a prolonged mission progresses (refs. 2, 4). Initiative also tends to diminish in an environmentally restricted, high-altitude balloon flight (ref. 3). Degredation of vigilance and initiative could have serious consequences on a prolonged space flight where the succcss of the mission may depend on the continued vigilance of one or two members at any one particular period of time. The role of vigilance on a prolonged space flight needs to be analyzed and evaluated. 5. Experiment 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification and Rationale Muter&: Rating scales for vigilance (alert- ness, concentration, excitation level). A minia- ture tape recorder into which the subject would dictate any interesting or exciting experiences of the day (or any other time period). The \"time spent dictating to activity\" (ref. 3) as would the GSR and EEG, using the method of RiehI to develop in- dices of vigilance. The basal resistance level and extinction rate can also be used as indices of excitation level for the GSR. Subjects: Same as in experiment entitled Emotional Changes During Prolonged Space Flight. Procedure: Physiological measurements and ratings should be taken every second day for a 30-day space flight. Dictation (an indicator of initiative) should be recommended (though not demanded) at the same rate during the astro- naut's recreation period. 6-22.

Effect of Frustrating Situations on Subsequent Psychological Performance During Prolonged Space Flights 2. Estimated Priority Priority 1. 3. Purpose To evaluate the degree of behavioral disrup- tion and disorganization following a frustrating situation in order (1) to determine the overall effects of the stress associated with prolonged flight missions and (2) to assess the need for additional conditioning or training to overcome possible adverse reactions. 4. Justification and Rationale Experiment 6, entitled Emotional Changes Dur- ing Prolonged Space Flight, may not indicate any dramatic alterations in emotional status from one measurement period to another since changes in stress tolerance may proceed by small incre- ments. Furthermore, ordinary behavior controls may mask significant inner changes. Neither will that experiment show directly how emo- tional changes can affect subsequent perform- ance. An intense but controlled stress input, inte- grated into the usual program of astronaut ac- tivities, could provide a situation sufficiently frustrating to permit an evalaution of (1) emo- tional overreaction and (2) degradation of sub- sequent psychological performance. The degree to which both of these effects exceed the base- line preflight data could be attributed in large part to the stresses of space flight. If the deg- radation of subsequent psychological perform- ance is \"excessive,\" remedial action would seem to be indicated. It is recommended that the controlled stress in- put be incorporated into the astronaut condi- tioning schedule related to troubleshooting and emergency training. If, for example, the sched- ule on a particular day demands that the astro- naut undergo four different troubleshooting maneuvers, the third of these should be one in which he fails (either to find the trouble spot or to fix it in a specified period of time). The fourth troubleshooting task should be a routine one for which some previous performance data on the astronaut is available. Since it is anticipated that such troubleshooting and emergency training will be continued aloft in order to keep the astronaut at peak perform- ance in emergency situations, equivalent frustrat- ing tasks should be incorporated in both ground- based and orbital training sessions. Since the number of possible emergency situations is ex- tensive, it should not be too difficult to construct many relatively equivalent task situations. It is anticipated that the frustrating tasks will arouse sufficient emotional reaction in astro- nauts who presumably have high ego regard and self-confidence. Before reentry and after the completion of the in-flight series of trouble- shooting tests, the astronauts should be de- briefed concerning the insoluble task so as to minimize any anxiety the frustrating experience of failure may have provoked. 5. Experiment Materials: The same psychological, physiolog- ical, and biochemical measures as those in the experiment entitled Emotional Changes During Prolonged Space Flight. Those in the experiment entitled Emotional Changes . During Prolonged Space Flight. Procedure; Basically similar to that in the experiment entitled Emotional Changes During Prolonged Space Flight. In the present experi- ment, four troubleshooting tasks would comprise one training session. The astronauts are in- structed that they might not be able to com- plete the tasks in time allotted. Of these tasks, one or more would be \"failed\" by the astro- nauts; the fourth would be a standard type for which preformance data is available. Immedi- ately following the fourth task, performance on the psychological tasks of the behavioral panel should be evaluated. The psychological rating scales should follow the psychological tests in half of the experimental sessions; they should precede the psychological tests in the other half. 6-22.

Behavior and Performance Levels During Pe- riods of Mental Stress and Relative Relaxation 2. Estimated Priority Priority 2. 3. Pnrpose To determine psychophysiological effects of concentrated mental stress in relative isofation rameters taken during relative relaxation. As manned space flights develop, various men- tal stresses will come to bear on the responsible in-flight personnel. Such personnel will be re- quired to perform at relatively high, or even extremely high, levels during the stresses and yet must have periods of relative relaxation. The problem of periodicity or cycling of duty and the relationship of performance levels to it re- mains largely unsolved. Therefore, this experi- ment is of considerable importance in that it is designed to provide further information on the relationship of concentrated mental stress, rela- tive relaxation, and periods of drowsing to average mean performance levels. The basic postulate is that intense concentrated language instruction constitutes a mental stress which can be evaluated in tern of full scale and verbal performance, as well as memory, and both physiological and biochemical parameters. This is a ground-based experiment in which 8 experimental and 8 control subjects will partici- pate. The experimental subjects will be in- structed in a language foreign to them by a technique known as total immersion for 3 days, then permitted a relative rest period of 2 days, followed by another intensive language iostruc- tion period. The control group will be iso- lated and relatively restrained in a manner iden- tical to the experimental group, but will not meet the language instruction requirements. On the contrary, the control group will have rela- tively nonstressful tasks assigned, but will be subject to the same test procedures as the ex- perimental personnel. Irzdependent Variables: a. The physical parameters of the test area. b. The environmental atmosphere. c. The personnel strength. d. The test cycle. Dependent Variables: a. Psychological performance as measured by verbal foreign language test, full scale per- formance test, Minnesota Memory Test, continuous performance test, and other tests to be designed and introduced as the pro- tocol develops.

To help answer questions concerning the effects of certain psychological variables (confinement, social restriction, monotony, and crowding), which are seemingly inherent in space flight, on the individual and group performance of astro- nauts. As space flights continue, the time spent in such flights will increase. Because of engineering limitations, the space travelers will be faced with confinement to small spaces, restricted SO- cially, crowded by other crew members, face a monotonous existence for long periods of time, and have reduced possibility for normal exer- cise. The effects of these variables on group performance need to be understood both as sin- gle and as interacting variables with weightless- ness. The hypothesis tested is that the spatial con- finement, social restrictions, monotony, crowd- ing, and exercise concomitants of space environ- ment for the Apollo and next larger. space cap- sules will operate as both single and interacting variables to affect the performance of individuals exposed to them. 4. Justification 5. Experiment Independent Variables: a.

Varied from 4 to 5 to 6 in terms of num- bers of subjects confined. Varied under the conditions of (1) programmed considerable exercise, (2) programmed minimum exercise, and (3) lack of any programmed exercise. b. Crowding: c. Exercise: Dependent Variables: a. Performance as measured by: (1) a performance panel consisting of psychomotor and cognitive tasks, (2) critical flicker fusion, (3) the Categories Test, and (4) operational procedures.

The experiment is a modified 3 X 3 X 3 factorial design with subjects assigned to the space confinement variable as follows: replication of Apollo volume size using 4 and then 5 occupants; replication of next larger size using 5 and then 6 occupants; and using 6 occupants only for the normal outside volume. 6. Experimental Controls To determine the effects of weightlessness as a main effect and as it interacts with the other independent variables, the study must be either replicated on the ground or in an artificial grav- ity environment aboard the space craft.

To help answer questions concerning the effects of prolonged space flight on the well-being and 79 80 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY crowding by other crew members, monotonous existence for long periods of time and work- rest-sleep cycles adjusted to duties and not to the 24-hour patterns to which they have been adapted in the past. The effects of these varia- bles on the physiological status and psychologi- cal functions of astronauts need to be evaluated. Hypothesis: The physical parameters of the space cabin (size) in combination with its en- vironment (atmosphere) and a work-rest-sleep cycle adjusted to duties (instead of self-selected) will operate as single and interacting variables to affect the performance of the crew members. Experimental design: Determined by the number of astronauts in flight (for example, 4 or 8) and whether the specific duties would allow for the matching of various hours on and off duty with paired subjects carrying out a different routine or a similar program. In this way it might be possible to obtain optimum well-being and performance in flight. The first step would be to work out a pro- posed schedule on the ground previous to flight based upon the findings from present studies and expected operating procedures. The sec- ond step would be to repeat the program in flight. The third step would be to readjust the schedule as determined by the requirements of flight operating procedures. The fourth step would involve the collection of data from the various matched subjects in which the basic work-rest-sleep cycles were varied in some and not in others. For example it would be inter- esting to determine whether the data from the more normal scheduling, as on Earth, would give more efficient performance records com- pared with 4 hours on duty, 4 hours off, and 4 hours sleep. The various patterns of schedul- ing for experimental purposes would be set up once the overall operational procedures had been established. 5. Experimetit lndependent Variables: a.

References CIRCULATORY AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS PREAMBLE The experiments proposed for the ORL are pre- sented on the basis of a critical review of the physi- ological mechanisms which may be affected adversely during space flight. These proposed experiments are based, partly, on the currently available results of space flight. In- flight experiments and observations in the Gemini- Apollo, Biosatellite, and MOL are considered to be sources of information that will be available during the design of the experiments. The group has interpreted an experiment to be a series of measurements and observations designed to test a hypothesis. Certain systematic observations of physiological changes during flight are necessary for monitoring and for more detailed analysis as indi- cated below. However, the justification of a space station depends on its requirement for the perform- ance of critical experiments. These critical experi- ments are related to (1) additions to knowledge made possible by features of the space environment which are unique. Prominent among these environ- mental features are: (a) low acceleration relative to the surrounding vehicle, (b) absence from the terrestrial diurnal cycle, (c) presence of a stress pat- tern not readily simulated on Earth, and (d) im- mersion in a radiation flux not simulable at ground level. These critical experiments are also related to (2) the research and development required to assess man's capability of long-term (one-year) space flight with indication of the support he may require. Conceptually, a class of experiments that seems most promising is that revolving about examination of the gain (p), feedback constant (p), and loop transfer function characteristics for the important homeostatic feedback and feedahead loops of famil- iar physiological regulatory system. In addition to experiments utilizing the normal physiological sys- tem, design here would surely seem to include open- ing the said loops or of exposing their internal 82 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY characteristics by pushing the system into the p p+1 region where \"overload\" begins to show. Although a number of specific experiments are designed to \"test\" the characteristics of the physio- logical systems, certain observations are recommended on a daily (continuous) basis to provide data which may be used in a number of data acquisition and reduction procedures. Prominent among these are heart rate, blood pressure, and ballistocardiograms related to cardiac function, and minute volume, res- piratory frequency, oxygen consumption, and arte- rial oxygen saturation related to pulmonary function. There are additional measurements which will be made on a periodic basis in the proposed experiments. Among these measurements are body mass, blood volume, hematocrit, body water, and routine urine analysis. Experiments that require minimal increases in burden of the experimental subjects with transducers or additional duties or of the vehicle with added weight, complexity, or hazards are highly desirable over manned orbital laboratory for research. Pref- erably, new experiments are most desirable if they require no new data acquisition techniques. Where new techniques are required they should be care- fully designed so as to optimize their utilization and minimize their interference and burden on the ve- hicular resources. Acquisition of this class of data is especially suited by a bioengineering system which incorporates a small, but fast, central control and processing com- puter capable of stored program control operation. A compatible slow memory of larger extent (e.g., an incremental multichannel magnetic tape recorder) is also a near requisite. With a good onboard data reduction system of adaptive type, it becomes feasible to store in a few pounds of tape a detailed running record of hun- dreds of experiments along with essentially continu- ous records of routine monitored how-goes-it in- format ion. RATIONALE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM One of the possible effects of long-duration ex- posure to the weightless environment is a deteriora- tion in cardiovascular reactivity due to absence of the usual hydrostatic stresses imposed during existence in the 1 G environment of Earth. If such deterioration does occur, it would be ex- pected to be manifest as a malfunction of one or more of the control loops responsible for homeo- static regulation of the cardiovascular system. Those loops, susceptible to hydrostatic effects such as the systems for regulation of systemic and venous blood pressure and blood volume, will presumably be sub- jected to minimum stress during exposure to zero G and hence would be most likely to deteriorate dur- ing sustained existence in this environment. Analysis of the mechanism of such deterioration could logically be divided into investigation of pos- sible alterations in the affector, the error-sensing, and the effector arms of the control loop under study. For example, one of the major control systems of arterial blood pressure is the baroreceptor (carotid sinus) system. Ideally, tests should be carried out on the static and dynamic sensitivity characteristics of the carotid sinus-transducer system in sensing shifts in arte- rial pressure away from the normal homeostatic level and transducing these shifts to the appropriate vari- ations in frequency of affector nerve impulses in the carotid sinus nerve. Similarly, it would be ideal to investigate the efi- ciency of the various effector mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of arterial pressure such as arte- riolar and venous tone or compliance and the static and dynamic capabilities of the arteriolar and venous systems to respond in an appropriate manner to effector stimuli for alteration of their caliber. Since the major concern is with the capability of man to maintain his normal function in the zero G environment and to withstand the stresses of reentry into and subsequent (ideally) immediate adaptation to the Earth environment, studies carried out on man himself will probably be most productive of the practical information required. This is particularly true since man's adaptation to the erect posture in the 1 G environment is not closely simulated in experimental animals. Investigation of cardiovascular reactivity in man in the zero G environment restricts applicable exper- 83 PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERlMENTS . imental procedures to those which carry a minimally acceptable risk of causing Other than aCCuraklY for- seeable, temporary restriction of the subject's full mental and physical capabilities. These restrictioiis preclude most academically ideal experiments in- volving opening of control loops and study of the static and dynamic characteristics of the affector, error-sensing, and effector components of the 9s- tem. This type of experimental rationale does, how- ever, provide a logical basis for desigll and nation of experiments. An attempt has been made, therefore, to design experiments with this rationale in mind, realizing that full separation of the indi- vidual components of a control loop cannot be achieved in conscious human subjects. PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES TO BE MEASURED The following list summarizes the variables which may be measured during prolonged space flight. Their priority is listed in the experiments them- selves. The purpose of this listing is to present some idea as to the extent of the equipment and techniques required for carrying out the proposed experiments and the day-to-day measurements dis- cussed in the preamble.

I), and G forces (ref. 1). The mechanisms that may be postulated include (1) reduction in blood vol- ume, (2) abnormal blood pooling, and (3) ab- normal regulatory responses. Each of these mechanisms is subject to experimental test and will serve to indicate a rational countermeasure. Russian reports and hypodynamic experiments suggest that a readjustment in fluid volumes occurs in one day. No method of determining blood volume is clearly superior. For the purposes of this dis- cussion, a dilution technique will be presented with the general characteristics of the solute and diluent. Proper experimental design will allow determination of a number of other parameters of physiological interest. A solute which is retained in the circulatory system may be in- jected in a deuterium oxide medium and blood volume and total body water determined. The determination of hematocrit is a necessary part of the experiment. Determination of the body mass will give additional data for calculation of percent body water and lean body mass. Urine volume and sodium analysis and. water intake determination will allow determination of fluid balance. Determinations should be made daily at the same time for a period of 30 days and, if pos- sible, a second determination made to deter- mine any circadian responses. (Alternative, every fifth day could be used following the first 5 days.) Postflight determinations after 30 minutes in the supine position should continue for 15 days. 5.

Body Volume It has been suggested in association with the previously discussed method of determining weight by an oscillatory method that a method for determining the volume of these by exclud- ing the volume occupied by air in the lungs would give a valuable set of additional infor- mation. A suggested method requiring minimal apparatus for accomplishing this purpose would be as follows: a relatively simple, zipper-closed enclosure (preferably translucent and with access to the zipper from the inside so as to provide minimal claustrophobia for the occupant) would be made of a very flexible and thin, but not readily stretchable, fabric, This suit, when inflated at a very low positive ambient pressure, would take up a fixed volume which could prob ably be held constant to within a few cubic centimeters. Knowing the volume of the con- tainer, the volume of the body excluding air would be available if the amount of air in the chamber were measurable. Two methods for measuring this air seem simple and practical. One would include the introduction of an ac- curately known, small incremental volume of air preferably in a sinusoidally oscillatory fashion. For example, a small cylinder of air could be discharged and reclaimed from the chamber by essentially a motor-driven hypodermic syringe of fairly large volume. Knowing the volume change and the pressure change accompanying it from a simple transducer, the volume of air would be measurable so long as the individual kept his airway open. The air in the lungs would be part of the air of the chamber and thus it could be measured. Alternatively, a tracer 86 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY 1. method could be used in which a known volume of a measurable gas is projected into the chamber and rebreathed a few cycles; a sample is then extracted to determine by dilution method the remaining air. Since the experiment would OC- cupy only a fraction of a minute or a little more, there would be no necessity for elaborate pro- vision of additional oxygen or carbon dioxide management. Experiment 1 b Assessment of Body Mass This experiment is concerned with the systematic variations in body weight over a period of days and is almost totally concerned with the provi- sion of a method of a simple, yet precise, meas- urement of body mass. Notice that it is not important that the method have high absolute accuracy as its interest is concerned mainly with changes in mass of the order of a few ounces with respect to a baseline. However, the method must be intrinsically sensitive and reproducible enough to detect changes of this order of mag- nitude. If, as has been suggested, there is interest in mass changes of the order of 20 grams, then the precision of the measurement must be sufficient to permit detection of 20 g in 80 kg or about 1 part in 4000, i.e., 1/40 of 1 %. This is not easily achieved with simple scale reading instruments. The method proposed in the experiment calls for an accelerometer meas- urement of the person when accelerated by a known force or rather a known impulse im- parted by a coil spring. While it is quite pos- sible to calibrate a spring to this precision, it is quite difficult to measure accelerations to a necessary degree of accuracy with any reasonably practical transducers. An alternative procedure which seems much simpler would be one relying on a spring to provide a known compliance when extehded to a fiducial mark but would measure the period of oscillation of a system including the experi- mental subject with the spring as a restoring force. If one assumes that a compliance is used which is sufficiently high to make a period of oscillation long with respect to the natural peri- ods of the body (i.e., long with respect to about a quarter second), then an estimate can be made of the required period of observation and the accuracy with which a cycle has to be measured. If one chooses a period of approximately 0.6 sec, then a measurement period of 1 minute would include something approaching 100 cycles of oscillation using a platform simpler, but of the same general sort, than that proposed in the experiment. The measurement required would be one of stress in the compliant element which need not be quantitative beyond rough linearity, and in a 100 cycle process it would require dis- crimination of approximately the percentage of the cycle represented by the fraction of a percent tolerable error. Thus, determination of oscil- lation to the nearest tenth of a cycle which is very easy would give a tenth of a percent ac- curacy while the previously mentioned 1/40 of 1% precision would require measurement to a fortieth of a cycle which is about 10 degrees of phase-a feasible but not completely easy task. A factor of two enters into the precision meas- urement to the square root relationship between mass and period. A special purpose device attached to a central computer designed to record the time required for 200 zero crossings of this compliant element would seem entirely suitable for this measurement and would require minimal equipment. Should there be real concern about the slight error induced through shaking of the abdominal structures, this could be detected by providing a pair of compliances and noting the two indicated masses which would differ in terms of the coupling to the movable portions of the body. EXPERIMENT 2 1. Assessnieiit of Body Mass in Real Time 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose izing these techniques. To measure fluctuation in body mass as a means Priority dependent on particular experiment util- PHASE 1I: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS * of calculating weight gain or loss. One of the major medical problems incurred by the astronauts and cosmonauts has been dehydra- tion. By means of ilaijp body niajs estinutions, it should be possible to estimate significant changes in total fluid balance. Refinement of techniques may lead to the ability to determine major shifts within large segments of the body. The subject places himself on a suitable platform fixed in the erect position. A vertical bar is firmly attached to the central point of the plat- form. At the top of the bar is a cap on a ring slide. This is fitted snugly down onto the head of the subject Below this is a cross bar at the ends of which on either side are molded shoulder pads. This is slid down and fixed over the shoulders. At about waist height on this bar are preset band bulbs which are grasped firmly by the hands. Thus it is possible to place the subject in a reproducible position for each subse- quent measurement. If a problem arises by virtue of the inertia of large internal abdominal organs it may be necessary to use the sitting position with the thighs drawn up tightly onto the abdomen. This position will compress the abdominal organs into the upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity and insure the whole body mass moving as a unit. Attached to his shoulder pads and head cap is a harness which is loose enough to allow his body mass to be displaced upward for several inches at which point it serves as a restraining mechanism and decelerates him. (The ends of the harness are fixed to appropriate plates on the floor of the capsules.) The plat- form sits on top of a spring-driven piston of exactly the same surface area which is contained in a cabinet about 1 foot square and 18 inches higher. The spring is wound to a fixed point of tension by a ratchet mechanism. A second member of the crew at a signal of readiness releases the spring tension. The impulse is transmitted by means of the piston to the plat- form on which the man is standing. This ac- celerates the subject up into the restraining harness. An accelerometer which is attached to the vertical rod to which the man has been at- tached is activated by the upward movement of 4. Justification and Rationale 5. Experiment the total mass. The meter is attached by hard wires to a suitable recording instrument. The acceleration by a fixed impulse will vary with the mass. By daily recording at a fixed time of the 24-hour cycle (on awakening, after voiding, and before eating), fluctuations in mass can be determined. It is calculated that changes in body mass of more than 0.5 Ib daily are due largely to fluid baiance iiuctuations. The metaboiic requirements for the man are in the order of 25OOKcd daily. If he eats nothing, he will have a caloric deficit of this magnitude A pound of body tissue is equivalent to 3700 cal. The estimated weight loss of maximum caloric deficit will be 25/37 or 0.66 Ib. Rapid catabolic changes will alter these figures. Necessary N2 excretion data will be available from previous flights which will enable one to make suitable corrections in the calibrations. Experimental controls will be governed by those of the experiment employing these techniques. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Spare Station Personnel Utilization of existing crew.

Purpose Pressure During the Weightless State Priority 1. To determine if the reduced stress on the circula- tory system (absence of gravity dependent hydro- dynamic effect) effects a reduction in venous compliance or reactivity to stretch (filling) or results in changes in venous pressure. Since space flights as well as experiments in the hypodynamic state and following bed rest have indicated that there is a postflight or postexperi- ment period of abnormal circulatory response to tilt (refs. 1, 2, 3), heat (ref. I), and G forces (ref. I), the mechanisms that may be postulated include (I) reduction in blood v01- ume, (2) abnormal blood pooling, and (3) ab- normal regulatory responses. Each of these mechanisms is subject to experimental test and will serve to indicate a rational counter-measure. Russian reports and hypodynamic experiments suggest that a readjustment in fluid volumes oc- curs in one day. Methods for this determination are equivocal, and effort should be made to increase the confidence in the techniques. For initial purposes, the fol- lowing are proposed: Venous compliance in flight, e.g., measure leg circumference with mercury in rubber strain gage (Whitney) and record pulse. Inflate cuff proximal to gage in 10 mm Hg pressure steps and record change in volume (refs. 4-1 3). 4. Justification and Rationale 5. Experiment 6.

Evaluation of Significance of Ballistocardiogram and/or Kinetocardiogram (Seismo or Rosa Ac- celerometer) for Estimation of Cardiac Dynam- ics in the Weightless State 2. Estimated Priority Priority 1. 3. Purpose To determine whether or not ballistocardio- graphic techniques can be used as a measure of cardiac dynamics and to extend these investiga- tions for the determination of cardiac output during various activities in weightlessness. 4. Justification An external indication of changes in stroke v01- urne (and heart rate) would serve as a useful measurement in testing effects of weightless- ness and in defining the effectiveness of coun- termeasures. The ballistocardiogram has had a series of ardent supporters, but lacks general acceptance among cardiovascular physiologists. In the weightless state certain objections to the technique may be removed. Bayevskiy (ref. 1) in Russia and Rosa in the U.S. have proposed using the principle of an accelerometer over the heart to indicate the force and duration of the stroke. 5. Experiment Appropriate ballistocardiographic devices can be mounted on selected astronauts or other space- craft personnel and the cardiac dynamics as- sessed. This assessment will be particularly valuable if made during the times in which car- diac output, as suggested in other experiments, are determined. 6. Experimental Controls While the preliminary study should be ground- based, the primary control will be the determi- nations made while cardiac outputs are being determined in the weightless environment. 7.

Changes in the Eficacy of Arterial Pressure Control Systems During Space Flight by Shifts of Blood Distribution Priority 1. To study the influence of prolonged weightless- ness on the integrity of the reflex and humeral control mechanisms which integrate and sustain the circulation. This is a necessary piece of knowledge relative to the safety of prolonged space travel. There is evidence from American and Russian expe- rience in weightless states over a long period of time that a loss of blood pressure control de- velops, and there is at least transient postural hypotension. It is interesting to note that this has been noted to occur with a diminished or absent excretion of norepinephrine. Ground- 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification based experiments on individuals in the sub- merged states also indicate similar results. Procedures will be used to shift the blood vol- ume in the astronauts by means of simple ex- perimental techniques. Under normal circum- stances, such a shift would require a readjust- ment in vasomotor activity to maintain arterial blood pressure and circulatory inadequacy. If the normal mechanisms are not operative, under the test conditions blood pressure and circula- tory adequacy will be disrupted. The initial test situations will be (I) a calibrated Valsalva procedure (Flack Test) which pro- duces an increase in intrathoracic pressure and, in turn, peripheral pooling of blood; (2) the inflation of blood pressure cuffs about three extremities, two legs and one arm to provide one free arm for measurements (The cuffs will be inflated to 60 millimeters of mercury pressure 5. Experiment PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 93 . for a period of 10 minutes.); and (3) other ficial gravity\" may be used in later stages of this experiment. Proposed protocol: A minimum of 4 subjects will be studied. The first control observation will be made prior to orbital conditions. Arte- rial pressure will be measured by the customary 43 technique and heart rate accurately timed. Control observations will be made after the subject has been supine for a minimum of 20 minutes. Then, the test procedure will be ap- plied, pressures and heart rates again measured, and, following this, additional control observa- tions will be obtained. The entire experiment will be repeated a minimum of 3 times prior to orbital flight, the procedure will be repeated 1 then, 1 time per week unless circulatory diffi- culties develop. On return to Earth, the ob- servations will be made as soon as possible and repeated at 2-hour intervals, insofar as possible, during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, they will be made 1 time per day for the first 2 weeks, although this may be modified depending upon the test results. 6.

Predictive Tests to Assess Ability of Vasomotor System to Readjust to Reentry Stress and Re- accommodation to Terrestrial Gravity Priority 1. To measure the secretion response of catechola- mines to standardized stress such as hypoxia and/or thermal stimuli. 4. ]ustificati,on and Rationale It has been noted that with increasing time in orbit there has been a degradation of the vaso- motor response after return to 1 G. It has been found that in ground-simulated experiments of prolonged bed rest that there is a disappearance of catecholamines and their metabolic end prod- ucts from the blood and urine of the subjects. It is known that under conditions of hypoxia (about 1.4 psi of 0,) there is a marked increase in the circulating catecholamines. It is assumed that if there is an adequate catecholamine re- sponse by an astronaut in orbit to a measured stress that he has sufficient responsiveness to tolerate reentry stress and return to 1 G. At a given time each day while the astronaut is in orbit, he will stress himself by a suitable tech- nique chosen from a series to be ground-tested by bed rest simulation. These stresses may be hypoxia, alternating hot and cold exposure in the new pressure suits, etc. After the stress, the astronaut voids into a container. A simple tab- let containing ingredients similar to those for the DOPPA test is put into the urine. A posi- tive color reaction indicates an adequate respon- siveness. A negative color would be an indica- tion of abort. Ground simulation testing to determine validity of response. Since the test will be carried out daily, a diminution in excretion can be detected early. 2. E;timated Priority 3. Purpose 5. Experiment 6. Experimental Controls 7.

Estimated Priority Priority 1. ~~ -~ PHASE It: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 95 3. Purpose As a measure of circulatory integrity, the ability of the heart to respond to stressful situations under prolonged weightless states is an impor- tant component of circulatory reflex integration. Maintenance of circulatory function in prolonged weightless states is of great importance in the survival of astronauts during prolonged space travel. New aspects become of critical impor- tance in the integration of the circulation on return to Earth. The response of the circulation to a stimulus that increases cardiac output under usual circum- stances will be studied in the weightless state. The stimulus to increase cardiac output will be (1) exercise and (2) reactive hyperemia. The experimental plan calls for 4 subjects. Observations will be carried out on Earth and repeated daily in orbit for the first week, then 1 time per week until return to Earth where they will be repeated once a week until the values have stabilized. The experimental plan will indude control Observations of cardiac out- put at rest, then under the stress of exercise, and will be followed with observations at rest. 6.

Study of Possible Effects of the Weightless En- vironments on the Sensitivity of the Carotid Sinus Arterial Pressure Control Loop Priority 1. To study the effect of the weightless environ- ment on the sensitivity of the carotid sinus arter- ial blood pressure control loop. It is generally believed that one of the possible major effects of a weightless environment will be a decrement in cardiovascular reactivity asso- ciated with the absence of the usual gravita- tional hydrostatic stresses which this system must withstand on Earth. The Baroreceptor carotid sinus mechanism is one of the major control loops responsible for the regulation of systemic arterial pressure and hence its sensitivity might possibly be altered by the relative disuse of the system during existence in the zero gravity state. An objective and quanti- tative test of the sensitivity and reactivity of this system which could be applied both in the 1 G and the zero G environment would make possible collection of firm data in this regard. If positive results were obtained during the zero gravity state by means of this procedure, there would be a significant probability that the test could be used as an objective means of assessing the severity of this hypodynamic state as well as the efficacy of various types of counter measures. An increase in transmural pressure which in- creases the tension and hence tends to lengthen 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification 5. Experiment the stretch receptors in the wall of the carotid sinus is the usual stimulus which will produce an increment in activity of the carotid sinus mechanism. An increase in transmural pressure in the carotid sinuses can be produced by applying a known degree of subambient (negative) pressure to the neck. This has been done by Drs. J. Ern- sting and D. J. Parry in Farnsborough, England, (Journal of Physiology 137: 45-46, 1957), and confirmed and extended by Drs. John Shephard and Sture Bevegard at the Mayo Foundation using specially fabricated neck casts made of transparent plastic lucite. Subambient pressures surrounding the neck ranging up to 50 to 60 cm H,O can be produced at will and are fol- lowed promptly by a decrease in heart rate and systemic arterial pressure and an increase in forearm blood flow, the magnitude of which is dependent on the degree of negative pressure. It is proposed to study this reaction in detail in selected astronauts preflight in the 1 G state and alter varying periods of weightlessness. If a decrement in sensitivity of the carotid sinus mechanism is demonstrable in the weightless environment, then the effects on this decrement of various possible countermeasures, such as graded degrees of exercise, application of nega- tive pressure to the body caudad to the dia- phragm, or large amplitude body oscillation (exercises on a double-ended trampoline) will be studied. Procedure: In preflight, 1 G studies and ob- servations would be made in the supinehorizon- tal position under controlled ambient conditions PHASE 11: IN-FLKHT hlEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 97 after one-half hour period of recumbency. These observations will be repeated at selected intervals after the launch phase of the flight. The first ex- periment should be performed within 24 hours after launch if possible. These observations should be repeated abcui ei~rj: 48 how5 foi the first 1 or 2 weeks and approximately once a week there- after, depending on the results obtained. If positive evidence of cardiovascular deteriora- tion is obtained, the experiments should be re- peated at selected intervals after return to Earth to delineate the recovery phase from the hypo- dynamic site. Neck cast with seals around base of head and neck-shoulder junction regions will need to be indiridual!~ fabricated and fitted for each subject. Periods of negative pressure of 60 seconds duration will be used. Measurements: a. Priority I (1) Heart rate continuously for 15 sec prior to, during, and 60 sec after period of negative pressure. (2) Respiratory amplitude continuously for same period. (3) Arterial pressure by auscultatory or di- rect method for same period. (4) Intermittent measurements of forearm blood flow (plethysmograph) for same period. b. Phrity 2 (priority based on judgment of technical difficulty of measurement and the value of the data obtained) (1) Cardiac output (just prior to period of negative pressure to neck and during last 30 sec of period of negative pressure). (2) Venous pressure via the catheter or needle used to inject the circulatory indi- cator. (3) Measurement of compliance of fore- arm veins (plethysmograph). (4) Repetition of experiment during circu- latory stress associated with exercise. 6.

Study of Possible Efects of the Weightless En- vironment on the Susceptibility of the Cardio- vascular System to a Hydrostatically Simulated Upright Position Priority 1. To study the effect of the weightless environ- ment on the capability of the cardiovascular sys- tem tocompensate for simulated hydroastatic effects. It is generally believed that one of the possible major effects of a weightless environment will be a decrement in cardiovascular reactivity asso- ciated with the absence of the usual gravita- tional hydrostatic stresses which this system must withstand on Earth. It has been demonstrated by Dr. David Green- field that application of subambient pressure to the body surface caudad to the diaphragm pro- duces a stress and consequent reactions of the cardiovascular system which are similar to effects of exposure to positive acceleration or to being tilted upright in the normal (1 G) environment. If positive results were obtained during the zero gravity state by means of this procedure, there would be significant probability that the test could be used as an objective means of detecting the onset of a decrement in cardiovascular re- activity and as a means of assessing the severity of this hypodynamic state. There is also a sig- nificant probability, if it is demonstrated that 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose 4. Justification countermeasures are required, that this procedure would be an excellent countermeasure to prevent deterioration of cardiovascular reactivity due to the absence in the weightless state of the normal hydrostatic stresses associated with existence in the 1 G environment of Earth. An effective decrease in resistance to blood flow to dependent portions of the body and increase in the level of venous pressure in dependent veins required to return blood to the heart are the essential effects of being tilted upright at 1 G or exposure to positive acceleration which con- stitute a stress to the cardiovascular system. These effects of the upright tilt as well as weight- bearing by the lower extremities can be simul- ated as follows: the lower body is enclosed, in the supine position, in a rigid, elongated (rec- tangular or cylindrical) container sealed around the lower rib margin by a rubber diaphragm and with the feet resting on a block of suitable thickness to contact the opposite end of the container. Subambient pressure of about 40 to 60 cm H,O is created in the container by con- necting it to a high volume level vacuum source such as a vacuum cleaner mechanism. The negative pressure over the entire lower surface of the body created in this fashion accelerates arterial inflow to the lower body and hinders the return of blood from the caudad portions of the vascular system to the heart. Dr. David Greenfield has demonstrated that this results in 5. Experiment ZOO MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY compensatory cardiovascular reactions similar to those produced by the upright tilt or exposure to positive acceleration. It is proposed to study these reactions in detail in selected astronauts preflight in the 1 G state and after varying periods of weightlessness. If a decrement in cardiovascular reactivity to this type of simulated hydrostatic stress is demon- strable in the weightless environment, then the effects on this decrement of various possible countermeasures, such as graded degrees of ex- ercise, repeated applications of negative pressure to the lower body, or large amplitude body oscillation (exercise on a double-ended tram- poline), will be studied. Parenthetically, the negative pressure produces a force tending to push the body into the con- tainer. This force amounts to a pound per square inch of cross sectional body area at the point of seal per 52 mm Hg of subambient pressure. For instance, an individual whose lower thorax was 31.4 inches in circumference would experience a caudad force supported by his lower extremities of about 78.9 pounds. This may have some effect on the presumed muscle and skeletal wasting effects of the weight- less environment. Procedure: Lower body containers of minimum volume and optimum design in relation to weight, configuration and ease of obtaining a seal around the lower thorax will be designed and fabricated for interchangeable use between subjects. A suitable high-volume, low-vacuum source with suitable rapid disconnect connec- tions to the lower-body container will be ob- tained. In pre-flight 1 G studies, observations would be made in the supine-horizontal position under controlled ambient conditions after one- half hour period of recumbency. Periods of negative pressure of 20 or more sec- onds will be used. These observations will be repeated at selected intervals after the launch phase of the flight. The initial experiment should be performed during the first 24 hours after launch if possible. These observations should be repeated about each 48 hours there- after the first 1 or 2 weeks and approximately weekly thereafter depending on the results obtained. If positive evidence of cardiovascular deteriora- tion is obtained the experiment should be re- peated at selected intervals after return to earth to delineate. the recovery process. * Measurements: a. Priority 1 (1) Heart rate continuously for 15 sec prior to, during, and 60 sec after period of negative pressure. (2) Respiratory amplitude continuously for same period.

Respiratory muscles normally are opposed by the weight of the viscera in expiration and the 4. Itistifiration weight of the chest and thorax in inspiration. Absence of gravity may lead to shifts in lung volume (particularly to a decrease in FRC, with an accompanying probatory of atelectasis) and may increase airway resistance, the latter result- ing from decreased tissue pull on the conducting airways. Possibly, decreased work of the respir- atory muscles may lead to a decrease in muscle strength. These studies will also be helpful in medical care of the astronaut.

The effect, particularly long-term, of zero G upon 104 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY this control system is not known. An example of a possible derangement is a reduction in respiratory minute volume, particularly while asleep, owing to a reduction in sensory inflow. An alteration in alveolar ventilation can cause disability whether it is raised or lowered. 5.

A cough cannot increase the velocity of air flow in the finer airways sufficiently to expel1 particu- late matter. If the ciliary action is changed or the secretion altered so that this cleansing mech- anism is less effective, damage to the lung may result. Below the respiratory bronchiole, foreign particulates are carried away by macrophages. While this should be investigated at some point, intuitively there is less likelihood of an effect of zero G. Experiment Measure the clearance of labeled particles from the lungs of animals. A labeled dust of a size that will deposit largely in the airways, rather than in the alveoli, will be chosen by experi- ment and introduced into the lungs of a con- venient animal (rat or mouse). The animals will be sacrificed and the clearance of the par- ticles from the lung followed over a month. Experimental Controls A similar study will be done on the ground be- fore launching.

The clearance of particulate matter from the lung has not been well-studied, and no good methods are available for man.

The type of animal, the dose of aerosol, the number of ani- mals, and the times of sampling will depend on the results of these studies. The classical stud- ies on ciliary motion in fresh specimens of tracheae in vitro should be repeated to investi- gate the effect of orientation in relation to 1 G on ciliary motion and mucus flow.

To Devise and Evaluate Analytical Techniques for the Assay of Blood (Urine, Sweat, and Saliva) for Components of Significance in the Maintenance of Honieostasis in Circulation and Respiration 012 the Ground and During Short Orbital Flights 2. Estimated Priority Generally, these experiments should rate first priority, since without analytical techniques one cannot obtain the data required for mainte- nance of the personnel and for other experi- ments. 3. Purpose In the condition of weightlessness, certain con- ventional techniques present problems which may be avoided by designing analytical proce- dures so that the force of gravity is not neces- sary. Thus, pipetting in the conventional man- ner cannot be used. An open container for liquids is impractical in the weightless state. In preparing for a long-range stay in orbit, the weight of the reagents and equipment to be used must be minimized. Ideally, techniques which require no reagents are to be preferred. Sample size for assay should be at a minimum. These limitations must not decrease the accu- racy and precision obtainable with conventional techniques. 4. ]rislificdon The level of certain blood components needs to be monitored from time to time and during the performance of certain experiments while in the weightless state. A significant change which is noted and recorded in certain blood components during the mission may anticipate profound changes which may eventually be disastrous to crew performance. Thus, techniques should be available for these components of blood which are simple and rapid so that they may be avail- able for interpretation by the medical team both on the ground and in space. 5. Experiments Obtaining the sample: a. Syringe or vacutainer: For some purposes such as obtaining blood volume, extra- cellular and total body water and arterial pressure, it may be necessary to enter the vein or artery. At these times, samples of blood may be sampled for analysis. Con- ventional techniques are probably satisfac- tory for this purpose. b. For repetitive analysis: It is recommended that a capillary tube be developed for fin- ger, toe, or ear prick. Specifications for these capillaries should be chosen after ground-based experiments, and for early tests in space before the orbital research laboratory program is put into effect. This tube could have such a design that the tube itself acts as the puncturing device, collector, measuring device, and cuvette for analysis. Heat- and fracture-resistant glass is recommended. Plastic that is wetted by water is not omitted from consideration. it is suggested that a capiilary be dwel- oped with a sharpened end similar to that of a hypodermic needle but transparent, of a light absorbency (in the visible near in- frared and near ultraviolet which is the same from tube to tube within +2%), 108 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY and of a constant bore, length, and outer diameter so that the volume contained is constant. The volume contemplated is of the order of 20 to 50 microliters. This capillary, for certain purposes, may be embedded in a small container of flexible plastic so that it may be emptied by posi- tive pressure if necessary. In Figure 1, when pressure is applied at A (with the finger closing the opening at the top), the sample will be ejected. The capillary may be metal-tipped for a sharper cutting edge without danger of fragmentation. This system can also be used for sampling (quantitatively) urine, sweat, or saliva. It is suggested, therefore, that samples for analysis be obtained by finger prick and by placing the capillary at the puncture SO as to let the blood flow into the capillary. An alternative method is to prick the fin- ger with a blade and use an ordinary capil- lary, square on both ends, to sample the blood. FIGURE 1 Experiment: The development of a suitable capillary system is subject to ground-based de- velopment; however, the best technique for ob- taining the specimen can only be decided after attempts are made during weightlessness to ob- tain the specimen. Thus, the use of the capil- lary as a means of obtaining and delivering a measured amount of blood is recommended as - an experiment to be carried out during short orbital flights. It should be pointed out that capillary blood is essentially arterial blood (93%), and a good estimate of arterial oxygen saturation can be obtained from capillary blood. Hematocrit value: Development: Develop a small, lightweight hematocrit centrifuge with a stroboscope attach- ment coupled to a linear scale so that the capil- lary full of blood can be observed during cen- trifugation. Removal of the capillary from the centrifuge during weightlessness will resuspend the cells. Thus, measurements must be made during centrifugation. At the same time, the length of the upper coat of leucocytes may be examined and measured for gross evidence of abnormality. Experiment: Test the instrument under weightless conditions in preorbital flights for evidence of its practicability. Hemoglobin and oxygen saturation: Development: A small lightweight colorime- ter, capable of taking measurements at two spe- cific wavelengths, needs to be developed. The capillary full of blood is inserted and a meas- urement is made at an isobestic point for deter- mining grams of hemoglobin and at another wavelength peak for oxyhemoglobin for its ab- sorbence. From these two values, a table can be constructed for giving the percentage of oxy- hemoglobin. If a spectrophotometer is contem- plated for other purposes, then an adapter for holding the capillary is all that needs to be developed. Experiment: Test this instrument in the state of weightlessness for practicability in preorbital flights. Other chemical components of blood ,or plasma development: In order to avoid the need for reagent bottles to be carried into space, a gen- eral technique is hereby proposed for develop- ment. An ideal method would be one where the cap- illary is touched to a piece of filter paper, the filter paper containing the reagents and devel- oping a color which can be quantitatively meas- ured. This cannot be done with serum or blood because they are colored and because the addi- PHASE Ii: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 109 tion of a fluid to a piece of paper washes the reagent out of the field, producing chromato- graphic rings and uneven spots. Further, the presence of cells or proteins vitiates the tests in many-cases. For this reason, the following 9s- tem is proposed for development and is illus- trated in Figure 2. a. Top view b. Side view Confining wax circle Filter paper J FIGURE 2. The sampler from the capillary is blown onto a piece of filter paper containing a spot confined by a wax circle. This retains the specimen in a definite area. As an alternative, the blood is placed directly onto the cellophane (or cel- lulose acetate). The paper with the sample is placed on a porous sheet (cellophane) underneath which is a reagent paper. When pressure is applied, the proteins will be retained and an ultrafiltrate of plasma passes through to the reagent tape. The color produced on the reagent tape is a measure of the component being tested. The three tapes are contained in a polyethylene or polypropylene bag. A press plate for timing the period of pressing in order to obtain repro- ducibility will be necessary. This would be hand-operated with a timer which releases the pressure after a fixed time. The Eeagent tape could then be torn off and placed in a colorime- ter for evalaution of the spot. For whole blood sugar, urea, uric acid, pH, creatine, and creatinine, this system would be satisfactory. From plasma, obtained by centrifuging the cap- illaries and cutting at the plasma-cell interface, sodium, calcium, phosphate, potassium, &lo- rine, CO,, pH, and other values could be ob- tained. If the porous tape is made of thin teflon so as to permit only gas exchange, Go, and Po, could be measured from whole blood. If the porous tape is perforated so as to let protein through, For the elements, the bottom tape can be simple filter paper, using the technique of x-ray spec- trometry for assay. As an alternative, a thin layer of cellophane or cellulose acetate is placed on a reagent paper. A drop of blood from the finger is touched to the cellophane. After a short time (1 min), the blood can be washed off or lifted off with the cellophane. The stain below will vary in size, but the intensity will be a function of the concentrations of the element sought. The stain can then be evaluated by comparison with a color chart or by reading in the spectrophotom- eter with a beam of light narrower than the stain as shown in Figure 3. rl. ulcll -- iota: pi&& and aibumin could be assayed. a.

Experiment: Evaluate the instrumentation discussed above during short orbital flights for practicability. Body water and blood volume: Development: Evans blue dye, dissolved in deuterium oxide, may be satisfactory as a tracer for these studies. It is recommended that the deuterium be assayed by either gas chromatog- raphy or by osmotic pressure measurements with instrumentation available. Experiment: Attempt to evaluate these tech- niques in flights prior to the ORL flight. Corticosteroids and catecholamines: Urine and blood specimens should be stored for assay on the ground.

METABOLIC, DIGESTIVE, NEUROMUSCULAR, FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE, RENAL, THERMOREGULATORY, REPRODUCTIVE, AND ENDOCRINE FUNCTIONS The five experiments proposed in this section are concerned with testing the reaction to prolonged space flight of several systems of the body which are vitally concerned, at the least, with ability to maintain effective working capacity and, in some instances, with ability to maintain life itself. For this reason they are among the more important studies proposed for ORL. Important preliminary information on the reac- tion of these systems to weightlessness and to cer- tain other stressewonfinement, threat of danger, thermal and circadian rhythm changes, monotony- will be obtainable from earlier flights and certain ground-based studies. However, the resistance of the body to or its ability to adjust to and compen- sate for these stresses in flights lasting for weeks or months can best, if not only, be determined by lengthy and precise observations in an orbiting lab- oratory environment. The vital functions and reactions principally to be examined in these experiments are (1) biochemi- cal or metabolic processes affecting energy expendi- ture; utilization of protein, fat and carbohydrate; and acid-base metabolism, all very important for efficient physical and mental function; (2) mineral metabolic processes which, if sufficiently and con- tinuously deranged, could lead to dangerous thin- ning of the skeleton and possibly to urinary tract stone formation; (3) fluid and electrolyte metabolism and kidney function because of the vital necessity to maintain normal water balance and electrolyte equilibrium and to preserve kidney function for the effective elimination of body wastes; (4) ability of the body's temperature regulatory mechanisms to maintain normal body temperature without undue loss of fluid or other incapacity; and (5) the ability of the body's endocrine glands to make appropriate hormonal responses to the stresses of space flight and to continue indefinitely to provide effective modula- tion of essential physiologic functions. EXPERIMENT 1 1. Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various effects of various stresses of prolonged space Metabolic Functions flight on energy, protein, carbohydrate, and 2. Estimated Priority acid-base metabolism. Although certain meta- Priority 1. bolic changes can be predicted qualitatively, 3. Purpose there is need to know the quantitative asws To determine the qualitative and quantitative of metabolic derangement with respect to rate, 112 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY 4. pattern, and degree, and, further, to learn whether man's metabolism after some or con- siderable alteration will come into a steady-state physiologically or become medically compatible with long space flight. Knowing the kinds aqd magnitudes of these derangements, the next step will be to determine the relative effective- ness of corrective or preventive measures, if needed. The stress primarily involved in this experiment is weightlessness, but in the initial stages of flight, at least, and in the first ORL flights there will be combined stress effects of confinement, threat of danger, thermal stress and circadian rhythm changes; less likely to exert effects will be the stresses of monotony, social restriction, toxic substances, and noise. The relative importance of some of these secondary stresses can be determined in either prior or subsequent ground-based studies. Iustijication Prior detailed studies on the ground (Deit- rick, Whedon, Shorr, and others) of the effects of immobilization or confinement to bed had shown significant, and in some respects, strik- ing alterations in a variety of metabolic func- decline excretion of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium (resulting in negative balance depending upon the dietary intake level of the clement), impaired carbohydrate toler- ance, and altered creatine metabolism. Con- versely, in the Walter Reed rotating room pro- viding 0.2 to 0.3 + G, increased carbohydrate clearance has been reported. The question is whether or not the greatly diminished effect of gravity and greater physical disuse associated with weightlessness in comparison to immo- bilization will result in greater disturbance in metabolic functions, perhaps in some instances to an extent incompatible with effective per- formance unless corrective or preventive meas- ures are devised and instituted. With respect to acid-base metabolism, the ques- tion is raised as to whether reduced movement or immobility associated with weightlessness may result in reduced chest ventilatory move- ment leading to hypercapnia. This event, if it occurred, would lead to a respiratory acidosis ' which would tend to have. significant outward 5 effects on muscle metabolism and bone. If hy- percapnia is found to develop, discussion and investigation should be undertaken with respect to the possibility that allowing the carbon diox- ide in cabin atmosphere to reach approximately 0.5% might be a useful ventilatory stimulant. It has been suggested that many of the proc- esses of intermediary metabolism may be grav- ity or weight dependent, normal function de- pending on directional orientation of subcellular particles. Although this rather fundamental question should be answered by studies with simpler life forms in earlier space flights, it would be important to find out if the phenome- non held in higher species and might, in part, be responsible for disorders of metabolic func- tion. Experiment Procedure: The human subjects under study would all have to be under well-controlled meta- bolic observation for an appropriate control phase prior to flight in ORL and for a similar postcontrol phase following return to Earth. These control phases should each extend for a minimum of 2 weeks during which all of the same tests and measurements should be made as would be made during ORL flight; prior to beginning of the actual control phase, some time would have to be devoted to \"shake-down\" of the various procedures and orientation of subjects and of directly-participating staff per- sonnel. Throughout all phases of the study, control of the metabolic intake will be essen- tially by keeping dietary intake as constant as possible and recording it and fluid intake with complete accuracy. Collection of all urine (or appropriate aliquots thereof) and stool speci- mens will be required, and some attention must be given to collection of sweat since important losses of metabolic constituents can occur by this route. Serial blood samples at minimal volumes will also be needed. The procedure employed in this experiment should be planned so that experiments on endocrine function, on skeletal function (or mineral metabolism), and on fluids and electrolytes can be carried out si- multaneously and in direct association. Measzri.ements: a. Enerpy metabolism: Although it has been PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 113 suggested that the total energy metabolism of all occupants of the ORL craft could be measured by determining the rates of utiliza- tion of oxygen as supplied from the oxygen tanks and of carbon dioxide as picked up by the onboard carbon dioxide scrubbers and making a correction for the determined leak rate of the craft at the existing pressure dif- ferential, a much more accurate and finite de- termination of energy mettahnlic rater (for specific individuals and during specific activi- ties) can be made by placing onboard elec- tronic continuous stream gas analyzers for O2 and CO, and making continuous expired air collections at desired intervals. Reasonably accurate determinations of 24-hour total en- ergy metabolism can be made from short measurements of sample determinations; the \"sample activities during the day\" are ob- tained by a detailed time-and-motion study log, which will permit energy metabolism observation over a few hours to be an accu- rate representation of a 24-hour day. In this method the O2 and COz content of the in- spired cabin air also has to be made at fre- quent intervals. From the ratio of oxygen and CO, utilized, R.Q. can be calculated for any desired interval, activity, etc., corrected for urinary nitrogen excretion, and the \"meta- bolic mixture\" (quantitative proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrate being burned) for the interval precisely determined. b. Nitrogen metabolism: In order to assess the extent of possible muscle wasting related to inactivity and weightlessness, nitrogen bal- ance would be determined by analyses of urines and stools and knowledge of the pro- tein intake, an effort being extended to keep the latter relatively constant. Urinary nitro- gen would be analyzed on a 24-hour basis for balance determinations, but in shorter aliquots in conjunction with energy metabolism deter- minations. c. Cdrbohydrate and fat metabolisnz: Intra- venous glucose tolerance tests, 30-minute in- fusion of 1 gm glucose per kilogram body weight, blood samples for glucose every 30 minutes for 3 hours. Frequency of test ap- proximately weekly, 3 such tests in control phase, and 2 in postcontrol phase. These tests can be combined with serial sampling of serum phosphorus and with continuous expired air oxygen and carbon dioxide analyses for R.Q. to give significantly more meaningful infor- mation on carbohydrate metabolism. In ad- dition, by the time minutely detailed protocols are required, methodology for determining metabolism of labeled sugars (carbon-14 in the one ad SLY cdxn psiitionsj r~ay be more advanced and be practicable in ORL cabin studies. With development of onboard experimental technology, glucose intravenous tolerance tests can be performed at weekly intervals during flight. Changes in fat me- tabolism should also be investigated pre- and postflight, and in-flight if feasible, by analy- ses of blood free fatty acids (FFA). This index of fat metabolism shouId also be meas- ured in association with changes in blood glucose in response to infusions of insulin and glucose and could be carried out in conjunction with analyses of expired air oxygen and car- bon dioxide for R.Q. in association with in- fusions of insulin and glucose. Measure- ments of changes in the blood level of growth hormone in association with these studies will also be practicable by the time these studies are ready to be flown (see experiment enti- tled EfJects of Prolonged Space Flight on Neuroendocrine Function). d. Hepatic function: In view of the possi- bility of an impairment of blood supply to and through the liver from confinement, weightlessness, or both, certain relatively eas- ily performed tests of hepatic function should be carried out at 1 to 2 week intervals:-BSP retention, serum protein profile, and certain serum enzymes to be selected at a later time in accordance with what seems pertinent in the light of most recent knowledge. e. Arid-base metabolimz: In view of the pos- sible development of some degree of hyper- capnia, periodic analyses of serum should be made for pH and pC02 and of urine for tri- tratable acidity and chloride. f. Mineral metabolism: The importance of measurements in this area of metabolism is unusual and will be dealt with in a separate experiment. 114 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY g. Body compoJition: Of considerable assist- ance to evaluation of energy metabolism ob- servations will be measurements of body com- position with respect to lean body mass, total fat, etc. The key measurements are total body water, body volume, and body weight (vide infra) from which the various compartments can be calculated by standard formulae. De- termination of lean body mass by whole body counting for the natural radioactive element of. potassium does not seem practical with presently available methods, but may later prove feasible. h. Body r'weight\": This is a critical and difi- cult measurement under the conditions of space flight. Since an object literally does not have weight in space, the mass of the body equivalent to what it would have under conditions of Earth gravity will have to be determined with an inertial technique (to be developed) using the fact that time period of oscillation of an object suspended between springs is a function of its mass. A varia- tion of this method which has been suggested would use the time and distance the subject moves, suspended between springs, from a motionless start as set in motion by a Cali- brated impulse. In addition to assessment of mass changes related to metabolism, this meas- urement will be very useful for determining changes in fluid balance. 6. Experimental Controls Control is built into the procedure of the experi- ment by preflight and postflight control phases, each subject in effect serving as his own con- trol. In addition, however, prior ground-based studies of the effects of immobilization or con- finement serve as control studies for the effects of weightlessness. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Station Personnel Trained astronauts will serve satisfactorily as subjects. Laboratory technicians will be needed to the extent that laboratory analyses can be performed in the weightless state. One tech- nician who is well-trained in operation of the continuous gas analyzers (competence in elec- tronic maintenance), body volume determina- tor, and other metabolic procedures will defi- nitely be required. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment , Required Basic equipment required is that for collection and storage of blood, urine and stool specimens, preparation of urine aliquots, accurate recording and labeling of all specimens, and recording of fluid intake and all food items consumed. Also required are (1) electronic continuous gas analyzers for O2 and CO,, (2) recorders or devices for telemetering to ground data from the analyzers, (3) solutions and necessary in- fusion apparatus for intravenous glucose toler- ance tests, (4) body volume determination (a box of known volume in which subject is placed for brief period while volume of space sur- rounding the subject's body is determined by dilution of a known injected volume of an inert gas, usually helium), and (5) apparatus for determining body mass. None. 10. Summary of Other Living Forms None. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determinations Minimum requirements will be in line with equipment described under 8-specimen (blood, urine, stool) collection, recording of food and fluid intake, etc., requiring 1 to 5 minutes sev- eral times a day; continuous expired air gas analyses (detailed protocol to be developed) but 20 minutes to 4 hours per determination for certain subjects approximately 1 to 2 times per week; i.v. carbohydrate tolerance requiring parts of 3 hours at intervals to be determined; body volume and total body water requiring parts of 2 hours approximately every 2 weeks; and body \"weight\" requiring a few minutes daily. Whether or not additional analyses (nitrogen or excreta, hepatic function test samples, etc.) will be done will depend on the relative fea- sibility of the proposed onboard laboratory an- alytic function within capacity versus capability of transferring specimens to the ground where the analyses can be done much more simply. 12.

Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Mineral 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose Metabolism and Bone Densitometry Priority 1. To determine the pattern, rate, and degree of mineral loss from the skeleton associated with weightlessness and inactivity in prolonged space flight. Prior detailed studies of the effects of immobiliza- tion in bed (ref. 1 ) , confirmed in several recent 4. Justification observations, have shown an increase in urinary calcium excretion to more than double the con- trol level, an increase in fecal calcium excretion, and development of negative calcium balance at moderate levels of mineral intake. Although demineralization of the skeleton was not de- monstrable in the 6 to 7 weeks of immobilization with the techniques of x-ray visualization of the skeleton then available, studies of the immobiliza- tion associated with paralytic poliomyelitis (ref. 2) showed definite decrease in bone density in paralyzed lower extremities within 2 months ; 116 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY and confinement studies of normal subjects cur- rently in progress have implied demonstrable decrease in bone density of the os calcis within a few weeks. It is extremely important to deter- mine whether this demineralizing process will occur at the same or a more rapid rate under conditions of weightlessness, in which the stress and strain of weight bearing, muscle pull on periosteum, and likely changes in circulation to bone are expected to be maximally oriented toward increased bone resorption (ref. 3). An associated significant problem is whether the factors favoring the development of urinary tract gravel or calculi will be significantly enhanced by weightlessness and associated inactivity. Al- though the anticipated increase in urinary cal- cium and phosphorus have commanded maximal attention in relation to the stone problem, other metabolic constituents of the urine are now re- garded as having equal or more important sig- nificance with respect to stone matrix formation and crystalline deposition, and these must be intensively investigated. 5. Experiment Procediire: Identical to that described for the experiment entitled EfJects of Prolonged Spare Flight on Variorrs Metabolic Fmrtions, which also will be utilized for the experiments entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Fluid and Electrolyte Metabolism and Effects of Prolonged Spare Flight on Neuroendocrine Function. Measurements: a. Mineral t)zetabolisni: In association with the regulation of relative constancy of dietary intake and urine and stool collections of the experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various Metabolic Functions, calcium and phosphorus intake will be stabilized and recorded and urinary and stool calcium and phosphorus measured for determinations of calcium and phosphorus balance. For possible utilization of bone-seeking isotopes in conjunc- tion with balance studies, see the experiment proposed by Dr. Grahn as a method of assess- ment of rates of mineral loss from the skele- ton (Determination of Bone Demineraliza- tion During Prolonged Space Flights). Kinetic studies using radioactive calcium- 45 or 47 of turnover, pool size, and \"bone formation rate\" or \"accretion rate\" could be performed prior to, during, and post-ORL * flight, but it is not clear at this time that such studies would significantly add to the informa- tion obtained from balance measurements ; such radioisotopic kinetic studies, however, should be brought into consideration for pos- sible later ORL flights. Serum calcium, phos- phorus, and alkaline phosphatase should be measured approximately four times preflight, approximately weekly during flight, and four times during the postflight control phase. b. Bone densi/onzetry: The technology of bone densitometry is in rapid flux at the present time, and it is difficult to define a specific protocol for an experiment to take place some years in the future. Minimal recommendation at the present time is that at least 4 determina- tions of bone density during the ground-based control must be made at each of 4 sites: (1) os calcis, (2) distal end of ulna, (3) lateral of vertebral body L-3, and (4) neck of femur, using a collimated x-ray radiation source, an aluminum graduated wedge on the film, and a scanning technique for determination of density of bone areas and correction of the latter for superimposed soft tissue density. Four additional measurements within a period of 2 to 3 days should be made at each of the sites mentioned immediately following return to Earth. The possibility of taking x-ray films for bone densitometry in flight has been con- sidered, but the weight and volume require- ments for this technique preclude this at the present time. Under development is a tech- nique utilizing iodine-125 as a radiation source, which would have a great advantage with respect to weight to be carried on the space craft and would be practical from this point of view ; current disadvantages of this new technique are (1) the several minutes required for the radiatioa source to scan across the body part being viewed so that the body part must be kept immobile for a long period and (2) the fact that the technique can be applied only to extremities. It is hoped that within 1 year a reliable and reproducible bone densitometry technique will be available which will be suitable for this experiment. c. Factors related to urinary tract stone forma- tion: Measurement in urine specimens already . planned to be collected prior to, during and after flight of pyrophosphate, magnesium, manganese, zinc, and various mucoproteins and related biocolloids (refs. 5, 6). 6.

In addition, however, prior ground- bawd stidits of &e c5a<s of iiiiobLviE~tkii or confinement serve as control studies for the ef- fects of weightlessness. 7.

Determination of Bone Demineralization Dur- 2. Estimated Priority 3. Purpose ing Prolonged Space Flight Priority 1. To detect the time and quantity of calcium mo- bilization from the skeleton during prolonged flight and to anticipate any physiological com- plications therefrom as they may occur during orbital flight or reentry. Calcium is known to be withdrawn from bone during periods of bed rest and during periods of weightlessness. The results of this may have serious effects upon the structural strength of the skeleton and, therefore, upon the capability of the skeleton to withstand excessive G loads. The extent of bone demineralization that may occur in prolonged flights must be carefully an- ticipated before such flights are programmed. It would appear that the phenomenon of bone demineralization is similar to that which occurs in hospitalized patients. In these cases the de- mineralization accompanying disuse may be suf- ficient to allow radiographic diagnosis of de- mineralization following periods of inactivity in excess of 6 weeks or so. However, this is probably subject to considerable individual vari- ation. It is generally felt that radiographic ob- servation of demineralization requires that bone densities be reduced to 60 to 70% of their ini- tial value. One can assume that the skeleton is more or less uniformly demineralized under these conditions. This would involve a loss of approximately y3 of the 600 grams of calcium contained in a standard man. The most sensitive method for determining cal- 4. JuJtification 5. Experiment cium withdrawal would be by representative analyses of excreta samples from an individual who had previously been given ,tolerable doses of either radioactive calcium or one of the al- kaline earths which would simulate the meta- bolic behavior of calcium. Strontium-85 would seem to be the most easily used isotope for this purpose since it decays with the emission of gamma radiation unaccompanied by any elec- trons and can, therefore, be given safely in the largest doses. The other possibilities would be calcium-45, calcium-47, barium-140, or ra- dium. However, there are technical and radio- logical problems associated with each of these alternatives. A preflight test experiment under conditions of normal physical activity using the person to be flown into space as the experimental subject, should be carried out a few weeks prior to flight. Using good experimental techniques, this could be accomplished with a minimum dose of strontium-85 (possibly as little as 1 pc). The second dose of strontium-85 which would be appreciably larger than this for two reasons: (1) to override residual activity from the first dose and (2) to compensate for inferior in- strumental possibilities in flight, would be ad- ministered at approximately 10 days prior to flight. The individual should be carefully mon- itored during these 10 days to determine the preflight baseline and for comparison with the first dose. Dose required for the second intra- venous injection could be in the order of per- haps 200 pc. This would deliver a maximum gamma dose to the individual of 20 to 25 milli- rads per day. This would drop steadily accord- ing to power function laws. It has been amply demonstrated that the power PHASE R: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 119 - function descriptions of whole body strontium- 85 retention can be used to predict the normal behavior of strontium in humans as well as experimental animals. These would allow for quantiption of the increased mobilization of calcium which may occur. A dose in excess of 200 FC could be safely administered to humans. Using good technique, it is possible to measure the strontium-85 whole body burden of such an individual over periods well in excess of a year. In essence, the control is inherent. The indi- vidual astronaut must be baselined in a pre- flight study and the e%ects of weightlessness will be controlled against the normal ground- based calcium metabolism pattern. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Spare Staiion Personnel It is anticipated that the study can be done by the trained astronaut. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required A minimum requirement for fixed equipment would be one single-channel pulse height ana- lyzer, or its equivalent, for the detection of a gamma-emitter in excreta. If payload is avail- able, the experiment can become more elaborate and look for phosphorus as well as strontium- 85. No experimental animals required. 10. Summary of Other Living Forms No other living forms required. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determinations The frequency of determinations will have to be determined from preflight studies and will have to be kept flexible during flights to allow for possible abrupt changes in calcium excretion. It can be recommended that all excreta be sam- pled, at least at the outset. The determination would be simply a matter of evaluating the sample for its content of radioactive isotopes. 12. Summary of Ldboratory Sperimens to be Flown to Earth for Lrlboratory Examindtion It is not anticipated that specimens will have to be ferried back to Earth during the course of prolonged orbital flight. 13. Proposed Rendezvous Schedule for Rotation of Crew Not applicable. 6. Experimental Controls 9. Summary of Animals 14. Telemetry versus Onboard Recording Require- ments The results of the determinations should be tele- metered rather than being read onboard. Tele- metering the count rate, for example, will per- mit immediate analysis of the data with the baseline program stored in the computer. It may be necessary, however, to accumulate count rates over a number of hours and, therefore, an onboard tape storage may be required which can then read out when over appropriate ground StationS. Each individual astronaut has to be evaluated through preflight ground-based studies in order to define his normal pattern of calcium metab- olism. This will also help to determine the required frequency of determinations during flight. The procedure should be evaluated during one of the Gemini missions. In this case, the ex- creta would be saved and returned and the counts made in ground-based laboratories. These can then be evaluated against chemical analysis and full calibration of the procedure will result. The only required R and D would be to bring about some miniaturitation of the counter and to consider the most dective way of prepiuing a sample of the excreta for counting. 18. Onboard Gaseous Atmosphere Desired No unusual gaseous atmosphere required. 19. Requirement for Rotation for Artificial G The capability for the induction of artificial gravity would make the total experiment more useful, but it is not a prerequkite. 20. Comments re Form of D6ta and Interpretmion of Data The data can be taken directly in the form of count rate and should be interpreted by proc- essing through the computer and comparison with the baseline metabolic parameters. 21.

EXPERIMENT 4 1. Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Fluid and 2. Estimated Pri,ority 3. Purpose Electrolyte Metabolism Priority 1. To determine the effects of weightlessness in prolonged space flight on water balance, elec- trolyte metabolism and excretion, and renal func- tion. Although the primary stress under study is weightlessness, in initial stages of flight, at least, there may be added stress effects from confinement, threat of danger, thermal stress, and circadian rhythm changes. Various prior studies on Earth have indicated substantial changes in fluid balance and renal function with changes in body position from vertical to horizontal-mobilization of fluid from tissues into the bloodstream, increased renal blood flow, changes in glomerular filtration rate, and increased urinary volume. Such func- tions have not been studied extensively in stud- ies of the effects of long-term bed rest or in- activity, but are under investigation at the pres- ent time (Air Force). Preliminary observations in short space flights have suggested, in a situa- tion having poor control, that marked water loss takes place possibly due to both sweating re- lated to heat stress and to changes in anti- diuretic hormonal control of water balance. There is also the possibility that disturbances may take place in the mechanisms responsible for adequate thirst response to dehydration. Since large changes in water balance and pos- sibly associated disturbances in electrolyte me- tabolism are incompatible with efficient per- formance of duty, if not life itself, it is expected that pertinent preliminary information will be obtained in earlier flights, but it will be essential to obtain detailed data of the problem in ORL flight to assess its status with respect to pro- longed space flight. 4. [ustifitation 5. Experiment Procedure: Identical to that described for the experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flights on various Metabolic Functions. It is anticipated that this experiment will be run in conjunction with those on Metabolism, Skele- tal Systems, and Endocrine Balance. Measurements: a. Water balance: The various measurements associated with water balance and its control are (1) total fluid intake, (2) urinary vol- ume, (3) fecal water content, (4) body mass (or \"weight\"), (5) urine and blood osmolol- ity, (6) blood osmololity, (7) blood hemo- globin and hematocrit, (8) blood volume, (9) total body water, and (10) assay of urine for antidiuretic hormone activity. Con- siderable attention will have to be devoted to methods for measuring or assessing sweat volume losses; in this conjunction, accurate repeated or continuous temperature and hu- midity measurements of the cabin air and walls must be taken. b. Electrolyte metabolism: With careful reg- ulation of dietary intake and with the urine and stool collections associated with other experiments, balance studies can be carried out for sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chloride. The studies planned on acid-base metabolism and described in the experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flights on Various Metabolic Functions should be men- tioned in this section since the changes in fluids and electrolytes related to heat and orthostasis could be complicated by the pos- sible development of hypercapnia which would favor sodium retention and chloride loss; respiratory rate and cabin atmosphere carbon dioxide will need to be monitored and telemetered to ground. c. Renal function: The relatively easily meas- ured indices of renal function are creatinine clearance and blood urea nitrogen (urea can be measured in blood or urine by a paper PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 121 stick method). Much more precise methods, such as insulin clearance (for glomerular fil- tration rate) and require in- travenous infusions and various timed urine specimens so that they probably should not be induded in initial protocols. d. Factors related to vrinary tract stone for- mation: Measurement in urine specimens al- ready planned to be collected prior to, dur- ing, and after flight, of pyrophosphate, mag- nesium, manganese, zinc, and various muco proteins and related biocolloids. 6.

Estimated Priority Temperature Regulation Prioriq 1. 122 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY 3. Purpose To determine the effects of various stress of prolonged space flight on physiologic mecha- nisms of temperature regulation. Tliermal comfort of the astronaut is absolutely essential for both his work efficiency and even maintenance of his life. If the effective tem- perature of the vehicle is too low or if other factors lead to excessive heat loss which is pro- longed, his efforts to increase his heat pro- duction (by exercise or shivering) or efforts to conserve heat by body positioning will, at the least, take extensive effort away from that re- quired for performance of duties. If the ef- fective temperature is too high, excessive sweat- ing may lead to extensive or even life-threaten- ing water loss and elevation in body tempera- ture. While at first glance the problem would seem to be entirely an engineering one with respect to temperature regulation of the vehicle or of the astronaut's suit, actually nothing is known of the effects of stresses other than ther- mal on the temperature regulating mechanisms of the body. Engineering design to handle thermal changes or unusual thermal situations can have a much more meaningful direction if it can be determined whether or not weightless- ness, confinement, changes in circadian rhythm, threat of danger, etc. (either alone or in com- bination with vehicular atmospheric conditions different from Earth in either gas composition or pressure) have distinct effects on thermal regulation. The limited space flight experience to date has suggested difficulty in maintaining comfort on the warm side (because of overheating), and it is not clear whether this difficulty was due en- tirely to the diminished heat loss attendant to wearing a space suit coupled with faulty cooling apparatus within the suit. An additional pos- sible basis for difficulty in achieving proper rates of heat loss may be related to the currently used atmospheric pressure of 5 psi which would tend to diminish the effectiveness of the convective route of heat loss and may well have other im- portant effects on mechanisms of thermal regula- tion (see under 15). (The reverse situation was noted in experiments simulating submarine exposure in which the atmospheric pressure was 4. Justification 5. substantially above normal; subjectively, heat loss was considerably increased.) A significant por- tion of the questions suggested can be approached and at least partially solved by ground-based experiments and by space flights prior to ORL. Experiment Procedure: This experiment logically should be coordinated closely with the experiment en- titled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Vuri- ous Metabolic Functions since the method of measurement of heat production is identical with the measurement of oxygen consumption and is carried out with the subject in the basal state. Measurements of heat production, loss, storage, and balance will be made on 2 or more occasions during a preflight control phase, at least at weekly intervals in flight, and again on 2 or more occasions postflight. (See under 15 for Prerequisite Ground-Based Experiments and see experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various Metabolic Functions.) Measurements: a. Heat production: Heat production is calcu- lated from oxygen consumption on the basis of the caloric value of oxygen for a particular metabolic mixture (relative amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrate being metabolized) as in- dicated by the respiratory quotient (RQ). In the resting postabsorptive state, an RQ may be assumed; but it is preferable to determine it accurately by measuring the rate of carbon diox- ide production as well as that of oxygen con- sumption. Correction is then made for the amount of nitrogen excreted during the period of measurement. The apparatus to be used would consist of the continuous expired air col- lection system and continuous stream gas analyzers described in the experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various Metabolic Functions. b. Heat loss: There are a variety of ways in which the various partitions of heat loss-con- ductive, convective, radiated, and evaporative may be measured, either alone or in combination. The best system will be to set up a number of these methods which in being partially dupli- cative will increase the accuracy of measurement. (1) Nonezlaporative beat loss (total Zess the evaporative) : Continuous analogue recording of the output of constantan-silver thermo- ~ ~ PHASE XI: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 123 couple thermal gradient disks applied to the surface of the b6dy at a minimum of 9 selected areas for gradient heat flow from the skin.

If it becomes important to telemeter these data to ground, the analogue information could be converted as received to digital data and the latter telemetered. meters\" are in general use by a number of physiological research laboratories but provide only relative measure of nonevaporative heat loss, valuable mainly for indicating compara- tive changes in the same individual from one set of circumstances to another. In order to obtain data via these disks which would indi- cate heat loss quantitatively, a study of the precision of calibration of sets of disks for quantitative heat loss would have to be re- quested of the Department of the Navy for performance by the staff of the Calorimetric Research Laboratory of the Naval Medical Re- search Institute, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland. This Laboratory operates the most accurate gradient calorimeter in the world, and it is the only group capable of performing this valuable research, essential for quantitation of this method of measuring nonevaporative heat loss. (2) Evaporative beat loss: Measure the tod air flow volume passing over the subject's total surface (either through a space suit, through a light plastic envelope surrounding the subject, or through some specific space or section of the craft in which the subject is located, the latter two arrangements for shirt- sleeve environment) and multiply by average difference in relative humidity between the point of entrance of the air stream and the point of exit from the suit or specific space. Prior to the experiment the system described would have to be calibrated with measured water loads. (3) Convective heat loss: In the system de- scribed under evaporative heat loss (either suit or specific space), place highly accurate heat meters (thermometers) in the inlet and outlet of the air stream. Multiply the inlet and outlet temperature difference by the vol- --- LL---..l I-^ iiic~ uiciulpi gdht dish ci of the air stream. (4) Conductive heat loss: The same basic system described under Convective heat loss can be applied to the cooling fluid circuit of a liquid-cooled space suit. This system would have to be ground-calibrated for corrections which would need to be made for heat con. ducted entirely through the suit. c. Heat Storage: Heat storage is determined peratwe as obtained from a continuously re- cording deep rectal thermometer or from a recording thermometer placed to obtain deep ear temperatures. d. Heat Balance: This calculation for any period of time is obtained from the equations: (1) Heat Production equals Total Heat Loss plus Heat Storage and (2) Total Heat Loss equals the Separate Heat Losses by Conduction, Con- vection, Radiation, and Evaporation. Ady, since each part of the equation can be measured (although nonevaprative heat loss, particularly conductive and radiated, less accurately than the others), these less accurate partitions can be ob- tained or checked by difference in the balance equation, e.g., Nonevaporative Heat Loss equals Heat Production minus Evaporative Heat Loss minus Heat Storage. 6. Expeviniental Controls Ccntroi is essentially built into the procedure by preflight and postflight tests and analyses, each subject serving as his own control. 7. Stlmrnary of Number and Types of Space Station Personnel Trained astronauts will serve satisfactorily as subjects. In conjunction with the experiment entitled Efects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various MetaboIic Functions, one technician who is well trained in the maintenance and operation of electronic equipment will definitely be re- quired. 8.

Telemetry uersus Onboard Recording Require- ments The bulk of the data is to be recorded on ana- logue recorders and the data reviewed onboard and reported by radio to the ground. Digital telemetry of oxygen consumption data might be useful (see experiment 1.) In the experimental protocol per se, ground- based control observations pre- and postflight are essential. Despite the fact that most of the methods are reasonably well established, con- siderable time and effort would need to be ex- pended in shakedown, calibration, etc. In addi- tion, however, specific experimental studies should be arranged, if possible, to calibrate the thermal gradient disks for quantitative measure- ment of nonevaporative heat loss as described under 5, Measurements, b, (1). Calibration studies also need to be carried out for conductive heat loss through a space suit if measurements of conductive heat loss are set up using the cool- ing fluid circuit of a liquid-cooled space suit (see 5, Measurements, b, (4)). The most important ground-based experiment, however, is a study of the effects of low atmos- pheric pressure (specifically oxygen at 5 psi) on 9. Summary of Animals 13. Proposed Rendez~~ous Schedule for Rotation of 15. Prereyuisite Ground-Based Experiments thermal regulation mechanisms. At least 3 pos- sible ways in which these mechanisms could be * affected or altered are suggested: (1) diminished heat loss by reduced convection in a less dense atmosphere ; (2) altered evaporative heat loss due to changes in rates of sweating or evaporation from the skin under conditions of reduced pres- sure (increased water loss from the lungs is also a possibility) ; and (3) alterations in peripheral (skin) blood flow due to diminished pressure support to skin blood vessels. The most likely possibility is capillary dilation resulting in subjec- tive warmth but increased heat loss by radiation. The number and variety of these possible altera- tions indicates the necessity for ground-based study of the effects of low atmospheric pressure. The measurement techniques would be identical to those described for this ORL experiment. To the extent possible, these thermal balance studies should be inserted in the flight plan of earlier flights. None visualized. It is strongly urged that Earth atmosphere be pro- vided; otherwise, a new factor or stress is intro- duced which may interact with weightlessness and other stresses in a way not yet calculable. With specific regard to thermal regulation, if ground-based studies show significant effects of low atmospheric pressure, it may be necessary to shift to Earth atmosphere.

Estimated Priority endocrine Function Priority 1. 125 PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 3. Purpose To determine the qualitative and quantitative effects of various stresses of prolonged space flight on pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, gonadal, and neurohumoral function. Since the endocrine system through the hormones secreted by its various internal glands exerts a highly important regulatory control over the idties of b;~&iiiId iedoiis in a!: of the C&S of the body and thus regulates to a considerable degree most of the important functions of the body, detailed knowledge of the way in which the endocrine glands will react to and stand up under severe and prolonged stresses is essential. Fundamentally, the degree of success with which the space traveler will meet, adjust to, and con- tinue to withstand the various flight stresses de- pends upon the appropriateness of response of the endocrine glands and their continuing, effec- tive modulation of essential physiologic func- tions. The principal stress to the human organism currently visualized is weightlessness, but in addition, during the early and final moments of flight, there will be high gravity stress and, until further experience is gained and more adequate space provided in the vehicle, there will be the added stresses of confinement, threat of danger, heat, changes in circadian rhythm, monotony, noise, social restriction, and possible toxic sub- stances. If we consider a \"stressor\" to be any environmental change that disturbs the \"steady state\" of existence of a living organism, then almost every event taking place in orbital flight may be a significant stress to which adaptive changes must be made. The stressor stimulus, however, whether specific or nonspecific, is fol- lowed by a final common pathway of response which is largely neuroendocrine in nature. Adrenal cortical response is best known, but the entire homeostatic function of the central ner- vous and endocrine systems is almost certainly involved. The capacity of healthy men to main- tain health through vigorous physiological re- sponse is very great, but the duration of this adaptability in the course of continuous severely adverse environmental conditions is unknown and can be clarified only by further information obtained from carefully planned experiments. 4. Jusfjficatzon Response to single stresses can be studied very largely in ground-based experiments (such as severe confinement, inactivity, abnormal atmo- sphere, or exposure to toxic materials), but there will almost certainly be a compounding eff& of multiple stresses acting concurrently that can be studied only during space flight. Fortunately for the purpose of this study, endocrinologists have devoted considerable effort assess not only the level of function of the vari- ous endocrine glands, but also their response to various forms of physical, biochemical, and, to some extent, psychological stress. Methodology has advanced prodigiously from the point 20 years ago when the only test available for evalu- ation of adrenal cortical response to stress was the circulating blood level of eosinophiles; in fact, by the time this experiment is actually flown it will need to be updated for advances on techniques expected in the near future. kj CXF!GiZ?iOR Gf m&iGdj: 2nd P-WCdUiej: i0 5. Experiment Procedure: The various measurements of endocrine function all depend upon sampling of venous blood at various intervals and upon analyses of urine, usually collected in 24-hour samples, all such samples to be returned to Earth for analysis at the present state of methodology. The various measurements will need to be made during a preflight control phase and also post- flight, as well as during flight to the extent possible. For these reasons this study can be reasonably easily integrated with the experiments on Metabolism, Fluid and Electrolytes, and the Skeletal System. The measurements proposed consist of those believed to be most useful and revealing within the feasibility limits of urine samples and periodic venous blood samples of modest size; tests involving complex procedure, administration of radioisotopes, or large blood samples have been generally excluded. a. Thyroid futzction: The oldest procedure for testing this function is measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption in the basal (post- absorptive and resting) state, the basal metabolic rate. This index can be obtained automatically in conjunction with the measurements of energy metabolism proposed in the experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight an Various Measurements: 126 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY Metabolic Functions; the instrumentation sug- gested is continuous stream gas analyzers for oxygen and carbon dioxide to be used with a hood arrangement for continuous collection of expired air. These measurements should be ob- tained periodically before, during, and after flight. At a minimum pre- and postflight venous blood samples should be taken for protein-bound circulating total thyroxine, uptake, and thyroxine binding pre-albumin (TBPA) capacity. To the extent that space for storage and facilities for blood collection are available in the vehicle, the value of these in- dices would be considerably enhanced by in-flight blood sampling for this purpose. The currently best available test which indicates rapid response in free thyroxine to stresses such as surgery and severe exertion is TBPA capacity. Among the various radioactive iodine proced- ures, it is now possible to do 1131 neck uptake scanning with sufficiently low dosage of isotope (5 to 10 microcuries) that it should be carried out pre- and postflight. If the vehicle can carry the weight of counting equipment, uptakes can be done periodically during flight, but whether or not this test is selected will depend on the total radioactivity burden from all sources. If this procedure is used, 1131 neck decay curve as measured daily will be useful to separate increased from normal thyroid activity. Various other radioactive iodine tests are not recommended. FBI131 requires an dosage in the neighborhood of 50 microcuries. Al- though produces a much smaller radiation exposure and is excellent for repeated tests of neck uptakes on Earth, it produces a hard gamma ray and so requires heavy shielding which would present a weight problem in flight; further even if telluri~m~3~ is carried as the source for its half-life would be too short to be of use on flights longer than 2 weeks. b. Adrenal cortical function: At a minimum, 24-hour urine samples should be collected pre- flight, during, and postflight for 17 hydroxy corticords (17-OHCS) . Initial control analyses should be carried out many days or weeks prior to takeoff to be certain of obtaining true control values; adrenal corticosteroid secretion could well be increased above normal during the days just preceding takeoff. It is anticipated that in- creased secretion will take place during and shortly following takeoff, but it will be impor- tant to examine excretion levels thereafter during flight to determine how long this evidence of stress continues to be present, and, if continued, to look for later suggestion of adrenal cortical exhaustion. The next most feasible analysis would be of plasma levels of 17-OHCS (or of free cortisol soon to be available). Normal adrenal cortical function (on Earth) is indicated by a diurnal variation, higher values being noted in the morning, lower values in the afternoon and evening; absence of this pattern, or flattening, is noted in adrenal hyperplasia and might be ex- pected from chronic stimulation in association with continuing stresses. It would thus be use- ful periodically during a long flight to obtain blood samples for 17-OHCS. (Four or more per period, preferably at 12-hour intervals re- lated to the flight day if the latter should be altered from 24 hours). Their value would be greatly enhanced, of course, as a guide to the state of endocrine response to stress, if method- ology could be developed so that these analyses could be performed during flight. When in-flight analytic methodology for plasma 17-OHCS has been developed, it would then be feasible to carry out, periodically, tests of adrenal cortical response to stimulation with pituitary adreno corticotrophic hormone (ACTH). The simplest form of this test is to obtain collections of urine for 17-OHCS before and immediately following an 8-hour continuous intravenous \"drip\" of 25 units of ACTH; obvi- ously, in flight the ACTH infusion will have to be administered by an infusion pump since gravity will not be available. Although seldom if ever used now, in this test in Earth studies, ACTH gel intramuscularly would avoid the in-flight gravity problem of administering an intravenous \"drip\". In any case, it is recom- mended that this test be performed as soon after flight as possible. If response to an 8-hour in- fusion of ACTH is low or absent (which would suggest adrenal cortical exhaustion), considera- tion should be given to testing for the response to a 48-hour infusion. PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 127 Measurement of possible alteration in adrenal cortical salt-retaining regulatory function may be obtained by analyzing 24-hour urine samples for aldosterone. This measurement is closely allied to the measurements of urinary sodium proposed in the experiment entitled Effecti of Prolonged Space Flight on Fluid and Electrolyte metabolism. If increased urinary aldosterone excretion is noted, it would be well to obtain venous blood samples for plasma renin. Nor- mal or increased amounts of plasma renin will be present if the increased aldosterone stimula- tion is of renal origin, whereas plasma renin will be undetectable if increased aldosterone activity is primary in the adrenal c. Pituitary function: (1 ) Circulating ACTH: An immuno-assay for blood levels of this pituitary hormone has just been reported. This analysis should be carried out pre- and postflight and blood specimens should be taken for this analysis during flight. (2) Pituitary ACTH reserve: Until in-flight laboratory and physiological testing method- ology becomes well advanced, this test will be feasible only during observations pre- and postflight. A synthetic steroid known as SU- 4885 is capabIe of suppressing Il-beta- hydroxylation by the adrenal cortex. In the resulting absence of cortisol production by this gland, the pituitary is normally induced to produce ACTH in increased amounts. The result is production by the adrenal cortex of steroids other than cortisol, and the test measurement currently is analysis of the urine for increased amounts of \"Compound B\"; a three- to .four-fold increase is normal. SU- 4885 is administered orally every 4 to 6 hours for 2 to 3 days. With availability of the circulating ACTH immuno-assay, its response to SU-4885 should be measured as well as urinary \"Compound B\". (3) Circulating TSH: An immuno-assay for blood levels of this pituitary hormone which regulates thyroid function is anticipated soon and.should be added to the protocol when available. (4) Pituitary antidiuretic hormone (ADH): From the limited space flight experience to date, a suppression of pituitary ADH has been suspected. At present, this hormone can be analyzed in the urine by bio-assay; an immuno- assay for blood levels, which will be much more precise and pertinent, is anticipated in the near future. Preflight, in-flight and post- flight 24-honr urine samples (and blood sam- ples for immuno-assay) will be required. For further definition of the function of reg- ulation of water retention and excretion, con- sideration should be given to the following pre- and podight functionai tests: Urine concentration test-restrict fluids overnight and obtain urine specimen in morning for urinary specific gravity; if there is apparent in- zbility to concentrate, the test may be repeated with the administration of pituitrin. Carter- Robbins salt-loading test-after a water diure- sis has been established as measured by urine volumes in successive 30-minute periods, an infusion of hypertonic saline is administered following which there is normally a prompt reduction in urine volume; if this does not occur, attribution of the disturbance in func- tion to the pituitary rather than to the kidney can be determined by administration of pitu- itrin when it is clear that salt-loading has had no effect. d. Gonadal function: Two potential threats to reproductive function of man in space are recog- nized. The first of these is ionizing radiation. Fortun- ately, a great deal of factual information is avail- able from unmanned flights, both relatively close to the Earth and far out in free space. These data indicate that the constant flux of radiation in free space probably is not dangerous except during solar flares when it may rise to as high as 80 rads total for very brief periods. Satellites in polar orbit also would be subject to much higher and even dangerous levels of radiation, up to possibly 21 rads daily. So long as the polar orbits are excluded, therefore, genetic dam- age of significant degree probably is unlikely, and the only remaining danger would occur when a space vehicle, far out in space was \"caught\" in a solar flare with no alternative except to take the radiation that occurred. The second threat is the possibility of a disinte- gration of cellular function as a consequence of zero.gravity. It has been reported that mitotic 128 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY activity of cells deteriorates under these condi- tions, and, accordingly, the intense rate of cell division of germinal tissues would be expected to reflect this abnormality. Furthermore, the male should be more severely affected than the female. Inasmuch as no dependable factual data are available upon which to establish a judg- ment, further observations of these functions must be made. The most readily available analysis reflective of gonadal function is the 24-hour urinary excre- tion of 17-ketosteroids (17-KS). These steroids in the male are produced principally by the interstitial cells of the testes, but significant quantities are produced by the adrenal cortex. Among the various steroids of this group, certain ones are more indicative than others of adrogenic function. Whether or not partition specifically for urinary adrogens (by column or double- isotope dilution methods) would contribute in- formation not indicated by total 17-KS is debat- able at the present time. In disease the pituitary trophic hormones most susceptible to impairment are the gonads-trophic. Bio-assays are currently available for both fol- licle-stimulatory hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the latter being closely similar to interstitial cell (of the testes) stimulating hormone. Immuno-assays for both FSH and LH will ultimately probably be available. For these assays blood samples and 24-hour urine speci- mens pre- and postflight will be required. With specific reference to reproductive function, when space flights of longer than approximately 60 days become feasible, it would be important to collect semen specimens pre- and postflight to detect any impairment in total sperm count and motility. It would also be important in at least two astronauts to obtain a testicular biopsy before and after a long flight. This procedure under local anesthesia is associated with only minor discomfort and is a distinctly more sensi- tive index of spermatogenic function than sperm counts. e. Other jmmuno-assays: Immuno-assays just becoming available or to be available soon are those for blood levels of pituitary growth hor- mone, insulin, and parathyroid hormone. When the relative case of analysis of these endocrine indices becomes more clear, they will need to be integrated into this experiment and those on Metabolism and the Skeletal System. f. Neurohumoral function: Recent additions to the considerable number of indices of physiologic reaction to stress are the neuropressor amines known as catecholeamines. These may be deter- mined on 24-hour urine specimens by bio- assay for total catecholeamines or by chemical analysis for metanephrine or VMA. The closely associated substance, 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (serotonin) may also be determined and might be particularly useful in conjunction with tilt table tests of the circulatory adjustment to the upright position. In-flight collection and pres- ervation of urine for these analyses will present a special problem in that specimens must be promptly acidified; in contrast, urine specimens for 17-OHCS and 17-KS must not be acidified and should be refrigerated. Control is essentially built into the procedure by preflight and postflight tests and analyses, each subject serving as his own control. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Sta- tion Personnel Trained astronauts will serve satisfactorily as subjects. Laboratory technicians will be needed to the extent that laboratory analyses can be per- formed in the weightless state. 8.

Telemetry versus Onboard Recording Require- me& Digital telemelry of oxygen consumption data would be useful (see experiment entitled Effects of Prolonged Space Flight on Various Metabolic Functiom). In order to separate the influence of weightless- ness from inactivity, confinement and all the various other possible stresses, it would be use- ful to set up groGd-based studies of the effects on the various indices described from the several individual stresses, particularly inactivity and confinement. Earlier studies of the effects of immobilization were done prior to the avail- ability of the present array of tests of endocrine function.

Purpose These observations are not experimental in type; rather, they are in the nature of screening ob- servations to determine the characteristics, trends, and magnitudes of possible changes in the hematopoietic function and the body distribu- tion of the formed elements of peripheral blood. A variety of possible mechanisms may operate Probably first feasible in extended 4. Justification in the situation of actual space flight which could induce significant hematological changes. Among the stresses which may activate these mechan- isms are weightlessness, radiation, psychological stresses, artificial atmospheres, toxic substances, and microorganisms of the environment. Multi- ple patterns of interaction of these stresses may operate. Furthermore, if these interactions do occur, the nature and extent of the interactions which may involve weightlessness are totally unpredictable and cannot be studied by ground- based simulation. For example, if weightless- ness seriously alters processes of cell division, the rapidly proliferating cells of the hematopoietic tissues might be strongly affected. This, in turn, 130 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY might alter such parameters as the dose-response relationship for radiation injury to these cells. The observations should consist of periodic ex- amination of all available subjects exposed for periods longer than 24 hours to the space flight environment. The examination should include: 5. Experiment Red blood cells: a. Hematocrit by a micro method. b. Reticulocyte counts. c. Periodic estimates of red cell mass. These may be available by calculation of the data used in determining blood volume. d. Red cell life span measurements by the Cr51 technic. This observation has lower priority and a higher requirement for skill of crew; thus, it probably will require deferral until later flights with larger crews. It is mentioned here for the sake of completeness. e. Determination of blood hemoglobin content. White blood cells: a. White blood cell counts. b. Differential leukocyte counts. c. Determination of selected parameters of leukocyte function (see related experiment). Platelets: a. Determination of platelet counts. b. Measurement of selected parameters of platelet function (see related experiment). Examination of the morphology of the formed elements of the blood on Wright's stained blood smears. Frequency of determinations: All of these ob- servations should be made at least every 3 to 5 days during missions less than 30 days in dura- tion, and every 7 to 10 days in longer missions. TO some extent, these determinations can be coordinated with other schedules of drawing blood samples. Red cell mass calculations can be coordinated with blood volume determinations. Control observations should be determined by the same method to be used in flight and by parallel standard methods at similar intervals during both preflight and postflight control study periods of the subjects. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Space Sta- tion Personnel The simplest level of these observations may be 6. Experimental Controls performed by a trained astronaut, utilizing sim- plified apparatus for the measurement, dilution, and storage of capillary blood samples and preparation of blood smears for return to Earth and later analysis on missions of short duration. In this case, hematocrit determinations will not be feasible. More sophisticated studies will require a spe- cially trained crew member who will have to function at the level of a routine hematology technician, again utilizing a variety of special apparatus. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required Fixed eqtripment: If hematocrits are to be measured, a centrifuge comparable to a clinical machine will be needed. With appropriate engineering, this should weigh no more than 3 to 5 lbs, have a power requirement of less than 250 watts, and require a cube space of less than '/3 cu ft. Such a machine could be multi- purpose in dealing with a variety of samples. Otherwise, there is need for no fixed equip- ment. Consumable equipment: Consumable equip- ment will have to be developed for the automatic measurement, dilution, and storage of blood samples for short flights. Pipettes of this gen- eral nature can be developed from existing auto- matic plastic pipettes, preloaded with diluent. The stability of the preserved cells will have to be proven in the diluent chosen, and possibly modified diluents will have to be developed for these purposes. At the moment, it seems impractical to consider microscopy of wet samples of any type under weightlessness. Cell sedimentation will not occur in counting chambers, for example, and it would be difficult to construct a completely closed sys- tem to prevent atmospheric contamination. If a gravitational field is available, the problem becomes much simpler, and modified standard microscopy could be employed, permitting on- board determinations of blood cell counts. Alternatively, an electronic particle counter could be employed, possibly utilizing an onboard scaler of multipurpose type. Many possible designs for such an instrument exist, of which the Coulter type seems most promising. The basic apparatus, exclusive of the scaler, might occupy ' PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 131 0.1 cu ft, weigh less than 1 pound and require less than 50 watts with proper engineering miniaturization. Equipment can be designed for staining of blood films in a closed system if onboard examination is possible. This might occupy less than 0.1 cu ft, weigh less than 1 pound, and require no pOWe2. None. 10. Smmary of Other Living Forms None. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determinations Determination frequencies are suggested under 5. Each complete determination would require about 10 minutes to collect (technician and sub- ject) and 5 minutes to process if only sample storage is involved. These time allowances are generous and anticipate di5iculties secondary to restricted space and mobility. If onboard processing is possible, each deter- mination would require about 30 minutes after the samples had been obtained. Saving of time could be accomplished if multiple samples can be processed simultaneously. 12. Smimary of Laboratory Specimens to be Flown to Earth for Laboratory Examination If samples cannot be processed onboard, they will have to be either saved or returned period- ically to Earth. For flights of less than 30 days, storage onboard seems best. The same is prob- ably true of flights of less than 90 days, unless other samples are returned for other reasons. Beyond 90 days, some type of onboard process- ing seems desirable, particularly if any of the parameters measured are found to have implica- tions for crew safety. If crew safety is not a 9. Suninrary of Animals consideration, return of samples every 90 to 120 days would probably be satisfactory, if adequate specimen preservation can be obtained. 13.

More impor- 4. \\u+ation 132 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY tantly, these technics may permit identification of this type of abnormality at levels of altera- tion or injury which might not affect the func- tion of the entire hemopoietic organ because of the capacity of unaffected cell clones to increase their activity. Pre- and postflight cytogenetic examinations of crew members in a graded series of flights of increasing duration is all that is deemed possible at present. If this can be done, there will prob- ably be a great advantage, since the technics are very demanding and might well be impos- sible in the weightless state. Standard cytogenetic methods can be employed, utilizing peripheral blood leukocytes with phyto- hemagglutinin stimulation, Since the detection of an increase in chromosomal abnormalities is essentially statistical in nature and since the con- trol level of these abnormalities and the possible increase are expected to be very small, the statis- tical design of these studies must be carefully considered. It is probable that large numbers of metaphases will have to be examined and complete karyotyping carried out on any anom- alous or suspected anomalous cells. (Details of design will depend upon available methods and upon the findings of preflight control observa- tions.) 6. Experimental Controls Preflight observations of selected crew members. 7.

Since large numbers of karyotypes may have to be examined, thought should be given to application of the several technics of automatic classification of chrom- osomes. 18.

It should be recognized that the possibility of finding major cytogenetic changes in these ex- periments is very low. However, a finding of \"no change\" will be of nearly equal interest and importance in that it will yield some assurance as to safety of crew in terms of possible effects of the space environment on proliferating cells. 22.

The literature on cytogenetics is now so vast that specific references are not particularly helpful. In general, the literature dealing with radiation-induced cytogenetic changes, both short- and long-term, provides a model of the type of study herein outlined. 15.

TO assess changes which may occur in the amount and type of serum immunoglobulins. comple- ment, preexistent, and newly-formed antibodies of subjects exposed for prolonged periods to the space flight environment. If cellular processes of proliferation, differentia- tion, and function are affected by the weightless space flight environment, it might be expected that ultimately these changes will be reflected in the immune apparatus. This would be of basic biological interest. Operational consider- ations might be involved as well, since resistance to disease, i.e., invasion by mutant organisms or flora of other persons in the environment, may be influenced by alterations in immune processes. Basically, the experiment involves only periodic collection of blood samples with separation of serum and storage in the frozen state at less than -2OOC for return to Earth and later analysis. Samples every 14 to 30 days would be adequate for survey purposes. Samples of 2 to 3 ml volume would be required, although micro tech- niques might be used if less than this is avail- able. Determinations should include immunoelec- trophoresis, electrophoresis, on starch gel, meas- urement of yn, yla, and ,,M globulin levels, measurement of whole hemolytic complement, titration of blood group antibodies, and measure- ment of preexistent antibacterial antibodies. It would also be of interest to test the capacity of subjects for anamnestic recall of antibodies and primary immune responses by in-flight immuni- zations after varying periods of exposure to space flight conditions. However, this would be reasonable only on long-term flights, i.e., longer than 90 to 120 days, and it shodd be recog- nized that with small numbers of individuals tested, absolute standards for responses can- not be applied.

Estimated Priority Priority 2 or 3. of longer than 1 week. To determine effects of the space environment upon physiological functional capacities of leu- kocytes. 4. Justification Space vehicles are characteristically small, closed, ecological systems. As such, a rapid interchange of microflora is to be expected in the crew; IOW- grade pathogens and pathogenic mutants of ordinarily saprophytic organisms will thus be rapidly spread. Infections may result if host resistance is altered unfavorably. Although many factors are undoubtedly involved in main- tenance of normal host resistance, many of them unknown and unmeasurable, certain pertinent aspects of leukocyte function are amenable to measurement. These measures, along with meas- urements of immune responsiveness, may pro- vide a first order approximation of host defenses, particularly if they can be correlated with in- flight experiences with infectious processes of several crew members. Three types of observations are proposed: Observations of leukocyte mobility under weightless Conditions: It is thought that leuko- cyte mobility is primarily crawling, i.e., the cell moves by pseudopodial motion over a sur- face or over other cells. Under ordinary condi- tions of terrestial observation, cells are seen to Multiple crew member flights 3. Purpose 5. Experiment move over the surface of a slide. In the absence of gravity, the force which orients a motile cell to the surface may be lacking and mobility may be impaired or in a different mode, i.e., swimming. It is proposed that apparatus be developed to permit observation of leukocyte mobility under weightless conditions. This might take the form of a prepared microchamber with 2 flat sides spaced between .05 and .01 mm apart. This could be loaded with capillary blood directly by capillary action or with a predetermined amount of diluent-anticoagulant. Alternatively, a centrifugal separation of leukocytes can be made, and the WBC-rich plasma loaded in the observation chamber. The onboard microscope proposed for use in connection with surveys of hematological param- eters can be used for these observations. Phase contrast capability would be valuable but not essential. An attachment to keep the sample at 37\u00b0C will be required. This may take the form of an electrically heated, thermostatically con- trolled stage with a stage hood. Determination of the mode of leukocyte motility can be made by a trained observer, Determina- tion of the rate of movement can probably be made as well, utilizing an eye piece disc microm- eter and distance standard. Determination of leukocyte phagocytic capac- ity: Qualitative observations of phagocytosis can be made in the system described under Observations of leukocyte mobility under weight- less conditions by the addition of particles such as starch, polystyrene, killed staphylococci, or opsonized red blood cells. PHASE II: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 135 A semiquantitative method is also recommended. In such a test, a leukocyte suspension is pre- pared, particles are added, and, after a constant period of incubation, the leukocytes are recov- ered by gentle centrifugation, smeared, stained, and exammed for phagocytosis. The percentage of potential phagocytes which have ingested par- tides is determined. Because a great deal is known about the system, erythrophagoqtosis would be a very useful method. On the other hand, it is technically more demanding in that opsonized red cells and complement must be provided. The exact method chosen should be based upon a feasibility study. Specimens need not be stained and exammed onboard; only the smears need to be prepared at the time of the study. These can be preserved for later study. Studies of leukocyte mobilization: These studies are designed to test the capacity of the stressed subject to mobilize leukocytes at the site of a sterile idammatory lesion which is artificially created. Two general methods have been developed and standardized. These are the skin window method of Rebudr and the quantitative leukocyte washoff method of Finch, et al. Both methods require the preparation of a small abraded area on the volar forearm. In Rebuck's method, this area is covered with a cover glass which is removed with adherent leukocytes and replaced periodically. The pat- tern of time of appearance and proportions of the several types of leukocytes in such a lesion has been well studied in normal subjects and in a variety of abnormal states. The method of Finch, et al. involves the quali- tative recovery of the leukocytes from the lesion by a system of closed flushing of the area. These cells can then be counted and differential leuko- cyte counts can be made as well. The two methods complement each other in that better morphological observations can be made by the Rebuck method, but better quantitation can be achieved by the latter method. Both methods can be carried out simultaneously on the same subject. The quantitative method is much more time consuming and technically demanding. Comparable periodic preflight and postflight stud- 6. Experimental Control ies of all subjects for control periods of at least several weeks. 7. Summary of Number and Types of Spare Sta- tion Personnel These experiments will require an advanced level of general training and a period of training in the specific technics involved. The general level of required competence lies between that of an advanced research technician and a trained pro- fessional biomedical investigator. 8. Summary of Onboard Experimental Equipment Required Equipment and power as needed for general hematology observations plus a small amount (less than 1 Ib) of disposable equipment and supplies. None. 10. Summary of Other Living Forms None. 11. Summary of Onboard Laboratory Determimtions With no knowledge of the nature or magnitude of changes which might be encountered, only the most tentative of schedules can be proposed. It seems unlikely that it would be practical to carry out these studies more frequently than every 5 to 7 days on a single subject. A deter- mination within 1 to 2 days after entry into orbit would be of interest, as would a determina- tion shortly after reentry. On longer flights, in- tervals of 10 to 15 days would seem feasible. It is estimated that each study will require 6 to 10 hours of the observer's time and '/2 this amount of the subject. 12. Si~tnmary of Laboratory Specimens to be Flown to Earth for Laboratory Examination If blood cell counts can be done onboard, these can be determined in flight. If not, samples can be stored, as for general hematology deter- minations, and returned with the crew. 13. Proposed Rendezvous Schedule for Rotation of Crew Does not apply. ments Does not apply.

Studies of Selected Parameters of Blood Coag- 2. Estimated Priority ulation and Hemostatic Function Priority 2 or 3. Probably not feasible until flights where a trained biomedical investigator is a crew member (ORL). To determine if the space flight environment, including weightlessness, affects the measurable parameters of blood coagulation and hemostasis. It seems probable that the weightless state will affect a variety of cardiovascular functions, spe- cifically vascular tone. As a consequence, pat- terns of vascular perfusion and venous return can be expected to be affected. If blood is pooled in the venous circulation, the possibility of thrombosis must be considered. Although there is no hemostatic function which is directly correlated with thrombosis, it nevertheless seems advisable to carry out those observations which can be made. Furthermore, the behavior of these physiological processes in the space en- vironment has inherent biological interest and justifies a survey in this area even in the absence of a practical consideration. It is proposed that a wide variety of coagulation and hemostatic functions be surveyed on selected subjects. Not all of these observations need be carried out on all subjects or on every flight, but it is hoped that data in all these areas might be obtained in the course of a number of flights. The following observations are recommended: Coagulation time of freshly-drawn whole blood: Coagulation of blood in glass and sili- 3. Purpose 4. /ustifiration 5. Experiment conized containers should be determined. In addition, it should be possible to see for the first time if blood will clot spontaneously in the absence of contact with any surface. It should be possible to place a small volume of freshly drawn blood in suspension in the center of a containing flask and observe it periodically for coagulation without allowing it to contact the sides of the flask. Unless the atmosphere pro- vides a surface activation effect, the coagulation time of such a sample might be greatly pro- longed. Bleeding time: Methods of Duke and Ivy. Platelet count: Either- by onboard determina- tion or preparation of stable fixed samples for later determination. Observations of clot retraction. Measurements of platelet adhesiveness: By the glass bead adherence method. Measurements of fibrinogen concentration. Measurements of fibrinolytic activity: By the euglobulin clot lysis technic or by measurement of the release of IIs1 from iodinated fibrinogen. Measurements of prothrombin complex (AHG) and plasma thromboplastin component (PTC) activities: These observations have the greatest technical requirements and lowest priority. Observations of coagulation time of fveshly- drawn whole blood through measurements of platelet adhesiveness should be carried out on- board. The remainder of this study probably cannot be carried out in flight and will involve obtaining samples for postflight analysis. PHASE 11: IN-FLIGHT MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS 137 6.

PtereqUi.de Research and Development Phase 111 DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS PRECEDING PACE BLANK NOT FILMED. c PHASE I11 DesZgn and Operatlbnal Recoundths SPAMAG chose to formulate its recommendations as discussions of a number of critical topics. These contributions developed over the course of eight meetings. The topics are not proposed as being inclusive of all significant ORL related problems. However, they appear to include all the major prob- lems of which we are currently aware. NEED FOR ORL FLIGHT OF DURATION LONGER THAN 30 DAYS FOR BIOMEDICAL INVESTIGATION The consensus was that it is highly probable that important medical questions will remain unresolved after the 30-day MOL and, in fact, after the %day MOL missions which are currently Considered a fu- ture possibility. Important questions will probably be revealed by these missions. In order to resolve these questions, there will be a need for space flights of longer than 30 to 90 days, carrying crews larger than 2 to 3 men, providing more space than the cur- rent configuration, and including among the crew members medical scientists. The Group was unan- imous in its opinion that a year-long ORL investiga- tional flight is essential if very long, manned flights, such as a Mars mission, are planned for the future. In addition, it was concluded that an ORL is re- quired in the interest of pure science as well as for the actual undertaking of prolonged missions by man at some time in the future. PREFERRED METHOD OF APPROACH The Group concluded that the most feasible ap- proach would be to design a single vehicle for very long-duration flights, preferably one which would remain in orbit virtually indefinitely, rather than to des@ B series of dBermt v&ides hi different flights. The interior of the vehicle could be rede- signed according to the latest technology for what- ever duration and purpose of mission is desired. This vehicle or class of vehicles would, in this sense, serve in the same manner that a ship or class of ships does, being capable of undertaking many varie- ties of missions as required. TYPE OF VEHICLE In general, the Group thought that the most de- sirable form of ORL would be one which is some- what similar to the MORL concept. It should carry a crew of 6 to 12 persons with the optimum figure set at an &man crew. It should allow 400 to 550 cu ft of free space per man with an additional 1000 cu ft volume reserved for a common laboratory area. Each man has to be allowed his own small area of privacy. (See also Volume (Space) Requirements recommendations in Phase I). DURATION OF FLIGHT FOR AN ORL The Group was of the opinion that we can safely proceed from the 30-day experience to a 90-day experience unless unanticipated prohibitive factors develop within 30 days. If no insurmountable d&- culties develop within the W-day expexience, then we are justified in designing for a 1-year or more ORL. Regarding the ORL as a vehicle and opera- tional configuration which can be characterized as a forgiving flight, then a 1 -year forgiving experience onboard the ORL should enable us to undertake a I-year (-c 10 to 20%) unforgiving mission. The group considered the physiological end points serv- ing as criteria for extending flight durations to be roughly exponential, specifically, 30 days, 90 days, and 360 days. 141 142 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY TYPE OF REENTRY VEHICLE The Group was unanimous in favoring a high L/D vehicle as a more desirable form of reentry vehicle. It did not, however, establish this as a requirement. A reentry vehicle which can operate over an incremental range of reentry gravitational profiles would provide a great safety factor in long- duration missions. COST EFFECTIVENESS PARAMETERS The Group was unable to suggest particular cost effectiveness criteria from the medical standpoint. It did, however, suggest that a payoff ranking method be used, i.e., that potential medical payoffs be first stated, then placed in order of importance utilizing a broad base of informed opinion. ORBIT The Group advocated an equatorial orbit of ap- proximately 30\u00b0 inclination, circular, with an apogee of 250 to 300 nautical miles. A polar orbit is to be avoided because of the hazard of excessive expo- sure to ionizing radiation. If minor adjustments in altitude can be made to provide subharmonics of a 24-hour cycle, Le., on or just off the circadian rhythm, this may be desirable. NEED FOR ARTIFICIAL G: ROTATION OF THE SPACECRAFT, ONBOARD CENTRIFUGE, OR BOTH The Group first considered whether or not some form of artificial G will prove to be required for an ORL in which persons would be exposed for 1 year. Opinions consisted entirely of educated guesses. With that understood, a vote was taken: 11 of 18 felt that no artificial G will be required; 6 of 18 voted in favor of artificial G; and 1 did not vote. The type of artificial G preferred, centrifuge or rotation of the vehicle, was also expressed by vote: 8 of 18 preferred rotation of the spacecraft, with counterrotating core; 10 of 18 preferred an onboard centrifuge. A portion of the spacecraft must provide weight- lessness at all times. A centrifuge may be used as a provocative test or for conditioning of crew. However, 16 of 18 voted to recommend deferral of a specific decision at present, and, instead, to design for both an onboard centrifuge and vehicular rotation in parallel until a specific decision can be made on the basis of Gemini, Apollo, biosatellite, and MOL findings. Several members of the Group agreed that quite apart from physiological considerations, intermittent rotation of the vehicle is desirable for simple \"housekeeping\" purposes, it., assisting the perform- ance of various laboratory procedures, cleaning up the laboratory, etc. ' VOLUME (SPACE) REQUIREMENTS In addition to the recommendations made with respect to the volume of living space to be provided per crew member (see under Type of Vehicle), the Group made several comments with respect to vol- ume allowances for equipment: 1. As a general principle, it is important to in- tegrate as many experiments and measurements as possible into the equipment which is to be provided. 2. The laboratory area must be separate from the living area. 3. The laboratory area must measure at least 6% ft in the \"vertical\" dimension and 8 ft in one \"hori- zontal\" dimension in order to allow the medical examiner to assume his full height and the subject to \"recline\" fully stretched out with hands over his head. If a double-ended trampoline is provided, it will require a dimension of at least 12 ft in the direction of movement of the subject. 4. Some of the required laboratory equipment will consist of the following: a general purpose scaler with pulse height analyzer, radiation detectors, an incubator for cell cultures, an electronic computer and special purpose sensors, electronic gas analyzer, microscope, miniature oscilloscope, tape recorder, x-ray unit, and bone density measuring device (us- ing isotopes or x-ray unit or other method which may be developed), 5. A specimen storage area should be provided which is to include a refrigerator, freezer, and lyo- philization apparatus. The storage capacity require- ment is dependent upon frequency of rendezvous and the experimental program. 6. An x-ray laboratoq is recommended as a first priority item on clinical grounds and as a second priority item from the standpoint of medical investi- gation. . PHA5E I11 : DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL KECOMMENDATIONS 143 WEIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS These are to be determined primarily on the basis of total experimental payload and represent relatively basic engineering considerations. Large power requirements are not anticipated for labora- tory Purposes- SIZE OF TiE FLXGHT CREW The Group was generally agreed that the num- ber of personnel to be carried should range between 6 and 12 with 8 as an optimum number. It was also the consensus of the Group that a crew size of 24 is unnecessary for medical research purposes. TYPES OF PERSONNEL COMPRISING THE FLIGHT CREW The group made the following recommendations: 1. A physician-physiologist must be a member of the crew. He must have research as well as clinical experience. It may be additionally advantageous if he were also an engineer and a pilot or had had additional experience these two fields. 2. A well-trained medical person (a medical chi- cian) should also be included as a crew member. 3. A technician, one who has had training in ex- perimental physiology and also in electronics and who is able to repair and maintain the sophisticated hardware involved in the experimental package, must also be included as a member of the crew. 4. In general, the crew must resemble flight crews which will later embark upon unforgiving missions beyond ORL. UTILIZATION OF ANIMALS ONBOARD The panel concluded that provision should be made for a small animal laboratory (mice, rats, and squirrel monkeys) aboard the ORL. This conclu- sion was based on the fact that techniques can be performed on animals which cannot be performed upon man and that animals can be sacrificed and examined for biochemical changes and microscopic as well as gross morphological changes. Further- more, if considered as substitutes for additional per- sonnel, animals provide a much better payoff per weight, volume, power, etc. requirements. CYCLING OF PERSONNEL AND ANIMALS UTILIZING RENDEZVOUS TECHNIQUES In general, the SPAMAG favored an 8-man crew with replacement of 2 members at 90 days, 2 mem- bers at 240 days, and removal of ail at 360 days. As an alternative procedure, 2 crew members may be replaced at 60 days, 2 at 120 days, 2 at 240 days, is considered preferable if rendezvous capabilities and logistic considerations will allow. Provision must be made for the removal of the entire crew at any time during the orbital stay of the vehicle in case of an emergency. Recommendations for cycling of animals were for the same intervals and the same proportionate re- placement cycling to provide greater scope of infor- mation at the same data points used for evaluation of the crew. This would permit thorough study of the animals at these same critical points by means of intensive physiological and performance exami- nations and by means of gross and histologic stud- ies of morphological changes on sacrificed specimens of each animal group. -*.. ,\"A '... LABORATORY AND BIOINSTRUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (See also Volume (Space) Requirements.) Onboard laboratory and bioinstrumentation re- quirements in addition to those mentioned under Volume (Space) Requirements will include at least the following: computer using central package of logic, ECG, VCG, impedance pneumograph, tem- perature measurements, blood pressure, EEG manometer, electromyography, analog dis- play, tape recorder, measurement of sweating rate, body mass measurement, body volume measurement, bicycle ergometer, negative lower-body pressure ap- paratus, and additional laboratory methods. The following additional laboratory equipment is suggested : measurement of volume of respiratory gases, measurement of flow of respiratory gases, measurement of blood gases, measurement of acid- 144 MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AN ORBITING RESEARCH LABORATORY base chemistries, radioactive tracers, microscope, method of making frozen sections, swallowable in- strumentation for measurement of core temperature and pH of the GI tract, galvanic skin response, a behavioral testing panel, head restraint and camera for measurement of ocular motions, Barany chair device for semicircular canal studies, swing device for otolith studies, device for measurement of ego- centric visual location of the horizon, pupillometry and eye tracking devices, visual field device, a lab- oratory centrifuge, spectrophotometer or colorimeter, possibly an x-ray spectrometer, an osmotic pressure apparatus (as a substitute for measurements of spe- cific gravity of specimens), and provision for stor- age, refrigerated storage, frozen storage, and lyo- philized storage of specimens. The Group also recommended that designers be mindful of the necessity for carrying spare parts for much of the above equipment. In the opinion of the Group, virtually all of the laboratory equipment will require redesign from that used in Earth-based laboratories for use in the weightless environment. GROUND SUPPORT PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT The Group made the following recommendations : 1. A display system should be worked out to en- able ground-based monitors to have baseline data quickly available to them at all times. 2. Serious consideration should be given the use of a selective data sampling system based upon for- mal information content analysis in place of a \"total data dump system.\" 3. A group comprised of clinical medical con- sultants and of chief investigators should be avail- able for communication at all times for both clinical consultation and consultation with respect to bio- medical investigations for the ORL, should the need arise. The responsibility for experimental protocols and procedures and their control should rest with the chief investigators on the ground. Should ques- tions of illness or other clinical problems arise, both the medical consultants and the experimental con- sultants should be informed and should advise, since the welfare of the experimental subjects will mark- edly influence experimental protocols. 4. It would be advisable to investigate the pos- sibility of a special \"ambulance\" vehicle with an easier reentry mode (high L/D), perhaps with a specially trained medical attendant as a crew mem- ber. NECESSITY FOR TOTAL GROUND SIMULATION PRIOR TO FLIGHT The Group recommended that baseline studies performed on flight simulators should be of 2 &pes. One type would employ the actual flight crew as subjects for relatively short periods of time so as not to endanger their subsequent usefulness as in- flight experimental subjects. The other would em- ploy astronaut-like subjects exposing them to long- term simulations (although very probably less than the full duration of the flight). Simulations for purposes of training and testing of equipment, systems, and methodologies will be of relatively short duration and will reveal their own end points. As a general principle, wherever possible, all on- board equipment should be spaceflight tested in ad- vance of the ORL flight or flights. POSTLANDING MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS In the opinion of the Group, confinement and intensive observation for at least 1 month will be a postflight requirement. During this period of time, studies will be extensive, very probably even includ- ing tissue biopsy. It may also be necessary to have ad hoc postflight simulations to obtain baseline in- formation relative to a particular flight finding or situation. The flight crews will be under general observation for a long period of time, perhaps many years after the flight. It is even likely that their offspring, both preflight and subsequent, will be un- der long-term medical observation. All of this must be thoroughly explained and acceptable to the flight crew prior to selection. USE OF DOUBLE-ENDED TRAMPOLINE ONBOARD THE ORL As indicated under Onboard Laboratory and Bio- instrumentation Requirements, in' the opinion of the Group, the use of the double-ended trampoline, as an in-flight technique for exercising the cardio- vascular system, is worthy of investigation. f7u.s.
