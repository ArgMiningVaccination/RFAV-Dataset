These substances may occur naturally in the organism or may be engineered and produced in the laboratory. In cancer, some biological therapies stimulate or suppress the immune system to help the body fight cancer (e.g., immunotherapies ). Other biological therapies attack specific cancer cells (e.g., targeted therapies like ADC ). They may also lessen certain side effects caused by some cancer treatments or can be used to image tumors for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Types of biological therapy include immunotherapy (such as cytokines, cancer treatment vaccines, and some antibodies) and some targeted therapies. Also called biological response modifier therapy, biotherapy, and BRM therapy.4 A Brief History of Biologic Therapies and Diagnostics for Cancer5 Evolution of Biologics Biologic isolates and extracts Recombinant proteins Antibodies ADCs and imaging agents Viruses/VLPs and bacteria Autologous CAR T cells Engineered Cells and Synthetic Biology 6 Biological Response Modifiers Program, NCI Interferon studies in the 1970s NCI grants, contracts, and clinical trial support Monoclonal antibody production and acquisition Tumor vaccines Cell and gene therapies Oncolytic viruses and bacteria 7 Biopharmaceutical Development Program at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research NCI established the BDP in 1993 to: Provide specialized and unique technical expertise and services not available in the commercial market Feasibility studies of project candidates Development of manufacturing process and assays Perform GMP manufacturing, filling, testing, and release FDA and international regulatory filings Technology transfer to commercial entities >150 investigational agents since 1998 61% 17%12%10% Recombinant Proteins/Peptides Monoclonal Antibodies Viral Vectors Regulation of Biologics FDA CBER, CDER ICH Guidelines9 Tragedies Prompt Regulations 1800s Patent Medicines -Many injured or killed 1901 Diphtheria antitoxin contaminated with tetanus 1902 Biologics Control Act 1906 Bureau of Chemistry (Dr. Harvey Wiley) 1930 Food and Drug Administration1937 Elixir of Sulfanilamide -diethylene glycol contamination, 105 killed 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 1954- 56 Polio vaccine contaminated with SV -40 virus 1960 Thalidomide ~12,000 affected 1962 Kefauver -Harris Drug Amendments (cGMPs, safety testing) 1972 Control of biologics passed from PHS to FDA (CBER established ) 10 Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Regulations 21 CFR 110 GMPs for human food 21 CFR 111 GMPs for dietary supplements 21 CFR 210 GMPs for drugs: general 21 CFR 211 GMPs for finished pharmaceuticals 21 CFR 225 GMPs for medicated feeds 21 CFR 226 GMPs for Type A medicated articles 21 CFR 606 GMPs for blood & blood components 21 CFR 820 GMPs for medical devices 21 CFR 1271 Human Cells, Tissues, and Related ProductsPurpose of GMPs Identify critical areas and procedures for control to ensure the quality of the product Identify minimum requirements for control in these areas Require written procedures to describe HOW this control will be assured Require that written procedures be FOLLOWED and DOCUMENTED.

Due diligence of R&D/preclinical material and analysis of starting materials for GMP suitability (SISQP, cell line history, etc.) Can you make enough? Process development for scale-up feasibility, purification, assay development and SOPs, formulation stability, etc. Generate reference material: reference lot, cell banks, virus banks Set testing specifications: Analytical qualification for QC product release; forced degradation studies to inform the stability program Can you make the clinical lot? Pilot manufacturing, \"GMP dress rehearsal\": often use product for IND -directed toxicology studies and infusion stability studies IND-directed safety studies: Range finding, toxicology, biodistribution of release assays that will detect degradation and contamination19 Generic Questionnaire for Biologics https://next.cancer.gov/content/docs/Biologics_Product_Development_Questionnaire.pdf Gauge the developmental readiness of a biologic Address SISQP Specific questions for recombinant proteins, viral vectors, oligonucleotides, peptides, and cell products 20 NCI and Other Resources21 NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program -NExT Not a grant; no funding is provided to applicant Requires clear path to clinic/patient benefit Provides access to NCI drug development resources Applicant is a key member of the Project Team: involved in project planning, implementation, and has full access to data Free consultation servicehttps://next.cancer.gov22 PREVENT Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program Not a funding mechanism but a contract resource provided by NCI Focus is on cancer prevention Flexible entry points for agents and biomarkers into the development pipeline https://prevention.cancer.gov/major -programs/prevent -cancer - preclinical -drug-development -program23 IND-directed pharmacology and toxicology studies for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) (ncats.nih.gov/ trnd) IND-enabling studies including all the above in BriDGs 24 NHLBI Translational Research Resources Gene Therapy Resource Program www.gtrp.org ) Clinical grade AAV and Lentivirus IND-directed pharmacology and toxicology studies Regulatory support Studies, and Phase I Clinical Trial (or U44 PAR-21-233) Leveraging a combination of cooperative agreement "}
