Ashley Murcia gave an informative presentation at the Chaplin Library, on July 30, about oils that treat everything from diabetes to the common cold to insomnia. \"Conventional medicine is so divorced from herbal medicine. In some places around the world, doctors will prescribe an essential oil as a remedy,\" Murcia said. While this is true in developing countries, it is also true in European countries, where many have the same - or higher - standard of living than the United States. Essential oils have had a wide range of uses and have been an important source of treatment for thousands of years. Antibiotics were developed in the early 20th century and what people think of as modern medicine is really very recent when compared to homeopathic practices. Murcia cautioned people to do their research when using essential oils and did not encourage people to substitute them for conventional medications, but simply pointed out their benefits. \"I would rather take peppermint for a headache and not destroy my liver,\" she said. Some oils have multiple benefits. \"Lavender is calming and relaxing, helps people sleep, and can be used as a antihistamine,\" she explained. Oils are used aromatically, internally, or topically. One drop is all that is needed. \"When used topically, they need to be diluted because they are very strong. Mix them with other oils like coconut or sesame oil,\" Murcia advised. Consulting a chart to find the correct ratio is advisable. Essential oils are a concentrated form of various plants. They don't expire and can be purchased over the counter. Murcia represents the company doTerra. \"High quality oils should be used for medicinal purposes,\" she said. doTerra tests the plants extensively. Essential oils can also be purchased at the Willimantic Food Co-op. They were available at the presentation as well, and Murcia can be contacted at [murciashley@gmail.com](mailto:murciashley@gmail.com) for anyone interested in making a purchase or for more information. In addition to medicinal uses for people, they can also be used with animals. They are also a safe and efficient repellent for insect pests bothering people and pets. \"This was an interesting program. People might get a lot of health benefits by learning about essential oils,\" Eunice Edelman said. "}
