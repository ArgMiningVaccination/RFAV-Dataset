Ask your doctor how to safely treat pain to avoid addiction.", "sitename": "familydoctor.org", "date": "2019-04-17", "cleaned_text": "Nearly everyone in the nation agrees: Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug abuse is at epidemic levels. The two represent what a doctor prescribes (prescription medicine) and what you can buy without a doctor's prescription (OTC). Both have immediate and long-term consequences. The consequences can be serious, even deadly. The most commonly abused prescription drugs are opioids. These include codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and Fentanyl. These are known as pain medicines. They are prescribed by doctors for pain related to surgery, chronic medical conditions, and dental procedures. [Opioid addiction](https://familydoctor.org/condition/opioid-addiction/) can happen after just a week of use. The risk for long-term opioid abuse increases after only 5 days of taking the medicine. Some people who were supposed to take opioids for only a week are still taking them a year later. Current thinking encourages doctors to limit opioid prescriptions to just 3 days and if they are absolutely necessary. After 3 days, doctors encourage patients to use OTC pain medicine, such as Tylenol. Other prescription medicines that are abused include sedatives (to sleep), tranquilizers (to relax), and stimulants (to stay awake). OTC drug abuse also is common. [OTC medicines](https://familydoctor.org/otc-medicines-know-your-risks-and-reduce-them/) treat a variety of things. These include coughs, colds, pain, constipation, fluid build-up, and more. The most commonly abused OTC medicines include [cough syrups](https://familydoctor.org/cough-medicine-understanding-your-otc-options/) and [anti-diarrheal](https://familydoctor.org/antidiarrheal-medicines-otc-relief-for-diarrhea/) medicines. Other abuse involves taking OTC medicine for weight loss that is not designed for that purpose. This includes abusing laxatives, diuretics, and OTC diet pills. People abuse OTC medicine to get high or they take more than the allowed dosage to treat their symptoms. Path to improved health There are important steps you or a family member can take to reduce the risk of prescription and OTC drug abuse. Preventing prescription drug abuse: - Plan ahead. Talk to your doctor about treating pain if you or a family member have a surgery planned. By sharing your concerns, your doctor can limit your prescription or suggest using an OTC pain medicine first. They may have other suggestions, as well. - Tell your doctor if you or a family member has a history of substance abuse. - Follow dosing instructions. Do not take more than prescribed. - Do not take another person's prescription medicine. Do not share your medicine with others. - Do not take the medicine in another form (crushing and snorting or injecting). - Do not take prescription medicine for another reason (to get high). - If you have chronic pain from a medical condition, seek alternative pain relief. This may involve working with a physical therapist for special exercises. - Safely store prescription medicines away from children, teens, and others. - Properly dispose of old opioid medicines. Look for locked and secured bins designed for this. Some pharmacies and many police departments have the bins onsite. Look for \"drug take back\" days in your community. These are special days you can go to stores and other areas to drop off your old medicines. They are staffed by police. - Do not mix prescription medicine with alcohol. - Understand that there may be drug interactions when taking more than one prescription medicine. Preventing OTC drug abuse: - Follow dosing instructions. Do not take more than prescribed. - Do not take the medicine in another form (crushing and snorting or injecting). - Do not take OTC medicine for another reason (to get high, to lose weight, etc.). - If you have chronic pain from a medical condition, seek alternative pain relief. This may involve working with a physical therapist for special exercises. Too much OTC pain medicine can permanently damage your kidneys or liver. - Throw away expired medicines. - Understand drug interactions. You should not combine certain OTC medicines. Treating drug abuse: Your doctor or a medical health professional can diagnose opioid use disorder (misusing opioids) and opioid addiction. Opioid addiction is a chronic illness and should be treated the same as other chronic illnesses. Like those, it should continually be managed and monitored. You should feel comfortable discussing treatment with your family doctor, who is properly trained for this treatment. Treatment for opioid addiction is different for each person. The main goal of treatment is to help you stop using the drug. Treatment also can help you avoid using it again in the future. When you stop using opioids, your body will react. You will have a number of symptoms that may include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and anxiety. This reaction is called withdrawal. Your doctor can prescribe certain medicines to help relieve your withdrawal symptoms. They also will help control your cravings. These medicines include methadone (often used to treat heroin addiction), buprenorphine, and naltrexone. | Methadone | |Sublingual (under-the-tongue) tablet, buccal film (small patch that adheres to inner cheek), long-acting injection (shot) | |Tablet, Intramuscular injection (shot) | |Use||Daily||\u00b7 Daily for tablet | \u00b7 Every 4 weeks for injection |\u00b7 Daily for tablet | \u00b7 Every 4 weeks for injection |How to get medication|| | Constipation Heart problems (such as heart disease) Interactions with other drugs (there are medicines that you should not use with methadone) Overdose if combined with certain other medicines Nausea Constipation Headache Insomnia May be seen monthly for injections Table adapted with permission from Coffa and Snyder, 2019.

Abusing OTC medicine can lead to serious health problems. These can include memory loss, kidney failure, heart problems, even death. High doses of cough syrup can have serious side effects.
