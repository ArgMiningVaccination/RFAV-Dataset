A drug allergy is an allergic reaction to medication that occurs when the immune system is incorrectly activated by a drug. Vaccine allergy is very rare. It is usually caused by allergy to an excipient in the vaccine, rather than the active ingredient. A drug allergy is an allergic reaction to medication that occurs when the immune system is incorrectly activated by a drug. All drugs can cause allergic reactions that range from [skin rashes](/conditions/body-skin-problems-and-rashes/)/hives/itching, skin swellings, a runny nose, itchy watery eyes to [shortness of breath](/conditions/breathlessness/)/wheezing and dizziness. Drug anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction to a drug with reactions including: The most common triggers include: penicillins general anaesthetics. Initial treatment of a drug allergy requires discontinuation of the suspected drug and focus on relieving symptoms with antihistamines, corticosteroids and - in severe cases - adrenaline. Drug allergy is diagnosed by an allergy specialist experienced in the management of various types of drug allergy. Diagnosis can include [skin prick](/tests-diagnostics/skin-prick-tests/) and intradermal tests with the relevant drugs; [blood tests](/tests-diagnostics/allergy-blood-tests/) and a [drug provocation](/tests-diagnostics/drug-provocations-and-challenges/) (challenge) test where a small amount of the suspect drug is administered in a graded fashion under medical supervision. Vaccine allergy is very rare. It is usually caused by allergy to an excipient in the vaccine, rather than the active ingredient. An allergy specialist can diagnose this form of allergy, recommend safe alternatives and distinguish between allergic and non-allergic reactions. Skin tests with the relevant excipients/vaccines followed by a [vaccine provocation test](/tests-diagnostics/drug-provocations-and-challenges/) (challenge) can help confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
