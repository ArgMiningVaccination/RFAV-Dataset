Your energy, or lack thereof, affects every dimension of your life, including your mind, body, and spirit. Energy leakage can take shape in many ways: physical or mental tiredness, [loss of motivation](//www.blog.swiha.edu/getting-motivated-mondays/), frustration, and/or feeling stuck. These symptoms may be confusing for some, especially if you're self-aware and cautious with your health. However, even if you have positive energy flowing in, that energy will continue to leak if you are not healed. Of course, in order to heal yourself, you have to know that you are leaking energy in the first place! In my case, I was in Bali and was drawn to seek out some advice from a spiritual healer. Since this wasn't my first time [receiving guidance from a healer](https://swiha.edu/integrative-healing-arts-practitioner-online-programs/), I sort of knew what to expect during our meeting. However, she brought up a topic I wasn't quite expecting: my energy. She explained that my energy had been leaking due to my inability to let go of a past relationship. This leakage was negatively affecting my energy levels and my current pursuit of love and happiness. This information came as quite a shock, yet made a lot of sense. My energy had been leaking for years, impacting my whole well-being, and I never once made [the mind-body connection](https://swiha.edu/mind-body-t). Once I understood that I was leaking energy due to my past non-forgiveness, I began to look at all the other areas in my life that could be contributing to my energy leakage as well. What I found may apply to you as well. Are you leaking energy? Here are five areas that could be the cause and some holistic healing approaches to feeling better fast... Food Just like the air we breathe, [food can either energize us or make us feel ill](https://swiha.edu/holistic-nutrition-programs/) and run down. It took a specialist to tell me that I had chronic fatigue to realize that the food I was eating was doing more harm than good. What I was eating was leaving me feeling lethargic and unenergized, which made me want to reevaluate my entire lifestyle, especially my diet. If you feel the food you're eating is the culprit of your leaky energy--if it makes you tired and sick--it's time to replace it with better alternatives. [The fix was simple](//www.blog.swiha.edu/6-culinary-tips-to-enjoy-whole-food-s-)! To heal my system, I began eating naturally energizing foods, such as fresh and organic fruits, vegetables, and protein. If your diet is clean, balanced, and jives well with your body, it will energize you! At SWIHA, they call it [S.O.U.L. food](https://swiha.edu/holistic-nutrition-programs/) - seasonal, organic, unprocessed, and locally grown food. Environment Your work and living space can have a huge impact on your energy. Have you ever walked into a place and immediately felt suffocated or couldn't shake the feeling of bad vibes surrounding you? That's negative energy. I once found myself working in an environment so toxic that I found it interfering with other aspects of my life-- my mind, body, and spirit were in distress. My energy was leaking so severely that it was disrupting my sleep, health, beliefs, and emotions. In all honesty, it's difficult to find a workspace that is perfect; however, you have the power to change the energy around yourself. You can change harsh energy through [smudging](//www.blog.swiha.edu/topic/sacred-ceremony), positive affirmations, getting a [hypnotherapy session](https://swiha.edu/hypnotherapy-programs/), or in worst case scenarios, leaving the environment all together. Relationships Unfortunately, this is an area that can negatively affect many of us, whether we're unaware we're in an unhealthy relationship or unwilling to let go of one we know to be unhealthy. For me, my leaking energy was the result of a [negative attachment](//www.blog.swiha.edu/life-coaching-corner-non-attachment-sucks) that left me feeling shattered on the inside. The energy leakage was leaving me tired, unsettled, and unfilled. The area in my body most affected was my heart chakra-- the energy force for [joy, love, and compassion](//www.blog.swiha.edu/10-signs-that-indicate-you-are-an-empath-by-guest-blogger-laura-wilkinson/). This type of leaking occurs when we are giving our energy and self to the past and not to the present. If you find yourself in this situation, don't worry. There is hope! Healing the heart chakra begins from within through acceptance and self-love. Self-healing techniques can include visualization, rose quartz crystals, positive mantras, or a [good yoga class](//www.blog.swiha.edu/yoga-training-program-sharing-self-discovery-clearing-healing-yoga-nidra). Past Circumstances Much like holding onto past relationships, holding on to unpleasant feelings or events of the past can be extremely harmful to your energy. Like an old record on repeat, constantly replaying situations that are out of your control takes up a lot of precious energy. [Energy goes where the mind flows](//www.blog.swiha.edu/give-yourself-permission/). Living in the past will make it difficult to be your best self in the present. Although it may be difficult, coming to emotional terms with what happened and letting go will bring peace and space for new energy. Limiting Beliefs One of the biggest energy suckers might actually be coming from your own mind. The fear of failure, self-doubt, worrying, and all around limiting beliefs will slowly diminish your vitality. I would be lying if I said that there weren't times that I spent my energy not [owning my purpose and truth](//www.blog.swiha.edu/transformational-toe-readings-tell-you-the-truth), or thinking I wasn't worthy enough. In the end, it's not worth wasting that energy when you could be using that energy to create the life you deserve. A great fix to this leakage is through powerful self-love mantras and cleansing the crown chakra with a galaxite stone. Galaxite can protect, cleanse, and balance the aura as well as prevent future leakages. By bringing awareness to these five areas that you may be leaking energy and actively working to plug those energetic fissures, you can reclaim the energy that is rightfully yours and feel the benefits of a full, energetic life!
