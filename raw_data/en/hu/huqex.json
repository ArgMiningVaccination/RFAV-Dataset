Crystal is a certified functional nutritionist and occupational therapist. She is also a wife and mother of three boys. Over a decade ago, she decided to dive into integrative health coaching and then functional medicine as a way to complement her practice as an occupational therapist and to fulfill her passion of working with adults and children to improve their health and well being. While working with children and adults with autism and other neurological disorders, she noticed how behaviors and recovery changed with a change in diet. This spurred her on to discover the why, seek to learn more from the leaders in the field of functional medicine, and take a stand to make things different for her, her patients, and her family. Educating the people around her, empowering others to make changes, and encouraging them along the journey, is the heart of Way to Wellness. In 2021, Crystal received her Master's Degree in Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine from the University of Western States in Portland, OR. She is a licensed Certified Nutritionist in the State of Washington and works with clients all over the world. In addition, she enjoys being part of the healthcare team at Eastside Integrated Primary Care where she is the functional nutritionist. She specializes in gut health, autoimmune disease, gut-skin connection and cellular health. She received her Bachelor's Degree in Sports Physiology from Biola University in La Mirada, CA and Master's Degree in Occupational Therapy from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington. Crystal works with clients to help them create healthy lives in a way that is flexible, fun, and liberating. You will discover the food and lifestyle choices that best support you. Making gradual, lifelong changes enables you to reach your current and future health goals. "}
