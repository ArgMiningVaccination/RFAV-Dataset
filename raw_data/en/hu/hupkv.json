[Jackie King, LMT, CIMI, CBCP](#) My passion has always been to help others be the best they could be on a Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual level. This has inspired my second passion of continued learning to better serve my clients. Initially, my journey on the health and wellness path began with an AAS Degree in Occupational Therapy, immediately followed by additional schooling and licensing in Massage Therapy (MO License #2001009530). I worked for nearly 20 years in adult rehab teaching my patients self-care skills after a life-altering trauma or surgery. I also worked part-time as a Massage Therapist, helping my clients relax and let go of the daily stressors that cause pain and discomfort. After all those years, I left the OT world to expand my business and pursue my passion. This has been nothing short of a dream come true for me. I am now able to help my clients excel in every area of their life in a more relaxed, alternative manner. Over the years, I have taken several classes for certification to include Certified Infant Massage Instructor (CIMI #R08290), Level 1 Qigong and Food Healing, The Emotion Code, The Body Code and now, Usui Holy Fire Reiki Master. I have taken many classes specific for use with therapeutic grade essential oils and Tibetan Bowls for Sound Healing. My interests are varied, but all are focused on getting to the root of the problem, healing at the cellular level, and achieving overall balance once again. I believe we are all on our own journey seeking health, happiness, and abundance and the tools we need are specific for each of us. I am very proud of my accomplishments over the years and extremely grateful to be able to provide my clients with a broad base of healing tips, tools, and techniques to help heal their body and balance their soul. Client Love! In my profession I spend a lot of time sitting - both with clients and in front of a computer. Sitting for long periods of time puts strain on my back and neck and causes a lot of headaches. Jackie gives a great massage. I have heard people say they bought a certain number of massages from some of the local spas, but they have trouble getting in because the places are always booked. I've not had that issue with Jackie. She's convenient and accessible when I need her, and with the long hours I keep that is very much appreciated. I would not hesitate to send my friends, family and colleagues to Jackie. Thank-you. Heidi L. Martin, CFP \u00ae \"I've suffered from back and neck pain for more than 30 years. Meeting Jackie has been a blessing in my life. She is a HEALER with her massage techniques and tools that she uses. She uses essential oils and tuning forks as methods of healing and releasing stress in the body. NO run of the mill commercial massage \"company\" will EVER provide the healing that Jackie does. Her hands are magic and medicine..... I'm so grateful to have Jackie for the therapy I need to get relief and relaxation. There's no one better.\" Traci Everman, VP of Mortgage Lending Guaranteed Rate Jackie King and her organization have helped my family in many different ways. We were first introduced to her through her therapeutic massage techniques, which we fell in love with. Jackie's professional approach combined with her knowledge of massage enhances the experience. I know that each of her movements have a purpose to release tension and help heal my body. My wife began to learn about essential oils from Jackie. Since then, essential oils have become part of our everyday life. That goes for each member of our family from grandparents to children. Weather it is applying Lavender directly to help us sleep and night or diffusing stress relieving blends while we are working about the home, we enjoy the use and effects of the oils. I highly recommend Jackie's services. We have not only enjoyed them but benefited from them. Sincerely, The Gleize Family. What can I say about Jackie! She is about as dedicated to her clients and work as anyone could possibly be. She is constantly learning new ways to help people. She has certainly helped me. I try to see her at least once a month for her wonderful, healing massages. She has also made me a firm believer in essential oils. My husband and I especially like the balsam fir for muscle pain and arthritis. Susan P. \"Words cannot express how well and therapeutic Jackie's massages are. You need to personally experience a massage by Jackie King, LMT. As soon as you get to the door , you start relaxing, which continues as the massage progresses. I have experienced massages from other massage therapists, but Jackie's massage outweighs those by far. Jackie is able to get you so relaxed that, in my opinion, you start thinking that you are floating on air. She uses a special technique that requires what is called \"The Tibetan Bowl\" in which you actually feel a tingling sensation shooting through your entire body and then shortly after, you feel like you are starting to float on air. If anyone is seeking a massage therapist, I would highly recommend Jackie King. She makes you feel right at home and takes all your stress/tension away.\" Lisa Rolwes There are massages then there is Jackie King. She will take the time to find out your personal needs when it comes to mind & body. I have been going to Jackie for over two years she is a professional in all ways for the care of your personal health. Bob D Cartridge World \"The infant massage class gave me skills to soothe and bond with my baby using gentle touch techniques\" S.S ~ St. Charles MO \"Therapist Recommended-Especially to Heal From Past Trauma! Working with Jackie has been an amazing and eye-opening experience! As a mental health therapist for nearly 20 years, I've always been pretty open to exploring my emotions, but I have to admit, I was a little skeptical in the beginning how much this would \"work\" or what would happen. During my Emotion Code session with Jackie, I was absolutely floored by all of the trapped emotions she uncovered. Nearly all of them I was able to immediately tie to certain events and experiences I'd had at the exact age she said (without her having any prior knowledge). However, some were so unconscious and repressed, it was really through her gentle questioning, nature, and intuition, we were able to bring those to the surface. I can hardly put into words the immense release, lightness, and awareness I experienced from our session. I know anyone could benefit from working with Jackie, but especially those who've experienced past or current trauma and are having challenges really clearing or fully healing...definitely give Jackie a call!\" \"After going through The Emotion Code, \"I felt like I was buzzing...I feel like I've been pulled out of the Quicksand.\" Ann M. - York, Maine \"I had a frequency healing session with Jackie, and it was AMAZING. My heart felt so open that I felt like singing and dancing all day, plus it took care of a minor headache I had. Jackie is very knowledgeable and open to answering questions, plus she is warm-hearted and caring. I highly recommend working with her!\" ~ A.H. ~ New Hampshire "}
