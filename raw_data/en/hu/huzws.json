Hormones are chemical messengers that help regulate different processes in the body. From feeling hungry to when it's time to sleep, we need hormones to keep our bodies on track. But what happens when your hormones are out of balance? Discover seven natural ways to help prevent the hormonal see-saw. Your hormones include adrenaline, insulin and cortisol and the thyroid hormones, as well as the sex hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone. Hormones are secreted by various glands around the body including your pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands, and travel through the bloodstream to reach their target organ. The hormonal, or endocrine system is complex and often compared to an orchestra, playing a symphony. If all the instruments play in tune, in time, beautiful music results. But if one or more elements goes wrong, the whole production can fall into chaos. Hormones can affect nearly all aspects of our health and wellbeing. But we may notice an imbalance most when our sex hormones are out of kilter. In women, this is most evident at times of change during the reproductive years - puberty, around menstruation, during and after pregnancy, and throughout perimenopause (the five to 10 years leading up to menopause). You may experience: Conventional treatments for hormonal issues can include hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). But there's a lot you can do with diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help restore hormone balance.

If you're stressed, for example, you may sleep badly and rely on alcohol. Or if you have a poor diet and don't exercise you can become overweight.
