And get enough rest. And exercise, too. Popular home preventives and remedies have varying degrees of merit, experts and residents in the Fox Valley say. Take that apple-a-day advice, for example. \"It doesn't mean that if you eat an apple every day you will never have a need to see a doctor,\" said Jennifer Kurka, a physician with the Rush-Copley Medical Group. \"The concept is that an apple is something that is healthy to eat because of the minerals and fiber that it provides for the body.\" There are healthier foods, though. While it might not be good news to those whose noses crinkle at cruciferae, broccoli and its cousins, cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts and their ilk can pack a powerful preventive punch. The antioxidants beta carotene and vitamins C and E help bolster the immune system, which strengthens resistance to viral infection. Protein and zinc also are important for resistance. Kurka said she also thinks there is some truth to the suggestion to steer clear of dairy during times of mild colds. \"Dairy, for some, can produce mucus, and if you're already suffering from the mucus caused by a cold, avoiding some dairy does make a difference, especially for children who don't know how to blow their nose,\" she said. A good diet plus assorted preventive measures can minimize vulnerability to the germs that cause coughs, common colds and the flu. \"Your body needs nutrients, your body needs fluids to fight off an illness,\" said George Aghia, a family medicine physician with Edward Medical Group. \"I think just in general, eating a healthy, well-balanced diet can keep your immune system healthy.\" It's something that works well for Pat Armstrong, 80, of Naperville. \"I just eat lots of fruits and vegetables,\" she said, adding that she takes a supplement made of organically grown and dried vegetables in capsule form that she buys from a consultant. \"I eat wild plants and fruits and vegetables. I do not buy any boxed things or prepared things. I don't eat any of those foods with funny chemicals in them.\" Specialized teas also are part of Armstrong's anti-illness arsenal. She makes an infusion of mullein leaf and drinks that daily, and uses osha root, a perennial wild herb related to parsley, as a tincture. \"I had asthma and hay fever as a child, and so my lungs were aged. And now in the winter, I do develop bronchitis,\" she said. \"I only do that in the winter time, because the air is cold and dry and irritates my lungs,\" she said. Tea can have some therapeutic value, Aghia said, although there is scant medical research suggesting it carries actual medicinal properties. \"Tea is something that I recommend a lot for people who have a cold or flu. I think part of it is because it's hot, it does have that mucus thinning. Same thing with warm showers,\" said Aghia, who suggests adding lemon and honey for their nutrients, to help build immunity. \"It's plus or minus. A lot of it is just feeling better, drinking tea. Just feeling better will boost your immune system.\" Coffee is not the same, said Ric Saguil, who practices integrative and family medicine in Bartlett and is on staff at Advocate Sherman Hospital in Elgin. \"It can be an irritant to the gut,\" said Saguil, who is teaching a series of classes this month on weight loss and healthy lifestyle at Advocate Sherman. \"I'm surprised by the number of people on acid reflux-related medications.\" Vitamin C can have the same effect, he said, particularly in high doses. . His advice for wellness support includes zinc tablets. \"Evidence-based medicine has shown modest improvements with outcomes,\" he said. Many people swear by echinacea, a supplement derived from coneflowers that is thought to support resistance to colds, but there is limited research on its powers. \"There is no medical evidence proving that taking echinacea truly does anything for a common cold, but if a patient feels it minimizes the number of days of a cold or they feel better, it's not something that is going to be harmful,\" Kurka said. The blend of herbal extracts, amino acids, antioxidants, electrolytes, vitamins and other ingredients marketed under the brand name Airborne is favored by many teachers, but Saguil said research has shown \"weak outcomes\" for its power to fight off colds as well. But its flavor may help with flluid consumption, which has assorted benefits, including the breakup of congestion. OK, so what about that age-old panacea, chicken soup? \"The chicken soup remedy provides the body with the proper liquids during times of common colds,\" said Kurka, pointing out that it can soothe digestion as well, although the benefits may be largely anecdotal. \"I don't know that studies have actually proven that chicken soup keeps down inflammation.\" Aghia has seen a hint of empirical evidence that chicken soup can help ward off ailments. \"There have been some studies that suggest there may be some characteristic in chicken broth that might boost your immune system,\" Aghia said, though he admitted that may be due in part to the immunity-boosting comfort to be found in a bowl of soup. \"On top of that, it also has some electrolytes and fluids that can help you feel better.\" Saguil is a proponent of using saline solutions and Neti Pots to flush out sinus cavities and keep them moist and free of irritants. \"Irritants cause boogers, which block the sinus cavities, which can lead to sinus infections,\" he said. Germs abound when people stay inside to avoid the weather. The solution is a no-brainer: get outside. Armstrong, who maintains a chemical-free system of natural plant species around her southeast Naperville home, said she makes sure to walk two miles every day. \"I climb mountains, too,\" she said. Saguil leads walking tours in the area. \"If you drive anywhere around here, you pass by a trail head,\" he said. But didn't Mom say it's not good to go out and if you do to wear extra layers? Aghia debunks that one. \"Being out in the cold or being out in the cold with wet hair, things like that (could possibly) affect your immune system,\" he said. \"But unless you come into contact with a virus, that won't make you sick.\" Kurka elaborates. \"Cold weather does not cause people to get sick,\" she said. \"But when the body's temperature drops, a person can become more susceptible to getting an infection. Not wearing a hat can decrease your body temperature, which potentially can make you more susceptible to getting sick. There is some validity to wearing a hat in the winter.\" Then there are arguments that a very cold winter, or a warm one, can affect the longevity of the viruses that cause illness. \"I think that's also a fallacy,\" Aghia said. \"These germs are pretty resilient, and they're able to find their way to propagate through these various conditions.\" Diminished daylight, plus the cold, may fuel lethargy and listlessness, another challenge to staying well. Saguil noted that sleep patterns and the body's circadian rhythms can become disrupted by extended darkness, for which he suggests valerian root, melatonin supplements, hops and the herb rhodiola. Vitamin D, associated with sunshine, can be important to general wellness and disease resistance. To get the recommended daily minimum intake of at least 600 international units, a supplement is recommended, Saguil said, in addition to eating some fish, orange juice, milk and eggs. While there are over-the-counter medications that can provide relief from common cold symptoms, Kurka acknowledges there is no getting around the season's ubiquitous congestion and plugged nasal passages. \"There really isn't a cure for the common cold. We do not prescribe antibiotics to patients suffering from a cold,\" she said. \"For nonmedication (remedies,) I will prescribe that children and adults drink plenty of fluids. Whether it is chicken soup or water, it helps to rehydrate the body.\" Staying well through winter's darkest days mostly demands common sense. \"Be on your game,\" Saguil said. \"Try to get enough sleep, eat properly, and do what you can to work realistic hours.\" Former Naperville Sun reporter Susan Frick Carlman contributed to this story.
