the Hospital Association of Southern California contracted with Scientific Technologies Corporation to complete a regional Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for several of its member hospitals representing the greater Inland Empire including San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The assessment incorporates three distinct data methodol ogies that when interpreted together provide a deeply rich picture of the health landscape of these communities. The first assessment consists of a plethora of health indicators (hospitalizations, social determinants of health, maternal and child health , mortality and morbidity) gathered from multiple primary and secondary sources. This quantitative data illustrates the current snapshot of health statistics in the communities that the member hospitals serve and also how they compare across geographical bou ndaries. The quantitative data was stratified by common public health groupings and service areas allowing a targeted identification of unique challenges and opportunities. It identifies priority issues related to community health and quality of life by analyzing health status, quality of life and risk factors in the community. In addition to statistics, a community health quality of life survey was administered to get community feedback regarding the strengths and areas of opportunity that assist in the co mmunity. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data was also garnered through the use of community member , health expert and key stakeholder focus groups. These 8 focus groups were conducted in both English and Spanish to reveal thoughts, percepti ons and to augment the quantitative data collected in the assessment process. The focus groups allowed a deep understanding of the issues respondents believe are important. The following report provides a detailed review of health in the Inland Empire and it is clear to see some similarities and variability across counties and hospital service areas . There are quite a few health indicators that stand out as desirable and others indicating an opportunity for additional study and outreach. A brief synopsis o f some of those is below: Hospitalizations Women have a significantly higher proportion of hospitalizations due to asthma compared to men at all hospitals. Approximately 40% of hospitalizations due to breast cancer are among Hispanic women at San Antonio R egional Hospital and Parkview Community Hospital Medical Center. Social Determinants of Health The proportion of adults 25 years and older whose highest level of education was high - school graduate/GED or lower, was significantly higher in San Bernardino an d Riverside Counties compared to the proportion in the United States and in the State of California. In 2014, approximately one in five people lived in poverty in San Bernardino County. In the 2014 -2015 academic school year, the proportion of eligible students for free and reduced meals was 19% higher in San Bernardino County compared to California and 9% higher in Riverside County compared to California. Maternal and Child Health Low birth weight in San Bernardino County was 12% higher compared to Riverside County and 7.4% higher compared to California. Riverside County has a significantly higher proportion of pregnant women receiving adequate prenatal care during their pregnancy compared to California. Mortality The rate for all -cause mortality was significantly higher in San Bernardino County (750.8/100,000) compared to Riverside County (669.5/100,000) and California (641.1/100,000). Likewise, the all -cause mortality rate was significantly higher for Riverside County compared to California. The all -cause mortality rate for San Bernardino County was 12% higher than Riverside County and 17% higher than California. Riverside's all -cause mortality rate was 4.4% higher than Cali fornia. Intro duction The Inland Empire teamed together to compile an extensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for the Hospital Association of Southern California. Working as a cohesive group to gather and analyze data for various service areas was vital. A three - tiered data collection method was used and included the collection and analysis of health indicators, focus group sessions and a Quality of Life survey (QOL). Primary and secondary health indicator data was assessed, bringing areas of need to the forefront. F ocus groups were held in eight different locations, bringing together several community leaders, hospitals executives, board representatives and members of the community. Allowing community members to come together to discuss points of concern, resources, positive changes that have been made and areas of improvement was extremely effective. Additionally, understanding the concerns of the individuals who live and work in the Inland Empire allowed for discussion and positive brain storming. Mass distribution of a QOL survey was disseminated across the Inland Empire. In addition to identifying respondent's views on various community issues and health behaviors, the survey serves as an instrument to prioritize next steps. Methodology The CHNA assessment was co mpleted using a three - tiered data collection approach, primary and secondary source data collection, quality of life survey and focus groups. Health indicators (hospitalizations, social determinants of health, discharges, maternal and child health , mortal ity and morbidity) were gathered from multiple primary and secondary public data sources. Data was abstracted and transferred into an excel spreadsheet and cleaned. Algorithms and formulas were created in spreadsheets to check data for accuracy. Once da ta was cleaned, it was transferred to a Stata database using Stat Transfer 10 and was then analyzed. Data elements were stratified by gender, age groups, race/ethnicity and location. Percentages and rates were calculated and analyzed for statistical signi ficance. Confidence intervals were used to show the differences in the outcomes for specific indicators displayed in bar graphs and in tables. Confidence intervals are ranges of numbers used to assess the accuracy of a point estimate and measure the variab ility in the data. The point estimate may be a rate, such as a deat h rate or incidence of a disease , or a frequ ency, such as the percent of pregnancies with low birth weight . The confidence intervals account for the uncertainty that arises from the natural variation inherent in the world around us. Confidence intervals also account for the difference between a sample from a population and the population itself. For the analysis of this report, confidence intervals were calculated at the 95 percent confidenc e level. This means that 95 times out of 100 the confidence interval captures the true value for the population. Sample size is inversely proportional to the precision of these estimates. Therefore, larger samples produce more precise estimates with smalle r confidence intervals. You can then use confidence intervals to determine statistical significance at a glance. When the confidence intervals of two comparison groups do not overlap, you may conclude that the two sample estimates are truly different and n ot likely attributable to chance, thus there is a true difference (significant difference) . When confidence intervals overlap you may conclude that there is no difference between the estimates. When observed differences were observed between estimates using confidence intervals, additional significan ce testing between or within grou ps was conducted by using a chi-square or logistic regression test with a probability level (p -value) of 0.05 us ed as the criterion to determine the strengt h of the statistically signif icant differences in the results. Data that contained an n -value of 10 or less observations under hospitalizations were not analyzed and were identified with an * in the table and graphs were not generated. Moreover, analysis with 10 or fewer data elements is deemed unreliable and is a threshold for confidentiality. Analysis for mortality data was adjusted for age using 2000 population data, whereas crude rates were calculated for morbidity data. Quantitative data regarding t opics in this report were analyzed using Stata version 13 or Epi - Info version 7 . Nine service areas were identified for this report. They include: LLUMC, LLUMC -Murrieta, Parkview, San Hospital, San Gorgonio, Ridgecrest, and Montclair. For the hospitalization segment and the Quality of Life Survey segment, data was analyzed by hospital service areas. Hospital service areas were identified by using primary and secondary service area zip codes from San Bernardino County and Riverside County for all service areas. The QOL survey was designed to gain anonymous feedback from those who live and work in the Inland Empire. The survey was designed to be administered electronically through Survey Monkey and also to be completed as a paper document. The QOL survey was distributed in various forms including, email lists, paper copies, many of which were passed out at focus groups, links on social media pages and also given at health care facilities. Spanish versio ns were available for those whose f irst language was not English. Demographic Information The population in the State of California is 38,548,204.

Education Educational attainment is commonly used to assess the influence of socioeconomic circumstances on health and is a strong determinant of current and future employment and income. An individual's overall physical and mental health and life expectancy are directly correlated to their income, and research has shown that educational attainment is one of the strongest predictors of income. For most people, educational attainment reflects material and other resources of the family and the knowledge and skills attained by young adulthood. Therefore, education captures both the long -term influence of early life circumstances and the influence of adult circumstances on adult health. The gradient of educational attainment illust rates that people with a higher level of education are more likely to have higher paying jobs and are more likely to be employed than people with a lower level of education. Studies have shown that each additional year in school is associated with increase d life expectancy and better health. Research also suggests that people who complete higher levels of education have better cognitive and psychological resources, such as problem solving, practice with teamwork, dependability, structure, and routine. What' s more, research demonstrates less educated individuals are more likely to be employed in jobs that are low -wage and require less skill, working in conditions that are more dangerous, stressful, and offer the worker less control than that enjoyed by more h ighly educated individuals. Furthermore, low -wage and low -skill jobs more often do not provide health insurance, making it more difficult to access preventive and immediate health care. Conversely a person's health also affects their education. Health cond itions are a common contributor to the decision to leave school. For instance, pregnancy, parental or sibling illness, and chronic conditions such as asthma, can all lead to excessive absenteeism and ultimately to dropout. As a result, individuals are less educated and in the course of their life are more likely to resign to low paying jobs.

Degree Income The association and relationship between higher levels of economic wealth and optimal health, and lower levels of economic wealth and poor health, have been well documented. It has been illustrated that different levels of income have significant differenc es in health outcomes. Income is the indicator that most directly measures material resources and can influence health by its direct effect on living standards; sp ecifically, access to better quality food, housing, and health care services. In addition, in come is used to measure an individual's socioeconomic status (SES). As a result, SES is closely tied to health outcomes as it provides access to a wide range of advantages. Such advantages include higher education, access and availability of profess ional o ccupations that offer benefits, and a better living environment. This directly influences an individual's power, prestige, and is beneficial to their social connections - all of which may provide greater protection against high risk behavio rs that ultimate ly affect a person's health. Median Income Data Source: American Community Survey, 2009 -2014 A median household income refers to the income level earned by a given household where half of the homes in the area earn more and half earn less.

The stress of joblessness can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and poor mental health. Unemployment can also affect a neighborhood's well -being. As the levels of joblessness increase, sociability and collective participation and commitment in solving neighborhood problems are weakened. Thus, when peop le cannot find work, they are more likely to turn to crime and street economy (e.g. selling drugs, working in commercial sex) to make money. Data Source: Bureau of Labor of Statistics , December 2014 -January 2016 Unemployment occurs when a person who is actively searching for employment is unable to find work.

Health Care Access The lack of access to adequate healthcare can pose barriers to one's physical and psychological well-being. The rates of mortality, morbidity, and visits to emergency departments can be reduced when the population has appropriate access to healthcare services. This section includes key indicators that form a picture of access in the Inland Empire area.

Top Discharges by Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) A Diagnosis -Related Group (DRG) is a statistical system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses into more than 20 major body systems and subdivid es them into almost 500 groups for the pu rpose of reimbursement, payment and cont racting purposes. The following DRG tables are based on the Medicare - severity DRGs (MSDRG). T here are some diagnoses with multiple MSDRG codes which were combined into a singl e diagnosis category. The rationale was to have one total for all the DRGs for a particular diagnosis without regard to the distinction of complicating or comorbid condition, major complicating or comorbid condition , etc. The data source used for the county level and hospital specific DRG tables was the 2014 Patient Discharge Data from the Office of Statewide Planning and Development (OSHPD) Statewide Model Data Set for Hospitals .

Maternal and Child Health Maternal and child health outcomes such as birth weight , adequacy of prenatal care and infant mortality rates provide critical information on the health of a population. Improving such outcomes has a reciprocal effect on health outcomes later in life. Key Findings Among all births from 2011 to 2013, it was observed that 7.3% of births were low birth weight for San Bernardino County compared to 6.5% in Riverside County; a significant difference. Low birth weight in San Bernardino County was 12% higher compared to Riverside County and 7.4 higher compared to California. Approximately 75% of pregnant women receive adequate prenatal care during their pregnancy in San Bernardino, which is significan tly lower than Riverside County (81.8%) and California State (79.2%). Riverside County has a significantly higher proportion of pregnant women receiving adequate prenatal care during their pregnancy compared to California. The proportion of women rec eiving adequate prenatal care in San Bernardino County is eight percent lower compared to Riverside County and 4.5% lower compared to California. Approximately one in three pregnancies in San Bernardino County are in women 15 -19 years of age, whereas in Riverside County and in the State of California it is approximately one in four pregnancies.

About 1 in every 13 infants born in the United States is born with low birth weight (approximately 48 8%) and 67% of low birth weight infants are born prematurely. Infants who are low birth weight have a 25% chance of dying before the age of one. More than three quarters of infant deaths are caused by babies being bo rn too small or too early. Low birth weight infants have higher rates of subnormal growth and of adverse health conditions. They are also at an increased risk of serious health problems as newbo rns, of developmental problems in which they can experience d elayed motor and social development, having a learning disability of, and dying within their first year of life . Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2011 -2013 Among all births from 2011 to 2013, it was observed that 7.3% of births were low birth weight for San Bernardino County compared to 6.5% in Riverside County; a significant difference. The proportion was also significantly higher compared to the State of C alifornia.

There was no difference in the proportion of low birth weight between Riverside County and California. First Trimes ter Prenatal Care Prenatal care refers to the medical attention received by women before and during their pregnancy, specifically addressing the mother's well -being during her pregnancy and caring for the development of her baby. The goal of prenatal care is to detect potential problems early on in the pregnancy and to prevent potential complications. Early prenatal care is a significant component in ensuring a good pregnancy outcome. Although it is recommended for women to begin prenatal care during the fi rst trimester, some women seek prenatal care at a later stage 7.3 6.5 6.8 012345678 San Bernardino County Riverside County CaliforniaPercent Low birth Weight , 2011 -2013 in their pregnancy or not at all. Women who receive late or no prenatal care are at risk for having undetected complications of pregnancy that can result in severe maternal morbidity and mortali ty and in serious consequences to the unborn infant including low birth weight, premature birth, morbidity, and mortality. Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2011 -2013 The proportion of women receiving prenatal care in th eir first trimester was approximately 85% for both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. This was consistent with the State of California. There was no significant difference when the proportion of low birth weight for California was compared to San Ber nardino and Riverside Counties. Adequate Prenatal Care Adequate prenatal care calculations are based on the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index (APNCU), which measures the utilization of prenatal care on two dimensions. The first dimension, adequac y of initiation of prenatal care, measures the timing of initiation using the month prenatal care began reported on the birth certificate. The second dimension, adequacy of received services, is measured by taking the ratio of the actual number of visits r eported on the birth certificate to the expected number of visits. The expected number of visits is based on the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology prenatal care visitations standards f or uncomplicated pregnancies , and is adjusted for the gestat ional age at initiation of care and for the gestational age at delivery. The two dimensions are combined into a single summary index, and grouped into four categories: Adequate Plus, Adequate, Intermediate, and Inadequate. For this report , the percent of i nfants whose mothers received Adequate and Adequate Plus prenatal care are combined i nto one category, Adequate/Adequate plus prenatal care. Adequate plus prenatal care is defined as prenatal care beginning by the 4th month of pregnancy and the expecting mother received 110% or more of the recommended visits . Adequate prenatal care is defined as prenatal care beginning by the 4th month of pregnancy and the expecting mother receives 80-109% of the recommended visits . 83.4 84.5 83.6 80818283848586 San Bernardino County Riverside County CaliforniaPercent First Trimrster Prenatal Care, 2011 -2013 Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2011 -2013 Approximately 75% of pregnant women receive adequate prenatal care during their pregnancy in San Bernardino, which is significantly lower than Riverside County (81.8%) and California State (79.2%). Riverside County has a significantly higher proportion of pregnant women receiving adequate prenatal care during their pregnancy compared to California. The proportion of women receiving adequate prenatal care in San Bernardino County is eight percent lower compared to R iverside County and 4.5% lower compared to California. Riverside's proportion is 3.3% higher compared to California. Teenage Pregnancy Teen pregnancy is an important issue for several reasons. First, nearly all teen pregnancies are unplanned. In addition, teen pregnancy is closely linked to a host of other critical social issues \u2014 poverty and income, overall child well -being, out -of-wedlock births, responsible fatherhood, health issues, education, child welfare, and other risky behavior. There ar e also substantial public costs associated with adolescent childbearing. Moreover , women who become pregnant during their teens are at increased risk for medical complications, such as premature labor, and social consequences. 75.8 81.8 79.2 7072747678808284 San Bernardino County Riverside County CaliforniaPercent Adequate Prenatal Care, 2011 -2013 Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2011 -2013 Approximately one in three pregnancies in San Bernardino County are in women 15 -19 years of age, whereas in Riverside County and in the State of California it is approximately one in four pregnancies. Th e percent in San Bernardino County is significantly higher compared to Riverside County and California. There is no difference in the proportion of births to women 15-19 years of age between Riverside County and California. The proportion of births to women 15 -19 years of age in San Bernardino County is 25% higher compared to Riverside County and California. Breastfeeding Initiation Breastfeeding an infant provides benefits to both the mother and the infant. Breastfed infants have fewer ear infections, le ss diarrhea and constipation, and fewer illnesses. Breastfeeding also helps protect against allergies, asthma, some childhood cancers, and diabetes. For the mother, breastfeeding returns the uterus to its normal size more quickly than if a mother does not breastfeed, it reduces the risk of some types of ovarian and breast cancer, and provides an opportunity for rest and bonding with their infant. 31.8 25.5 25.5 05101520253035 San Bernardino County Riverside County CaliforniaPercent Teenage Pregnancy, 2011 -2013 Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2011 -2013 The proportion of women who initiated breastfeeding after having a baby was 87.5% for San Bernardino County. This was significantly lower compared to Riverside County (91.6%) and the State of California (92.3%). When Riverside County was compared to California, the proportion was s imilar and no difference was observed. The proportion for San Bernardino County was 4.5% lower compared to Riverside County and five percent lower compared to California. Preterm Births Preterm birth is defined as childbirth occurring earlier than 37 co mpleted weeks of pregnancy. Infants born prematurely have an increased risk of health complications, including infant mortality, and are at a greater risk for developing long -term disabilities and conditions; such as cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal problems, and vision and hearing loss. The risk of adverse outcomes is directly related to the length of a woman's pregnancy: the shorter the term of the pregnancy, the greater the risk the newborn has for complications and disabilities, r anging from mild to severe. 87.5 91.6 92.3 82848688909294 San Bernardino County Riverside County CaliforniaPercent Breastfeeding Initiation, 2011 -2013 Data Source: California Department of Health, Birth Certificates, 2010 -2013 The proportion of preterm births remained stable from 2010 to 2013 for both San Bernardino County and Riverside County. The difference in the propor tion of preterm births between the counties was similar with the exception of 2012 , where the proportion for San Bernardino County was significantly higher. Overall from 2010 to 2013 (aggregate), the proportion of preterm births was significantly higher i n San Bernardino County (8.9%) compared to Riverside County (8.5%). The proportion was approximately five percent higher in San Bernardino County compared to Riverside County. Infant Mortality Infant mortality is a useful indicator for the level of health in a community. It is defined as the number of deaths of infants younger than one year of age per 1,000 live births for a given period of time. Infant mortality is related to the underlying health of the mother, public health practices, socioeconomic cond itions, and the availability and use of appropriate health care for infants and pregnant women. Two -thirds of infant deaths occur in the first month after birth and are primarily due to health problems of the infant or the pregnancy, such as preterm delive ry or birth defects. Infant deaths occurring after the first month are influenced greatly by social or environmental factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke or problems with access to health care. 8.9 8.7 9.2 8.9 8.9 8.6 8.4 8.4 8.5 8.5 77.588.599.510 2010 2011 2012 2013 Overall 2010-2013Percent Preterm Births, 2010 -2013 San Bernardino County Riverside County Lower CI Upper CI Lower CI Upper CI 5.2 6.9 4.2 5.7 1.7 8.2 0.7 6.3 7.7 16.2 5.7 16.2 4.5 6.7 3.6 5.7 3.9 7.4 3.5 6.6 INFANT MORTALITY: WHITE 5.4 4.8 3.9INFANT MORTALITY: BLACK 11.4 10.0 9.8 INFANT MORTALITY: HISPANIC 5.5 4.6 4.7INFANT MORTALITY: ALL RACES 6.0 5.0 4.8 INFANT MORTALITY: ASIAN/PI 3.6Infant Mortality Indicator 2010-2012 Riverside Infant Confidence Death Rate95% Confidence LimitsInfant Death RateINFANT MORTALITY Data Source: Birth Certificates, California Depar tment of Health, 2010 -2012 Overall the infant mortality rate from 2010 to 2012 for all races was significantly higher in San Bernardino County (6.0%) compared to California (4.8%).

Cancer mortality is usually expressed as the number of deaths due to cancer per 100,000 population. The impact that cancer has on the lives of patients, their fam ilies, and the health care system cannot be overstated. The long -term emotional, physical, and psychological strain on individuals diagnosed with cancer \u2014and their families \u2014is profound. In addition, the cost of cancer also places a heavy burden on the health care system.

It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Most people who get the flu will have mild illness, will not need medical care or antiviral drugs, and will recover in less than two weeks. Some people, however, are more likely to get flu complications that result in being hospitalized and occasionally result in death. Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections and ear infections are examples of flu -related complications. The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have the fl u, and people with chronic congestive heart failure may experience a worsening of this condition that is triggered by the flu. Moreover, the flu is more dangerous than the common cold for children. Each year flu places a large burden on the health and well -being of children and their families. Also, i t has been recognized for many years that people 65 years and older are at greater risk of serious complications from the flu compared with young, healthy adults because human immune defenses become weaker with age. While flu seasons can vary in severity, during most seasons, people 65 years and older bear the greatest burden of severe flu disease. Data Source: Death Certificates, California Department of Health, 2010 -2013 Mortality due to influenza/pneumoni a was significantly lower in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties compared to the State of California.

The most deadly of these is chronic obstructiv e pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes it hard to breathe. COPD includes two main illnesses; emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD. If you smoke, you are 12 times as likely to die of COPD as men who have never smok ed. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis also are strongly associated with lung cancer.

The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances. Liver disease can be inherited (genetic) or caused by a variety of factors that damage the liver, such as viruses and alcohol use. Obesity is also associated with liver damage. Over time, damage to the liver results in scarring (cirrhosis), this can lead to liver failure, a life - threatening condition. Data Source: Death Certificates, Califor nia Department of Health, 2010 -2013 The mortality rate due to chronic liver disease/cirrhosis was significantly higher for San Bernardino County (13.9/100,000) compared to California (11.7 /100,000), however there was no difference between Riverside County (12.6/100,000) and California.

They account for 1 of every 4 people treated in an emergency department. Death can result from many types of accidents, such as car accidents, drug overdose, falls, drownings, poisonings, fires and burns. Men account for more unintentional injury deaths than females. In many cases, accidental injury can be prevente d. Data Source: Death Certificates, California Department of Health, 2010 -2013 Mortality due to accidents (unintentional injuries) was significantly higher in Riverside County (31.6/100,000) compared to California (27.9/100,000) and San Bernardino Cou nty ((25/100,000).

More than 2.5 million Americans went to the emergency department (ED ) and nearly 200,000 were then hospitalized for crash injuries in 2012. On average, each crash -related ED visit costs about $3,300 and each hospitalization costs about $57,000 over a person's lifetime. Data Source: Death Certificates, California Department of Health, 2010 -2013 Mortality due to motor vehicle traffic accidents was significantly higher in San Bernardino County (10/100,000) and Riverside County (9.6/100,000) compared to the State of California (7.6/100,000).

Although more women than men attempt suicide, men are almost four times more likely than women to die by suicide. One reason is that men are more likely to use deadlier means, such as firearms, when they set out to take their own lives. Moreover, the highest suicide rates in the United States are among whites and American Indian/Alaska Natives. The reasons some people want to take their own lives are complex. We do know that many people who die by suicide have a mental illness, usually depression, a substance use problem, or both. Treating mental illness and substance abuse can lower the risk of suicide. Men get treatment less often than women do. Many factors can work together to lead a person to suicide. Some factors that may increase a person's risk of suicide include: Age. Suicide rates for men are highest among those 75 and older. Also, older men are much more likely to commit suicide than older women. A major loss. These can range from losing a loved one , like your wife, to losing your freedom, like being sent to prison. Social isolation. Those who kill themselves often live alone and have little contact with others. Family history of suicide. A personal history of attempted suicide is a risk factor too. Family violence. This includes being a victim of physical or sexual abuse. Unemployment. Research shows that suicide rates increase during times of wide unemployment, especially among working -age men. Being around someone else who attempts suicide. Having a friend or family member who dies by suicide can increase a person's risk.

A drug includes illicit or street drugs (e.g., heroin and cocaine), as well as legal prescription and over -the-counter drugs; alcohol is not included. Deaths from drug overdose have increased sharply in the past decade. This increase has been associated with overdoses of prescription opioi d pain relievers, which have more than tripled in the past 20 years. From 2012 to 2013, drug induced deaths have increased by 6%. Deaths involving heroin had the largest upsurge overall, with a 39% increase, while deaths from cocaine increased by 12%. Most drug -induced deaths are unintentional drug poisoning deaths, with suicidal drug poisoning and drug poisoning of undetermined intent comprising the majority of the remainder. Data Source: Death Certificates, California Department of Health, 2010 -2013 The mortality rate identified as drug -induced was significantly higher in Riverside County (13.3/100,000) compared to San Bernardino County (9.5/100,000) and California (11.1/100,000).

Over the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, while the annual number of n ew HIV infections has remained relatively stable. Still, the pace of new infections continues at far too high a level \u2014particularly among certain groups. The estimated incidence (new infections) of HIV has remained stable overall in recent years, at about 50,000 new HIV infections per year. Within the overall estimates, however, some groups are affected more than others. Men having sex with men continue to bear the greatest burden of HIV infection, and among races/ethnicities, African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected. If you get an STD you are more likely to get HIV than someone who is STD -free. This is because the same behaviors and circumstances that may put you at risk for getting an STD can also put you at greater risk for getting HIV. Data Source: California Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Section, 2011 -2013 The crude rate for AIDS incidence is significantly lower in San Bernardino County (6.2/100,000) and Riverside County (6.4/100,000) compa red to the State of California (8.1/100,000).

It can cause cervicitis in women and urethritis and proctitis in both men and women. Chlamydial infections in women can lead to serious consequences including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pel vic pain. Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States. In 2014, 1,441,789 cases of chlamydia were reported to CDC from 50 states and the District of Columbia, but an estimated 2.86 million infect ions occur annually. A large number of cases are not reported because most people with chlamydia are asymptomatic and do not seek testing. Chlamydia is most common among young people. Almost two -thirds of new chlamydia infections occur among youth aged 15 -24 years. It is estimated that 1 in 20 sexually active young women aged 14 -24 years has chlamydia. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities in chlamydial infection exist, with prevalence among non -Hispanic blacks 6.7 times the prevalence among non -Hispanic wh ites. Chlamydia is also common among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM screened for rectal chlamydial infection, positivity has ranged from 3.0% to 10.5%. Among MSM screened for pharyngeal chlamydial infection, has ranged from 0.5% to 2 .3%.

N. gonorrhoeae infects the mucous membran es of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes in women, and the urethra in women and men. N. gonorrhoeae can also infect the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, eyes, and rectum. Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease. CDC estimates that approximately 820,000 new gonorrheal infections occur in the United States each year, and that less than half of these infections are detected and reported to CDC. CDC estimates that 570,000 of them were among young people 15 -24 y ears of age. In 2014, 350,062 cases of gonorrhea were reported to CDC . Any sexually active person can be infected with gonorrhea. In the United States, the highest reported rates of infection are among sexually active teenagers, young adults, and African Americans.

Tuberculosis Incid ence Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but TB bacteria can attack any part of the body such as the kidney, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal . TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. People nearby may breathe in these bacteria and become infected. TB ba cteria can live in the body without making you sick. This is called latent TB infection. In most people who breathe in TB bacteria and become infected, the body is able to fight the bacteria to stop them from growing. People with latent TB infection do not feel sick and do not have any symptoms. People with latent TB infection are not infectious and cannot spread TB bacteria to others. However, if TB bacteria become active in the body and multiply, the person will go from having latent TB infection to being sick with TB disease . Once a person is infected with TB bacteria, the chance of developing TB disease is higher if the person, has HIV infection; has been recently infected with TB bacteria (in the last 2 years); has other health problems, like diabetes, that make it hard for the body to fight bacteria; abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs; or was not treated correctly for TB infection in the past.

Quality of Life Survey (QOLS) Analysis The QOL survey was used as part of the visioning and planning process for local area hospitals. The word 'community' represented the county as a whole: its cities, municipalities, unincorporated areas, neighborhoods and their residents. The survey captured opinions about the Inland Empire by highlighting characteristics that people may enjoy or see as areas of improvement for the community. The QOL survey was distributed in various forms including, email lists, paper copies, many of which were passes out at focus groups, links on social media pages and also given at health care facilities. Spanish versions were available for those whose first language was not English. Methodology The QOLS was finalized and sent out to all participating hospitals on February 7th, 2016.
