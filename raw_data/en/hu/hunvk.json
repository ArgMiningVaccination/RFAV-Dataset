He and writer Cameron Stauth contend that environmental factors and nutritional deficiencies trigger the conditions in kids who are genetically predisposed to them, and intervention can be effective in treating those youngsters, intervention involving \"detoxifying\" them and changing their diets, among other things. They've penned a book called \" [Healing the New Childhood Epidemics: Autism, ADHD, Asthma, and Allergies: The Groundbreaking Program for the 4-A Disorders](http://www.4ahealing.com),\" in which they describe Bock's approach, and the results he's been getting at a facility he heads, results some consider quite impressive. Bock is co-founder and co-director of the [Rhinebeck Health Center and the Center for Progressive Medicine](http://www.rhinebeckhealth.com/rhc/services.php), and a clinical instructor in family medicine at the [Albany Medical College](http://www.amc.edu/Academic/index.html).
