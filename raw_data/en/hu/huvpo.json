Vibrational Acupuncture is available from Singing Dragon UK. \"Together, (tuning forks and acupuncture) balance Yin and Yang, both calm and stimulate, and simultaneously ground and lift up the Qi. This permits the integration of Water/Fire polarities within the body, allowing for a flow of Shen spirit in physical form and contributing to the manifestation one's particular destiny.\" [[1]](#_ftn1) The innovative, non-invasive treatment protocols in this book feature the use of precision calibrated Acutonics\u00ae Ohm tuning forks, by themselves, or in synergy with acupuncture needling, on the points and meridians of the face and body. The vibrational effect of the sound resonance engendered by the tuning forks is enhanced by the body's skeletal structure and its watery consistency. As experienced practitioners of vibrational medicine, you will naturally be aware that the human body is comprised of, on average, about 60-65% water, and likewise that sound travels four times faster in water than air. Consequently, the vibrational Qi of tuning forks is readily transmitted to the entire body through engagement with the Water element, and its key meridian, that of the Kidney. This encourages the healing frequencies to penetrate the most profound level of essence - the Jing. This dynamic synergy of sound and acupuncture, employed in a treatment, results in a relaxing, clinically effective healing regimen that boosts the immune system, relaxes fear, and prevents disease. Tuning forks are also useful in the treatment of sensitive, needle-phobic patients, as well as those suffering from PTSD. The Nature of Sound 'Vibration has motion, therefore all life is motion ... behind the whole creation, the whole of manifestation, if there is any subtle trace of life that can be found, it is motion, it is movement, it is vibration.' - Hazrat Inayat Khan The Acutonics\u00ae Ohm tuning forks are used on the points and meridians of the body and face. - The Ohm Middle frequency is 136.1 Hz, which is approximately a C# in Western tunings, and is derived specifically from the orbital period of the Earth around the Sun. - The Ohm Low frequency, at 68.05 Hz, is one-half that of Ohm (an octave relationship), and consequently can be used to address deep-seated conditions. These tones can be regarded a distillation, in musical terms, of the Earth itself, and are, as a consequence, vibrationally grounding - calming, meditative and still. Earth is at the Center To our all-too-human eyes, Earth remains at the center of the universe ... just as it was in the traditional schema of the Five Elements, according to the Chinese, denizens of Middle Earth, and in the astrological art of the West... It is here on Earth that we dwell, and live out the finite span of our mortal existence. Thus, it is appropriate that the Acutonics\u00ae sound healing system, too, which is informed by Western astrological archetypes, is similarly Earth-centered from a tonal perspective. Archetypal Qualities of Earth - maternal instincts - origin, source - constancy, permanence - nature, the natural world - creativity - primogeniture - fecundity - abundance, ripeness - groundedness, anchor - tranquility Vibrational Healing The use of healing sound, whether embodied in tuning forks, the human voice, chanting, keening, Tibetan or crystal bowls, tinghas, bells, etc., can help to ground, open and calm negative emotional states, connecting us to a wave of good will and peace. Healing vibration connects us with the rhythms and pulses of the natural world, and fosters the development of a vibratory \"relationship\" between practitioner and patient that can be profoundly transformative: 'In a healing context, exposure of a patient to the appropriate resonance precipitates a process of energetic alignment or entrainment, during which the practitioner enters into a profound rapport with the patient. This energetic vibrational framework invokes a powerful state of compassionate engagement.' [[2]](#_ftn2) The Content of our Book The nine chapters of Vibrational Acupuncture progressively outline our philosophy and present unique treatment protocols for health care professionals, acupuncturists, and interested lay persons. We have also included considerations of self-treatment: The Introduction to our book explores: - Vibration and the nature of sound - Linkages between healing sound and sacred geometry - An overview of theories and practice of music in ancient China - The Huang Kung, the \"Yellow Bell\", a cosmic sound - The contribution of degenerate music to the fall of the final dynasty of China, the Qing (1644-1912 CE) Chapter 1: A History and Overview of Quantum Music Theory The reader is provided with useful and necessary information concerning the musical component of healing sound treatments, including Pythagorean number theory, the world of number and musical tones, the archetypal significance and healing applications of musical intervals and overtones, and the conversion of planetary movement into sound. Relevant anecdotes are included to illustrate this material. The planetary myth, archetype, and symbolism of the Acutonics\u00ae Ohm/Earth tuning forks, used in Vibrational Acupuncture treatments, will be introduced. Chapter 2: Practical Discernment: Tuning Forks and/or Needles? This chapter provides practical information required for Vibrational Acupuncture treatments: - Benefits and contraindications for acupuncture and tuning fork usage; - Discernment, knowledge, and awareness of when to integrate these two modalities; - Supplies, treatment length and timeline, etc. Chapter 3: The Eight Extraordinary Meridians and Our Genetic Imprint The Eight Extraordinary meridians embody our prenatal Qi \u2014 the Jing level of treatment. Even though much has been written in recent years on these meridians by experts within the Chinese medicine community, there are, in our experience, no protocols that take into account the integration of tuning forks with acupuncture needles on the master/couple points of these meridians. This chapter includes: - 'Fascia Talk': palpation of the fascia to determine which master/couple points to use in a given treatment; - Information on the psychospiritual aspects of these meridians, not found in customary sources. This is in addition to the physical aspects; - Specific treatment protocols utilizing sacred geometry and the lemniscate, the planetary glyph for Earth, and Sound Tube - Discern whether to use tuning forks, acupuncture needles, or to integrate both modalities. Chapter 4: The Anti-Exhaustion Treatments: Anchoring the Ying Ying, postnatal Qi, supports lifestyle choices \u2014 a person's diet, exercise regimen, thoughts and emotions, etc. Treatments for this level target the root cause of physical and psychospiritual fatigue, i.e., noise and air pollution. Source Luo points for treating anxiety, anger, sadness, depression, and other imbalances are introduced. Also included are: - Specific protocols for integrating tuning forks with acupuncture needling - the Twister, the \"V\" Vortex, and the Three Treasures treatment - are discussed. - Criteria for assessing whether to utilize needles, tuning forks, or a synergy of both modalities, are provided. Chapter 5: Harmonizing the Wei This chapter includes: - Definitions of motor and trigger points; - How and when they are used to harmonize the Wei Qi; - Treatments using trigger/motor point protocols for specific syndromes, i.e., temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ); - Palpation techniques and discernment of which modality is appropriate Chapter 6: Facial Acu-Sound Protocols The readers will be introduced to two facial acu-sound protocols. - A basic facial balancing treatment using two Acutonics\u00ae Ohm tuning forks in tandem on the face. Specialized techniques for this protocol include: - activating the tuning forks - holding - gliding - sliding - rolling - resonating with the stem of the fork - Troubleshooting: 'Turkey Wattles'. The platysma muscle, an imbalance of which is associated with the appearance of a saggy, drooping neck, is treated using motor points, either with needles, tuning forks, or a synergy of both modalities. Photos and diagrams will illustrate each step of the process. Chapter 7: Vibrational Hara Palpation and Treatment: the Five Element Japanese hara, or abdominal, treatment has been used for centuries to maintain health and well-being. Palpation techniques and discernment concerning which treatment to employ, will be discussed in depth. Additionally, the reader will be provided with an overview of the Five Elements, as they pertain to sound, receptivity, and listening. Chapter 8: Solo Sound Therapy Treatments This chapter is written with an \"ear\" to the treatment of super-sensitive, needle-phobic patients, and also for non-acupuncturists who may wish to take advantage of these non-needle protocols. All the acu-sound treatments in this book are very effective when performed with tuning forks alone. The authors recommend three specialized treatments: the Grounding Protocol, the Sacred Mudra Meditation: Lacing the Three Jiaos, and a Corpus Callosum Vibrational Treatment, for balancing the twin hemispheres of the brain. Photographs and charts are included. Chapter 9: Vibrational Topical and Internal Treatments A complete topical protocol using natural and organic products to enhance the efficacy of the treatments is included in this chapter. Readers will be introduced to the use of the following: - The QuintEssentials 5 Element Planetary Gem Elixirs - VibRadiance 5 Element Planetary Essential Oils, infused with gem essence - Creme Vitale ESP Rose, an organic Bulgarian rose moisturizing cream - Three organic essential oil hydrosols (Bulgarian rose, lavender and neroli) Chapter 10: A Personal Note from the Authors Additional guidelines and personal recommendations, drawn from the authors' personal and professional experience. While there are many books on vibrational healing available to healthcare practitioners, Vibrational Acupuncture is comparatively unique in its synergies, not only of the modalities themselves, but also its content, a creative melding of history, philosophy, music theory, social commentary, personal anecdote, plus a soup\u00e7on of astrology. There is a wealth of eminently practical applications for both acupuncturists and non-acupuncturists alike, and potentially interested laypersons who may wish to use the tuning fork protocols for self-care. The information and treatment protocols in this book are the product of many years of teaching and experimentation with a wide range of approaches; we want to encourage you in your exploration of this exciting new aspect of your practice: vibrational acupuncture.\" [[3]](#_ftn3) Interested in becoming a certified acupuncture professional?
