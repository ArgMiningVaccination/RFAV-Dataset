Recruitment will begin in the first half of the year. \"This trial is significant as we are studying microdose psilocybin at a scale never done before. Microdoses are not associated with an intense psychedelic effect, allowing them to be taken at home and offering an easy to access, yet potentially equally effective pathway for psilocybin.\" - Dr. Mark Johnston, APEX-002-A01-03 Principal Investigator and Director of Central Nervous System Research at [Centricity Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/centricityresearch?trk=public_post_reshare-text) We are so proud of our team's hard work and look forward to providing updates throughout the trial.
