An integrative medicine consultation is a time for exploration of your primary concerns and an in-depth review of your whole health history. During the consultation, you and your physician develop a customized health and wellness plan to best fulfill your health needs. Your ongoing care will be coordinated among the Osher Center's team of practitioners, and may be communicated to any other providers on your healthcare team. Common reasons patients seek an integrative medicine consult: Common Conditions Addressed in an Integrative Medicine Consult - Chronic pain and fibromyalgia [Chronic fatigue](http://encyclopedia.nmh.org/Search/85,P00618) - Stress-related conditions - Optimal aging strategies - Peri-menopause/menopause (including bioidentical hormone therapy) - Thyroid and adrenal hormone concerns - Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome - Gastrointestinal issues - Autoimmune disease - Cancer-related side effects and supportive care - Cardiovascular disease - Hypertension and high cholesterol - Recurrent infections or chronic inflammation - Sleep disturbances and insomnia - Mood disorders (anxiety and depression) | | Your First Visit During this visit, you and your physician begin to outline how you can best work together to fulfill your health needs. Our goal is to assess your health concerns, and then address all possible factors that might be contributing to any health issues, and determine the root cause of your condition. Your Integrative Medicine physician will meet with you, take a detailed personal and family history, and go over your medications, supplements, diet and lifestyle. Recommendations at this time might include further investigations (labs, functional medicine testing, genomics or imaging), and therapies that span complementary and conventional Western medicine approaches. What to Bring | | Follow-up Integrative Medicine Visits When instituting lifestyle changes, having regular follow-up visits supports success. These appointments allow for discussion of your experiences in trying new therapies or lifestyle changes, review of specialized testing results, and a deeper exploration of mind-body techniques, nutrition and personal issues. Your doctor will help determine the appropriate timing for your return visit. Follow-up visits are generally thirty minutes in length. Integrative Consultant / Primary Care Collaboration Please note: Our integrative medicine specialists do not serve as primary care doctors. As such, all patients are asked to have a primary care or similar physician to provide for their ongoing healthcare needs. Our office may assist you in locating a primary care provider either within the Osher Center for Integrative Health or at an affiliated office if you do not already have one. We are happy to provide documentation of your visits with us to your primary care provider in order to facilitate coordinated and collaborative care.
