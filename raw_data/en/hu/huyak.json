I had already prepared a few of these well in advance of getting symptoms. I am not a trained medical practitioner, herbalist or naturopath. I am self taught, I have been learning and independently researching extensively for the last three years in the natural herbal medicine rhelm. I have done extensive self experimentation, these and all the other remedies I share successfully with my immediate family and friends. My immediate family have no co-morbidities, health issues, have very good gut health from our daily glass of water kefir and still have a fully functioning natural immune system. So many people crippled and living in fear of getting this virus that isn't deadly for the vast majority of people who get it. And now I can say from experience that you have nothing to fear, when did we become so fearful of getting sick? It is part of being a human. Please start taking responsibility for your own health, it really is a necessity of life. You don't need to run to the doctor for everything, first look at what you are putting in your mouths everyday. Seriously. The doctor will patch you up and send you on your way, with prescriptions to last you a life time, like a slave to pharmaceuticals. I went out, had a big night and had fun with my friends, dancing all night long, it's what life is all about. Enjoying yourself not living in fear. Yes it looks like I paid the price, I caught it from someone, but I am glad I got it now I have natural immunity and can personally vouch for the natural remedies that helped my bodies beautiful, wonderful fighting cells beat the shit out of those nasty ones in three days flat, with a few days of lingering fatigue. I could actually feel my cells buzzing and body tingled after getting out of the magnesium baths I had for the aches and pains. Each sip of these wonder plant medicines supporting my natural immune system to fight back and heal its self with plenty of rest and the herbal protocol. What I can tell you about it from mine and my families experience is pretty much a really bad flu for us. Yes, I totally realise other people have had different experiences, and I am not trying to belittle anyone else's experiences or make light of the situation, on the contrary I am trying to give people tools to help themselves, give people hope that there are other options available to them, I am only sharing what happened to me and my family. I put a lot of hard work in to my business, which by the way has come into pretty tough times as so many other businesses throughout our beautiful country recently, and the recipes that I share freely for those who want to help themselves and their families with nature. When we are sick we stay home, rest and get well, to follow is how it played out for us... Started with sore throat late in the night and was having trouble sleeping so I took: 30ml [elderberry immune boosting tonic](https://www.theveggietree.com/recipes/tags/immune-boosting-recipes) Day 1 Low energy next day. I made a Self Heal Infusion with whole lemons sliced and steeped (recipe below). I drank this throughout the day, along with: 2ml angi angi, pine, kumarahou tincture 5 drops zinc liquid supplement 10 drops wormwood tincture Each measure of drops I had separately in glasses of fresh water. I was always sipping on my Self Heal Infusion lemon steeped water: 30ml elderberry tonic at either end of the day Started to get achy by the afternoon, neck first, lower back, then legs in the evening. Made a batch of [Golden sweetcorn soup](https://www.theveggietree.com/recipes/tags/golden-sweetcorn-soup) with extra amounts of turmeric, ginger, black pepper and bay leaves (tap the link for recipe). Had a bath with kawakawa magnesium, Himalayan pink salt and rose petals for the aches. Full on fever and sweating in the night, massive pressure in my head like when I had meningitis, full aching body neck, back, legs, tingling all over my body. Needed to be rubbed, used kawakawa steeped in almond oil. Cold flannel on my head. Day 2 Had a piece of toast with activated charcoal spread for breakfast and a small glass water kefir. Two paracetamol in morning because of the head pain and two more in the afternoon. Feeling exhausted and achy all day. Sipped throughout the day: 2ml angi angi, pine and kumarahou tincture 5 drops zinc liquid supplement 10 drops wormwood tincture 1/4 tsp NAC in water Each measure of drops I had separately in glasses of fresh water. I was always sipping on the Self Heal Infusion separately. I had a plum and vomited, I did find out that you can overdo the zinc supplement which gives you nausea. I had more soup this evening, all I felt like, could eat a whole bowl slowly. Still in bed. Sore throat from throwing up. Day 3 Another feverish night, very achy, aching soothed by rubbing with oil. Ran myself a bath in the morning with magnesium, felt really good, not too full or hot, but got out and fainted. Have someone check up on you when getting out of the bath. Made it back to bed and dozed for a few hours. Had a little bit of toast, struggled to eat it today. Made a batch of kawakawa, kumarahou, koromiko, pine and lemon wairakau. Started sipping that in the afternoon, it brought up some mucus to get rid of which was good, no cough until then but it was to bring it up and get rid of it. Feeling a little better, had more soup, a whole bowl, really good. A bit of a tickley cough while I was going to sleep but not bad. I made a batch of my [Immune Boosting Broth](https://www.theveggietree.com/recipes/tags/immune-boosting-broth) and had this over the next few days for lunch or dinner. Day 4 Feeling on the mend Day 5 Still tired but up and doing things but having sit downs and lie downs in between, little bit foggy headed, its super humid Day 6 Starting to get back into soft yoga and tasks. Sometimes have waves of nausea, got to take it easy. Can feel my heart beating and a little shaky. Still taking the protocols in water and drinking the rongoa. Have a bit of a chesty feeling that has come after a couple of days with the occasional mucus cough which I get rid of. Still finishing the wairakau which soothes and helps bring it up. In hindsight I would have made the wairakau earlier if I had felt up to it. The kids got it and had much more milder symptoms. Athena: Had a fever, and slept for a day, achy. Had 2 magnesium baths and the protocol. Wyn: Felt floppy and tired for one day. Gareth: Had a bad headache, body aches and a fever for about 36 hours. Covid Wairakau Recipe ~New Recipe~ To preface this recipe according to traditional rongoa practise please say a karakia before collecting gifts from papatuanuku, an acknowledgement, give thanks and gather with good intentions and don't be greedy. This is natural wild foraging law also. Kawakawa supports your cytokines, which are chemical messengers which send signals between cells. There are many different cytokines and they all have different complex functions from recruiting cells, proliferating cells, causing cells to activate and differentiate. It is super complex but basically the immune response is a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Kawakawa is a great rongoa/plant medicine for young children and the elderly because it is such a gentle remedy, especially when supporting improved lung health and bronchial system function. It is a natural expectorant so helps to remove excess mucus from the respiratory system. Pine is high in vitamin C and A, a boiled tea from the needles helps with respiratory symptoms such as sore throats and coughs. Pine needle tea works well, as the heat also helps the body get rid of phlegm. Koromiko supports respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and coughs. Kanuka is antiviral and the lemons contain quercetin, pectin and Vitamin C. Gathering your ingredients and measure them into a pot: 4 L water 4-5 kawakawa leaves 4-5 kumarahou leaves A full handful of pine tips or needles 4 tips of koromiko, top 4 leaves, it's flowering white flowers at the moment, I added them (optional) 4-5 kanuka tips, a hand width size or 2 Tablespoons of leaves (optional) 4-5 plantain leaves (optional) 1-2 lemons, sliced Lid on and simmer gently for 1 hour. Leave the lid on while it cools. You can drink warm or cold. It brings up the phlegm, which you'll want to get rid of. Dosage - 1 cup, sip throughout the day Natural Cough and Respiratory Support Tonic ~New Recipe~ To preface this recipe according to traditional rongoa practise please say a karakia before collecting gifts from papatuanuku, an acknowledgement, give thanks and gather with good intentions and don't be greedy. This is natural wild foraging law also. In springtime the pine trees produce their new growth shoots and this is when they have the highest concentrations of vitamin C and A so is the best time to pick them to make this syrup, pinus radiata is the most common pine tree in New Zealand and this is perfect for collecting needles or tips, just ensure you go past the road line as they will be sprayed. Kumarahou is a natural expectorant, so helps to remove excess mucus from the respiratory system and supports bronchial system function. It detoxes the lungs, kidneys and lymphatic system. Angi angi/usnea, the lungs of the forest, is a great immune support and a valuable addition to herbal formulas for respiratory symptoms as it supports the lungs, shifts phelm and helps remove toxicity from the body. It is a powerful antibiotic and antiviral. A fantastic anti-bacterial medicine which tones the system and shuts off bad bacteria from reproducing. When harvesting angi angi/usnea it is best practise to gather from fallen branches as it takes many years to grow. If it is in a damp environment it should have an elastic quality to it. It only grows where the air is very clean so head off into the bush if you are living in a city environment. (Please refer to picture below for identification, we are blessed around Kaeo to have an abundant beautiful supply). Kanuka has been drank as a tea for coughs and colds in NZ forever and there's good reason. It has been found to contain antiviral, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-parasitic/insecticidal, anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. This tincture syrup will also help inflammation as well as asthma, pine allergies and corona virus symptoms. Other expectorants you could use are licorice, mullein, fenugreek or marshmellow if you can't find the kumarahou or if you are in other countries. You could also substitute rosemary, oregano or thyme for their anti-viral qualities if needed. Other plants you could add to your brew would be olive leaf (immune boosting and repels spike proteins), rosehips (high in Vitamin C), cinnamon (fights various types of infections). Makes a 500ml jar Gather your ingredients, locally for best results, and three quarter fill the jar with equal parts of each: pine shoots, dried kumarahou leaves and angi angi/usnea. Then measure the following into the jar to fill to the top: 1 to 1 \u00bd c vodka or stronger white spirit \u00bd c honey (local if possible) Secure with a lid and shake vigorously. Leave to infuse for at least a month, up to 6 months, shaking regularly. Strain. Dosage - 2ml in a glass of water at a time as needed. You can also buy angi angi/usnea tincture, there's a few NZ stockists online, you really want to be able to use it immediately for the immune boosting, anti viral and lung support, but you could also make some for the future. Only use when acutely sick, listen to your body, as soon as I feel a little itchy in my throat, blocked or runny sinus's or feeling like I'm coming down with something I'll take a couple of doses. Wormwood Tincture or Tea Wormwood, Artimeisia Annua, has been studied in multiple settings around the world and has been found to have good antiviral activity to inhibit the replication of the coronavirus inside our cells. It has been used for hundreds of years in natural plant form as well as in synthesised into malaria medication. Wormwood is not meant for long term use, like many other plant medicines, they are best used when you are acutely sick. To extract the medicine from the plant you need to make a tincture which draws the medicinal qualities out, or you can also make into a tea. If the wormwood plant isn't available for you, there are many suppliers online. FOR THE TINCTURE Gather wormwood leaves and flowers. Loosely pack into a sterilised jar. Pour over vodka or a higher alcohol content white spirit and leave to infuse for 1-6 months. Strain out the leaf matter and bottle up into a dropper bottle if you have it. Dosage10-20 drops in a glass of water. FOR THE TEA Measure 1 tsp of dried or fresh leaves into a 250ml boiling water. Leave to steep for 15 minutes, it is bitter so you can add peppermint or the like to the brew if you prefer. Self Heal Infusion Self heal, Prunella Vulgaris, is a super common plant in wild lawns with lavender like flowers close to the ground which smells of nothing much and is actually from the mint family. An amazing heal all herb for a wide array of ailments but today we will be focusing on its antiviral and antibacterial qualities for treating sore throats and aiding respiratory infections. It also supports the heart and liver as well as helping to bring down a fever. The additions of whole lemon and apple slices are to add quercetin, pectin and vitamin C (see below for benefits). Makes1L Gather your ingredients and pop them into a jug: 8-10 self heal flowers and tips of leaves 1 whole lemon, sliced and squeezed 1 whole apple, sliced 1 L water Leave too steep overnight. Sip throughout the day. Picture of angi angi/usnea Early treatment and practising a healthy lifestyle is essential Why? Because our bodies natural immune system kicks in immediately, as soon as our cells sense an invader they set to work. Getting exercise everyday so that your blood easily pumps around your body is essential to good health, as is eating a nutrient dense diet. You need antioxidants to protect you from oxidative stress which comes from spike proteins, bacteria, poisons and toxins. And actually you should be ensuring what you are putting in your mouth everyday has the nutrients your body needs to function well. If you look at each thing you put in your mouth as what your body needs to function there really isn't that much room for much else. Treat your body as a temple, you deserve it. To follow are the most important vitamins and minerals you need to be on top of to protect your body generally from any viral infections. It is so very important to ensure you feed your body these vitamins and minerals every day. If you are eating the right foods everyday then your body isn't already depleted, which in turn means it will naturally respond to 'invaders' in already peak condition. However if you are deficient in these nutrients you will need to take much higher does which I will also add, but I do believe in eating for your health not waiting until it fails, waiting at the bottom of the cliff as it were.

Selenium - Helps makes white blood cells, T cells (thymus cells made in bone marrow) which are part of the immune system that helps protect the body from infection. Glutathione - Helps reduce oxidative stress. Our body naturally makes this in the liver. Amino acids cysteine, glutamate and glycine are natural precursors from food. NAC is a precursor for glutathione, it gets converted to cysteine in the liver. Gut Health - Good gut health is essential for general health and is also extremely important when it come to fighting off corona virus's. Your microbiome is key to a healthy immune system. To follow are plant foods foods that you can get these essential nutrients from in order from the first in line has the highest amounts: Zinc - Hemp seeds, elderberry, tofu, cashews, sesame seeds capsicum, elderberry, black currants, papaya, kiwifruit, orange and lemon.

If you find yourself in a pinch and haven't treated your body as the temple it is here is the recommended daily supplement protocol from Dr Brian Ardis: Zinc - 50-100mg Vitamin C - 5,000mg Selenium - 200mg Apple pectin - 700mg There it is guys. Take it or leave it, I hope this helps some of you feel empowered and supports your family to bounce back from this like we did. If you are keen to have a try at making your own [Water Kefir](https://www.theveggietree.com/shop) tap the link. As I said previously in the post having a healthy gut is essential to a healthy body, 70% of the immune system is located in the gut. Water kefir has 2.5 billion good microorganisims in one glass, you need to be adding the good guys to fight off the bad guys. Yes it takes some effort but as I also said before you are worth the effort. Anna x "}
