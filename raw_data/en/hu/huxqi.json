It's quickly become my go-to daily moisturizer and lip balm. When I'm at work and my hands, eyes or lips feel dry, I apply this. My knuckles in particular tend to get really dry, to the point of scaly (bleeechhh) After rubbing a good amount into my knuckles (about a nickel size on each) lo and behold they were soft. The balm doesn't take too long to absorb either and it doesn't leave a residue of any kind. I only need to do this maybe once or twice a week for my hands. For my eyes, I put a teeny amount on my finger and rubbed it around my orbital bone. It did great there too. The skin under my eyes tends to get dry, so I'm constantly trying to moisturize them. A tiny amount worked well to put some softness back into the creases and under my eyes. It's fantastic as a lip balm as well. Even though I drink a bunch of water while I'm at work, my lips still get chapped sometimes. This stuff is a savior. I only need to put on a bit and my lips are hydrated. Overall: I really love this balm. My one complaint is that between using it on my hands, eyes and lips throughout the week, I'll probably be through the balm after a month or so. I wish it came in a bigger size! I didn't get a chance to test it on any cuts, burns or bug bites (maybe that's a good thing?) but it does a great job at keeping my lips, eyes and hands hydrated. The other thing is that it ships from Singapore if you buy it directly from their [site](https://thegentlelabel.com/) or the UK if you buy it from [contentbeautywellbeing.com](https://www.contentbeautywellbeing.com/), so it takes about a week or two to make it to the USA. If you don't mind the wait, it really is a wonderful balm. [Organic Healing Balm](https://thegentlelabel.com/products/organic-healing-balm) 25 ml $15.92 USD + $8.00 for "}
