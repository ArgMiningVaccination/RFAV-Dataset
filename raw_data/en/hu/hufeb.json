Shingrix for the prevention of herpes zoster. [Herpes zoster](/health-guide/shingles-herpes-zoster.html) is caused by the same virus (varicella) that causes [chickenpox](/health-guide/chickenpox-varicella.html) in children. When this virus becomes active again, it can cause herpes zoster, or [shingles](/cg/shingles.html). Shingrix helps prevent shingles. Shingrix works by exposing you to a small dose of inactive virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body. Shingrix is used to prevent herpes zoster virus (shingles): - in people age 50 and older, including people who previously received a live zoster vaccine ( [Zostavax](/zostavax.html)); and - in people 18 years and older at increased risk of herpes zoster virus (shingles) due due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy.
