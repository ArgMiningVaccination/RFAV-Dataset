Its disruptive effects have continued through 2021. In Western Australia we have been protected from extensive infection by a restrictive border policy. That policy, however, has limited both interstate and international travel affecting students, prospective students and staff. The University has had to adapt to this changed and changing environment. Against that challenging background, the University in 2021 continued to carry out its core missions of teaching and research. It continued its program of structural reform to ensure that those missions could be carried on sustainably. Changes also in the academic and professional workforce, carried out against a larger background of pandemic-related uncertainty and adaptation, imposed pressures and stresses on staff. I acknowledge that fact and thank the staff of the University at all levels for their work above and beyond the call of duty. The past year created some significant and promising trends in the higher education marketplace. Demographic changes in Western Australia and an increase in recent school leavers remaining or returning to the State led to an increase in domestic student commencements, largely undergraduate, of 23 per cent over commencements in 2020. They were supported by the launch of new courses and processes to support early admission by Year 12 students. The University now has 66 approved micro-credential courses and 2021 saw a significant uptake of those courses. We endeavoured to enhance the student experience and opportunities for employment following graduation. Elective workplace-integrated learning enrolments increased by 22 per cent. The Careers and Employability Centre expanded virtual work experience and internships. The UniMentor program had 890 participants who volunteered more than 11,400 hours to support new students. The McCusker Centre for Citizenship placed 560 interns and 300 industry partners, providing more than 1,700 internships.The University continued to pursue the strategic goal of Indigenous higher education. In 2021, 286 Indigenous students enrolled at the University. The School of Indigenous Studies conducted Outreach Programs for Year 12s in regional centres and Perth, Year 8 Discovery Days and the Year 9 Djinanginy program. At a global level, the University signed a Strategic Agreement with INTO University Partnerships, establishing UWA College as a new pathway institution for international students. We retained our Learning Centres in China, providing students with a physical learning experience while maintaining our international enrolments. The year saw an array of research collaboration with industry and other research and community organisations. New endowed chairs were created in cardiovascular disease, optometry translational research, marine research and leadership and management. The Institute of Data was launched to provide data-intensive industries and government agencies access to expertise in applied data science. The UWA Defence and Security Institute was also launched to boost research on policy and advocacy, science technology and human performance. A SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre grant facilitated the launch of the International Space Centre to advance innovation in areas ranging from astronaut health to optical communication between earth and space. The University released its 2020 UWA Crawley Campus Masterplan which demonstrated the need for substantial enhancements of the Crawley/QEII Medical Centre precincts. An investigation on future use of the Nedlands campus and Park Avenue site commenced. The University also initiated a Capital Investment Plan for 2021-23 including provision for the transformation of dated facilities in Reid Library. Investment in digital infrastructure and the ongoing imperative to ensure cybersecurity is a high priority for the University and has continued throughout 2021. Its importance to staff, both teaching and research, and to students cannot be overstated.2 The University of Western Australia | our universityThe Hon. Robert French AC CitWA Chancellor Alumni of the University play an important role in its activities and development. The Office of Development and Alumni Relations (DAR) and Convocation raised more than $30 million in gifts and sponsorships. Convocation, which has a governance role in relation to University statutes and representation on the Senate, has increased collaboration between the Convocation Council and DAR through a new Joint Working Group chaired by Warren Kerr, a member of the Senate elected by Convocation. The UWA Emeriti Professors College was established to celebrate Emeritus and Emerita Professors of the University, maintain connections and provide a vehicle for ongoing contributions to the work of the University. In 2020 UWA commissioned Professor Geoff Kiel to review the governance of the University as required by the Higher Education Standards Framework in the renewal of the University's accreditation by the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Authority as a Higher Education Provider. The report prepared by Professor Kiel made 44 recommendations, the great majority of which have been accepted and are being implemented. A Working Group on Effective Governance, chaired by Senate member, Robert Olivier, reported during the year resulting in changes in the way Senate arranges its agenda and in which information is presented to it. The Senate and its committees all shouldered substantial workloads through the year. The University owes much to the voluntary work and expertise of their members for proper governance and the fulfilment of its mission. In 2021 the Senate welcomed new members: Linda Kenyon was appointed by the Governor, Julie O'Neill was co-opted and Adjunct Professor Brett Davies was elected by Convocation. Sue Gordon AM retired from Senate, Convocation-elected member, Simon Dawkins completed his term as did student-elected members, Emma Mezger, the Guild President for 2021 and Joseph Chan, President of the Postgraduate Students' Association. The Senate welcomed in their place the 2022 Student Guild President, Amitabh Jeganathan and the President of the Postgraduate Students' Association, Max Beard. On behalf of the University, I express my thanks to all members, new and continuing, and departed. I would also like to express my appreciation to the Vice- Chancellor and senior leadership of the University for their tireless work. 2021 was the last year in office of the Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Simon Biggs, who commenced as Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University in February 2022. I wish him well in his new role. While much of the focus of the Senate and senior leadership in 2021 involved operational issues, 2022 promises an increasing consideration of larger strategic goals to respond to the questions \u2014 What kind of university are we? \u2014 What do we aspire to be? \u2014 How do we advance that aspiration? The Hon. Robert French AC CitWA Chancellor3 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au3We are helping exploration and mining companies to work more efficiently and to reduce their environmental impact. Our work with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization is helping the world to identify neglected crop species that will help overcome global hunger and malnutrition. We are inventing processes that will aid in the regeneration of bone and tissue and making discoveries about the genetic causes of diseases such as diabetes. This vital work is being done as we strengthen our commitment to excellence, integrity and diversity in all its forms. We welcome students, teachers and researchers from all over the globe; encouraging them to join us in the great endeavour of creating knowledge, finding solutions and asking new questions. At The University of Western Australia, we respect the diversity of different life experiences and different points of view. We learn from each other and with each other. We seek wisdom. Professor Amit Chakma Vice-ChancellorThe University of Western Australia, like universities across the world, has been faced with the necessity of proving our adaptability and flexibility under acute pressures. We have moved decisively; developing and adjusting strategies in a rapidly changing environment. In this process, we have been guided by the fundamental need to serve our students and the community and by the crucial importance of ensuring that our University stands upon firm foundations. Those foundations must be strong enough to withstand all manner of future shocks. UWA stands proudly in the world's top 100 universities, ranked in the top one per cent in more than 40 subject areas. This is an outstanding testimony to the work our researchers and teachers have done and will continue to do. Our institutes gather scholars together to share their understanding, seek wisdom, and inspire each other in the creation of new knowledge. UWA is ranked in the world's top 20 for agricultural sciences, with our Institute of Agriculture providing a model of practical collaboration with industry. Our Oceans Institute has members from 45 nations; our UWA Public Policy Institute acts as a bridge between academic research and the immediate policy needs of government, business and the wider community - bridging the sciences and the humanities. In January we launched our International Space Centre, bringing together more than 150 researchers and offering new opportunities for knowledge creation in human space exploration and technologies. The centre collaborates with industry, government and space research organisations across our planet. Our new Defence and Security Institute, launched in March, is already playing a vital role in adding a Western Australian and Indian Ocean perspective to the defining and understanding of Australia's security interests. The UWA Institute of Data we launched in October brings together representatives from 12 different disciplines and offers industry training courses.Vice-Chancellor's report Professor Amit Chakma Vice-Chancellor4 The University of Western Australia | our university5 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au5ABOUT UWA Established in 1911 as the State's first university, The University of Western Australia (UWA) was also the first free university in the British Empire , actively promoting equal access to tertiary education for all social classes.

Chancellor's Committee coordinates planning for the programs of the Senate and its key committees. It advises Senate on matters related to the Vice-Chancellor and advises the Vice-Chancellor on matters related to the University Executives, and reviews the induction and professional development programs of Senate members. Honorary Degrees Committee makes recommendations to the Senate on the awarding of honorary degrees and Chancellor's medals. Senate Nominations Committee provides advice and recommendations on appointments and co-options to the Senate, its Standing Committees, and committees on which Senate has representation. Strategic Resources Committee monitors, makes recommendations and reports to the Senate on the financial welfare of the University (including University investments, campus planning initiatives and major infrastructure developments), and monitors policy of staffing resources. Academic Board is the University's peak academic body. Established by the Senate under the UWA Statute , the Board is chaired by a member of the academic community.12 The University of Western Australia | our universityConvocation of UWA Graduates All graduates of the University are life-long members of the Convocation of UWA Graduates. The UWA Act and UWA Statute assign the roles of representative, governance, contribution, engagement and promotion to Convocation. In a governance capacity, elected members of Convocation are represented on the University Senate. UWA Student Guild The UWA Student Guild was founded by students, for students, in 1913. It is the peak student representative body, elected by the student body. The University Guild Council leads the Guild and provides student representation on the University Senate and a number of University boards and committees.

The emergence of COVID-19 and the subsequent closure of Australia's borders significantly impacted Australian universities; affecting student mobility, enrolments and course delivery in 2021. Global market International student enrolments at Australian universities declined in 2021, as students retained a preference for face-to-face learning while border restrictions remained in place. With Australia's reputation for high-quality education and proximity to Asia, it remains an attractive education destination, however, once borders open, it may take some time to recover to pre-pandemic enrolment levels as some students may find alternative destinations more appealing1. UWA holds a small share of the Australian international student market, with plenty of capacity to significantly increase student enrolments. Western Australia is in the same time zone as much of Asia and alongside other benefits its regional designation for visa purposes enhances its attractiveness. The University is working with government agencies to reconnect with international student markets; raise awareness and appeal of Perth, and positively promote UWA as a study destination. Domestic market In recent years, domestic enrolment growth has been challenging with a stagnant population of 15-to-30-year- olds in WA, and a declining proportion attaining an ATAR; impacting progress to university via traditional entry pathways. In 2021 there was organic population growth, plus a boost from recent school leavers remaining or returning to WA, increasing commencements. Positively, moderate growth is forecast in the school- aged population and 18-to-25-year-olds, nationally and in WA, through to 2025, which should see an increase in domestic undergraduate commencements1. Low unemployment rates may taper this, and challenge domestic postgraduate student enrolments in the coming period1. 1 Source: IBIWWorld, University and Other Higher Education in Australia, November 2021It is anticipated that an increasing number of students will take courses online in the next few years, with universities expanding their online capabilities to improve flexibility and penetrate different markets. In response, UWA is expanding its range of courses, broadening accessibility, and enhancing its online and blended learning delivery. In doing so UWA is building an improved offering for regional and international students, while also working to raise UWA's profile internationally. GOVERNMENT AND POLICY Once again, the COVID-19 pandemic dominated public policy decision-making at both the State and Federal levels, with key impacts to the University being ongoing uncertainty about the return of international students subject to travel and border controls. This year saw continued scrutiny of how universities engage with their global partners. The Australia's Foreign Relations (State and Territory Arrangements) Act 2020 was passed by the Senate in December 2020 and requires universities to register with the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade their 'written arrangements' with overseas universities. Under the Act, the Minister for Foreign Affairs can unilaterally terminate any such arrangement entered into by a university. This policy has raised important discussions regarding what kind of information it is reasonable to expect university staff to disclose with regard to overseas political, military and security affiliations. The University has put appropriate measures in place to ensure that we are compliant with the Act and have registered around 150 arrangements. UWA made a submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Inquiry into national security risks affecting the Australian higher education and research sector. The final report is yet to be released. Noting the Government's ongoing interest in the role of international partnerships in the higher education sector, UWA acknowledges the value of our strong international ties to the university community and economy, particularly in the context of UWA's location. The March 2021 State Election saw a historic result for the WA Labor Party. The Hon. Sue Ellery MLC continues as the Minister for Education. The challenges of the pandemic highlighted the importance of cooperation and partnership between all the universities in our Significant issues and trends19 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au19 State and the Minister has facilitated regular meetings and information sessions for the West Australian Vice Chancellors which have greatly assisted us in collaborative leadership and decision making. In 2021 we welcomed many distinguished former and current politicians to our campus. In an exciting start to the year the International Space Centre was launched by former Federal Defence Minister Linda Reynolds and then-WA Minister for Science David Kelly, and we unveiled the UWA Defence and Security Institute (DSI) in March. The DSI is chaired by Professor Stephen Smith, who also serves on the Advisory Board with WA Governor The Hon. Kim Beazley AC. In June we were delighted to host the Prime Minister the Hon. Scott Morrison MP for a keynote speech on foreign policy. The 2021 Universities Australia Conference was an important opportunity for engagement between our sector and the Government. In his address, Minister Tudge called on universities to adopt the model code on free speech developed by UWA Chancellor the Hon. Robert French AC which was adopted by UWA in December 2020. Research commercialisation has been high on the Government's agenda and funding was provided in the 2020-21 Budget to develop a University Research Commercialisation Scheme. In November the Trailblazer Universities Program was announced as the first initiative of the Government's research commercialisation agenda. The Federal Government's International Education Strategy was also released in December and encourages the sector to diversify student cohorts and source countries. FOREIGN INTERFERENCE The University is subject to legislation and government guidelines designed to manage risks associated with actual and potential foreign interference threats, including to our research, teaching, engagement and operational activities. These are issues which the University takes very seriously, and following an internal review and consultation, the Executive has established a Foreign Interference Advisory Committee (FIAC). This committee includes all Deputy Vice-Chancellors, the Chief Digital Officer, and the Director Governance and General Counsel. FIAC takes responsibility for and coordinates the University's ongoing actions to manage and mitigate foreign interference risks. In dealing with these risks the University is taking a whole of institution risk-based approach, seeking to ensure that risks are managed in a way that does not unnecessarily interfere with the University's normal operations, but which takes seriously and deals appropriately with genuine risks to the national interest, the University and our staff and students. These matters, and the associated legislation and guidelines are complex, and intersect with other issues such as academic freedom, freedom of expression, conflicts of interest and the protection of sensitive personal information. In-person training of the most at-risk research teams has already taken place, and a continuing program of education and training has been implemented. A foreign interference policy will go to Senate for approval in early 2022, and a new online declaration system will be implemented to allow the University to collect information required by the legislation and government guidelines. INFORMATION SECURITY Consistent with global trends, Australian education networks continue to be high-value targets for malicious cyber activity from cyber adversaries seeking financial profit or to compromise or gain access to confidential information. The globally engaged nature of our organisation and the sector are an intrinsic part of our business model and our competitiveness in the market. This combination of an expanded attack surface and high-value digital assets presents an attractive target for threat actors seeking ways to access information. The threat surface of our University has further expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic as students and staff adapt to online remote learning and working. As a result, malicious actors are increasingly targeting user accounts and University networks, seeking to exploit the use of home networks and crafting COVID-19 themed phishing attacks. The changing geopolitical environment has resulted in increasingly sophisticated hostile cyber espionage activity. The Federal Government now recognises higher education and research as critical infrastructure of national significance and has called for increased accountability for information security, additional security obligations and enhanced risk management. Information security remains one of the highest priorities. Continuing from previous years, UWA is advancing its cyber strategy with a focus on delivering risk-based and measured security controls and addressing risks beyond appetite. As cyber-attacks against the higher education sector have increased in frequency, size, and scope, so too has the investment of time and resources in the University's cybersecurity controls.20 The University of Western Australia | report on strategic priorities Education PRIORITIES Ceaselessly drive innovation in our curriculum to create unique and globally relevant educational experiences. Exploit the potential of disruptive digital technology to positively transform the student experience. Broaden the variety of courses we offer and the diversity of students we attract. Aligned with the University's 2030 vision, the UWA Student Experience Strategic Plan 2020-25 sets targets to deliver the best student experience of the Group of Eight (Go8) universities, both locally and nationally. The 2021 Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching Student Experience Survey ranked UWA first among the Go8 for both Le arner Engagement and Learning Resources and Overall Satisfaction (postgraduate coursework level), and second in Go8 for Student Support. Quacquarelli Symonds ranked UWA first in WA for Employability, another key focus area. Enrolments in elective Workplace Integrated Learning units increased 22 per cent this year. The Careers and Employability Centre expanded virtual work experience and internships, allowing onshore and offshore students to work together on industry-led challenges. The UniMentor program, in its 21st year, had 897 participants who volunteered more than 11,400 hours to support new students. The McCusker Centre for Citizenship placed 562 interns (39 regional) in community organisations, local government and the public sector. Three hundred industry partners provided more than 1,700 internships with 98 per cent of students likely to recommend the program. The centre also launched the interdisciplinary Active Citizenship minor, which provides practical engagement with industry partners. Wellbeing initiatives continued with focus groups contributing to the development of the Mental Health and Wellbeing Framework . We launched the UWA After Hours Wellbeing Line and our peer support service, The Living Room, organised activities including yoga, mindfulness sessions and informal pet therapy.UWA's Open Day saw online registrations up 81 per cent from 2020, and 36 per cent on 2019. Registration numbers indicated: 91 per cent of registrants were interested in undergraduate study (55 per cent were Year 12 students). 94 per cent of post-event respondents said the experience met or exceeded their expectations. There was a 23 per cent growth in domestic student commencements from 2020. This was focused largely on the undergraduate cohort and underpinned by the launch of new courses and a change to the admission process (allowing Year 12 students' whose studies were interrupted by COVID-19, to apply earlier using ATAR predictions based on their Year 11 results). Postgraduate growth was also significant, possibly as a result of the uncertain labour market disrupted by the pandemic. Introduced in 2020, UWA Plus has 66 micro-credentials approved for delivery, 17 draft proposals and several proposals currently in development. In 2021, there were 599 micro-credential enrolments with 93 participants studying more than one micro-credential. The micro- credential initiative has attracted students who are not traditional learners for UWA and who have used the opportunity to up-skill for greater employability. They are a key element of the Lifelong Learning strategy.21 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au21 December Graduations UWA is also the host of the WA Secretariat for the United Nations Regional Centre of Expertise (UN RCEWA) which officially launched in September. The UN RCEWA has a broad objective to build awareness, measure our impact on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and provide education for sustainable development. The University is developing a sustainability strategy which encompasses all areas of the University working to address the 17 SDGs. This strategy will set out KPIs in line with our commitment to sustainability and is planned for delivery by mid-2023. An important element will be to update the Environmental Sustainability Strategy 2020-2 5 to align with the University's carbon neutral targets. These targets include a short-term energy neutral commitment for emissions from the University's operations by 2025, and a long-term commitment, which includes emissions from our value chain by 2040. With the development of the strategy, the entire University community will be empowered to contribute to our targets and initiatives.UWA Sports athletes excelled this year. A contingent of 16 students, alumni and club members competed at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. At the Western Indigenous Games, UWA's Western Waagyls won all sports in the competition and took home the Wirrin Waabiny (Spirit of the Games) award. Children's University Australasia won The Australian Charity Awards 2021 for Outstanding Achievement . The Children's University WA Partnership between UWA and Edith Cowan University has 60 Learning Destination Partners providing 100 sites across WA. In 2021, the program's first full year, 204 students graduated from 13 UWA partner schools. This year saw 14 prestigious outbound scholarships awarded to UWA students; one Rhodes, three Fulbright, two Westpac Future Leaders, one Sir John Monash and seven Westpac Asian Exchange scholarships. The University engages in many sustainability initiatives across teaching, research, engagement and operations. This year, we established our Grand Challenges Champions network bringing together expert staff, students and alumni to drive ongoing social transformation. 22 The University of Western Australia | report on strategic priorities Research and Innovation PRIORITIES Focus our research on resolving the world's Grand Challenges to improve lives and our environment. Engage in research that is digitally driven and data-intensive. Be the world leader in open, accessible and trusted research. The University's reputation for innovative and impactful research attracts collaborators from other research organisations, industry and the wider community. Our research partnerships are many and diverse, such as endowed chairs, industry chairs, joint centres, collaborative projects, national research infrastructure networks and medical research institutes. Research centres bring together teams to deliver knowledge and solutions for problems faced by society. In 2021, the Cooperative Research Centre for Transformations in Mining Economies completed its first year of research on transitioning of mine sites for future use. The International Space Centre was also launched this year. The centre will focus on innovation areas ranging from optical communications to astronaut health, and has been awarded a SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre grant to advance optical communication between Earth and space. Two National Health and Medical Research Council (NMHRC) Centres of Research Excellence received funding this year: 'Good Spirit Good Life' will elucidate better health and wellbeing for older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; the National Centre for Asbestos Related Diseases will continue to improve outcomes for people with mesothelioma. Research institutes enable critical mass for multidisciplinary research. The UWA Oceans Institute and Institute of Agriculture have delivered research success over many years. The Institute of Data, launched in 2021, provides a gateway for data intensive industries and government agencies to access expertise in applied data science. Additionally, we saw the launch of UWA Defence and Security Institute, to boost research on policy and advocacy, science and technology and human performance. The research projects, centres and institutes included Higher Degree by Research students who contributed discoveries as well as receiving a world-class research training experience. 23 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au23 UWA invested in cutting-edge research infrastructure (supported by the Federal Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the WA State Government's Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation) which included the delivery of the Microscopy Australia Cryo-Electron Microscopy suite. Endowed chairs provide academic leadership positions in perpetuity. This year the University named four new chairs: the Wesfarmers-Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute Chair in Cardiovascular Disease, the Lions-UWA Chair in Optometry Research, the Jock Clough Marine Foundation Chair and the Woodside Chair in Leadership and Management. In addition to our volume of quality research publications and other impressive research outputs, we also engaged the community in various public lectures and events. Raising the Bar in 2021 saw several Perth CBD bars transform into learning spaces with eleven world-leading researchers discussing their work, and how it benefits society and the environment. Professor Liva Hool is the inaugural Wesfarmers-VCCRI-UWA Chair in Cardiovascular DiseaseThe University was successful in competitive grants to undertake many innovative research projects in 2021, including: $10.7 million from the NHMRC Ideas Grant scheme to support various projects, such as a study of adaptive diagnostics for emerging pandemic threats in regional Australia. $3 million from the Medical Research Futures Fund to investigate the genetic causes of neurological disorders. $8 million for two Australian Research Council Industrial Transformation Training Centres, one of which is focused on ways to encourage adoption of innovative technologies. $4.8 million from the WA State Government and the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre to demonstrate the Albany region's wave energy potential to power local industry.24 The University of Western Australia | report on strategic priorities PRIORITIES Be the pre-eminent academic leader in the Indian Ocean Rim. Build deeper and broader partnerships with industry, governments and not-for-profits to inform and translate our research. Engage openly and ensure our research benefits the widest possible range of communities.Global Global engagement Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the University extended its global reach by joining the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). The ACU has more than 500 member universities in 50 countries, and covers more than 10 million students and more than one million academic and professional staff. This membership enables UWA researchers, staff and students to collaborate with peers to tackle global challenges and build stronger universities. Additionally, UWA and The University of Arizona formalised a partnership which aims to offer two new joint degree programs: Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine. This year, the University signed a strategic agreement with INTO University Partnerships, (INTO Perth subsidiary) establishing UWA College, a new pathway institution that will welcome international students from June 2022. The partnership was officially launched by the Vice-Chancellor in November. With continued border closures throughout 2021, the University retained the UWA Learning Centres in China. The centres mitigated online learning fatigue by providing students with a physical learning experience, while maintaining our international enrolments. The number of offshore China cohort students who attended a centre in 2021: Semester 1: 347 (31.7 per cent) Semester 2: 525 (44.6 per cent) The centres will continue operating in 2022.PartnershipsMinimum ATAR 92 or equivalent STAT Not Applicable Intake months February and July Completion 4 years full time Arts and culture This year the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery welcomed more than 45,000 visitors over the course of two exhibition seasons. The 2021 Perth Festival celebrated Western Australia and its people. The program's artists were mostly local, and performed to a (mostly) local audience - connecting us to place and each other. The COVID-19 lockdown in the opening week meant the entire program had to be rescheduled - a massive undertaking only possible due to the extraordinary help of audiences, artists, companies and crew, as well as our generous government partners, corporate sponsors and donors. Development and Alumni Relations In 2021, our alumni and community supporters enjoyed in-person and virtual events including alumni career mentoring, which ran locally and throughout our global networks. The UWA Emeriti Professors College, which celebrates and connects our Emeriti Professors, was launched in partnership with the Academic Board. The University is grateful for the support of its volunteers who contributed to student experience and helped enrich campus life. The Convocation of UWA Graduates continued to represent and engage with our alumni through the autumn and spring meetings, which were held online with participants from around Australia and the world. 25 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au25 Minimum ATAR 92 or equivalent STAT Not Applicable Intake months February and July Completion 4 years full time Indigenous strategy The Indigenous strategy aligns the vision, strategic objectives and performance of Indigenous education at UWA with the University's strategic directions and the national Indigenous higher education agenda. This year, 286 Indigenous students enrolled at UWA. As part of the University's Outreach Program, the School of Indigenous Studies organised a Year 12 Leadership Seminar held in May. Thirty-three Indigenous students from schools in Albany, Hedland and Perth attended the seminar. In November, 250 Indigenous students attended three Year 8 Discovery Days, and the Year 9 Djinanginy program. Both were held on campus.Professor Pat Dudgeon, Australia's first Aboriginal psychologist, was elected as a new Fellow to the Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences. The Berndt Museum welcomed a total of 64 community, research and student access requests, with approximately 150 visitors through the museum who attended the culturally significant exhibition, Creatures: Ochred, Pokered, Carved and Twined, held in the Lawrence Wilson Art Gallery on campus. 26 The University of Western Australia | report on strategic priorities Sustainable Environments PRIORITIES Establish modern and fully integrated physical and digital environments that foster world-leading education and research and reflect Indigenous place and our shared history. Embed sustainability and fair-trade principles into the developmental and operational activities of the campus. Create new opportunities for collaboration, co-location and connectivity. Establish modern and fully integrated physical and digital environments that foster world-leading education and research and reflect Indigenous place and our shared history. The University released its 2020 UWA Crawley Campus Masterplan . This is aligned with the University's 2030 vision and campus development strategy to ensure UWA has a progressive, resilient and sustainable future. Through the articulation of design and development principles and plans (including sustainability, transport, infrastructure, landscape and cultural heritage), the Masterplan provides a framework for future development. The Masterplan highlighted an urgent need for substantial investment in the Crawley/QEIIMC precinct to contemporise our campuses. The opportunity to optimise and unlock value from some of the University's non- core assets to fund future University capital investment underpins our long-term master planning strategy. The University has started a planning process to investigate potential future uses of its Nedlands campus and Park Avenue site, and in early 2022 will engage with staff, students and the community to help inform future planning of these sites. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to create an uncertain operating environment for UWA. Physical investment initiatives were predominantly focused on priority compliance, safety and welfare matters. However, 2021 saw some notable achievements, including: EZONE building winning the Hillson Beasley Award for Educational Architecture in the Australian Institute of Architects Awards and the Special Interior Design award in the Campus Category of the prestigious Prix de Versailles. Bilya Marlee winning the Julius Elischer Award for Interior Architecture in the Australian Institute of Architects Awards, and the National Australian Institute of Landscape Architects Award for Health and Education Landscapes. Embed sustainability and fair-trade principles into the developmental and operational activities of the campus. A capital investment plan for 2021-23 was initiated addressing the key objectives of load growth, financial sustainability and student experience. Exciting initiatives in this investment plan include the transformation of dated and poor quality facilities in the Reid Library into innovative and high quality learning and research spaces, and new and improved medicine and optometry clinical teaching facilities. The University signed an agreement with Synergy for the supply of electricity for the next four years. This is planned to be completely offset with renewable energy by 2025 accomplished through the purchase of Large Scale Generation Certificates generated by the Warradarge Wind Farm in Eneabba. This is the first agreement of its kind for Synergy, and with this commitment to offset 100 per cent of its electricity with renewables, the University is on its way to achieving almost 90 per cent of its energy neutral target, and more than 80 per cent of its carbon neutral target (for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions).27 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au27 This year an energy sustainability dashboard was designed to help the University achieve its 2025 carbon-neutral target. The dashboard provides a comprehensive understanding of UWA's electrical energy resources, including how to better manage and maximise use of renewable energy, and accurately forecast future energy usage. With the continued uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 this year, Venues Management continued to adopt a safe, cautious and measured recovery plan. This included establishing a more agile workforce to meet the needs of the University, and easing the booking terms and conditions across its venues and The University Club. These strategies proved successful leading to a significant increase in new clients. This year, University Theatres extended the hugely popular Candlelight Concerts program to 147 performances, and attracted the return of the Black Swan Theatre Company with their performance of The Tempest . The University Club also experienced a surge in conference and banquet room bookings, with forward booking enquiries suggesting this trend will continue and return to pre-COVID levels. Collectively, Venues Management coordinated approximately 1,600 events attracting more than 330,000 people to campus, and supported the safe provision of core activities, including the delivery of 90,000 meals to University Hall residents. Operationally, 2021 saw significant progress in moving data centre computer workloads off campus and into more efficient cloud and co-located commercial service offerings. Improvements to sourcing strategies of IT services were also made, improving the use of recycled materials in devices and packaging, energy star certification and configuration for efficient operations, as well as an increase to the peripheral lifecycles to encourage continued use, which is both environmentally and financially sustainable. This dynamic has provided opportunities for the University to further its sustainability objectives, with immediate reductions in the environmental impacts of commuting, demand on power (including heating and cooling on campus), printing quantities (as people move to digital), and in the longer term, an increase on our ability to optimise our facility usage to better leverage the University's assets. Create new opportunities for collaboration, co-location and connectivity. The University continued to invest in its digital infrastructure this year, to support education and research strategic activities, and drive agility and efficient use of resources within its operational space. The University continued to progress its Connected Campus project, which aims to provide a highly connected, efficient foundational network through Wi-Fi connectivity (to support capability for new teaching modes and improved research network performance). Additionally, the Trusted Campus project also progressed significantly this year. The project seeks to improve digital identity and secure access to UWA research, teaching and learning and supporting corporate systems services for staff and students, while responding to the significant increases in cyber threats associated with industries moving to remote working. The events of 2020 and 2021 placed unprecedented pressure on the digital landscape to enable remote learning and activity-based working. Despite the campus reopening, the flow-on demand for access to digital resources from staff and students continued to be strong. Moving forward into 2022, the digital program will continue to positively impact student experience, enable critical teaching and learning enhancement that supports online learning, provide services for research activities, reduce reliance on ageing physical infrastructure and improve the University's digital resilience.28 The University of Western Australia | report on strategic priorities PRIORITIES Build a workforce with the capabilities to deliver the objectives of UWA 2030 and develop leadership to motivate and engage colleagues to succeed. Foster a high-performance culture that is values-led, collaborative and open, and that embraces diversity. Encourage innovation and development through high-quality training, recognition and reward. Throughout 2021, the University continued to support our workforce as we transitioned into the post-pandemic world. Leadership development and improving the agility, resilience and capability of our workforce became even more important, as we continually balanced the delivery of initiatives designed to meet our goals of financial sustainability, growth and improving the student experience. Our structural reform program encouraged leaders to make strategic decisions regarding longer-term business unit operating models, while we continued to focus on fostering diversity and inclusion across our workforce to be reflective of the communities in which we operate. We have progressed all aspects of the People and Culture Strategy , which is underpinned by the following four objectives.Defining, creating and supporting the careers of the future that will attract world-class people The University continued to refine its talent acquisition and management processes during 2021; securing local, interstate and international talent for key roles across the University. Key HR initiatives were introduced, enabling the University to provide further career opportunities to many existing staff: retaining key talent and intellectual property. Work also continued with Executive on strengthening our commitment to culture and the desire to be a values driven organisation.and Culture People 29 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au29 Developing an inclusive and diverse workforce that lives its values There was increased focus on inclusion and diversity this year through the delivery of awareness sessions on various topics to staff. This included the launch of the SBS Core Inclusion training, and continued rollout of the Project Peacock online modules - designed for staff to learn how to create a positive environment for the LGBTIQA+ student experience. Inclusion and diversity seminars continued to grow in strength, promoting and building inclusivity on a range of topics, with support provided for Harmony Week and Wear it Purple Day, the introduction of a Gender Panel Pledge, and promotion of inclusive meeting guidelines. Driving and rewarding a high-performing workforce capable of driving real change A leadership development program commenced this year to further develop the leadership skills of mid-career research leaders. The program is based on a tailored competency framework and features 360 feedback, individual development plans and mentoring and tailored group development sessions. This pilot program will extend into 2022. Professional development sessions were provided more broadly covering topics such as Leading through Change. Our performance review process was reframed to incorporate the impacts of COVID-19 on the University and encourage staff to set objectives for 2022 and beyond.Building engagement and motivation of and for all staff Though an engagement survey was not conducted in 2021, we have continued to monitor progress in the UWA 'Your Say' Engagement Plan 2020-21 and initiatives to enhance the employee experience on an ongoing basis. As we move forward into 2022 and look towards our 2025 goals, we will continue to invest in leadership capability and competencies across campus, strategic workforce planning and embedding our values in everyday behaviours. 30 The University of Western Australia | governance and disclosures CHANCELLOR The Hon Robert S.

Inclusion and diversity training and courses were also prioritised with the launch of the online, self- paced SBS Core Inclusion Course; the all-year round facilitation of in-person and virtual Unconscious Bias training, and Step Up Bystander, Disability Awareness and ALLY training. The University continued its commitment to gender equity by progressing its action plan under the Athena SWAN Bronze Award. UWA was also recognised as a Bronze Employer in the annual Australian Workplace Equality Index for LGBTIQA+ inclusion, and shortlisted for an Institute of Public Administration Award for its ALLY training program. In 2021, a new Pro-Vice Chancellor, Diversity and Inclusion role was created and Professor Marit Kragt was appointed to oversee inclusion and diversity at the University. The UWA Inclusion and Diversity Working Group also appointed Executive Sponsors to support and champion inclusion and diversity initiatives. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS The University continued to support staff and students through the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns during 2021. The Human Resources directorate played a key role in supporting the University's Structural Reform Program. The University has successfully implemented amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) in relation to casual employment, which now requires an employer to make an offer to a casual employee, to convert from casual to permanent employment (in certain circumstances). As a result of this amendment, 31 offers were made to UWA employees, with 16 of those offers accepted. In the year ahead, UWA will continue developing its new staff agreement through the enterprise bargaining process. It will also continue its focus on compliance, including resolving staff-related queries about pay and entitlements, in line with the University's enterprise agreements and policies.SAFETY AND HEALTH Commitment This year UWA continued its commitment to providing a safe and healthy working and learning environment for its staff, students, visitors and contractors. This proactive approach to minimising the potential for injury, illness and harm was reinforced in a commitment statement and supporting Safety and Health Leadership and Governance Framework by UWA Executive, the Audit and Risk Committee and Senate. All staff are now able to be assessed on their safety performance and due diligence obligations based on the responsibilities and accountabilities as outlined in these strategic documents. Training and performance monitoring This year saw the introduction of three new Online Safety Training Modules and an Induction Module that will support staff in receiving safety training in areas specific to their role; and in accordance with the University's Safety and Health training requirements. A new Safety and Health Training Performance Dashboard was also rolled out to enable leaders to monitor staff training completion rates. This will be further developed in 2022. Communication and consultation An internal review was undertaken to update the purpose and function of UWA's Safety and Health committees. This included developing new Terms of Reference designed to provide structure and guidance on how these committees should operate and consult; meet their due diligence obligations and raise safety issues within their local work area. Incident reporting system In late 2021 a new incident reporting online system was rolled out for reporting and management of safety hazards, incidents, near misses and safety risks. Managers and supervisors are now able to rely on an intuitive system to support them in managing and documenting local area safety risks. This also supports the University in meeting its duty of care requirements. Following the State Government's mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy across prescribed sectors, resources from the Safety and Health team were diverted from daily operations to adequately support the University as required. It is anticipated that considerable resources will continue to be required in this capacity in 2022. 43 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au43 INJURY MANAGEMENT AND WELLBEING The Injury Management and Wellbeing team continued to provide best practice injury management and prevention services aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of work related injuries, and meeting its obligations under the Workers' Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981 (WA). In addition to the core services provided in line with the Injury Management and Wellbeing Framework and UWA Strategic Plan 2021-25, a number of key activities were progressed in 2021, including: Development of a Musculoskeletal Risk Assessment tool to assess the risk of injury for higher risk work tasks, along with targeted mitigation strategies. Implementation of Mental Health First Aid Officer Network to enhance peer support and ensure staff/ students requiring support are linked in with appropriate resources.Performance reporting There was an increase in Lost Time Injuries (LTIs) in 2021, compared to 2020, and an increase in Lost Time Injury Days (LTIDs), which were attributed to two injuries accounting for 79 per cent of the total LTIDs. While the Injury Management and Return to Work target (80 per cent return to full capacity within 26 weeks) was not met, 10 of the 11 LTI's have been supported on return to work programs with five regaining a full capacity for work within the current reporting period. Increases in incidents, LTIs and workers compensation claims in 2021 are in line with the University's five year average, with 2020 being an unusually well performing year, potentially attributable to the impacts of COVID-19 and remote working arrangements.

The Code is 'a voluntary set of principles and processes designed to ensure fair and appropriate remuneration for University leadership that is understood and supported by the sector's stakeholders'. At the time of the release of the Code, the UCC advised that member Universities would be supported to implement the Code through the provision of best practice templates and guidance for the reporting of remuneration. In late 2021 the UCC advised that supporting documentation will not be available until after UCC adoption in May 2022.In the absence of UCC templates and guidance, and to ensure UWA's approach is not misaligned or less transparent to the disclosures by others in the sector, Senate subsequently approved deferral of application of the Code to the UWA Annual Report 2022. A disclosure is provided at note 3.4 in the University's financial statements. 48 The University of Western Australia | governance and disclosures Statement of Freedom of Speech Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom Statement The University of Western Australia's main policy regarding freedom of speech and academic freedom is the UWA Code for the Protection of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom (UWA Code). The UWA Code demonstrates the University's commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom. The University vigorously supports the right of its staff and students to freely express their opinions in the course of academic debate and discussion.1 The UWA Code upholds academic freedom and freedom of speech as paramount values and is in accordance with the Model Code for the Protection of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom in Australian Higher Education Providers2. The University maintains an institutional environment in which freedom of speech and academic freedom are upheld and protected3. The University initiated several activities to support a culture committed to freedom of speech and academic freedom. This is demonstrated through the University's socialisation of the UWA Code within the University Community, including by briefings provided by the University's General Counsel and Director of Governance to: College of Schools (comprising Heads of Schools), 15 April 2021 Human Resources Management, 19 April 2021 University's Board of Discipline for Student Matters, 20 April 2021 Senior Leaders and Management of the University, 20 May 20214. 1 This paragraph addresses the first bullet point under the heading: 'Annually' in the University Chancellors' Council's template for the Attestation Statement for Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom (the Template). 2 This paragraph addresses paragraph 1 of the Template. 3 This paragraph addresses paragraph 2 of the Template. 4 This paragraph addresses the second bullet point under the heading: 'Annually' in the Template.The University addresses questions that arise in relation to the management of freedom of speech and academic freedom issues promptly, actively and in good faith5. In early 2021 the Human Rights Watch identified difficulties faced by some international students regarding freedom of speech and academic freedom at Australian universities. In his correspondence in August 2021, the Vice-Chancellor reminded all students that: their entitlement to academic freedom and freedom of speech exists within a framework of Australian law, including laws against racially discriminatory speech that is offensive, insulting, humiliating or intimidating; and it would be inconsistent with the protections created by the UWA Code if any student should seek by any means (including reporting to a foreign government) to adversely affect any other student or that student's family or friends on account of statements made by that other student6. In correspondence to all students in October 2021, the Vice-Chancellor reinforced that these principles apply to all students, including international students of the same national origin, and advised all international students who are concerned about freedom of speech to contact the International Student Support team if they wish to privately discuss any concerns. International students who ever feel threatened, intimidated or humiliated as a result of exercising their academic freedom, and freedom of speech were encouraged to make a complaint to the UWA Integrity and Standards Unit . Much of the recent discussion and debate concerning freedom of expression and academic freedom within Australian universities has concerned events at which contentious views and ideas may be expressed on university campus grounds by external speakers. 5 This paragraph addresses paragraph 3 of the Template. 6 This paragraph and the next address the third bullet point under the heading: 'Annually' in the Template.49 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au49 Following consideration of the input from various consultation sessions, the University agreed that the UWA Code: should apply to everyone who expresses views and ideas within this University, including visitors and external speakers (i.e. rather than only applying to members of UWA); and should do so whether this expression takes place on campus or through UWA administered online platforms7. With respect to the issue of whether the UWA Code should apply to UWA members expressing ideas in other settings \u2014 discussion within consultation sessions in 2019-20 identified the importance of distinguishing between members of UWA expressing ideas as private individuals or expressing those ideas in their capacity as UWA members. The University has also established a 'Freedom of Expression Panel' to provide a mechanism by which the Vice-Chancellor can seek advice about the use of the University's facilities by visiting speakers. It also allows members of the University community who are concerned about a prospective use of the University's facilities to ask that panel to consider that use and to provide advice to the Vice-Chancellor. A clear set of procedures have been developed to enable the function of this Panel. There has been no business since the establishment of the Panel in 2021. 7 This paragraph and the next address the fourth bullet point under the heading: 'Annually' in the Template.Alignment of University policy with the Model Code On 31 August 2020, the University's governing body, the Senate, resolved to establish a Senate Working Group to consider the University's response to an independent review of freedom of speech and academic freedom (the Model Code) in Australian higher education by former High Court Chief Justice, The Hon. Robert French AC. The working group comprised three members of Senate, the chair and deputy-chair of the Academic Board and the Student Guild President as representative of the student body8. On 7 December 2020, the Senate resolved to endorse the Working Group's recommendation to adopt the UWA Code for the Protection of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom (the UWA Code), which was viewed by the Senate to be consistent with the principles of the Model Code. In response to a review conducted by Emeritus Professor Sally Walker AM, the Senate resolved at its meeting in August 2021 that \" the University undertake a general review of codes, policies and principles which may affect freedom of speech or academic freedom to ensure that they comply with the reasonable and proportionate regulation and other restrictions contemplated by this Code\" 9. The University undertook an audit of its policies/codes to identify those policies/codes that need to be reviewed for alignment and consistency with the UWA Code. To this end, eighteen (18) policies have been identified for review, of which seven (7) policies have since been confirmed to be in alignment with the UWA Code. The University Policy on Student Rights and Responsibility, which has been amended to align it with the UWA Code, was approved by Senate on 6 December 2021. Work to align the remaining identified policies with the UWA Code will continue into early 2022 and is anticipated to be completed by June 2022. 8 This paragraph and the next address the first bullet point under the heading: 'Year 1 Annual Statement (potentially one-off)' in the Template. 9 This paragraph and the next address the second bullet point under the heading: 'Year 1 Annual Statement (potentially one-off)' in the Template.50 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Key performance indicators UWA's mission is to provide world-class education, research and community engagement for the advancement of the prosperity and welfare of our communities. The University has a vision of creating the next generation of global leaders through experience-rich education and world-leading, trustworthy research. The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are designed to evidence progress towards our vision and mission. These KPIs contain some changes to the UWA Annual Report 2020 and reflects the activities within the University's 2030 vision and Strategic Plan 2020-25 , as well as an alignment of focus against the immediate University strategic priorities of: financial sustainability student enrolment growth an excellent student experience. Where an indicator is new or changed, it is noted. Relationships with previous reporting are referenced in the notes for each indicator.51 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au51 1 | Education Strategic goal A UWA education will empower students to create the best possible future for themselves and, through their leadership, others. We will be globally acclaimed for our stimulating curriculum built on social responsibility, experience-rich learning and cutting-edge research. Key performance indicators Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following effectiveness indicators: 1.1 Student revenue growth 1.2 Participation 1.3 Student experience 1.4 Graduate outcomes 1.1 STUDENT REVENUE GROWTH This effectiveness indicator measures the University's ability to attract and retain students and generate revenue for reinvestment into student experience and to ensure financial sustainability. Increased student revenue is largely reflective of increased enrolments. Attracting students from both within Australia and from around the world is a key aspect in delivering on UWA's educational goals and financial targets. This metric reflects the financial impact related to the size of the UWA student body and the mix of students to ensure ongoing growth is most likely to be financially sustainable. The University managed to significantly exceed its forecast position in 2021. With continued Australian border closures, a decline in international commencing enrolments was anticipated, leading to an expected reduction in revenue compared to the previous year. Although international students were unable to study onshore, the University successfully retained international students enrolled and studying online. The University also attracted an increased number of domestic student enrolments through a number of changes to course offerings and enrolment processes. Looking forward the University will seek to maintain attractiveness with recently launched new course offerings while also providing greater accessibility and learning options for students - both domestic and international.Student revenue growth PERCENTAGE CHANGE 2021 2021 TARGET Student revenue growth compared to previous year5% -3% Data source: Internal management reporting data source Note: This indicator is new for 2021. It is the financial expression of student load targets that were previously reported in the UWA Annual Report 2020. 'Student revenue' relates to course fees from undergraduate, postgraduate and Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students. It includes Commonwealth Grant Scheme subsidies for tuition costs for higher education students, domestic and international student payments. 1.2 PARTICIPATION UWA recognises the importance of creating an environment that supports achieving a more diverse student population. The participation rate allows for the monitoring of UWA's ability to attract, retain, progress and support students from designated equity groups: low socioeconomic status (SES) students, Indigenous students, and students from regional and remote locations. Equity is one of UWA's core values. Participation rates from these equity groups provide an indicator of the University's effectiveness in achieving diversity and inclusion to support success. While the relative percentage declined, the University attracted and retained growth in the absolute participation numbers of Indigenous students and regional and remote students in 2021. Growth in the lower SES cohort was at pace with broader growth, with a key ongoing contribution channel being the University's Fairway program. In 2021 the Student Equity and Access Framework was developed, aiming to support increased diversity among our student cohort. Within this, equity group students are also being supported for success within the EquiP initiative that is monitoring early engagement with campus life and academic study in order to support the provision of personalised support. Participation COHORT (%) 2019 2020 20212021 TARGET Indigenous students 1.3 1.4 1.3 1.5 Low SES students 12.3 11.8 11.8 12.0 Regional/remote students 8.7 8.0 7.7 8.1 Data source: Internal management reporting system Note: This is a revised Annual Report indicator compared to 2020. Participation rates of students from a non-English-speaking background (NESB) and students with a disability were included in the UWA Annual Report 2020 but have not been included for 2021. Indigenous students are those students who self-declared; low SES students are determined by postcode classification; and regional/remote students are determined by Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) classification.52 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Education (continued) 1.3 STUDENT EXPERIENCE Student perceptions of their overall experience at UWA are critical in understanding the University's ability to deliver quality courses, relevant pedagogy and curriculum and an enjoyable learning experience. This includes perspectives from domestic and international students across undergraduate and postgraduate coursework degrees. It is also consistent in measuring outcomes related to the University's strategic priority in delivering an excellent student experience. There was a recovery in student satisfaction results in 2021, reflecting improvements in student experiences compared to the more COVID-19 disrupted learning environment of 2020. The combination of both greater stability in teaching and increased familiarity with delivery options such as online or mixed classes has seen overall student satisfaction achieve its target and overall improvements back to pre COVID-19 levels. However, it is recognised that undergraduate student results have not yet recovered to the 2019 levels. A greater number of students responded to the survey in 2021, as compared with the response rate in recent years. Ensuring an excellent student experience is a key strategic priority for the University. The UWA Student Experience Strategic Plan 2020-25 is driving a wide range of initiatives that will uplift and transform student experience in areas such as learning opportunities, digital engagement, student wellbeing and career development opportunities.

Reporting source produced by Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QILT) (via the Social Research Centre); national data sets including institutional response rates for the 2021 Student Experience Survey are not yet available. Postgraduate students were only included in SES from 2017. Teaching Quality was reported in 2020 but this has been changed to focus on Overall Experience results for 2021. Note: This indicator was included in the UWA Annual Report 2020 with overall experience reported separately for undergraduates and postgraduates, along with an overall Teaching Quality result. In 2020 it was determined that the International Student Barometer (ISB) reporting on international students should be excluded due to significant delays in the availability of that metric. Overall student experience targets were not set individually for undergraduates or postgraduates but these results are provided for context. Results are calculated based on the headcount of students who answer satisfied or very satisfied to the overall experience question divided by the headcount of students who have responded to the overall experience question. The WA Average figure excludes the UWA result to remove the impact of the University's result on the overall WA result. *Full year figures for response rates, WA and National averages will not be available until the full release of 2021 data via QILT.53 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au53 1.4 GRADUATE OUTCOMES Students value not only their experiences at university, but also the ability to achieve positive outcomes as a result of their qualification. Gaining meaningful employment post-study is of significant importance to a large number of students and monitoring the employment rates of students provides an indication that UWA's education offerings are relevant to employer expectations, enhancing the opportunity for graduates to be on their career path soon after graduation. It is important to also consider students who wish to continue their study in order to achieve enhanced professional qualifications or more specialist knowledge. Performance in this metric provides an indication that the University's course content is relevant to employer requirements, is aligned with Federal Government performance-based objectives and are providing students with desirable employment or further study options. There has been an improvement in graduate outcomes following the 2020 decline in full-time employment rates experienced by undergraduates across Western Australia. This recovery was greater than expected, leading to the University exceeding its annual target. A continued focus on the inclusion of work-integrated learning opportunities within courses will be supported by increased embedding of employability links through curricular and co-curricular experiences, through initiatives such as the University Centre for Employability. The University also continues to evaluate its pathways from undergraduate to postgraduate study to provide students with relevant and appropriate options to continue their learning journey.Graduate outcomes for undergraduates OUTCOME (% EMPLOYMENT OR FULL-TIME STUDY WITHIN 4 MONTHS)2020 2021 2021 TARGET UWA 60.4 67.4 62.0 WA average 58.7 GRADUATE OUTCOMES SURVEY (GOS) RATE (%)2020 2021 UWA 35.3 38.4 Data source: Datasets and dashboard provided by Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QILT) (via the national Social Research Centre) Note: This KPI was revised this year to include both full-time employment and full-time study outcomes and has been applied to the 2020 comparator. In the previous years annual report only full- time employment outcomes were reported for both undergraduates and postgraduates. Graduate Employment was an indicator included in the UWA Annual Report 2018 (KPI 1.3). It was also included in the 2019 and 2020 annual reports (KPI 1.5) as separate undergraduate and postgraduate results. In 2021 a focus on improving undergraduate pathways into either employment or further study saw a new target set for undergraduates only that covered both employment and full-time study graduate outcomes. This metric represents the number of undergraduates who were either employed or studying full-time four months after completing their course, as a percentage of those undergraduates who were available for full-time employment. Benchmarking averages exclude UWA. Domestic student outcomes are shown only; response rate includes international students. The Graduate Outcomes Survey began in its current format in 2016 for students graduating in 2015. QILT reports show as collection year (one year on from graduation). Year refers to the reference year of the survey, e.g. 2021 represents 2020 graduates.54 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au 2 | Research and innovation Strategic goal As one of the world's elite, research-intensive universities, we will be known for our trusted, reproducible, transformative, open research and accessible data. We will be recognised for leading teams in resolving real-world challenges that are critical to the planet and its people. Key performance indicators Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following effectiveness and efficiency indicators: 2.1 Research income (effectiveness) 2.2 HDR completions (efficiency) 2.3 Publications and outputs - Highly Cited Papers (effectiveness) 2.4 Publications and outputs - Total ERA-Eligible Research Outputs (effectiveness) 2.1 RESEARCH INCOME Research funding earned by an institution provides an indication of its effectiveness in conducting relevant and valued research, while also informing the community how effective the University is in attracting an appropriate proportion of this national funding, which can vary in size across years. It aligns with the strategic priority of financial sustainability. The University exceeded its total research income target thanks to increased Industry, International and Philanthropic funding, which was largely driven by growth in research funding to medical research institutes (MRIs) affiliated with the University. Research occurs in a highly competitive environment that attracts appropriate funding through ongoing performance and innovation. There will be a focus on strategic partnerships with industry and other research organisations alongside increased mentoring and support of researchers linked to key promising areas in order to grow University research income, both as total dollars and as a proportional share of national funding. Research income awarded to UWA 2017 2018 2019 2020 2020 TARGET Total research income ($millions) - effectiveness$167 $177 $214 $233 $214 UWA income - effectiveness4.2% 4.2% 4.7% 4.6%4.2% and above Australian HDR COMPLETIONS Increased Higher Degree by Research (HDR) completions are a measure of success for the University for a number of reasons, from the development of highly-skilled experts and leaders for the future workforce, new knowledge for society, to greater engagement with students and for increasing the research capacity of the University. It is important that this process can be delivered efficiently, ensuring that completions are timely to appropriately align completion outcomes with Federal funding requirements and to provide suitable support for research students. It aligns with the strategic priorities of financial sustainability and excellent student experience. Efficient completion of HDR students is important due to the funding requirements associated with Research Training Program (RTP) courses. Students that exceed their allotted time in completing HDR qualifications result in financial and resourcing issues, while also potentially influencing other research-linked activities. The University did not meet its efficient HDR completion target in 2021. This is a new indicator and the measure (completions within four years of commencement) will lag in response to changes in practices. COVID-19 related events during 2020 and 2021 have created challenges for some students, such as preventing research-related travel or limiting face-to-face engagement with supervisors for students not located in Perth. This has especially impacted international HDR students who may be offshore and unable to access University physical campus resources given travel restrictions. In recognition of these factors the Federal Government approved additional scholarship extensions of up to six months for COVID-19 related delays. Improving the efficiency of HDR completions will take a number of years to achieve and will need to take into account recent Government financial incentives around three-month industry internships for PhD students. Enhanced supervisor development is planned to provide greater support to HDR students while an updated candidature management system will allow for improved governance of HDR student progress. Data source: Commonwealth Government Higher Education Research Data Collection (HERDC) for year ending 31 December, with 2020 as the most recent data. Figures in millions are rounded to the nearest million. Note: The total research income indicator was included in the UWA Annual Report 2019 and corresponds to KPI 2.1 in the 2012 to 2018 annual reports; however, there are some reporting category changes and methodological changes from the 2017 onwards due to changes in HERDC categorisations and reporting. The previous measure of average research funding per level B+ researcher has been removed, with the focus placed on the University share of national research income received. The four research income categories within HERDC income did not have an institutional target set but are provided for context; these components may not equal the total research income due to rounding effects.55 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au55 HDR students who had completed their studies by four years of commencement (%) 2018 to 2021 2021 TARGET UWA - overall 12.5 17.0 UWA - domestic students 14.4 UWA - international students 8.8 Data source: Internal management reporting system. Group of Eight and national benchmark results are sourced from the Department of Education, Skills and Employment report, Higher Degrees by Research Completions, Cohort Analysis 2007 to 2017 . Note: This is a new indicator. A PhD should complete within four years and a Master by research complete in two years to align with Federal funding requirements. Students are tracked and analysed by commencing year. The 2021 UWA HDR results are as at 31 January 2022. 2.3 PUBLICATIONS AND OUTPUTS - HIGHLY CITED PAPERS UWA is committed to communicating its research globally through highly impactful outputs. Publications that are highly cited in their field of research (top 1%) are used to benchmark research outputs regardless of differences in size and disciplinary profiles, and to highlight the impact within and across fields of research. This contributes to the institutional reputation, with total citations also contributing to some global ranking indicators. Reputation assists more prestigious institutions to attract students, so this indicator is aligned to the strategic priority of enrolment growth. The University did not meet its target for highly cited papers over a difficult period for research publications. COVID-19 has had significant impacts on research, such as reducing opportunities for international research collaborations. These impacts may continue to have effects over the coming years, especially for the development of highly cited papers. In order to improve this result in future the University is looking to develop a research culture that aims to develop highly cited papers through improved socialisation of key papers, increased strategic collaboration opportunities (research collaboration awards have been suspended during COVID-19 travel restrictions), support for current and emerging research leaders, and recruitment of research leaders, including endowed chairs. Highly cited papers 2021 2021 TARGET Number of highly cited papers (rolling 10 year window)990 11002.4 PUBLICATIONS AND OUTPUTS - TOTAL ERA-ELIGIBLE RESEARCH OUTPUTS UWA seeks to ensure it is distinguished by the intensity and breadth of the research it conducts. Increases in high-quality and relevant research outputs assist in communicating new knowledge, achieving greater external engagement and investment, development of further research capacities and strengthening of national and international partnerships. The Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) is Australia's national research evaluation framework. ERA identifies and promotes excellence across the full spectrum of research activity in Australia's higher education institutions. An annual total of all ERA-eligible research outputs provides a whole-of-institution view for research outputs across our diversity of disciplines. This indicator is also linked to financial sustainability through ensuring excellence in research output, which is relevant for attraction of future research funding. The University exceeded its overall target for ERA-eligible outputs. Despite COVID-19 having significant impacts on research, and especially the number of conference proceedings papers, the University saw increases in total research outputs in 2021 compared to target. The development of ERA-eligible outputs remains a priority for the University given its research intensive focus as a Group of Eight institution. The results of 2021 will contribute to the next round of ERA evaluation, which is scheduled to take place in 2023. Total ERA-eligible research outputs 2021 2021 TARGET Annual total of ERA-eligible research outputs6134 5989 Data source: Internal management reporting system provides ERA- eligible outputs data; performance for 2021 reported as at 31 January 2022. Note: This is a new indicator. ERA identifies and promotes excellence across the full spectrum of research activity in Australia's higher education institutions. Within the ERA the disciplines are defined as two-digit and four-digit Fields of Research codes as identified in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification, allowing the full range of University disciplines to be covered when it comes to eligible research outputs. Data source: Data extracted from Clarivate InCites with performance for 2021 reported as at 31 January 2022 Note: This is a new indicator. Highly cited papers are identified within the Clarivate Web of Science and reflect the most cited papers within 22 broad fields of research (21 subject categories plus multidisciplinary) over the past decade. This is a 10-year rolling indicator, as citations are determined over time and publications may increase or decrease in citation performance in comparison to other publications in its field of research over that period.56 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au 3 | Global partnerships and engagement Strategic goal As an authoritative global leader in education and cross-disciplinary and translatable research, we will forge and nurture strong, deep partnerships that reinforce our position as the fulcrum of the Indian Ocean Rim. Key performance indicator Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following effectiveness indicator: 3.1 Non-traditional revenue 3.1 NON-TRADITIONAL REVENUE A combination of philanthropic income raised (pledged) and other 'non-grant income', including Centre for English Language Testing (CELT) linked international on-shore income, short/CPD courses, consultancy, royalties on commercialised research, intellectual property income and sales of publications / services, together reflect aspects of the University's external engagement. As competition for funding continues to increase, it is important for UWA to effectively broaden sources of revenue. Growing this category of revenue also diversifies income beyond traditional research sources and supports greater financial sustainability. The University exceeded its annual target due to higher than expected performance of both pledged philanthropic revenue and royalties. It was anticipated that ongoing COVID-19 impacts would reduce philanthropic pledges to below previous years, but this did not occur. Revenue generated by short courses fell below expectations, but this was more than offset by increased royalties above target, particularly from medical-related research which was commercialised a few years ago. The University will continue to further develop its philanthropic support action plan and a coordinated approach to fundraising to support our mission.Non-traditional revenue 2019 2020 2021 2021 TARGET Philanthropic revenue raised (pledged) ($millions)$22.3 $31.7 $34.2 partnership and non grant income Alumni Relations philanthropic income; Innovation and Industry Engagement commercial and partnerships income (internal data/records). Note: This indicator was reported using the same methodology in 2020. Philanthropic income reported is at the University level (i.e. excluding subsidiaries).57 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au57 4 | Sustainable environments Strategic goal We will be recognised as a vibrant, sustainable and connected hub that blends our heritage with our future and welcomes our partners, the community and the wider world. Key performance indicator Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following efficiency indicator: 4.1 Campus intensity 4.1 CAMPUS INTENSITY Campus intensity reflects the potential use of campus space by staff and students through the creation of a 'gross floor area (in square metres) per student (in student load) and staff (in full-time equivalent)' metric. This space utilisation indicator is commonly used in the University sector as a measure of the efficiency of space utilisation across an entire campus area. A key priority within the University's Sustainable Environments enabling strategy is appropriate investment in the University's physical and digital environment. The impact of these activities would include improved space utilisation and intensification, which would be reflected in the 'Campus Intensity' metric. The significant increase in student enrolments, driven by domestic students, saw the University come close to achieving its campus intensity annual target. In 2021 the UWA Crawley Campus Masterplan was released, providing the community with information on the University's planning intentions. This provides a ten-year plan covering the activation, rejuvenation and refurbishment approach for the campus, with a key aim being the increased utilisation of campus spaces. Campus intensity 2019 2020 2021 2021 TARGET Gross floor area (m2) per person18.3 18.9 18.2 18.0 Data source: The student load (EFTSL) and staff FTE are taken from an internal management reporting data source. Campus information (i.e. gross floor area in square metres) was taken from information shared with the Tertiary Education Facilities Management Association (TEFMA). 2020 is the most current year available where results have been externally reported. The 2021 result is based on internal reporting sources that are consistent with TEFMA's methodology. Note: This indicator was included in the UWA Annual Report 2020 .58 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au 5 | People and culture Strategic goal UWA will be a remarkable place to work, attracting and retaining world-class staff from diverse backgrounds who want to build careers, drive change, provide leadership and create opportunities in an institution renowned for its excellence. Key performance indicator Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following efficiency indicator: 5.1 Staff turnover 5.1 STAFF TURNOVER Appropriate management of voluntary staff turnover is an important aspect of operations and managing human resources. Although some staff turnover is expected, unplanned levels of voluntary separations can represent loss of key skills, reduced productivity and increased employee search costs. Staff turnover measures voluntary employee-initiated turnover within the University over an annual period and reveals the University's ability to efficiently plan for staff who choose to leave employment as a percentage of overall staff numbers. Voluntary staff turnover was higher than the University target. There has been a range of change management activities within the University that have seen structural changes to the organisation, which may be linked to the increased voluntary staff turnover.Staff turnover - voluntary separation rate (%) Voluntary separation rate (%)2019 2020 2021 2021 TARGET UWA 7.7 8.1 9.8* Within +/- 1% of 8.6 Group of Eight average 8.6 7.7 National average 8.7 7. 2 Data source: Australian Higher Education Industrial Association (AHEIA) Universities HR Benchmarking Program 2021: HR Performance Indicators for the University of Western Australia Compared with Australian Universities For the period 2017-21 report and the equivalent Group of Eight comparison report. This result is classified as 'Voluntary Employee Initiated Turnover' within this report. 2021 is the most current year available for reporting to AHEIA which only reports voluntary employee separation to 2020. The 2021 result is based on internal reporting sources that are consistent with AHEIA's methodology. Staff who accepted a redundancy when leaving the University are not included in the voluntary turnover calculation. *The 2021 result will not be able to be finalised until 31 March 2022 and so this result will be updated in 2022 reporting. Note: This indicator was included in the UWA Annual Report 2020.59 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au59 6 | Effective and sustainable operations Strategic goal Offerings (academic and administrative) will be high- quality, timely and user-focused and will be designed to enable us to meet our education, research and engagement aspirations. Key performance indicator Achievement of this goal will be measured by the following efficiency indicator: 6.1 Operating margin (excluding total investment income) 6.1 OPERATING MARGIN* The indicator used earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin adjusted to remove total investment income to calculate the operating margin and represents the total funding available for servicing debt and investment into physical and capital infrastructure, ensuring sustainable operations. The University has adjusted the EBITDA margin to exclude investment income, removing this volatility in comparing any given year. The University separately monitors the effectiveness of its investment strategy and portfolio. Performance on this indicator is primarily driven by fee-paying student load and the efficiency in delivering core operations before the cost of servicing debt (interest) and the cost of capital investments (depreciation and amortisation). This indicator is also influenced by the timing of income and expenditure associated capital grants and donations, as well as expenditure associated with investments in academic excellence, student experience and other University strategic priorities. The University has exceeded both its 2020 performance and 2021 Target. This outcome was attributable to the receipt of one-time government research funding to alleviate the impact of COVID-19, material growth in domestic enrolments, and one-time donation funding to support the University's investment in endowed research chairs. The favourable uplift in margin against prior year is also attributable to increased savings as part of initiatives for continued financial sustainability. The 2021 operating margin also includes $19 million one-time capital donations to fund the construction of Forrest Hall 2 (stage 2). The University's long-term target for its adjusted EBITDA margin (excluding one-time funding) is above 10 per cent to sustain suitable investments into core infrastructure and its maintenance. Continuing to improve operating margin over future periods will be of key strategic focus for the University.Operating margin* 2019 RESTATED2020 RESTATED2021 2021 TARGET Operating margin* (excluding total investment income) (%)3.4 5.6 11.0 5.0 Data source: Audited financial statements at University level Note: This indicator was included in the UWA Annual Report 2020 and is a revised indicator compared to the margin result included in the UWA Annual Report 2019 .

The 2020 and 2019 operating margin (previously reported as 6.6% and 4.2% respectively) has been restated as a result of the initial application of International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee decision on Software as a Service arrangement and correction of prior period error on the revenue recognition for research grants as disclosed in note 1.3 of the audited financial statements.60 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Financial overview FINANCIAL OVERVIEW The 2021 financial year represents a strong start to the University's financial sustainability journey, as the University seeks to create financial capacity to invest in our future with a focus on enhancing student experience and transforming our digital and physical environments. SUSTAINABILITY AND REINVESTMENT To ensure financial sustainability the University seeks to achieve a 15% EBITDA margin on its underlying operations by 2025, to be achieved through growing and diversifying our revenue and addressing the efficiency of our operations. The University managed to navigate through many financial challenges in a continued backdrop of COVID-19 disruption to our operations, impacting our staff, students, community and supply chains. Despite these challenges, the University continued to focus on financial sustainability and through a program of structural reform and savings initiatives achieved nearly 70% of the $70 million operational savings target (structural deficit1). The University will continue its program for sustainable and efficient operations throughout 2022, acknowledging there will also be continued financial pressure from raising inflationary costs and significant volatility in investment markets. Following a number of COVID-19 relief measures from Government and other strategic partners, the University was fortunate to also receive one-time income to alleviate financial pressures and assist with creating capacity to fund capital projects. This will enable much needed investment into our digital and physical infrastructures, with planning underway to upgrade our libraries, teaching and learning spaces and digital enablement of our facilities and study offerings. . 1 The University's structural deficit represents the annual operational savings required to sustainably rebase the University's expenditure. If these savings had not been made the University's Underlying Result would have been in significant deficit.2021 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE While the University's reported financial statements reflects a true and fair view of the financial performance and position in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the University's financial focus is on the underlying EBITDA2 margin, adjusted to exclude investment income. This represents the total operational funding available for debt servicing and strategic and capital reinvestment and acknowledges the predominately restricted nature of our investment funds (other financial assets). The underlying EBITDA (adjusted to exclude investment income) was 11% for the year (2020: 5.6%). The material improvement in underlying EBITDA is largely attributable to growth in domestic enrolments, one-time COVID-19 relief funding, donations for endowed academic leadership positions, and increased operational savings. The University also monitors its sustainable financial performance using a financial measure referred to as the 'underlying result', which is widely used by Australian Group of Eight universities as a measure of a university's capacity to operate sustainably. The underlying result adjusts the University's net result for items that are one-off or items which are restricted in nature. While the University's 2021 underlying result of $8 million is an improvement from deficits in prior years, it is acknowledged that there are a number of core activities which due to the impacts of COVID-19 over the last two years have either stopped, been delayed or undertaken at reduced levels. For example, teaching and research fieldtrips, travel and capital equipment. The reduction in these non-employee expenditures may not be sustained annually. 2 EBITDA represents the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.61 2021 Annual Report | uwa.edu.au61 Underlying result 2021 $m2020 Restated $m Consolidated operating result 203.5 46.6 Less subsidiaries (1.0) 3.0 University operating result 202.5 49.6 Adjusted for: Restricted investment income (135.4) (33.8) Net result from endowment and gifted funds (33.7) (12.4) Net result from research (5.9) (4.8) Other capital grant income (1.3) ( 7.8) Net one time income (32.9) - Staff separation costs 15.1 2.1 Underlying result 8.3 (7. 2) Net One Time Income represents funding received in 2021 as a result of COVID-19 relief measures which will be reinvested into strategic and capital priorities in 2022. The 2020 Result has been restated (previously reported at -$2.4m) as a result of the initial application of IFRS IC IAS 38 Software as a Service arrangement and change in revenue recognition for Research Grants as disclosed in note 1.3 of the audited financial statements. FINANCIAL POSITION The University's liquidity or current ratio (current assets/ current liabilities) is 0.5 (2020: 0.6) which is considered low, however it is acknowledged that the University invests its operational funds not required for use in the immediate term in defensive unit trusts which are recorded as other financial assets (non-current asset), these funds are available to be drawn at short notice.The University's gearing (debt) ratio is 8% (2020: 9%) which is considered low risk, however it is noted that excluding restricted net assets, that this ratio is 18% (2020: 19%) which presents higher risk to the University's ability to sustainably service its debt. These metrics will continue to improve, as the University focuses on financial sustainability.62 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Auditor General Page 1 of 5 7th Floor Albert Facey House 469 Wellington Street Perth MAIL TO: Perth BC PO Box 8489 Perth WA 6849 TEL: 08 6557 7500 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 2021 THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA To the Parliament of Western Australia Report on the Financial Statements Opinion I have audited the financial statements of The University of Western Australia (University) which comprise: the Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2021, the Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Cash Flows for the University and the consolidated entity for the year then ended Notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In my opinion, the financial statements are: based on proper accounts and present fairly, in all material respects, the operating results and cash flows of The University of Western Australia and the consolidated entity for the year ended 31 December 2021 and the financial position at the end of that period in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the Financial Management Act 2006 and relevant Treasurer's Instructions, and Division 60 of the Australian Charities and Not-for- profits Commission Act 2012 (ACNC Act) and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Regulation 2013. Basis for Opinion I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the University in accordance with the Auditor General Act 2006, ACNC Act and the relevant ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence standards) (the Code) that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements. I have also fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.63 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au63 Page 2 of 5Emphasis of matter I draw attention to Note 1.3 of the financial statements which explains that the amounts reported in the previously issued 31 December 2020 financial statements have been restated and disclosed as comparatives in the financial statements. My opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. The University Senate's Responsibilities for the Financial Statements The University Senate is responsible for: keeping proper accounts preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the Financial Management Act 2006 and relevant Treasurer's Instructions, and the ACNC Act such internal control as the University Senate determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the University Senate is responsible for: assessing the entity's ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements As required by the Auditor General Act 2006 , my responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements. The objectives of my audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. A further description of my responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website. This description forms part of my auditor's report and can be found at https://www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar4.pdf. 64 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Page 3 of 5Report on Controls Opinion I have undertaken a reasonable assurance engagement on the design and implementation of controls exercised by The University of Western Australia. The controls exercised by the University are those policies and procedures established by the University Senate to ensure that the receipt, expenditure and investment of money, the acquisition and disposal of property, and the incurring of liabilities have been in accordance with legislative provisions (the overall control objectives). My opinion has been formed on the basis of the matters outlined in this report. In my opinion, in all material respects, the controls exercised by The University of Western Australia are sufficiently adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the receipt, expenditure and investment of money, the acquisition and disposal of property and the incurring of liabilities have been in accordance with legislative provisions during the year ended 31 December 2021. The University Senate's Responsibilities The University Senate is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining controls to ensure that the receipt, expenditure and investment of money, the acquisition and disposal of property, and the incurring of liabilities are in accordance with the Financial Management Act 2006, relevant Treasurer's Instructions and other relevant written law. Auditor General's Responsibilities As required by the Auditor General Act 2006 , my responsibility as an assurance practitioner is to express an opinion on the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve the overall control objectives, and the implementation of the controls as designed. I conducted my engagement in accordance with Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3150 Assurance Engagements on Controls issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that I comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform my procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, the controls are suitably designed to achieve the overall control objectives and the controls, necessary to achieve the overall control objectives were implemented as designed. An assurance engagement to report on the design and implementation of controls involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the suitability of the design of controls to achieve the overall control objectives, and the implementation of those controls. The procedures selected depend on my judgement, including the assessment of the risks that controls are not suitably designed or implemented as designed. My procedures included testing the implementation of those controls that I consider necessary to achieve the overall control objectives. I believe that the evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Limitations of Controls Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that, even if the controls are suitably designed and implemented as designed, once the controls are in operation, the overall control objectives may not be achieved so that fraud, error, or noncompliance with laws and regulations may occur and not be detected. Any projection of the outcome of the evaluation of the suitability of the design of controls to future periods is subject to the risk that the controls may become unsuitable because of changes in conditions.65 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au65 Page 4 of 5Report on the Key Performance Indicators Opinion I have undertaken a reasonable assurance engagement on the key performance indicators of The University of Western Australia for the year ended 31 December 2021. The key performance indicators are the key effectiveness indicators and the key efficiency indicators that provide performance information about achieving outcomes and delivering services. In my opinion, in all material respects, the key performance indicators of The University of Western Australia are relevant and appropriate to assist users to assess the University's performance and fairly represent indicated performance for the year ended 31 December 2021. The University Senate's Responsibilities for the Key Performance Indicators The University Senate is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the key performance indicators in accordance with the Financial Management Act 2006 and the Treasurer's Instructions, and for such internal control as it determines necessary to enable the preparation of key performance indicators that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the key performance indicators, the University Senate is responsible for identifying key performance indicators that are relevant and appropriate having regard to their purpose in accordance with Treasurer's Instruction 904U Key Performance Indicators. Auditor General's Responsibilities As required by the Auditor General Act 2006 , my responsibility as an assurance practitioner is to express an opinion on the key performance indicators. The objectives of my engagement are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the key performance indicators are relevant and appropriate to assist users to assess the University's performance, and whether the key performance indicators are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. I conducted my engagement in accordance with Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that I comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance engagements. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the key performance indicators. It also involves evaluating the relevance and appropriateness of the key performance indicators against the criteria and guidance in Treasurer's Instruction 904U for measuring the extent of outcome achievement and the efficiency of service delivery. The procedures selected depend on my judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the key performance indicators. In making these risk assessments I obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the engagement in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. I believe that the evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.66 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au Page 5 of 5My Independence and Quality Control Relating to the Reports on Controls and Key Performance Indicators I have complied with the independence requirements of the Auditor General Act 2006 and the relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance engagements. In accordance with ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, and Other Assurance Engagements, the Office of the Auditor General maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Other information The University Senate is responsible for the other information. The other information is the information in the entity's annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021, but not the financial statements, key performance indicators and my auditor's report. My opinions do not cover the other information and, accordingly, I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Matters Relating to the Electronic Publication of the Audited Financial Statements and Key Performance Indicators This auditor's report relates to the financial statements, controls and key performance indicators of The University of Western Australia for the year ended 31 December 2021 included on the University's website. The University's management is responsible for the integrity of the University's website. This audit does not provide assurance on the integrity of the University's website. The auditor's report refers only to the financial statements, controls and key performance indicators described above. It does not provide an opinion on any other information which may have been hyperlinked to/from these financial statements, controls or key performance indicators. If users of the financial statements, controls and key performance indicators are concerned with the inherent risks arising from publication on a website, they are advised to refer to the hard copy of the audited financial statements, controls and key performance indicators to confirm the information contained in this website version of the financial statements, controls and key performance indicators.

Where modification is required and has a material or significant financial effect upon the reported results, details of that modification and the resulting financial effect aredisclosed in the notes to the financial statements. COVID-19 The Group continued to take active measures, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and national health ministries, to preserve the health and well-being of our staff and students, including online teaching and assessments, working from home, overseas learning centres, and rigorous cleaning and sanitation. These measures will remain under review as the Group continue d to respond to the ongoing impact of COVID-19. At this stage, the impact of COVID-19 has not been significant, given the University received $44m additional Education research grant funding from the Australian government in 2021 to support the impact of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on future performance, will inform our capacity to respond to the challenges ahead and the active measure s required to be taken to preserve liquidity. At this stage, the Group has sufficient cash reserves to meet our obligations as and when they become due and payable. We will continue to follow the various government policies and advice and, in parallel, we will do our utmost to continue our operations in the best andsafest waypossible without jeopardising the health of our staff and students.

Previously reportedAdjustment Restated Previously 1,982,378 Consolidated University 1 January 2020The University is liable to pay Payroll Tax, and it is included in 'Employee related expenses' in the Income Statement. Intangible assetsRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except: Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.Where the GST incurred ona purchase of goods and services isnotrecoverable from the taxation authority, then the GST isrecognised aspart of the cost of acquisition or as part of the expense item as applicable; and The netamount ofGST recoverable from, authority isincluded aspart ofreceivables orpayables inthe Statement of Financial Position. The GST component ofcash flows arising from investing andfinancing activities, which are recoverable from orpayable tothe taxation authority, is classified as an operating cash flow. Foreign currency transactions are initially translated into Australian currency at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, amounts payable and receivable in foreign currencies are translated to Australian currency at rates of exchange at that date. Non-monetary items held at the reporting date are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction. Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the income statement. Chang esto significant accounting policy and correction of aprior period error (i) Change in Accounting policy forSoftware as a Service (SaaS) arrangement In April 2021, the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) issued a final agenda decision for configuration and customisation costs incurred related to a SaaS arrangement. The Group has changed its accounting policy in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing a SaaS arrangement. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of changing this policy is described below. The Group's accounting policy has historically been to capitalise all costs related to the configuration of SaaS arrangements as intangible assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The adoption of the above IFRS IC agenda decision resulted in a reclassification of these intangible assets to recognition of an expense in the Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income. Thechange in policy has been retrospectively applied andcomparative financial information has been restated. Thenew accountin g policyis presente d in No te5.4.The University is liable to pay Fringe Benefits Tax, and it is included in 'Employee related expenses' in the Income Statement. During 2021, the Group identified an error in the application of AASB 15 for research grants, which was initially adopted in 2020. As a consequence, research income was overstated and contract liabilities were understated. The error has been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior period. The following tables summarises the impact of the change in significant accounting policy and correction of prior period error on the Groups financial statements.

The Group's management made a judgement that the two distributions by EAL in 2021 represent in substance a return of the EAL investment as they result from EAL's restructure and intended winding up. The delay in the winding up of EAL is due to common legal/ administrative processes including settlement of tax liabilities. Therefore, the University has accounted for the value of the consideration received from the two distributions (being IDP shares, cash and the associated franking credits) as the recovery of the carrying amount of the EAL investment without any impact on the statement of comprehensive income. The Group has accounted for the EAL and IDP holdings as Other Financial Assets at fair valued through the profit and loss in accordance with its accounting policy. The value of consideration from the EAL restructure received from the two distributions (being IDP shares, cash and the associated franking credits) has been recorded at fair value through profit and loss.

Changes in these estimations andassumptions may impact on the carrying amount of the long service leave provision.Annual leave is classified as a current provision as the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period, however the liability is not expected to be settled in full within twelve months of the reporting period. The annual leave liability is recognised and measured at the present value of amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, a sclosely a spossible, the estimated future cash outflows. Purchased leave The Group entered into an Employee Agreement Variation in July 2020, which included the requirement for staff to purchase leave as part of the response to COVID-19. Leave taken in excess of purchase leave payment at the reporting date is off-set against employee provision. Other provisions Other provisions comprise of provision made for separation and redundancy benefits payments and other employment on-costs. The Group recognises a provision for redundancy when it has developed a formal plan and informed employee. The termination benefits are measured based on the number of employee expected to accept the offer.

The information about the credit exposures are disclosed in Note 6.4 Financial Risk Management For trade receivables the Group applies a simplified approach incalculating expected credit losses (ECLs). Therefore, the Group does not track changes incredit risk, butinstead recognises a loss allowance based onlifetime ECLs ateach reporting date. The Group hasestablished a provision matrix that isbased onits historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.The Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with its trade and other receivables on a forward-looking basis. COVID-19 has not had a material impact on the loss allowances recognised at the end of the period. Accounting policy Trade receivables are held to collect contractual cash flows and give rise to cash flows representing solely payments of principal and interest. These are classified and measured as debt instruments at amortised cost. Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 14 day sfrom the date of recognition. Contract assets Contract asset are revenue receivables andrepresent right topayment for goods and services orresearch andnon-research output that have been delivered butconsiderations have not been received as at reporting date. This arises where expenditure has occurred under a research and/or non-research grant and the grant funds have not yet been received.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS91 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au91 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2021 5.2 Other non-financial assets Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 $'000 assets 24,795 26,798 26,527 Accounting policy 5.3 Investment 2020 2021 2020 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 At at 1 January 34,958 32,072 34,958 32,072 Net 2,886 3,589 2,886 Capitalised subsequent expenditure 323 - 323 Closing balance at 31 December 38,870 34,958 38,870 34,958 For fair value hierarchy categorisation of investment properties see Note 6.5. Accounting policy Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Valuation of investment properties The Group carried its investment properties atfair value with changes inthe fair values recognised inthe income statement. It obtains independent valuations atleast annually. Attheend of the reporting period the Group updates its assessment ofthe fair value ofeach property, taking into account the most recent valuations. Where aninvestment property isacquired at no cost orfor nominal consideration, its cost shall be deemed to be its fair value as at the date of acquisition.The Group recognises a prepayment as an asset when the payments for goods and services have been made inadvance ofthe Group obtaining a right to access those goods and services.Advances and prepayments include $4.6 million of prepayments for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (2020: $6.5 million). Initially, investment properties are measured atcost including transaction costs. Subsequent toinitial recognition, investment properties are stated atfair value determined annually by an external valuer. Any gains orlosses arising from changes inthe fair values of investment properties are included in the income statement in the year in which they arise. Fair value consists ofthe amounts for which properties could beexchanged between willing parties inanarm's length transaction, based on comparable market transactions.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS92 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2021 5.4 Intangible assets Consolidated and University SoftwareSoftware work in progressElectronic library resources Total $'000 $'000 amortisation and impairment (11,681) - Net effect of change in accounting policy (3,336) (5,802) - (9,138) Restated net book value 2,632 1,657 29,307 33,596 Year ended 31 December 2020 (Restated) Restated opening net book value 2,632 1,657 29,307 book value 3,727 1,675 24,733 30,135 At 31 Accumulated amortisation 1,675 24,733 30,135 Year 1,401 26,406 Accounting policy The amortisation rate policy is as follows: Asset Class Amortisation rate Amortisation method Software 20% Straight line Electronic library resources 10% Straight line Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Note 1.3 describes the Group accounting policy in respect of customisation and configuration costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements. In the process of applying the Group accounting policy, management has made the following judgements: (i) Determining whether cloud computing arrangements contain a software licence intangible asset The Group evaluates cloud computing arrangements to determine if it provides a resource that the Group can control. The Group determines that a software licence intangible asset exists in a cloud computing arrangement when both of the following are met at the inception of the arrangement: The Group has the contractual right to take possession of the software during the hosting period without significant penalty. It is feasible for the Group to run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the supplier to host the software. (ii) Capitalisation of configuration and customisation costs in SaaS arrangements Where the Group incurs costs to configure or customise SaaS arrangements and such costs are considered to enhance current on- premise software or provide code that can be used by the Group in other arrangements, the Group applies judgement to assess whether such costs result in the creation of an intangible asset that meets the definition and recognition criteria in AASB 138 Intangible Assets.Impairment testing is performed when an indicator of impairment is identified.Software Software includes both acquired and internally generated software, and isstated athistoric cost less amortisation and, where applicable, any impairment losses. Electronic library resources Electronic library resources can becategorised into perpetual access and annual subscriptions. Perpetual access based resources are capitalised and amortised 10 per cent annually over 10 years. Annual subscriptions are expensed as incurred.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS93 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au93NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5.5 Property, plant and equipment Freehold Leasehold Buildings Work in Plant and Artworks Library Right of Special Total land land progress equipment books Use Assets collections 420 202 2,120 113 57,148 - - (300) (138) (101) (308) - - - (847) - - (25,188) - (19,877) - (961) (1,206) - (47,232) (89) - (2,517) (874) - - - - - (3,480) - - 97,560 (98,746) 1,186 - - (496,742) (2,143) 388 49 47,465 (7,729) - (540) - (168) - - - - (8,437) - - (26,090) - (19,749) - (763) (892) - (47,494) 455 - (747) - - - - - - (292) - - 2,179 (2,999) 820 - - - - - (376) - - - - - - - - (376) (225) - (87) - - - - - - (312) 177,903 80,000 (874) - - - - (21,018) (38,689)Consolidated At 1 January 2020 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value Yearended 31 December 2020 Opening net book value Additions Disposals Depreciation Impairment Transfer in/(out) Closi ngnet book value At 31 December 2020 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value Yearended 31 December 2021 Opening net book value Additions Disposals Depreciation Impairment Transfer in/(out) Adjustment Transfer of carrying amount to assets he ldfor sale Closi ngnet book value At 31 December 2021 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value 907,123 53,323 57,954 29,783 31 December 2021NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS94 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.auNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5.5 Property, plant and equipment Freehold Leasehold Buildings Work in Plant and Artworks Library Right of Special Total land land progress equipment books Use Assets collections 202 1,964 113 56,570 - - (295) - (43) - - - - (338) - - (25,105) - (19,621) - (961) (1,189) - (46,876) (89) - (2,517) (874) - - - - - (3,480) - - 97,432 (98,617) 1,185 - - (493,649) (2,143) 49 47,027 (7,729) - (540) - (168) - - - - (8,437) - - (26,084) - (19,365) - (763) (876) - (47,088) 455 - (747) - - - - - - (292) - - 2,179 (2,999) 820 - - - - - (376) - - - - - - - - (376) (225) - (87) - - - - - - (312) 177,903 (874) - - - - (21,018) (38,689)University At 1 January 2020 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value Yearended 31 December 2020 Opening net book value Additions Disposals Depreciation Impairment Transfer in/(out) Closi ngnet book value At 31 December 2020 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value Yearended 31 December 2021 Opening net book value Additions Disposals Depreciation Impairment Transfer in/(out) Adjustment Transfer of carrying amount to assets he ldfor sale Closi ngnet book value At 31 December 2021 Cost Accumulated depreciation Accumulated impairment Net book value 906,686 53,180 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au95 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accounting policy The depreciation rate policy is as follows: Asset Class Depreciation rate Depreciation method Leasehold land Not depreciated Not depreciated Freehold land Not depreciated Not depreciated Buildings: Structure/shell/building fabric 2% Reducing balance Fixtures, fittings and central plant 5% Straight line Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease Straight line Plant and equipment Computer hardware and audio visual 25% Straight line General plant and equipment 12.5% Straight line Motor vehicles 17.4% Straight line Library books 10% Straight line Artworks Not depreciated Not depreciated Special collections Not depreciated Not depreciated Impairment of assets Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Property, plant and equipment Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Impairment Assets areassessed annually for impairment.

Where an asset isacquired at no cost orfor a nominal cost, the cost recorded isthe fair value ofthe asset atthe acquisition date. Cultural assets where the fair value or economic benefit cannot be reliably measured are not ascribed a value.

Allother repairs andmaintenance arecharged tothe income bytheGroup areclassified asnon-current assets. potential isnot, inanymaterial sense, consumed. Assuch, noamount for depreciation is recognised. Work in progress assets are not depreciated until construction has been completed and the asset is available for use. Assets' residual values anduseful lives arereviewed ateach balance sheet date. Gains andlosses ondisposal arerecorded inthe income statement for the year. Impairment testing is performed when an indicator of impairment is identified. The carrying amount of an asset isderecognised when disposed of or when nofuture economic benefits areexpected from its use or disposal. Where the cost ofa replacement part of an item isrecognised as part of an asset (orasa separate asset), the Group derecognises the carrying amount of the replaced part regardless of whether it had been depreciated separately. Where it is not practicable for the Group to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the cost of the replacement is used as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time of acquisition or construction. Assets that have anindefinite useful life aretested annually for impairment. Assets with a finite life aretested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Animpairment loss isrecognised for the amount bywhich the asset's carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount isthehigher of its fair value less costs ofdisposal andits value inuse. AstheGroup isa not-for-profit entity, if the future economic benefits ofthe asset are not primarily dependent on its ability togenerate netcash flows, unless the asset has been identified as surplus, the value in use is its depreciated replacement cost. Property, plant and equipment andintangible assets aredepreciated/amortised over their useful lives taking into account anyresidual values where appropriate. The useful lives ofthe assets andresidual values (where appropriate) are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number offactors. Inassessing asset lives, factors such astechnological innovation, wear andtearandmaintenance programs aretaken into account. Anincrease (decrease) inasset lives would result ina lower (higher) future period charge recognised in the income statement.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS96 The University of Western Australia | uwa.edu.au NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2021 Right-of-use assets Consolidated University 2021 2020 Buildings $'000 1 January 1,459 510 1,319 510 Additions of right-of-use assets 347 2,120 347 1,964 Depreciation charge (857) (1,171) (841) (1,155) At 31 December 949 1,459 825 1,319 Right-of-use asset - Equipment At 1 January 5 39 5 39 Additions of right-of-use assets 40 - 40 - Depreciation charge (35) (34) (35) (34) At 31 December 10 5 10 5 Accounting policy Leases 5.6 Trade and other payables Consolidated University 2021 Accounting policy Payables represent liabilities forgoods or services incurred on or before the reporting date. Trade payables areinitially recorded at fair value andsubsequently recorded atamortised cost. Due tothe short duration andother terms ofpayment these amounts usually equate to cost.Right-of-use assets predominately relate to long-term property leases. Assessment of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease Atinception ofa contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, orcontains, a lease. A contract is, orcontains, a lease ifthe contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group assesses whether: a. The contract involves the use of an identified asset. The asset may be explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract. b.The customer hastheright toobtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use ofthe asset throughout the period of use. c. The customer has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use. The customer is considered to have the right to direct the use of the asset only if either: i. The customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use; or ii. The relevant decisions about how and for what purposes the asset is used is predetermined and the customer has the right to operate the asset, or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use. Accounting for l eases - Group as lessee In contracts where the Group is a lessee, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of thelease, unless t heshort-term orlow-v alue exempt ionis applied. Right-of-u seasset A right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received); plus initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located, orrestoring theunderly ingasset t helease. A right-of-use asset associated with land and buildings is subsequently measured at cost. All other property, plant and equipment are meas ured as desc ribed plant andequipment. Concessionar y(peppercorn )leases Leased assets arising from significantly below market leases are measured at cost at the inception of the lease whereas the lease liability is recognised at present value of peppercorn lease payment amounts. The difference between the right-of-use asset and lease liability is recorded as income inthe income statement under AASB 1058. The Group has elected to measure a class (or classes) of right-of-use assets arising under 'concessionary leases' at initial recognition at cost, in accordance with AASB 16 paragraphs 23-25, which incorporates the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS97 2021 Financial Report | uwa.edu.au97 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2021 5.7 Contract and other liabilities Consolidated University 2021Restated 2020 2021Restated 2020 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 14,510 Student fees and other liabilities 219,344 188,275 218,038 185,416 Other funds held for outside parties that do not qualify for recognition in the financial statements 5.8 Other Provisions Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Current Other Provisions 3,000 90 3,000 90 3,000 90 3,000 90 Refer to note 3.2 for an understanding of the Groups Employee Benefit provisions.

The lease liability isremeasured when there arechanges infuture lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. The adjustment amount is factored into depreciation of the right-of-use asset prospectively. Right-of-use assets arepresented within property, plant 5.5andlease liabilities arepresented asborrowings in Note TheGroup recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Borrowings Borrowings arerecognised initially atfairvalue netoftransaction costs that aredirectly attributable toitsissue. After initial recognition, borrowings aresubsequently measured atamortised cost using theEffective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses arerecognised intheincome EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date and does not expect to settle the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Borrowing costs incurred fortheconstruction ofanyqualifying asset arecapitalised during theperiod oftime that isrequired to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.

Since the reporting date, global financial markets have experienced a high degree of volatility in response to continuing COVID-19 pandemic concerns and global political tensions. Further, the Group's holding in IDP Education Ltd has subsequently fallen as the market responded to lower than expected half year results. Collectively, these events have resulted in a 4.5% reduction in carrying value of Other Financial Assets, representing a $58m unrealised loss on investments between the end of the reporting period and the date of this authorised report. The Group continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic situation and will take further action as necessary in response to any economic disruption.
