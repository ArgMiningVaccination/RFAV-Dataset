Scripps Florida Funding Corporation Annual Report 2010 Appendix 1, \"Economi c Impact Analysis \" The Economic Impacts of Scripps Florida on Florida's Economy October 1, 2009 - September 30, 2010 Prepared by the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. for the Scripps Florida Funding Corporation Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 The analyses for the first four fiscal years were conducted by Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI), while the fifth and sixth fiscal years analyses were conducted by the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. (BDB), and this analysis will follow a similar format as that established by EFI to address Subsection 14(e) of the Scripps Florida Funding Corporation's (SFFC) Annual Report to the Florida Governor and Legislature. This analysis was conducted by the staff of the BDB at the request of SFFC. It is based on information and data provided to the BDB from SFFC and uses the IMPLAN economic impact model, as was used in prior analyses by EFI and the BDB. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the quantifiable economic impacts of Scripps Florida's activities in the State of Florida during its seventh fiscal year in operation, based on the expenditures made by Scripps Florida or its partners, Palm Beach County and Florida Atlantic University. As previously stated, this report follows a similar format as the one established by EFI in initial analyses. As such, this report will include sections that provide information on economic impact analysis and the model, IMPLAN, used to estimate impacts, the methodology used to conduct this analysis, results of the IMPLAN model, and a brief description of the impacts that this analysis does not attempt to estimate. Economic Impact Analysis Using IMPLAN Economic impact analysis estimates the changes in economic output (gross domestic product), employment, personal income (labor compensation and proprietors' income), property income (rents), and tax revenues that result from changes in demand for products or services in a given study area (referred to as an event). Impacts can be measured for zip codes, counties, states, or the entire country.This analysis makes no attempt to project future economic impacts or benefits on the State of Florida or Palm Beach County, nor does it attempt to estimate or project non-quantifiable benefits or impacts to Florida or Palm Beach County.Purpose: Estimate the economic impacts of the activities of the Scripps Florida facility on the State of Florida during its seventh fiscal year of operation that covers the period October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010.The Economic Impacts of Scripps Florida on Florida's Economy October 1, 2009 - September 30, 2010 This analysis is designed to fulfill the requirements of Subsection 14(e) of the 2010 Scripps Florida Funding Corporation Annual Report to the State of Florida Governor and Legislature.Introduction Page 2 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 Second, there are three rounds of effects that are analyzed. Each round is classified as a separate category or effect. The first round produces the direct effects , which include the economic impacts to the four categories stated above that result from the facilities-related activities and operations of Scripps Florida itself, such as the number of jobs created by Scripps to work in the new facility or the change in employment by the companies hired by Scripps to provide goods or services. Next come the indirect effects , which include interindustry changes in demand resulting from the facilities-related activities and operation of Scripps or the goods and services required by companies hired by Scripps for the facilities or operations. Lastly, the induced effects are measured, which are the increases in economic activity stemming from the expenditures by the households of the employees hired by Scripps or the companies used for the facilities-related activities and operations or businesses indirectly influenced by the presence of Scripps.Due to the importance of Scripps Florida to the State of Florida, as being a world class research institute that has positioned Florida as an emerging focal point for the life sciences, this analysis will estimate the economic impacts to the entire State of Florida resulting from Scripps Florida operations. However, the majority of the benefits from Scripps Florida are likely concentrated in Palm Beach County and the surrounding region. The IMPLAN model is a recognized industry leader in the United States and is used by many organizations from federal agencies to private consultants for economic impact analysis. This analysis uses many of the default settings and features of the standard IMPLAN model. In accordance with the circumstances stipulated by Scripps Florida and in keeping with the format of prior analyses by EFI, this analysis reports the economic impacts of Scripps Florida in two different categories. First, the IMPLAN model quantifies four categories of impacts: employment ; personal income ; economic output (gross domestic product); and tax revenues . Employment refers to the number of full-time jobs created in the study area due to the presence of Scripps Florida. Personal Income includes all forms of labor compensation and proprietors' income that are injected into the economy of the study area as a result of Scripps Florida. Economic Output (Gross Domestic Product) is the increased amount of total economic output in the study area that results from the change in employment and value added created by the presence of Scripps. Lastly, tax revenues refer to the additional fiscal revenues generated by state and local governments (such as sales taxes, property taxes, and other excise taxes and fees) resulting from the increased economic activity due to Scripps. Page 3 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 Methodology The results of an economic impact analysis are reliant upon the primary data and assumptions used in the model. In this analysis, the BDB has relied on data provided by the Scripps Florida Funding Corporation. The data provided include all known expenditures by Scripps Florida and its partners (Palm Beach County and Florida Atlantic University) during the fiscal year October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010. All expenditures data obtained were input into the IMPLAN model, with the appropriate NAICS- based IMPLAN industry codes for each line item expenditure. The line items were then aggregated based on their features to achieve the quantifiable impacts mentioned in the previous section.The presence of direct effects, indirect effects, and induced effects result from what is referred to as the multiplier effect . The multiplier effect occurs, because every time a purchase is made in any sector of the economy, additional spending is created through direct, indirect, and induced effects. This happens over and over many times. Essentially, when one person or company spends money, it enables another person or company to spend money and so on, creating a chain of new spending by other people or companies. Previous analyses estimated a third category that distinguished between the Scripps Florida's Operational Impacts and Facility-Related Impacts. However, this analysis focuses only on the operations, since construction was completed prior to the beginning of the fiscal year under analysis. Scripps Florida's Operational Impacts. These impacts result from the operations of Scripps Florida during its seventh fiscal year. The operational impacts include Scripps payroll expenditures (for scientists and professional and support staff), expenditures for laboratory equipment, office supplies, information technology, utilities, and various other business services and operational expenses. Page 4 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 No data on actual job creation by Scripps Florida's activities were provided, and therefore no employment data were input into the IMPLAN model. However, expenditures for salaries and benefits were provided by Scripps, and these were included in the model using the IMPLAN industry code for payroll compensation, which allowed the model to estimate direct employment levels throughout the fiscal year. Therefore the estimated employment impacts generated by IMPLAN should be interpreted as the average annual full-time employment created in the State of Florida in various occupations and companies due to the presence of Scripps Florida, and may in fact not be the actual employment of Scripps Florida or any other entity affected by the presence of Scripps at any time during the fiscal year analyzed. Since this analysis is focused on the single fiscal year of October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010, the IMPLAN model does not attempt to differentiate between recurring and one-time impacts. As stated previously, Scripps moved into its permanent facilities during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, so any jobs or other impacts associated with the construction and design of Scripps permanent facility will likely diminish or disappear entirely in future years. Additionally, impacts associated with the operations of the Scripps facility can recur each year. However, this study is only concerned with impacts in fiscal year 2009-10. This analysis relied upon the default assumptions built into the IMPLAN model. This analysis used the assumptions in the IMPLAN model to determine the amount of expenditures and activity that affected the State of Florida due to the presence of Scripps Florida by estimating the amount of goods and services that are demanded from domestic sources versus sources in other states. The data used for the IMPLAN model's assumptions are derived from US Federal Government databases. Fiscal impacts were also estimated by the IMPLAN model, which differentiates between federal and state and local tax revenues. This analysis maintains the state and local tax revenue impacts established in the previous analyses by EFI. In previous analyses, EFI assumed that all tax revenues obtained through vehicle licensing fees go to the State of Florida, whereas property taxes are paid to local governments. The sales tax receipts are split between the state and local governments, where the State of Florida receives 92.3 percent of all sales tax revenue and the local governments receive anything above that due to the local option of an additional 0.5 percent above the six percent State of Florida Sales and Use Tax. The IMPLAN model does not differentiate the split in sales tax, so it is possible that the amount of sales tax collected is overstated for the State of Florida and understated for the counties and municipalities. Page 5 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 The primary expenditures data provided by Scripps Florida Funding Corporation (SFFC) for use in the IMPLAN model are provided in the table below.

The results that follow illustrate the total economic impacts to the State of Florida due to the presence of Scripps Florida in Palm Beach County, based on the data provided by the SFFC. Page 6 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 Direct Indirect Induced Total 69 40 181 290 69 40 181 activities of Scripps Florida and the companies it hired for services were directly responsible for contributing to an influx of $7,936,882 of personal income into Florida's economy. Indirect and Induced. The multiplier effect led to an additional $14,777,097 in personal income in the Florida economy.Employment Impact. The presence of Scripps Florida assisted in sustaining an estimated 290 jobs statewide. It is important to note that those jobs were not necessarily created during the FY 2009-2010, where some may have carried over from previous fiscal years, while some were also created during the fiscal year of the study. Therefore, it would not be correct to add results from previous fiscal years' analyses to this one. It is also important to note that many of the scientists at Scripps Florida get outside funding for salaries and staff that do not appear in this analysis, therefore there are likely more jobs that are sustained by Scripps Florida than what appear in this analysis. Direct. This analysis reports the total direct impacts. During the SFFC's Fiscal Year 2009-2010, Scripps Florida had a total direct employment impact of 69 full-time jobs. Indirect and Induced. An additional 221 jobs were supported throughout Florida as a result of indirect and induced effects from Scripps Florida's operations. Income Impact. The total personal income impact of Scripps in the SFFC's seventh fiscal year was $22,713,979.Type of ImpactThe Economic Impacts of Scripps Florida on the State of Florida, SFFC's FY 2009-2010 Operational Output (Gross Domestic Product)Employment Impact OperationalPersonal Income Impact Each of the impact types are summarized below.Breakdown of Tax Revenues Between State & Local Gov't State of Florida Local Governments (County & Municipal) Operational Tax Revenues Operational Note: The estimated totals may not add up exactly due to rounding off to the nearest whole dollar or employee. Page 7 Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc. December 2010 This analysis has focused on the economic impacts of Scripps Florida on the economy of the State of Florida during SFFC's seventh fiscal year of activities, October 1, 2009 - September 30, 2010. It is important to note that the IMPLAN model can only estimate the quantifiable economic impacts, such as employment, personal income, output, and tax revenues, to a geographical area based on changes in demand for goods or services caused by an event. Therefore, the model is not capable of measuring the qualitative economic benefits of an event, such as the presence of Scripps Florida, that could positively affect the economy of Florida. While the qualitative benefits are important, they may only become evident after a number of years or may influence quantifiable impacts in future analyses.The approximate breakdown between estimated tax revenues for the State of Florida and the local governments was: State Taxes. The estimated tax revenues that went to the State of Florida as a result of Scripps Florida were $825,100. Local Taxes. The estimated tax revenues that went to the local governments (county and municipal) in Florida as a result of Scripps Florida were $1,456,632. Economic Impacts Outside of the ModelIndirect and Induced. The multiplier effect led to the addition of $26,896,557 to Florida's GDP. Fiscal Impact. The total estimated fiscal revenues to State and local governments due to the presence of Scripps Florida in its seventh fiscal year amounted to $2,281,732. Direct. The operational activities of Scripps Florida directly contributed to an estimated $821,701 in tax revenues to state and local governments. Indirect and Induced. The multiplier effect from the activities of Scripps Florida led to an additional $1,460,031 in estimated tax revenues for state and local governments.Output (Gross Domestic Product) Impact. Scripps Florida added $40,152,589 to Florida's gross domestic product (GDP). Direct. The operational activities of Scripps Florida directly contributed to adding $13,256,032 to Florida's GDP.

The BDB's Life Science Strategic Steering Group (LSSSG) met several times throughout the year to monitor the development of the industry, to begin to articulate a value proposition for Palm Beach County's cluster of compa nies and to learn about new funding sources that became available throughout the year. BDB made companies throughout the region aware of an initiative under the health reform that passed Congress that awarded companies R&D tax credits or grants for innova tive programs that could contribute to the curing of cancer, or the lowering of the price of pharmaceuticals. BDB staff attended BIO 2010 in Chicago, IL in collaboration with BioFlorida, Enterprise Florida and area companies. Meetings were held with co mpanies from many different countries and regions of the US to discuss the possibility of relocation or expansion into Palm Beach County. The trend of this trade show/convention has been toward more economic development officials being represented on the floor of the convention as opposed to scientists and corporate leaders and thus, the BDB is looking for more effective ways of reaching its target audience for 2011 and beyond. BDB staff took part in the planning of BioFlorida's annual conference to take place in Fort Lauderdale in October 2010. The Business Development Board's continuous efforts in making Palm Beach County an attractive place for life science companies to relocate to and expand in paid off in 2010. The BDB worked with six companies est ablished their corporate offices in Palm Beach County in the life science space: Institute for Healthy Living, Life Science & Research Jupiter 220 jobs ChemPep Wellington 5 jobs Woodfield Distribution Boca Raton 39 jobs CHS Pharma Jupiter 25 jobs GLG Pharma Jupiter 4 jobs SurgiTrace Boca Raton 39 jobs Throughout Palm Beach County the county and municipal governments have maintained their interest in developing a sustainable life science cluster and the BDB has engaged with many partners to ensure that infrastructure is developed to create an attractive environment for entrepreneurs to establish their life science (and other) companies while creating high paying jobs and creating new inventions to better the human condition. In particular, BDB staff continued to support the staff of the Town of Jupiter in its efforts to nurture the life sciences around Scripps Florida and Max Pla nck. The Town established a $3 million fund in 2006 and has loaned money to companies in the industry after an application process and review by an Scripps Florida Funding Corpor ation 9 Annual Report 2009 Appendix 2, \"Assessment of Factors Affecting the Progress Toward Achieving the Projected Biotech Industry C luster\" Advisory Board.

Scripps Florida Funding Corpor ation 10 Annual Report 2009 Appendix 2, \"Assessment of Factors Affecting the Progress Toward Achieving the Projected Biotech Industry C luster\" Economic Development PBSC's Biotechnology Prog ram is embarking on its second economic development projec t with the Town of Jupiter. PBS C acquired funding from the Town of Jupiter Economic Development Fund to crea te a technology incubator at PBS C's Palm Beach Gardens campus. Under this pilot program, the College provides laboratory space and equipment for scientists to perform proof -of- concept experiments and conduct business start -up ac tivities. PBS C hosted its first tenant, ACAM Laboratories, a microbiology food testing service pr ovider in 2009 and is presently negotiating its second contract with a local biotechnology company . Town of Jupiter Economic Development Fund In 2006, the Town of Jupiter established a $3 million economic development fund in support of an interlocal agreement with Palm Beach County. The fund's purpo se is to support economic development and growth that generates jobs for north county residents. Following the establishment of the fund, Jupiter's Town Council also established an advisory board, which provides recommendations regarding the distribution of the funds . The Board oversees funding for the Northern Palm Beaches (Mangonia Park, Riviera Beach, Jupiter, North Palm Beach, Palm Beach Gardens, Lake Park). The eight member Board meets monthly to review applications and monitor progress on companies which were supported by the fund. To date, the fund has loaned $2 ,107,500 to nine companies. Three additional loans are pending. Thirteen companies were reviewed by the Board and were rejected or are on hold.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of Scripps Florida Fund ing Corporation. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordan ce with U.S. generally accepted au diting standards and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial report ing of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also incl udes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statemen ts, assessing the accounting principl es used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonabl e basis for our opinions. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities and ma jor fund of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation as of September 30, 2010, and the respective changes in financial position for th e year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated November 22, 2010 on our consideration of the internal control over financial reporting of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to desc ribe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance an d the results of that testing, an d not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on complianc e. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.

November 22, 2010 2 3 Management's Discuss ion and Analysis Acting in our capacity as the management of Scri pps Florida Funding Corporation (\"SFFC\"), we offer readers of SFFC's financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of th e financial activities of SFFC as of and for the year ended September 30, 201 0 . S F F C i s g o v e r n e d b y a n i n e m e m b e r B o a r d o f Directors, three of whom are appointed by the Gove rnor of the State of Florida, three of whom are appointed by the President of the Senate of the State of Florida, and three of whom are appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the St ate of Florida. For financial reporting purposes, management determined that SFFC should be reported as a governmental organization and a component unit of the State of Flor ida based on the appointment of the Board of Directors by officials of State government. Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-and Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments requires the presentation of certain comparative information for the current and prior year in the Management Discussion and Analysis. Financial Highlights The assets o f SFFC exceeded its liabilities at September 30, 2010 by $68,039,221 ( net assets). SFFC's total assets were $73,633,308 at September 30, 2010. Net assets of $68,000,002 are attributable to the unexpended portion of a federal grant of $ 310 million and investment earnings thereon and are restricted for future grants to The Scripps Rese arch Institute for development of a biomedical research center in Palm Beach County, Florida. As of September 30, 2010, the General Fund of SFFC reported ending fund balance of $68,039,221. Of this total amount, $68,000,002 is committed to funding The Scripps Research Institute project ( reserved fund balance ), $13,199 is reserved for prepaid items and $26,020 is designated for spending in the subsequent year's budget ( designated fund balance ). Overview of the Financial Statements This di scussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to SFFC's basic financial statements. The basic financial statements of SFFC include three components: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial statements, and (3) no tes to the financial statements. This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves. Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of SFFC's finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business. The statement of net assets presents information on all of SFFC's assets and liabilities, with the difference between the two reported as net assets. Over time, increases or decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of SFFC is improving or deteriorating. The statement of activities presents information showing how SFFC's net assets changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net asset are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flow. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods. The government-wide financial statements present functions of SFFC that are principally supported by federal funds passed through from the State of Fl orida to finance SFFC's mission of promoting, developing and advancing the economic welfare of Florida through the establishment and operation of a 4 biomedical research institution and campus by The Scripps Research Institute ( governmental activities ). The governmental activities of SFFC include all General Fund functions. SFFC has no business-type activities that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 8 and 9 of this report. Fund financial statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific acti vities or objectives. SFFC , like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure an d demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. SFFC utiliz es only one fund, the General Fund , which is classified as a governmental fund and accounts for all financial resources of SFFC. Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentia lly the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statem ents. However, unlike the government- wide financial statements, the governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a government's near-ter m financing requirements. Because the focus of governmental funds is narro wer than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to comp are the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of SFFC's near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the government al fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between the governmental fund and governmental activities . SFFC adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund. A budgetary comparison schedule has been provided on page 16 for the General Fund to demonstrate compliance with this budget. The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 8 and 9 of this report. Explanations of the reconciling items between the gove rnmental fund and the governmental activities can be found in Note D on page 15. Notes to the financial statements. The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the governme nt-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 10-15 of this report. Other information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary information concerning SFFC's budget to actual results for the General Fund for the current year. Required supplem entary information can be found on pages 16-17 of this report. Government-wide Financial Analysis As noted ea rlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government's financial position. In the case of SFFC, assets exceeded liabilities by $68,039,221 at September 30, 2010. By far, the largest portion of SFFC's total assets (99.6 percent) are restricted assets held by the State Board of Administration on behalf of S FFC for future disbursements to The Scripps Research Institute for the development of a biomedical research institutio n and campus in Palm Beach County, Florida. 5 Net Assets 2010 2009 Assets Ca sh and other current assets Investments and other restricted assets $ 263,140 73,370,168 $ 223,001 102,353,741 Total assets $ 73,633,308 $ 102,576,742 Liabilities Current liabilities Liabilities payable from restricted assets Total liabilities $ 1,631 5,592,456 $ 5,594,087 $ 917 8,171,160 $ 26,711 Total net assets $ 68,039,221 $ 94,404,665 The decrease in restricted investments is a result of payments to The Scripps Research Institute in 2010. The largest portion of SFFC's net assets ( restricted net assets) represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. Thes e restrictions require the funds to be used for the development of a biomedical research institution and campus by The Scripps Research Institute. SFFC's unrestricted net assets of $39,219 relate to the unspent portion of funds appropriated by the Florida Legislature for the administrative expenses of SFFC. At the end of the current fiscal year, SFFC reported positive balances in both categories of net assets. Governmental activities. Governmental activities decreased SFFC's net assets by $26,365,444 in 2010 and by $34,205,588 in 2009. Key elements of this change are as follows. Changes in Net Assets 2010 2009 Revenues Inve stment income Securities lending income Contributed services $ 1,746,001 0 17,500 $ 5,675,826 125,335 17,500 Total revenues 1,763,501 5,818,661 Expenses Gene ral government Economic development grant to The Scripps Research Institute $ 178,281 27,950,664 $ 190,789 39,739,500 Total expenses 28,128,945 40,024,249 Change in net assets (26,365,444) (34,205,588) Net assets - beginning of year Net assets - end of year 94,404,665 $ 68,039,221 128,610,253 $ 94,404,665 6 Investment income includes the earnings from the in vestment of the federal grant in U.S. Government securities, a money market mutual fund and securities lending income through the State Board of Administration (the \"SBA\"). During 2009 the SFFC Board of Directors requested that the SBA terminate the securities lending program for its investment portfolio. The securities lending program was terminated and the collateral pool securities were li quidated in February 2009. SFFC incurred a loss of approximately $105,000 on the disposition of the collateral securities, which was included in investment income for 2009. For the most part, general government expenses were primarily professional fees associated with the grant monitoring responsibilities of SFFC and administrative expenses, such as rent. The economic development expense includes the grant funding SFFC provided to The Scripps Research Institute in connection with the development of the biomedical research institution and campus in Palm Beach County, Florida. Due to delays in finalizing a site for The Scripps Research Institute's permanent facilities in Palm Beach County, SFFC and The Scripps Research Institute agreed to amend the Operating and Funding Agreement in 2007 to modify the future annual amounts of the grant payments and extend the time period for disbursement of the grant funds from a term ending December 31, 2010 to a term ending December 31, 2013. The total disbursements to The Scripps Research Institute over the term of the Operating and Funding Agreement did not change. Financial Analysis of the Government's Funds As noted ea rlier, SFFC uses fund accounting to en sure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. Governmental funds. The focus of the governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows and balances of spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing SFFC's financing requirements. In particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government's net resources available for spending at the end of the fi scal year. As noted previously, SFFC has only one governmental fund, the General Fund. A s o f t h e e n d o f t h e c u r r e n t p e r i o d , S F F C ' s g o v e rnmental fund reported ending fund balance of $68,039,221. Substantially all of the ending fund balance ($68,013,201) constitutes reserved fund balance , which is not available for new spending because it has already been committed to pay for development of the biomedical research institution and campus in Palm Beach County, Florida, and for prepaid items. The remainder of fund balance ($26,020) is unreserved to indicate that it is available for spending at the discretion of SFFC, although all of the unreserved fund balance is designated for 2010-2011 budgeted expenditures. Key factors to consider in analyzing the fund balance for the General Fund are as follows: The restricted investments with the SBA and the investment earnings thereon are required to be disbursed to The Scripps Research Institute through December 31, 2013. In future years, SFFC is limited to expenditures of $200,000 annually for administrative expenses. All other funds are committed to The Scripps Research Institute project, including any unexpended portion of the annual administrative budget allocation of $200,000. General Fund Budgetary Highlights There were n o differences between the original budg et and the final amended budget for the year ended September 30, 2010. 7 During the year, revenue met budgetary estimates. Ex penditures were less than budgetary estimates by approximately $36,000, which was attributable primarily to lower professional fees incurred for the grant monitoring activities of SFFC. Capital Asset and Debt Administration Ca pital assets. SFFC has not purchased any capital assets, but is renting equipment for the SFFC office. Long-term debt. SFFC is not permitted to incur long-term debt. Economic Factors and Next Year's Budget SFFC h as a stable financial position and economic outlook, as indicated by: The investments with the State Board of Administration earned approximately $1.7 million for 2010, including net realized and unrealized gains of approximately $1.6 million and investment expenses of approximately $18,000 on SBA accounts. At September 30, 2010 investments consist of a money market mutual fund and U.S. Go vernment securities with fixed maturities corresponding with the annual payments to The Scripps Research Institute. SFFC anticipates holding the securities to maturity which will avoid realization of any market losses. Administrative expenditures are limited to $200,000 annually in future years. These factors were considered in preparing SFFC's budget for the 2010-2011 fiscal year. Requests for Information This f inancial report is designed to provide a general overview of SFFC's finances for all those with an interest in the organization's fina nces. Questions concerning any of the information provided in this report or requests for additional financial informatio n should be addressed to the Scripps Project Director at 505 South Flagler Drive, Suite 1003, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33401.

SFFC is exempt from income taxes un der Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. SFFC is governed by a nine member Board of Directors, three of whom ar e appointed by the Governor of the State of Florida, three of whom are appointed by the Pres ident of the Senate of the State of Florida, and three of whom are appointed by the Speaker of the Ho use of Representatives of the State of Florida. Financial Reporting Entity : For financial reporting purposes, manage ment determined that SFFC should be reported as a governmental orga nization and a component unit of the State of Florida based on the appointment of the Board of Director s by officials of State government. In considering potential component units to include in the SFFC financ ial reporting entity, management app lied the criteria set forth in U.S. generally accepted accounting principl es (GAAP). As defined by GAAP, the financial reporting entity consists of (a) the primary government, (b) organizations for which the primary go vernment is financially accountable, and (c) other organizations for which the primary government is not accountable, but for which the nature and significance of thei r relationship with the primary govern ment are such that exclusion would cause the financial reporting entity's financial statemen ts to be misleading or incomplete. Component units are legally separate organizations for which the electe d officials of the primary government are financially accountable. In addition, component units can be other organizations for which the na ture and significance of their relationship with the primary government are such that exclusion would cause the financial reporting entity's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. Based upon the application of these criteria, SFFC found that there were no entities to c onsider as potential component units. Government-wide/Governmental Fund Financial Statements : SFFC is a special-purpose government engaged in one primary governmental activity , to facilitate and oversee the estab lishment and operation of a state-of- the-art biomedical research institut ion and campus in the State by The Scripps Research Institute. SFFC accounts for all financial re sources in one fund, the General Fund, which includes all governmental activities of SFFC, which are supported primarily by an annual a ppropriation established by the State of Florida. Accordingly, the Government-wide and Governmental Fund financial statem ents of SFFC are combined using a columnar format that reconciles in dividual line items of General Fund financial data to Government-wide data in separate columns on the face of the financial statements. The Governmental Fund financial statements include a Balance Sheet and a Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance for the General Fund. The Government-wide fi nancial statements consist of the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities. Note D expl ains the reconciling items presented in the adjustments column of the combined Government-wide and Governme ntal Fund financial statements. Measurement Focus and Basis of Accounting : Financial reporting is based upon all pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standard s Board (GASB), as well as the pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its predecessors, including FASB Statements and Interpretations, APB Opinions, and Accounting Rese arch Bulletins that do not conf lict with or contradict GASB pronouncements. SCRIPPS FLORIDA FUNDING CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 11 NOTE A - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting . Revenue is recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenues as soon as all eligibility requirements impose d by the provider have been met. SFFC does not allocate indirect expenses. Governmental fund financial stat ements are reported using the current financial reso urces measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting . Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized in the period in which they become both me asurable and available. Reve nues are considered to be available when collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liab ilities of the current period. SFFC considers revenues to be available if collected within 90 days of the end of the current fiscal year. Expenditures are generally recogn ized in the accounting period in which the fund liability is incurred. Investment earnings are considered susceptible to accrua l and have been recognized as revenue in the current fiscal year. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and av ailable only when received in cash by SFFC. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash consists of amounts on deposit in a non-interest bear ing checking account with a financial institution. Cash equivalents include amounts held in an institut ional money market mutual fund through the State Board of Administrati on of the State of Florida (the \"SBA\"). Investments : Investments consist of deposits in an investment pool administ ered by the SBA pursuant to a trust agreement entered into Januar y 30, 2004. All SFFC funds legally rest ricted to the TSRI project are required to be deposited in the SBA investment pool. Investments are presen ted in the financial statements at fair value as determined by the SBA. Prepaid Items : Certain payments to vendors reflect costs app licable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items. Net Assets/Fund Balance : The government-wide financial statemen ts utilize a net asset presentation. Net assets are categorized as follows: Restricted - This component of net assets consists of constraints placed on the use of net assets by external restrictions imposed by vendors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or constraints imposed by law, constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Restricted resources are used first to fund expenses incurred for restricted purposes. Unrestricted - This component of net assets consists of net assets that do not meet the definition of Invested in Capital Assets, Net of Related Debt or Restricted . The governmental fund financial statements utilize a fu nd balance presentation. Fund balance is categorized as follows: Fund balance reserves indicate the portion of fund balance that is not available for subsequent expenditure, other than for the specific purp ose for which the reserve was established. Fund balance designations indicate management's intended fu ture use of available resources. SCRIPPS FLORIDA FUNDING CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 12 NOTE A - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Economic Development Grant : SFFC entered into an Operating and Funding Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with TSRI dated January 30, 2004. Pu rsuant to the terms of the Agreem ent, SFFC will provide an economic development grant to TSRI in the amount of $310 million plus the net investment in come thereon and less the annual administrative appropriation to SFFC. Subject to compliance by TSRI with the terms of the Agreement and annual approval of a grant request by SFFC, th e economic development grant is payable to TSRI in quarterly installments on March 15th, June 15th, September 15th and December 15th of each year, unless there is a material default of the Agreement by TSRI. At September 30, 2010, TSRI was in compliance with the Agreement and the payment due on December 15, 2010 is accrued in the accompanying financial statements. In-Kind Contributions : SFFC records in-kind contributions for contributed professional services. Contributed professional services are recognized if the services received (a) create or enhance long-lived assets or (b) require specialized skills, are provided by individuals possessing those skills, and would typically need to be purchased if not provided by donation. The project director for SFFC was an employee of the State of Florida, Office of Tourism, Trade and Ec onomic Development, which contribu ted to SFFC the portion of the professional time of the project dire ctor related to administering the op erations of SFFC. For 2010, these in- kind professional services were valu ed at $17,500 and recorded in the a ccompanying financial statements as contributions and offset by a like amount included in general go vernment expenditures/expenses. Property Taxes : SFFC receives no property taxes. Risk Management : SFFC is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and om issions; injuries to em ployees; and natural disasters. SFFC purchases commercial insurance for the risks of losses to which it is exposed. Polic y limits and deductibles are reviewed annually by management and established at amounts to provide reasonable protection from significant financial loss. Settlements have not exceed ed insurance coverage since inception. Recent Accounting Pronouncement : The GASB has issued Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions , which establishes accounting and financial reporting requirements for all governmental funds and establishes crit eria for classifying fund balances. The requirements of this statement will be effective for SFFC for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011. Management has not completed its analysis of the effects of this statement, if any, on the financial statements of SFFC. Estimates : Management uses estimates and assumptions in prep aring financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting pr inciples. Those estimate s and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, th e disclosure of contingent assets and lia bilities, and the reported revenues and expenditures. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were used. NOTE B - CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS Cash : At September 30, 2010, SFFC had deposits with fina ncial institutions with a carrying value and bank balance of approximately $250,000. The de posits with financial institutions were entirely co vered by federal depository insurance and a collateral p ool pledged to the State Treasurer of Florida by financial institutions that comply with the requirements of Florida Statutes and have been designated as a qualified public depository by the State Treasurer. Qua lified public depositories are required to pledge collateral to the State SCRIPPS FLORIDA FUNDING CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 13 NOTE B - CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS (Continued) Treasurer with a fair value equal to a percentage of the average daily balance of a ll government deposits in excess of any federal deposit insurance. In the event of a default by a qualified public depository, the amount of public funds would be covered by the proceeds of federal deposit insurance, pledged collateral of the public depository in defaul t and, if necessary, a pro rata assessment to the other qualified public depositories in the collateral pool. Accordingly, a ll deposits with financial instituti ons are considered fully insured or collateralized in accordance with the pr ovisions of GASB Statement No. 3. Cash Equivalents : Cash equivalents include investments in the Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund, an institutional money market fund held in the SBA investment pool for SFFC. All cash equivalents are legally re stricted to the TSRI project. Investments : Pursuant to a trust agreement with the SBA entered into on January 30, 2004, SFFC is required to invest all funds legally restricted to the TSRI project in an investment pool administered by the SBA. The objective of the SBA investment pool is to provide liq uidity to fund the antici pated disbursements for the TSRI project through 2013. All investment policies are established by the SBA, except for those specifically set forth in the trust agreement. The trus t agreement requires investments to be made in marketable securities rated investment grade (BBB for Standard and Poor's or Baa for Moody's Investor Services) by at least one Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), or if not rated, deemed by the SBA to be the equivalent of investment grade. Short- term investments must be rated in th e highest two categories by at least one NRSRO. All investments are required to mature within six months of the anticipated date of disbursement to TSRI. During the year ended Septembe r 30, 2010 the SBA investment pool for SFFC included U.S. Government Treasury inflation pr otected securities (TIPS), U.S. Treasury interest only and principal only strip securities, and the Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund. Interest Rate Risk : Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in intere st rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Investments of the SBA pool are stru ctured to mature within si x months of the scheduled SFFC annual grant disbursement da tes. The weighted average maturity of the Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund (Dreyfus) is limited to ninety days pursuant to the requirements of Rule 2a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The weigh ted average maturity of Dreyfus was approximately 50 days at Septem ber 30, 2010. For purposes of calcul ating a weighted average maturity, the maturity date is assumed to be th e next interest rate reset date rather than the stated maturity date. The table below summarizes the scheduled maturities of investment securities at September 30, 2010. Scheduled Maturities Fair Value Less Than One Year One to Five Years U.S. Government Securities (cost $71,085,397) Treasury interest only strips Treasury principal only strips $ 45,120,274 27,467,285 $ 72,587,559 $ 9,591,072 27,467,285 $ 37,058,357 $ 35,529,202 0 $ 35,529,202 SCRIPPS FLORIDA FUNDING CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 14 NOTE B - CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS (Continued) Credit Risk : Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will not fulfill its obligati ons. All investments must be rated investment grade by at least one Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), or if not rated, deemed by the SBA to be the equivalent of investment grade. An investment grade rating is at least BBB for Standard and Poor's (S&P) or Baa for Moody's In vestor Services (Moody's). At September 30, 2010 the credit quality ratings by S&P and Moody's for the Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund were AAAm and Aaa, respectively. Concentration of Credit Risk : Concentration of credit ri sk is defined as the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of an investment in a si ngle issuer. For investments other than the Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund, there is no spec ific policy for concentration of credit risk. The Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mutual fund is structured to comply with the requirements of Rule 2a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and for 75% of the total assets, securities of a single issuer are limit ed to no more than 5% and voting secu rities of a single issuer are limited to no more than 10% of the amortized cost of the portfolio (excluding securities of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities). Custodial Credit Risk : Custodial credit risk is defined as the risk that the investment pool may not recover the securities held by another party in the event of a financial failure. The SB A investment pool does not have a formal policy for custodial credit risk. The assets in the SFFC investment pool were classified by the SBA pursuant to the custodial credit risk categories of GASB Statement No. 3 to give an indication of the level of custodial credit risk for the SFFC investment pool at September 30, 2010. Category 1 includes investments that are insured or registered or for wh ich the securities are held by the SB A or its agent in the SBA's name for the SFFC account. At September 30, 2010, the U. S. Government securiti es are classified as Category 1 . The Dreyfus Government Cash Management money market mu tual fund is a commingled pool of investments that cannot be classified. Foreign Currency Risk : Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. There was no exposu re to foreign currency risk at September 30, 2010. Administrative Expense : The SBA receives an administrative investment fee in the amount of two basis points annualized, calculated and charged monthly based on the end-of-month fair value of the investments, with an annual minimum fee of $2, 500. The SBA administrative fee expense for the year ended September 30, 2010 was approximately $18,000 and is netted with investment income received from the SBA. NOTE C - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY Contract Commitment : Pursuant to the terms of the Operating and Funding Agreement, SFFC will provide an economic development grant to TSRI of $310 million plus the investment in come thereon and less an annual allocation to SFFC for administrative expenses of $200, 000 for each contract year. The grant funds are to be used by TSRI to establish and operate a state-of-the-art biomedical research institut ion and campus in Florida. Subject to a material default by TSRI under the agreem ent, SFFC will disburse th e grant funds to TSRI in quarterly installments over the te rm of the Agreement. During 2007 S FFC and TSRI agreed to amend the Agreement to modify the future annual amounts of the grant payments and exte nd the time period for disbursement of the grant funds from a term ending December 31, 2010 to a term ending December 31, 2013. SCRIPPS FLORIDA FUNDING CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2010 15 NOTE C - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY (Continued) The future anticipated annual disbursements under the revised Agreement, exclusive of investment earnings on invested funds, are as follows: Year Ending September 30, Amount 2011 2012 2013 2014 $ 30,180,750 19,271,000 7,441,500 1,250,000 Total $ 58,143,250 Lease Commitment : SFFC leases office space under an operatin g lease expiring January 31, 2011. Annual rent increases are based on changes in the consumer price in dex. Rent expense under this lease was $13,262 for the year ended September 30, 2010. The minimum future lease payments at Septem ber 30, 2010 were $4,470 due in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011. Grants : Amounts received or receivable from grantor agen cies are subject to audit and adjustment by those agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already received, might constitute a liability of SFFC for the return of those funds. NOTE D - EXPLANATION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOVERNMENTAL FUND AND GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS The only difference between the Govern mental Fund financial statements and the Government-wide financial statements is the reclassification of the Fund Balance reported for SFFC's General Fund into the Net Assets categories reported for Governmental Activities in the Statement of Ne t Assets. There were no differences between the Governmental Fund Statement of Revenues , Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance and the Statement of Activities.

The Board of Directors must approve all changes or am endments to the budgeted expenditures of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation (SFFC). Total expend itures may not legally exceed total budgeted appropriations at the fund level. During 2010 SFFC made no supplemental appropriations. The General Fund budget amounts presented in th e accompanying budgetary comparison schedule reflect the original budget and the amended budget ba sed on legally authorized revisions to the original budget during the year. Appropriations lapse at fiscal year end. NOTE B - BUDGET TO ACTUAL COMPARISONS U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require that the General Fund budgetary comparison schedule be prepared under the basis of accounting used in preparing the budget. As a result, General Fund revenues and expenditures repo rted in the budgetary comparison schedule differ from the revenues and expenditures reported on th e GAAP basis. The difference can be reconciled as follows: Revenues Expenditures Budgetary basis GAAP basis adjustments: SBA investment income Economic development grant In-kind contribution of professional services GAAP Basis $ 200,000 1,546,001 0 17,500 $ 1,763,501 $ 160,781 0 27,950,664 17,500 $ 28,128,945 Expenditures for general government purposes are lega lly limited by Florida Statutes to $300,000 for the first contract year of operations, ending on Decemb er 15, 2004 and $200,000 for each contract year thereafter. For purposes of this limitation, the budgetary basis expenditures for general government purposes of $160,781 through September 30, 2010 were within the $200,000 limitation for the contract period ending December 15, 2010. The limitation of $ 200,000 for the contract period ended December 15, 2009 was also met. COMPLIANCE REPORT AND MANAGEMENT LETTER Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Ot her Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance With Government Auditing Standards To the Board of Directors Scripps Florida Funding Corporation West Palm Beach, Florida We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities and majo r fund of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation, a component unit of the State of Florida, as of and for th e year ended September 30, 2010, which collectively comprise the basic financial statements of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation and have issued our report thereon date d November 22, 2010. We conducted ou r audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards and the standa rds applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller Ge neral of the United States. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit, we consid ered the internal control over financial reporting of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Scripps Florida Funding Corporati on. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectivene ss of the internal control over fina ncial reporting of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of pe rforming their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combinati on of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility th at a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or de tected and corrected on a timely basis. Our consideration of the internal control over financia l reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be de ficiencies, significant de ficiencies or material weaknesses. We did not identify any deficiencies in intern al control over financial reporting that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whethe r th e financial statements of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation are free of material misstat ement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 18 CALER, DONTEN, LEVINE, PORTER & VEIL, P.A.

November 22, 2010 19 Management Letter To the Board of Directors Scripps Florida Funding Corporation West Palm Beach, Florida We have audited the financial statements of Scripps Florida Funding Corporation, a component unit of the State of Florida, as of September 30, 2010 and fo r the year then ended, and have issued our report thereon dated November 22, 2010. We conducted our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. We have issued our Inde pendent Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards. Disclosures in that report, which is dated November 22, 2010, should be considered in conjunction with this management letter. Additionally, our audit was conducted in accordance with Chapter 10.700, Rules of the Auditor General, which governs the conduct of certain nonprofit organizations audits performed in the State of Florida and requires disclosure in the management letter of violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, or abuse, that have an effect on the financial statements that is less than material but more than inconsequential. In addition, for matters that have an inconsequential effect on the financial statements, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors, the following may be reported based on professional judgment: (1) violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, fraud, illegal acts, or abuse, and (2) control deficiencies that are not signif icant deficiencies. In connection with our audit, we noted no matters that are required to be disclosed. There were no prior year comments. Pursuant to Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, this management letter is a public record and its distribution is not limited.
