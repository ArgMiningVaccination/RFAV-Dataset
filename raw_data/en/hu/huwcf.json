With a rapidly ageing population, the number of years people can expect to spend in good health, without disabling illness, continues to decline. People notice the passage of time in their faces first, often compelling them to find cosmetic solutions to reverse the signs. Most people believe ageing to be an inevitable process, but it doesn't have to be. Across the world, individuals are oblivious to how the cellular changes within their body can be improved and optimised to reduce the physical signs of ageing. and how this in turn, can improve wellbeing and extend health span. Tania Malan, founder and clinical director of Uniskin states that it's time to change the way we think about getting older. In Ageless she explores the vast range of factors that can cause people to age, digging deeper into a phenomenon that seems inevitable. This book draws on Tania's thirty years of experience in trauma and medicine in the UK and South Africa, as well as her time spent achieving four degrees and diplomas in midwifery, psychiatry and general and community nursing. Ageless aims to inform readers about the underlying causes of ageing and empower them to consciously extend their health span. In it Tania breaks down how stress, injury, illness and lifestyle impact the body and can lead to cellular ageing. Combining her expertise in medicine and aesthetics with various case studies, she explains why and how cells change. Throughout the chapters, she digs deep into topics such as the effect of nutrition, hormones, physical activity, injuries, supplements and cosmetic procedures on ageing in the hope to raise awareness of why there is a need for personalised nutrition and hormonal balance. Readers will finish this book with a full understanding of how personalised precision treatments can identify and provide each person with an accurate road map of what nutrients and hormones their body specifically lacks and needs to prevent cellular ageing. Ageless challenges the status quo around ageing and wellbeing, empowering readers to change their lives for the better. Through Ageless, Tania provides an alternative lens through which readers can view themselves, enabling them to not only better understand the causes of ageing but also to navigate their own personal path to an ageless future. \"More than ever before, we need to take responsibility for our own wellbeing and understand that we are in charge of our bodies, and that what we put into them will have long-term consequences. At the same time, we are unique, and one size does not fit all. We are deserving of precision nutrition, hormones and authentic rejuvenation,\" explains Tania. \"Investing in your health and wellbeing is the best gift you can give to yourself. You no longer need to accept the status quo. Ageing is no longer a fact of life; reverse cellular ageing and extending your health span is within your grasp.\" Ageless is published by [Rethink Press](https://rethinkpress.com/books/ageless/) About the author Tania Malan is the founder and clinician director of Uniskin - a UK-based wellness clinic with a global vision.
