What is Addiction? [Addiction](/denver-long-term-rehab-program/) is a chronic, relapsing disorder. It involves compulsive, habitual behaviors that have harmful consequences. Addiction is a complex condition that involves both physical and psychological components. A well-rounded approach is necessary for a full recovery from addiction. At the Mile High Recovery Center, our approach to wellness is holistic. Through our facility, mind-body addiction treatment in Denver is available. Substance Addictions A substance addiction is the inability to control the use of a substance. This can lead to a physical dependence. Substance addictions include (but are not limited to) the following: - Alcoholism - Opioid addiction [Cocaine addiction](/substance-abuse-treatment-program-denver/cocaine-addiction-treatment-center-denver/) Behavioral Addictions Behavioral addictions involve activities that stimulate the brain to repeat a behavior. These activities turn into habits despite negative consequences. These are some recognized forms of behavioral addiction: [1](#resource) - Gambling - Internet addiction [Overeating](/denver-eating-disorder-residential-treatment/) - Overworking Impacts of Addiction Addiction can impact many aspects of an individual's life. Some of the short term consequences of addiction include the following: - Intoxication - Impaired judgment - Accidents - Injuries - Risky behaviors - Strained relationships - Legal troubles - Difficulties fulfilling work or home obligations - Trouble at school The Long-Term Complications of Addiction Our mind-body addiction treatment in Denver is not a short-term solution. We recognize that over time, addiction can cause many complications. [2](#resource) These may include the following: - Severe and chronic health problems - Damage to interpersonal relationships - Hindrance to personal growth - Financial instability - Unemployment - Homelessness - Incarceration - Social isolation How Does Addiction Impact Society? The prevalence of addiction in society is very high. It affects individuals across all demographics, irrespective of age, gender, or socioeconomic status. Approximately 38.7 million adults battled a [substance use disorder](/substance-abuse-treatment-program-denver/) in 2020. [3](#resource) This demographic was in the United States alone. The ongoing opioid crisis has highlighted the urgency of effective addiction treatment strategies. Help is available through mind-body addiction treatment in Denver. The Mile High Recovery Center has built a solid reputation in addiction recovery. Physical Impacts of Addiction Addiction takes a toll on the physical well-being of individuals. Substance abuse can lead to various health complications that deteriorate the body. The specific physical impacts of addiction vary depending on the substance misused. Common Physical Impacts of Addiction [4](#resource) - Organ damage: Prolonged substance abuse can damage vital organs. These include the liver, heart, lungs, and brain. - Weakened immune system: Substance abuse weakens the immune system. This makes individuals more susceptible to infections and illnesses. - Hormonal imbalances: Addiction can disrupt hormonal balance. This can lead to infertility, sexual dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities. - Nutritional deficiencies: Substance use disorder often results in poor dietary habits. This causes malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. - Increased risk of overdose: Substance abuse raises the risk of an overdose, which can be fatal. Mental Impacts of Addiction Addiction has a profound effect on mental health. The mental impacts of addiction can be wide-ranging and include: [5](#resource) - Psychological distress: Individuals with addiction may experience anxiety, [depression](/substance-abuse-treatment-program-denver/dual-diagnosis-treatment-center-denver/depression-treatment-center-denver/)or other mood disorders. - Cognitive impairment: Prolonged substance abuse can impair cognitive functions. These include memory, attention, and decision-making. - Behavioral changes: Addiction can lead to impulsivity, aggression, and impaired judgment. Individuals may engage in risky behaviors or experience a decline in responsibilities. - Co-occurring disorders: It is common for addictions to co-occur with mental health disorders. These can include anxiety disorders, [bipolar disorder,](/substance-abuse-treatment-program-denver/dual-diagnosis-treatment-center-denver/bipolar-disorder-treatment-center-denver/)or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is a complex interplay between substance abuse and psychiatric conditions. Limitations of Symptom-Based Treatment Addiction treatment is often centered around symptom management alone. This targets the physical aspects of addiction and withdrawal. It often falls short of addressing the complex underlying factors contributing to addiction. Addressing the symptoms of addiction without addressing the underlying causes is fruitless. Limited treatment leads to an incomplete recovery and a higher risk of relapse. We urge you to consider mind-body addiction treatment in Denver. Symptom-based treatment can only provide momentary relief and short-term stabilization. The following segments describe the limitations of using symptom-based treatment by itself. Neglect of Root Causes Addiction is often rooted in unresolved trauma and emotional pain. Sometimes there are also underlying mental health conditions. Symptom management alone leaves underlying addiction causes unaddressed. This may lead to a continued struggle with the same issues that led to addiction in the first place. Inadequate Coping Strategies Symptom-based treatment may relieve withdrawal symptoms or cravings. This treatment unfortunately cannot equip individuals with long-term coping skills. Addiction recovery involves facing triggers, stressors, and emotional challenges. Limited Holistic Healing True recovery involves healing on all levels. It involves rebuilding relationships, improving self-esteem, and finding meaning in life. With mind-body addiction treatment in Denver, we look at the whole picture. Treating physical symptoms alone misses the opportunity for holistic healing. Lack of Long-Term Sustainability Symptomatic treatment may provide short-term relief. Even so, it will never be a successful solution to addiction. The Mile High Recovery Center offers the tools and resources for sustained recovery. Discover mind-body addiction treatment in Denver. Our Approach to Mind-Body Addiction Treatment in Denver Addiction is not a physical or behavioral issue. Addiction has psychological, emotional, and spiritual components. With mind-body addiction treatment in Denver, we aim to promote complete healing and recovery. We do this through holistic practices. Holistic Healing: Mind-Body Addiction Treatment in Denver The Mile High Recovery Center uses a specialized approach when addressing addiction. Our goal is holistic healing. Our approach addresses the following aspects of well-being: - Physical - Emotional - Mental - Spiritual Increased Self-Awareness Our mind-body addiction treatment in Denver encourages individuals to better understand themselves. This heightened self-awareness helps in recognizing triggers and identifying patterns in addiction. Self-awareness during recovery involves the following: - Thoughts - Emotions - Physical sensations Emotional Regulation and Stress Management Addiction often coexists with emotional dysregulation and stress.
