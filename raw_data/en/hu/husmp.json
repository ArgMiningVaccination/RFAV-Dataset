Adverse events are more common after the second dose. These side effects are a sign that your immune system is doing exactly what it is supposed to do - building up protection to the disease. The risk of any vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small but possible. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a severe problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The COVID-19 vaccines are new, and some effects may not yet be known. We routinely give vaccines in controlled settings and always have medications and equipment available for managing allergic reactions at each vaccination site. We may call 9-1-1 in the case of a severe reaction. Allergic response usually occurs within 4 hours of receiving an injection and may include breathing difficulty, swelling of your tongue/lips, itching, hives and redness. If you experience any of these symptoms or you were treated with an injection of Epinephrine, contact your healthcare provider. If you test positive for COVID-19 after your first dose of the vaccine and before your second dose and you still have COVID-19 symptoms, you will need to reschedule your second dose for when you are completely recovered. Completely recovered means you have no active symptoms from your illness and are no longer required to isolate (10 days since symptoms began). After that time period you may receive your vaccination. This is unclear, although the likelihood of carrying the disease to others is significantly reduced if a person is not actively infected. After a vaccination, the body doesn't build an immune response instantly - it takes weeks. With COVID-19 vaccines, studies show that all three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) only achieve full immunity four to six weeks after starting. It is strongly recommended that you complete both doses if you receive Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna. A booster dose may also be recommended. You will not test positive for COVID but may test positive for the antibodies. The vaccines cannot give someone COVID-19. Herd immunity (or community immunity) is a term to describe when enough individuals have protection - either from previous infection or vaccination - that there are so few at risk people in a community that it is unlikely a virus or bacteria can continue to spread widely and infect others. As a result, everyone within the community is protected, even if some people do not have any protection themselves. The percentage of people who need to have protection to reach herd immunity varies by disease. At this time, experts do not know what percentage of people would need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity for COVID-19, but current estimates are that at least 75% of people within a community will need to have immunity to begin controlling the pandemic. A great deal remains unknown about the long-term effects of the vaccine, including how long it provides immunity. Patients in vaccine studies will continue to be monitored by the FDA and the CDC for 24 months to allow researchers to learn more about these impacts. If a safety issue is detected, immediate action will take place to determine if the issue is related to the COVID-19 vaccine and determine the best course of action. While experts learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines protect those that receive it and our community, it is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, frequent hand washing and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following the CDC's recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading SARs-CoV2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change infection control recommendations. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities will also affect this decision. V-safe is a CDC smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins after you receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Through v-safe, you can quickly tell CDC if you have any side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Once you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you can enroll in v-safe using your smartphone. Information to register can be found on the vaccination record card you receive during your vaccination or on the "}
