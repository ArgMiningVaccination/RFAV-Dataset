Arogya Holistic Healing & Arogya Tea 131 Post Rd E Westport, CT 06880 From Our Director Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated with my traditional Chinese Heritage. The deep philosophic wisdom of the great sages, the sweet scent of freshly brewed green tea, the mouth-watering array of curative culinary delights, and the mystique of Chinese medicine, with its powerful therapeutic herbs and connection with nature's profound energy, have all left deep and lasting impressions upon me. With the founding of Arogya in 2000, it has been my intention to bring the great healing traditions of the east into our contemporary modern lifestyles, which are in such desperate need for true balance and well-being. Our goal is to offer all our clients and community the highest quality access to integrative medicine and education about holistic wellness.

With gratitude, Wei Bertram Director, Arogya What Makes Arogya Tea Unique Arogya specializes in organic, wild-harvest, and artisanal teas and tisanes. We're dedicated to ensuring the quality of our teas from soil to cup, sourcing the finest teas for your health and enjoyment, and working directly with small, eco-conscious tea producers. - The complex and delicious flavor of our teas comes from the excellent quality of our leaves and ingredients, and the traditional ways in which they are produced. When we drink tea grown from clean soil, that hasn't been contaminated by chemicals, produced by happy workers who take pride in their product, you can taste the difference in each sip. - We are celebrated for our specialty tea blends, which are masterfully created with fine teas, botanicals, and organic and medicinally potent herbs. Wei Bertram develops all our house blends using a synergy of Western and Chinese healing herbs. Our signature blends are intricately balanced, full of flavor, and uniquely tailored to support health and wellness. - Wei has immersed herself in the entire tea production process from soil to cup by visiting tea farms and personally inspecting the quality and purity of tea leaves and farming techniques. We import many of our teas from farm-direct vendors with whom Wei has developed personal relationships over the years.
