Please keep in mind you do not 2have to make your comments today. You can provide 3comments at a later date through any of the mechanisms 4listed on the slide as long as we receive them by 5August 25. 6 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, Jamie. At this 7point, we are to the questions and answers portion of 8the agenda. This is a 20-minute period. If anyone has 9any questions that they would like answers to 10specifically tied to the NEPA process or the 11presentation that was just given, please fill free to 12come to the microphone. If you would like, state your 13name and post your question. And we will work through 14and answer. Yes, sir. 15 MR. BECK: Chris Beck with House Community on 16Homeland Security. In the discussion, you talked about 17consequences and specifically for three diseases. One 18of the most concern is Foot and Mouth Disease. 19 You mentioned that the consequences were 20lower at the Plum Island site and then kind of seemed 21to me sort of characterized the other five together. 22Is there any breakout of difference between the other 23five sites as far as consequences for that disease 24specifically? 25 MR. PERGLER: There is a difference in terms1|21.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 3 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley Fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2858 251of the numbers of livestock and the types of wildlife 2present. But overall -- and I am going to look to our 3prime analyst Randy Jenke to support this. There 4really are no significant differences between the five 5mainland sites. 6 MR. KARNOVITZ: Do you want me to address 7one? Just really quickly, while we are summarizing the 8document -- 9 MR. PERGLER: This is Alan Karnovitz. He is 10the prime socioeconomics analyst. 11 MR. KARNOVITZ: The main source for that 12estimate, which we relied on, was a recent simulation 13that was done by Lawrence Livermore Labs that was 14commissioned by DHS to run an existing model that they 15had. And as Chuck just stated, I believe it is 16somewhere around 80 percent or 90 percent, depending on 17the site, of a loss to the U.S. economy from an FMD 18breakout is the ban on exports. The remaining 19estimated loss is primarily attributable to the 20destruction of livestock within the state in which the 21outbreak took place. 22 Therefore, a state like Kansas had a greater 23number for that component of the total loss. But if 24you look at the chart, the losses accruing from the 25export ban dominates to total loss estimates. So there July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 4 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2859 261are some differences, but they are also almost dwarfed 2or trivialized by the export ban itself and the 3duration of the export. 4 MR. BECK: And is that in the draft EIS? 5 MR. KARNOVITZ: Yes, it is. There is a chart 6in there. 7 MR. PERGLER: Thank you very much. 8 MS. COGHILL: Next question, please. 9 MS. PRESCOTT: My name is Kathy Prescott, and 10I am from Athens, Georgia. And in the DEIS, I am 11confused about the executive summary table contained in 12the executive summary because it seems to contradict a 13lot of the information in the text of the DEIS. You 14speak about cumulative effects as ranking these 15environmental effects. You know, you go from 16negligible to minor to significant. And I am confused 17about how the executive summary table was accomplished 18because it is misleading to just go to the table and 19run down the specific sites and say, oh, air quality is 20negligible affected like in Athens, Georgia when you 21discuss that it is moderately affected on the page just 22previous to the table. And I am wondering what the 23process for breaking down this summary table, which is 24what most people are going to go to, to look at. They 25are not going to read a thousand something page1|26.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 5 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the no action and site alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. DHS attempted to present the information in such a manner to allow the reader to clearly follow and evaluate the information. The summary table presents an adjectival assessment of the potential effects of the proposed NBAF on the environmental and human resources of each affected site alternative. The table and the text in the NBAF EIS have been modified to rectify inconsistencies.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2860 271document. And I am curious to know how you arrived at 2those rankings. 3 MR. PERGLER: That's an excellent comment for 4us to look at to revise the draft to the final. Often 5times, summary tables are subjective because we are 6digesting a wealth of information. We have had 7internal discussions to what you just said as well. If 8you could provide that comment during the formal 9scoping comment, we will take it into a great deal of 10consideration and look at how we can revise it so that 11we can get rid of perhaps what you would consider the 12misleading statements. Thank you. 13 MS. COGHILL: Yes, ma'am. 14 MS. MOODY-SMITH: My name is Susanne 15Moody-Smith. I am a resident of Gramble County, North 16Carolina. I have some questions. I am still not real 17clear on the Foot and Mouth outbreak, the study that 18was cited by the gentleman with the first question. I 19don't remember his name. I just remember he worked for 20DHS. I am assuming that's the Crimson Sky Report that 21ended with riots in the street, National Guard running 22out of bullets, or is that a different study? 23 MR. PERGLER: Let me just clarify. 24 MS. MOODY-SMITH: That is not my question. I 25understand that Crimson Sky --1|21.0 2|19.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 6 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes commentor's concern. The potential economic effects resulting from an accidental release of FMD is discussed in Appendix D and Chapter 3, Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF DEIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease free. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.0 DHS notes the commentor's misunderstanding regarding the Lawrence Livermore Lab study cited in the public hearing.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2861 281 MR. PERGLER: Okay. That was part of the 2scope. It is a part of our team and not DHS. He is an 3independent reviewer. And the study referenced is a 4study done just recently by Lawrence Livermore. 5 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Oh, so there has been 6another study since Crimson? 7 MR. PERGLER: Yes. 8 MS. MOODY-SMITH: So if Foot and Mouth does 9break out in Gramble County or Athens, Georgia, I know 10that those two sites do have 45, quote, deer per acre 11in the areas surrounding those sites. I don't know the 12density at the other sites. But I imagine Georgia has 13got a few -- I mean, Mississippi has got a few. I 14imagine there are deer pretty much across the country, 15aren't there? 16 Again, not my question. I am wondering how 17you will contain the disease that can be carried on the 18grass on your feet. In other words, will you 19exterminate all of our deer? Will you exterminate all 20the goats? If there is any sort of public outburst 21because of possible food shortages or having their 22livelihoods and their farms destroyed by somebody 23coughing on the wrong animal that left your facility, 24will they be reimbursed? I mean, exactly how are you 25going to deal with 45 deer per acre?3|13.0 1 Cont.|21.0 2 Cont.|19.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 7 of 24 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 13.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the potential effects of an accidental release on white- tailed deer populations. The potential response measures that could be employed in the event of an accidental release are described in Section 3.8.9 of the NBAF EIS. Table 3.8.9-1 describes the potential strategies for response that could be considered in the event of an accidental release. Depopulation or population reduction is one of ten potential FMD response stategies developed by the National Park Service. However, the National Park Service recommends the use of other stategies or combinations of strategies to avoid this stategy (see Table 3.8.9-1). A more likely scenario would include one or more of the non-lethal measures described in Table 3.8.9-1. Although the NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on white-tailed deer in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Furthermore, the purpose of NBAF is to combat diseases that could have significant effects on wildlife. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2862 291 MR. JOHNSON: Let me see if I can address 2that. Part of our working with USDA, they have the 3responsibility coordinating FMD outbreaks, whether it 4comes in from another country or in the highly unlikely 5event of the scenario that you have just described, 6what happens and how do we respond to it. I would like 7for Dr. Bill White to just walk through the process of, 8you know, controlling the animal movement and the 9vaccines so we can answer her question. 10 MR. WHITE: Sure. Thank you. My name is 11Dr. Bill White, and I am a veterinarian at USDA, 12Athens, Plum Island. And Athens is the unit of USDA 13that's responsible for responding to an emergency 14disease like Foot and Mouth Disease. If it were to, 15for some reason, escape the NBAF or be imported for 16some reason, we are the agency that would respond to 17that. There is a national response plan in place for 18this contingency. As far as the effects on wild deer, 19in general, wherever FMD has occurred throughout the 20world in wildlife, it has burned itself out. So that 21sort of assessment will only be made at the time to see 22how much interaction is there between effective 23livestock and whitetail deer, for example. It may be 24that we may need to do nothing, for example, as was 25done in the UK in 2001 or if indeed we do see symptoms July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 8 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2863 301of Foot and Mouth Disease in whitetail deer, it may 2require eradication of some type. We are just not sure 3yet what that would require. 4 MS. MOODY-SMITH: How many types of 5eradication are there of deer -- for wild deer? How 6many types and what are the types of eradication for 7wild deer? 8 MR. WHITE: Well, eradication of white deer 9would be stamping out. That would be, as you know -- 10 MS. MOODY-SMITH: By what methods? My 11husband spends most of his methods shooting them one at 12a time. 13 MR. WHITE: It would be hunting. And part of 14the risk of actually hunting potentially infected 15whitetail deer, if they are infected, is actually 16spreading the disease further. So that sort of risk 17would have to be factored into what will we do with 18whitetail deer. 19 MS. MOODY-SMITH: So it just depends on if 20they get over it how you will proceed? 21 MR. WHITE: It depends on whether they are 22infected, I think, more than if they get over it. 23 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Or it burns itself out? 24 MR. WHITE: Yeah. 25 MS. MOODY-SMITH: And that would take how1 Cont.|21.0; 3 Cont.|13.0 3 Cont.|13.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 9 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2864 311long and what would keep them from infecting animals? 2I mean, they jump in and out of my wood pasture all the 3time. 4 MS. COGHILL: Excuse me. You have some very 5important questions that you are posing. We just want 6to make sure that we give everybody else equal 7opportunity if they have a question. 8 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Am I holding you all up? I 9still don't understand how you are going to get rid of 10the deer if you need to. I am still trying to get an 11answer to that question. I apologize if I am taking 12too long. 13 MS. COGHILL: No, no. What would be very 14helpful is what we have to do under the National 15Environmental Policy Act is take all the questions you 16posed to us and look at that and then answer all of 17those and do further analysis to produce the -- 18 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Answer mine. 19 MS. COGHILL: Excuse me. -- the final. 20 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Answer mine. I want to 21know how it will be -- how they will be eradicated. I 22don't understand the procedures. You have given me 23if's and maybe's. But -- so will you send people out 24to shoot them? Will they be poisoned? How will -- 25worse case scenario, they are all broken out,1Cont.|21.0 1 Cont.|21.0; 3 Cont.|13.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 10 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2865 321blistering, can't walk, running around with other 2animals, and carrying it all over the place. What are 3you going to do with them? Are you going to poison 4them? Are you going to shoot them? What? 5 MR. WHITE: That's a good question. I don't 6see poisoning as an option. Shooting, I think, would 7be the option. But an assessment would have to be made 8on the ground what is the level of contact between 9affected livestock and treating whitetail deer and are 10there indeed regions of whitetail deer. If there are 11regions of whitetail deer, then some sort of 12stamping-out program would have to be done and circles 13drawn around the possible infected area to know which 14area -- 15 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Circles of what? 16 MR. WHITE: Well, you look for the infected 17premise, and then you go maybe with a 10 kilometer 18circle around that to do surveillance. You send 19people out on the ground and you look for disease both 20in livestock, which is our main concern, and then also 21wildlife like whitetail deer. 22 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Okay. Thank you. 23 MR. PERGLER: If I could just say one thing 24here because what you have presented is a perfect 25example of a comment that if you can give it to us in1Cont.|21.0; 3Cont.|13.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 11 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2866 331formal scoping comment saying please identify in the 2final EIS the method of eradication should this occur, 3we actually do in the EIS address two plans on what -- 4on control measures. But, again, the more specific in 5detailed your question or comment is the better we can 6modify the EIS to address your concern. Thank you. 7 MS. MOODY-SMITH: Thank you. 8 MS. COGHILL: Yes, sir. 9 MR. CHAVIS: My name is Ian Chavis from Akin, 10Gump. The gentleman from the EIS team said towards the 11end of the presentation that all of the information 12generated during the process will be used to make the 13ultimate decision by EIS. But you also mentioned that 14there would be some other analyses or other studies 15that will also be considered. So I guess I have a 16two-part question. One, I think you mentioned the cost 17analysis, the cost study being one. The first question 18is, what are those other studies and will those studies 19be made available and be made part of the NEPA record. 20 MR. JOHNSON: I can address that. NEPA 21requires us to do an environmental assessment of the 22potential impacts on that federal action on the 23environment. So the decision-makers need to understand 24what those environmental impacts are under, as we 25described them, the normal operation standard of1|26.0; 2|4.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 12 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 26.0 All materials used in analysis and preparation of the NBAF EIS will be included in the Administrative Record. In addition, DHS made available on its website (www.dhs.gov/nbaf), on or about August 11, 2008, the key supporting documents which are expected to assist the DHS decision maker in making a final decision about NBAF. These documents include the Site Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study, and other documents. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes the commentor's request for other information and studies that would be considered in DHS's final decision on NBAF. As described in Section 2.6 of the NBAF EIS, DHS will consider the following reports, in addition to the NBAF EIS, in formulating the Record of Decision: Threat Risk Assessment (TRA), Site Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and the Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study. The Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and the Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study and other support documents were made available on DHS's NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf) in early August 2008. The TRA has not been released and is not publicly available due to NBAF security considerations. With the exception of the TRA, these studies, along with the references used in preparation of the NBAF EIS, are part of the Administrative Record and can also be accessed through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2867 341accident scenarios so he can decide how we wants to 2mitigate those impacts depending on which site and 3which option is chosen. Along with that, the 4decision-maker needs to be aware of other things that 5go into that decision, such as cost, site 6characterization. We are also looking at, for example, 7if we decide to build a NBAF right next to the Plum 8Island facility, what would it cost to transition 9people to the new facility or to the -- you know, the 10facility on the mainland site. We have to have all 11those factors, so we are not just making a decision in 12a vacuum, if you will. So those supporting documents 13are now part of the NEPA record. There are other 14studies that were going on. Certainly, if people want 15to request copies, they can. But those are not part of 16the NEPA record. And those documents are not for 17public comment. 18 MR. CHAVIS: And how would one get copies of 19those studies or make that request? 20 MR. JOHNSON: You have to go through the FOIA 21process. 22 MR. CHAVIS: Through the FOIA process to the 23Department of Homeland Security? 24 MR. JOHNSON: Correct. 25 MR. CHAVIS: Okay. Thank you. July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 13 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2868 351 MS. COGHILL: Thank you very much. Yes, 2sir. 3 MR. THRASHER: My name is Grady Thrasher. I 4am from Athens, Georgia. And I have a question about 5what appears to be a disingenuous presentation in the 6EIS in the summary table. You have the various 7potential impacts on the environment. And the summary 8says they are even negligible or they are not 9negligible or whatever. And then at the bottom, all 10the way across it says, benefits and its significance, 11significance, significance. So I thought, wow, this is 12really going to benefit the environment and are they 13going to stop erosion or air pollution or something. 14And what you have is, well, there may be things 15developed, such as vaccines and countermeasures that, 16you know, would cure foreign animal diseases. Well, of 17course, that's the purpose of NBAF, but that is very 18speculative. And it is looking out way over the 19future. 20 I understand that you have been studying Foot 21and Mouth Disease for 50 years and have not come up 22with an effective cure or countermeasure for it. So I 23believe you are misleading the public when they say, 24Well, look, we have done a study and it is going to be 25a significant benefit to the environment in Athens,1|26.0 2|9.0; 3|11.0 4|1.0 1Cont.|26.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 14 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 26.0 The summary table presents an adjectival assessment of the potential effects of the proposed NBAF on the environmental and human resources of each affected site alternative. The table has been modified based on comments received during the public comment period. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 9.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns. The NBAF EIS Section 2.5 provides a comparision summary of the effects for each site alternative by resource; however, more detail by site and resource is found in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 Section 3.4 summarizes the preliminary air assessment and Section 3.4.1 describes the methodology used to assess each site's potential air effects. Once a site is selected, disposal method(s) determined, and design complete; a complete emission inventory will be developed and refined air dispersion modeling executed if necessary to show compliance with the NAAQS and state specific SIPs if applicable. The final design will ensure that the NBAF does not significantly affect the region's ability to meet air quality standards. Sections 3.3 and 3.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spills and runoff affects. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 11.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement regarding the Comparison of Environmental Effects Table in the NBAF EIS Executive Summary. The portion of the Summary of Environmental Effects Table in the Executive Summary and Section 2.5 that the commentor is referring to described the potential benefit from the NBAF under normal operation. As the commentor noted, these are indeed the benefits that would be realized from the NBAF in preventing or minimizing the effects of a FAD outbreak. DHS feels it is important to include this information to assist the reader in understanding the intended benefits to the economy, biological resources, and health and safety as well as any adverse effects resulting from construction and operation activities. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 1.0 DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2869 361Georgia by putting this and all the other effects on 2the environment are going to be minimal or whatever. I 3am not sure your statement that it is going to have 4beneficial effects is really responsive to NBAF. And 5that's my question. 6 MR. PERGLER: That is -- I am taking that as 7a comment. And we hear you. We are going to take a 8hard look at the presentation and content for the 9executive summary. And so when you see the final, 10judge us on how well we did our homework and responded 11to you. Thank you. 12 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, sir. 13 MR. KAPPES: I would like to point out that 14you are correct that we have worked on Foot and Mouth 15Disease for the last 50 years, but we have made 16significant progress. We are currently evaluating an 17effective vaccine with a company. DHS and the USDA 18jointly are working on that, and it looks to be very 19successful. And we are in the process of developing a 20vaccine for all seven different sterotypes. So we 21fortunately have made tremendous progress in the last 22few years. 23 MR. COGHILL: At this point in time we are to 24the close of the question and answer period. I want to 25thank everybody. That's very valuable information that1Cont.|26.0 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 15 of 24 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2870 371was put forward. Right now we would like to open it up 2to the formal comments period of the meeting and listen 3to what folks who signed up what their comments are.

And 11please remember that you each have three minutes. 12 Again, I will work with the yellow and red 13cards so we are not interfering with your statement. 14But if you could please respect that because clearly 15there is quite a few folks who would like to speak. 16 The first person is Kathy Prescott. 17 MS. PRESCOTT: My name is Kathy Prescott. 18Again, I am from Athens, Georgia, one of the six sites 19for this proposed NBAF. I would like to tell you about 20a really big seller in Athens right now -- rain 21barrels. We are in a 100-year drought, and people are 22collecting rainwater off of their roofs to water their 23plants. Yet, the DEIS says, rainwater in Athens, no 24problem. The executive summary table says effects on 25water in Athens by NBAF will be minor.1|12.2 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 16 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 12.2 DHS notes the commentor's drought concerns and DHS acknowledges current regional drought conditions. As described in Section 3.7.3.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would use approximately 118,000 gallons per day of potable water, an amount that is approximately 0.76% of Athens' current annual average of 15.5 million gallons per day usage. The NBAF annual potable water usage is expected to be approximately equivalent to the amount consumed by 228 residential homes.. The South Milledge Avenue Site alternative would have access to 3 surface water resources: the North Oconee River, the Middle Oconee River, and the Jackson County Bear Creek Reservoir. The access to 3 surface water resources will help ensure the availability of water in the event that any one of those sources becomes in adequate. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2871 381 Another popular item in Athens is the 2mosquito pellet. They are for the rain barrels. We 3had so many mosquitoes in Athens, Georgia that the fire 4stations give these pellets away for free. We have 5PSA's describing how best to avoid breeding mosquitoes 6around our homes. Yet, now we discover in the DEIS 7that NBAF will have an insectary to breed mosquitoes by 8the thousands to serve as vectors for diseases, some of 9which are fatal to humans. But the DEIS says, No 10problem. Well, a little bit more of a problem in areas 11that have mosquitoes since a breech could cause a 12disease, particularly Rift Valley Fever, to become 13established in the environment. But we were told the 14health and safety effects of NBAF on Athens are 15negligible. 16 We also learned in the DEIS that incineration 17is a possible means of carcass disposal. It would be, 18quote, a major Title V air emissions source. Athens is 19in violation of EPA's standards for ozone and 20particulate matter right now. The DEIS only refers to, 21quote, state compliance continues to be a challenge, 22unquote. But air quality in Athens, effects in Athens, 23minor. The most egregious information, however, came 24in February at our DHS Town Hall meeting called to 25answer our questions.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g., Rift Valley fever virus [RVF]) becoming established in native mosquito populations, particularly in warm, humid climates, was evaluated in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the NBAF. RVF and foot and mouth disease SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. The potential consequences of pesticide use would be evaluated during the preparation of a site-specific response plan. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 9.2 DHS notes the commentor's observations regarding the assessment of Athens area air quality and potential impacts from NBAF operations. Section 3.4.1 of the NBAF EIS describes the methodology used in assessing potential air quality consequences. Section 3.4.3.3.2 describes an emission inventory relative to the South Milledge Avenue Site based on the current state of NBAF design, and Section 3.4.3.1.2 summarizes the 2006 Ambient Air Surveillance Report produced by the Ambient Monitoring Program of Georgia's Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and following site selection and final design, a complete emission inventory would be developed and refined modeling performed as necessary in accordance with state-specific air quality permitting requirements and specifically to show compliance with the NAAQS and the Georgia SIP, if applicable.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2872 391Island sat there and volunteered, and I quote because I 2have the tape, If you look at the eight diseases that 3we are going to work with in this facility, there is 4only one of those diseases that is transmitted through 5aerosol FMD, unquote. 6 According to the DEIS, Dr. Barrett left out 7the three zoonotic diseases that are spread through 8aerosol that can be fatal to humans and two diseases 9completely omitted from any public discussion we now 10find listed in the NBAF feasibility study -- Avian Flu 11and Newcastle. Dr. Barrett also made a point of 12telling us about how small the animals in NBAF will be. 13The DEIS directly contradicts him. 1430 pounds cattle, 141400 pound bison. That's a lot of infected meat. The 15citizens of Athens have been mislead and are tired of 16DHS's blatant disingenuousness. 17 To use your very overuse term, we will 18leverage all the ill-wills caused by DHS's, quote, 19highly competitive acquisition strategy that has 20already disrupted our community. And we will use all 21legal means to keep NBAF away from Athens, Georgia. 22 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, Kathy. The next 23person to speak, next lined up is Grady Thrasher. 24 MR.

Dr. Barrett is the Director of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) is correct in stating that only one of the diseases at PIADC, foot and mouth disease (FMD) can be transmitted through aerosol means. At the NBAF, FMD virus along with three other pathogens, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Rift Valley fever virus can be transmitted through aerosol means.

To bring NBAF 22to Athens, DHS will have to climb a mountain of legal 23briefs and live with a lifetime of public resentment. 24NBAF is not compatible with the character of our town. 25We find your willingness to put us at risk1|25.2 2|15.2 1Cont.|25.2 July 24, 2008, Washington, DC, Washington, DC Page 19 of 24 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.2 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the South Milledge Avenue Site Alternative.

Please understand this for we want it to 3be abundantly clear, the vast majority of the people of 4Athens, Georgia do not want NBAF in their community. 5We will fight you by every lawful means every step of 6the way should you choose to impose NBAF on Athens. 7The DEIS clearly shows that the safest location for 8NBAF, if anywhere at all, would be Plum Island, a 9800-acre island you are already on. The DEIS failed to 10show any compelling reasons for incurring greater risk 11of placing NBAF anywhere on the U.S. mainland. Why 12does DHS persist in this effort? Thank you. 13 MS.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 17.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern about the traffic congestion in the area of the Umstead Research Farm site and the future impact of the NBAF operation on the area's transportation infrastructure. A discussion of the planned improvements to the area's primary transportation corridors of Range Road (SR 1121) and Old Route 75 to alleviate current and future traffc congestion resulting from the NBAF operation at the Umstead Research Farm site is located in Section 3.11.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. All planned improvements are per the recommendations of the Granville County Comprehensive Transportation Plan of October 1, 2007. An evaluation of cumulative impacts for traffic the area of the Umstead Research Farm site is located in Section 3.11.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS.

But, yet, we are told four 2years of construction and traffic will be significant 3but, yet, the environment is not at all analyzed. The 4Highway 75 where the NBAF will be located, the DEIS 5stated that 2.2 cars travel that road per day. It is 63,000 feet from one of the larger federal facilities in 7the United States. I think it is safe to say 2.2 8cars -- more than 2.2 cars travel that road. 9 Waste disposal. We still do not understand 10what type of waste disposal will be used. We don't 11know if we will have an incinerator. We don't know if 12it is a tissue digester. Some of these are so many 13unknowns. And, basically, I think now that the DEIS is 14released, I am happy to say there is more opposition 15now than ever. Thank you. 16 MS. COGHILL: Thank you. 17 MS.

Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF EIS describes the origins of, pretreatment applicable to, and final disposition all of the waste streams that would be generated by the operation of the NBAF EIS. Sanitary sewer wastes are summarized on Table 3.13.2.2-2, waste solids are summarized on Table 3.13.2.2-3, and three technologies being considered for the disposal of carcass/pathological wastes (incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering) are compared on Table 3.13.2.2-4. As discussed in Section 3.13.2.2, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of carcasses and pathological wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual site requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by-products, and operation and maintenance requirements. Because the method of carcass and pathological waste disposal has not yet been determined, Section 3.4. of the NBAF EIS (Air Quality) assumes that the treatment technology with the greatest potential to negatively impact air quality, incineration, will be used to assess the maximum adverse effect. Section 3.4.1 describes the methodology used in assessing potential air quality consequences at each site. Potential construction emissions were extrapolated from a similar facility's construction approach to ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compounds. For operations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dispersion modeling program, SCREEN3, was used to predict potential bounding case emissions at each site based on the current state of facility design. Should a decision be made to build the NBAF and following site selection and final design, a complete emission inventory would be developed and refined modeling performed as necessary in accordance with state-specific air quality permitting requirements. Similarly, because alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest impact on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3 of the EIS (Infrastructure) assumes that alkaline hydrolysis will be used to assess the maximum sanitary sewage impacts. Following site selection, specialized studies would be performed to ensure that wastewater would meet the acceptance criteria of the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority (SGWASA).

And all we learn from state 7of the art is something else that can go wrong. 8 You have the safest site already in your 9possession by your own assessment. Also, a point of 10serious concern for those of us that value the 11residents in Murdock Center and in our psychiatric 12hospital in John Upstead, is the fragility of our 13patients that have absolutely no say.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide adequate funding for safe operation and maintenance, including insuring that the NBAF maintained up to date equipment and operational procedures. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 20.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern that NBAF operations could result in an accident. Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Once the ROD has been signed and prior to the initiation of NBAF operations, a site-specific emergency management plan will be developed that will be coordinated with the local Emergency Management Officer and will include contingency plans for potentially affected residents and institutions. DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated and are presented in Section 3.14. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives.\" Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 19.2 DHS notes the commentor's lack of confidence in the DHS and concerns regarding safe facility operations. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, then site- specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, andChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2877 wildlife populations residing within the area.

DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated and are presented in Section 3.14. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.3 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2886 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 33 1 Susan had is that she'd like clarification on 2 the information that was given.

Are we talking about $69,000,000 in 1|21.3; 2|19.3 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 8 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.3 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of an accident and subsequent potential evacuation on hospitalized population. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are extremely low. Appendix B to the NBAF EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections in the United States and world-wide. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site then site-specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of population, including hospitalized persons, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident condition is considered to be very low probability event. An evacuation would not be necessary if FMDV were accidentally released from NBAF, since FMDV is not a public health threat. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2888 A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The type of, duration, and geographical extent of quarantine would be determined by the appropriate authorities depending on the pathogen released and contamination level.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2889 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 35 1 the county being cost. What happens? 2 MS. COGHILL: Okay. The -- the3 question is what will happen after a release.4 MR. JOHNSON: Let me see if I can5 answer that. A release where -- or a highly6 unlikely event of a release, or introduction of7 Foot and Mouth Disease or any foreign animal8 disease into the country is something that9 requires a response. 10 So, we have a well-defined system for11 reporting, detecting and responding to outbreaks12 of Foot and Mouth Disease, whether it's in the13 unlikely event it gets out of the lab, like Plum14 Island, or comes into the country. That we have15 had -- we have a national plan that involves16 three steps.17 And I would like for Dr. Bill White in the18 USDA -- the USDA has been working on this for a19 number of years. The Animal, Plants and Health20 Inspection Service is responsible for responding21 to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease.22 And we have a very deliberate set of23 sequences.

This is one thing that I think we 2 should put to rest right now. It's not going3 to be necessary for the community to evacuate if4 there is a release of Rift Valley Fever or one5 of the other viruses that they'll be working6 with at the NBAF.7 We faced the same question, for example,8 in the town meetings. They were also worried9 about getting on the Long Island Expressway and 10 trying to get through New York City. And this11 is a blue call incident. This is just -- we are12 working with small, small volumes of virus.13 If there is a release, it would be so14 small that it won't infect one person.15 MS.

The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that future work would be conducted on strictly human pathogens. The pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS include Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study. If not, a new risk assessment would be prepared and a separate NEPA evaluation may be required.\"Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2893 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 39 1 that you will only examine foreign animal 2 disease?3 Will you guarantee that that's all you're4 going to be studying at this facility ten years5 from now, two years from now or fifty years from6 now?7 MR.

As described in Section 3.8.9.1 of the NBAF EIS, depopulation control measures could be undertaken given a worst-case scenario to prevent a widespread outbreak among wildlife and domestic livestock, should an accidental release of the foot and mouth disease virus occur. Section 3.14 and Appendix E investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur and consequences of those accidents. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.Depopulation or population reduction is one of ten potential FMD response stategies developed by the National Park Service. However, the National Park Service recommends the use of other stategies or combinations of strategies to avoid this stategy (see Table 3.8.9-1). A more likely scenario would include one or more of the non-lethal measures described in Table 3.8.9-1. Although the NBAF EIS acknowledges the potential for significant impacts on white-tailed deer in the event of an accidental release, the risk of such a release is extremely low (see Section 3.14). It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas and in areas with abundant wildlife. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Furthermore, the purpose of NBAF is to combat diseases that could have significant effects on wildlife. Research at the NBAF would include the development of vaccines for wildlife that could prevent adverse impacts from a foreign introduction.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2895 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 41 1 reiterate what he -- the ques- -- the answer to 2 my question in Washington concerning deer3 eradication.4 MR.

My understanding of the charts we 10 saw in the back and much of what we've heard11 tonight is -- is that they are part of the12 attempt to decide which of the sites would be13 the best site.14 Since we are clearly dealing with extremely15 dangerous things here, and since we're clearly16 dealing with unpredictable things that we will17 be dealing with in the future, because nobody18 knows what kind of stuff you're going to have to19 study in 10 or 15 or 20 years; and then with20 technology the way it is, there's no way to21 predict it.22 Other than safety, are there any other23 proper considerations to bring in to play other24 than safety, when you're deciding where to put25 this facility? 1|4.0 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 18 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 4.0 Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS and support documents; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the Federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment. The Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary for Science and Technology Jay M. Cohen, with other Department officials, will consider the factors identified above in making final decisions regarding the NBAF. A Record of Decision that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2899 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 45 1 MR. JOHNSON: The question is other 2 than safety, are there any other considerations3 where to put this facility?4 The answer is yes. Safety in the risk5 assessment we've done and the EIS is of paramount6 importance to us. But we do consider other7 factors that go into the decision.8 As I mentioned earlier, we have public9 participation. It is a part of that process. 10 The cost to build and operate this facility is a11 factor. Site characterization is a factor,12 security and technical feasibility.13 So, we look at the range of information14 that's in those factors and try to make an15 informed decision. The other thing that goes16 into play is when we were doing our screening of17 the sites, we factored in what was important in18 terms of collaboration with research. You know,19 if we're going to have a facility for the next20 50 years, we want to be able to make sure we21 have some proximity for researchers and22 universities and vet schools, so we can be able23 to have a collaboration and to be able to24 recruit scientists and --25 MR.

At 2 what point would we know the weight that's given3 to safety of a community versus the weight4 that's given to things that you've mentioned,5 such as convenience and that sort of thing?6 At what point could we see a nice7 Powerpoint point slide saying, safety is just 308 percent, and we have these other 70 percent; or9 what we'd like to see is, safety is 99 percent 10 and somebody's convenience -- if I were a11 researcher who's got to fly across the country12 to do his work, that's a very small part.13 Is there any point in this process where14 we could actually see the decision making, know15 all the factors that go into the decision16 making; or are we just supposed to think, well,17 they did some safety studies, so I guess they18 must know what they're doing in safety?19 I assume your safety people do know what20 they're doing with safety. What I would like to21 know is what Homeland Security -- how much they22 weight those safety considerations, because it23 doesn't seem to me that anything else is as24 important.25 MR. JOHNSON: Okay.

A case in point is Plum4 Island. We currently operate -- DHS is5 currently responsible for operating Plum Island.6 And when we took over the facility in7 2003, we spent a lot of money upgrading Plum8 Island to make sure that it was safe and secure9 and can operate in a safe manner; not just for 10 the workers but around the public. I envision11 fully that we will take that mind set for NBAF.12 No matter where it's built, it has to be13 and will be a safe and secure facility. We will14 apply the layers of safety, the layers of15 security, depending on the risks that we're16 trying to mitigate. So, I in no way want to17 undermine the -- or for anybody to feel that18 we're not going to put safety first.19 For me, it's the highest priority. Again,20 we have to factor in other things as well, but21 safety is our priority.22 MS. COGHILL: Thank you, David. 23 Folks, we have five minutes left of the Q and24 A. Let's move it along.

On September 15th,23 1978, there was a news release that said, \"Foot24 and Mouth Disease has been diagnosed in cattle25 in pre-experimental animal holding facilities at 1| 21.1 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 23 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.1 The evaluation of an accidental release of foot and mouth disease virus is presented in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS and includes national-scale economic consequences as well as local economic consequences. As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2904 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 50 1 the Plum Island Animal Disease Center,\" which I 2 think most people here are probably aware that3 there was an outbreak at that time.4 And the only reason, presumably, that it5 didn't make it to the mainland was because it6 was on the island. In 1982, the Federal Review7 Board -- begun after the Foot and Mouth Disease8 outbreak -- issued its annual report in which9 they said, quote, \"We believe there is a 10 potentially dangerous situation, and that11 without an immediate massive effort to correct12 efficiencies, a severe accident could result.13 \"Lack of preventive maintenance, pressures14 by management to expedite programs have resulted15 in compromising safety.\"16 We know that in 2001, there was an17 outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in England18 from the Pirbright Laboratory, which resulted in19 a massive slaughter of cattle.20 Ten million cattle and sheep had to be21 slaughtered to contain that outbreak. And,22 thankfully, the U.S. Congress passed a law in23 1948, Public Law 48-496, which states that, \"No24 live virus of Foot and Mouth Disease may be25 introduced for any purpose into any part of the1 cont.| 21.1 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 24 of 115 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2905 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 51 1 mainland of the United States, except the 2 coastal islands, separated therefrom by waters3 navigable for deep water navigation, and which4 shall not be connected at the mainland by any5 tunnel.\"6 In light of those accidents, and the7 existing federal law, how do you expect to8 legally bring Foot and Mouth Disease to Butner,9 and how do you justify it? 10 MR. JOHNSON: The question on the law,11 I think it would be good to update folks, in12 case they haven't been following it, but the13 Congress did pass a Farm Bill that says that the14 Secretary of Agriculture shall issue a permit to15 the Secretary of Homeland Security to any16 successive facility to Plum Island.17 And there was no -- it was not tied to18 Plum Island or a body of water.

The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS show that even though the Plum Island Site Alternative has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites.Security concerns will be considered in the selection of the preferred alternative. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's position and concern for locating NBAF on a mainland site. DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). NEPA requires all reasonable alternatives to be considered and that includes consideration of mainland sites. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated on the mainland. Prior to passage of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (H.R. 6124 [2008 Farm Bill]) which became law on May 22, 2008, the United States Code (21 U.S.C.Section 113a) stipulated that live FMD virus could not be studied on the U.S. mainland unless the Secretary of Agriculture made a determination that such study was necessary and in the public interest and issued a permit for such research to be conducted on the mainland. Section 7524 of the 2008 Farm Bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a permit to the Secretary of Homeland Security for work on the live virus of FMD at any facility that is a successor to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center and charged with researching high-consequence biological threats involving zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. The permit is limited to a single successor facility.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2906 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 52 1 has not been repealed, correct? 2 MR.

If I might ask one more short8 question, I understand that up to 50 different9 pathogens may be stored at this facility, and 10 that only three were studied in the EIS.11 I know of one in particular that's a BSL-412 virus, the Hendra virus, which apparently was13 not part of the EIS.

As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS anticipates that NBAF research would initially focus on five pathogens including African swine fever, classical swine fever, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, FMD virus, Japanese encephalitis, and RVF virus, Hendra, virus, and Nipah virus. The NBAF research mission would be based on current pathogen and disease risk assessments, subject to change as threats and risk assessments change. The human health and safety and economic effects of an accidental release of FMD virus, RVF virus, and Nipah virus are presented in Section 3.10 and Section 3.14 and in Appendix D and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The diseases caused by these three pathogens sufficiently cover the spectrum of outcomes likely to occur if any pathogens to be studied at the proposed NBAF were to be released to the environment. However, should a decision be made to construct and operate NBAF, the North American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank, currently located at PIADC, would be transitioned to NBAF along with pathogen repository maintained by he PIADC Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL). FADDL maintains the ability to identify/diagnose up to 30 foreign animal diseases (FADs). The FADDL-maintained pathogen repository consists of very small quantities of pathogens which are not studied or actively researched but which are maintained in a secure state for the exclusive purpose of aiding disease diagnosis.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2908 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 54 1 cover Hendra as well, because the impacts would 2 either be equal to or less than Nipah.3 DR.

The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.

In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release.

Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study.

DHS is aware of the presence of the mental health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the mental health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Section 3.13.2.2 in Chapter 3 of the NBAF EIS addresses the technologies being considered for the treatment and disposal of animal carcasses and pathological waste. Burial of animal carcasses in not being considered as a disposal alternative. Table 3.13.2.2-4 provides a brief description and comparison of the three most likely technologies being considered (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As discussed in this section, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of these wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual site requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by-products, and operation and maintenance requirements. Because the method of carcass and pathological waste disposal has not yet been determined, Section 3.4. of the EIS (Air Quality) assumes that the treatment technology with the greatest potential to negatively impact air quality, incineration, will be used to assess the maximum adverse effect. Similarly, because alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest impact on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3 of the EIS (Infrastructure) assumes that alkaline hydrolysis will be used to assess the maximum sanitary sewage impacts.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2919 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 65 1 These animals will be injected with 2 incurable diseases, and they're going to die. 3 If you bury them, it will be some more in the4 water system.

As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection process including site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.

Chapter 1, Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS identifies DHS's mission as the study of foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The goal or benefit of NBAF is to prevent these animal diseases from spreading in the United States through research into the transmission of these animal diseases and the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. DHS also notes the commentor's statement that the NBAF will be exempt from the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The information used in the preparation of the NBAF EIS will be included in the Administrative Record. NBAF could be subject to FOIA and any exemptions that might apply to a given document. The DHS FOIA office will respond to all requests for documents.

And the -- the people in New Mexico fought7 this vehemently, specifically because they8 believed that it was a biological weapons lab9 facility, as many people do here tonight. 10 So -- which brings up another question11 about the exemption from the Freedom of12 Information Act. This is very troubling. And13 this should be a very transparent process, and14 it's unclear to me why this project is exempt15 from the Freedom of Information Act.16 Finally, we -- I think that my request to17 you would be to remove the exemption and bring18 this out in the open, because if this is truly19 what you say it is, the public -- the people of20 Butner and the rest of the country need to know21 about this; no secrets.22 Get rid of the cloak of secrecy, and I23 think that this whole process will be much24 further along.

Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and the site selected, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 13.3 DHS acknowledges the commentor's concern regarding wildlife impacts at the Umstead Research Farm Site. The susceptibility of native wildlife to foreign animal diseases necessitates additional research to further evaluate the potential adverse effects of foreign animal diseases. Research will enable the preparation of response plans that focus on species that are likely to affected, and the development of vaccines for wildlife would be part of the NBAF mission. Introduction of a foreign animal disease into the U.S., whether unintentional or intentional (as an agent of bioterror, for example), might go undetected for a relatively long period of time. Once detected, the necessary time required for response mobilization would further delay containment of the outbreak. Delays in detection and response would increase the potential for a widespread outbreak among wildlife populations. In the event of a widespread outbreak, the availability of effective vaccines for wildlife could prevent devastating impacts on wildlife populations and could be the only means of preventing the extirpation of endangered or otherwise vulnerable native species. The development of response plans and vaccines that focus on susceptible species would enhance the capability to protect native wildlife against the foreign introduction of diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease and Rift Valley fever.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for outside insect vector penetration, laboratory- acquired infections, vector escape and accidental releases. A discussion of insectary operations is contained in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 and elsewhere in the NBAF EIS. Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1.1 (Biosafety Design) of the NBAF EIS, also provides a discussion of the biosafety fundamentals, goals and design criteria for the NBAF operation. In addition, information has been added to Chapter 2 regarding operations and containment of arthropod vectors. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts each of which has the potential to release a vector. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release of a vector are low. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (APHIS). An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations surrounding the Umstead Research Farm Site is specifically addressed in Chapter 3, Section 3.8.9 and Section 3.10.9.5 as well as in Section 3.14.4.5 (Health and Safety). Section 3.10.9.5 discusses the relative suitability of the regional climate of the Umstead Research Farm Site to promote mosquito survival and virus spread based on the extensive discussion contained in Section 3.4.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. As such, the RVF response plan would include a mosquito control action plan, and the potential consequences of pesticide use in mosquito control would be evaluated during the preparation of a site specific response plan.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2926 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 72 1 Caroline Dyer-Gonn.

However, as described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, the purpose and need for the proposed action encompasses the need for integrated, BSL-4 laboratories in the United States necessary to conduct research and develop countermeasures for zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. Other locations to construct the NBAF were considered in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS. These alternatives were considered but eliminated from detailed study in the EIS based on the evaluation criteria calling for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. These alternatives included remote locations such as an island, desert, or arctic habitat distant from populated areas or inhospitable to escaped animal hosts/vectors.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2928 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 74 1 countries.

Section 3.4.1 of the NBAF EIS describes the methodology used in assessing potential air quality consequences at each site. Based on the state of facility design, a potential bounding case condition was described using primary emission sources including boilers, emergency generators, and an incinerator as the refuse disposal method. For operations, the U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program, SCREEN3, was used to predict potential pollutant concentrations at each site. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and following site selection and final design, a complete emission inventory would be developed and refined modeling performed as necessary in accordance with state-specific air quality permitting requirements Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's question regarding the position of Senator Clinton and Representative Bishop of New York. Both the Senator and Congressman support maintaining the existing level of BSL-3 research being performed at PIADC and oppose the addition of BSL-4 research and facilities.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2931 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 77 1 again, I'm a physician by trade.

Consideration of mechanisms for the public to serve in an advisory or oversight capacity of NBAF operations is not within the scope of the NBAF EIS, which presents the need for and evaluates the environmental impacts of the alternatives for constructing and operating the NBAF. However, should a decision be made to build the NBAF, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. The information used in the preparation of the NBAF EIS will be included in the Administrative Record. NBAF could be subject to FOIA and any exemptions that might apply to a given document.

DHS also notes that the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extreemly low. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. DHS also notes the commentor's concern that carcass disposal practices will be limited to incineration. Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS describes the processes that would be used to control and dispose of liquid and solid waste from the NBAF and Sections 3.3 and 3.7 of the NBAF EIS describing standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential effects of spills and runoff. Since the method of carcass disposal has not yet been determined, the effects of alkaline hydrolysis, rendering and incineration were included in the analysis presented in Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS. Incineration has the potential to affect air quality, so the evaluation in Section 3.4 (Air Quality) assumed only incineration would be used to assess the greatest adverse effect. Alkaline hydrolysis and rendering would have the greatest effect on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3, so the sanitary sewage effects were determined using these method.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2935 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 81 1 guarantee us safety of the lab, but you can 2 guarantee us one thing, and that's for sure. 3 The waste from this facility -- and one of the4 reasons that you didn't speak, sir, about the5 envir- -- the environmental impact of the waste6 is because you dare not tell this community that7 you're going to burn it.8 This is a community that fought an9 incinerator, and my community and communities 10 all over this region have fought landfills, and11 you cannot do anything without waste --12 (Interruption by audience applause.)13 And when you burn that waste, there will14 be no oversight.

Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF presents detailed information on the liquid and solid waste streams that could be generated by the operation of the facility, proposed onsite pretreatment methodologies, and the types of offsite waste management facilities where additional treatment and disposal could occur. DHS notes commentor's concern regarding the possibility that DHS would build an incinerator at the NBAF. As discussed in Section 3.13.2.2, however, onsite incineration is only being considered for carcass/pathological waste disposal, and it is only one of the technologies being considered. Other types of waste solids will be autoclaved, decontaminated, or disinfected onsite with additional treatment (if necessary) and disposal occurring at offsite facilities. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 9.3 The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from incineration. Site-specific effects at the Umstead Research Farm Site are discussed in Section 3.4.7. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated using SCREEN3, a U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Carcass/pathological waste disposal, including incineration, is discussed in Section 3.13. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2936 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 82 1 hazardous waste. 2 When you have a facility that's the size3 of five Wal-Marts, you're going to create a lot4 of waste.

DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, 3.14, and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS, provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. DHS also notes the commentor's concern regarding the proper treatment and disposal of the wastes generated from the NBAF operation. Disposal and decontamination (killing or inactivation of bacteria and fungi and viruses, respectively) procedures have a long and proven history of effectiveness when facilities are well maintained and procedures followed. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, identifies the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release.

And in 1971, representatives from the4 USDA proclaimed that, quote, \"Plum Island is5 considered the safest in the world on virus6 diseases. As proof of this statement, there has7 never been a disease outbreak among the8 susceptible animals maintained outside the9 laboratory on the island since it was 10 established.\"11 Well, as we know, that changed in 1978, as12 I described before, with the release of the Foot13 and Mouth Disease Virus into the14 pre-experimental animal holding facility. And15 in 1982, the Federal Review Board found that16 there was a dangerous situation that was due to17 management's inclination to expedite programs,18 resulting in compromising safety.19 In 1991, the federal government decided to20 privatize Plum Island. And the New Jersey21 company, which was the low bidder on the22 contract, took over. And in order to cut costs,23 they reduced expenses for safety and security24 measures.25 In 1991, following that change, there was 2|21.1 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 58 of 115 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.1 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts.

As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2939 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 85 1 underground cable supplying lab 257 at the Plum 2 Island facility, which some of you have read the3 book about -- about lab 257 and will know about4 this.5 And following that, in -- in -- in August6 of 1991, Hurricane Bob hit Plum Island and7 knocked over the overhead power box, which was8 the back-up power for the facility.9 And as a consequence, the freezers 10 containing virus samples defrosted.

COGHILL: Larry Petrovik, Chris11 Jackson and Kathryn Spann.12 MR. PETROVIK: Thank you for the13 opportunity to speak tonight. My name is Larry14 Petrovik, and I'm a Granville County landowner. 15 I am opposed to the Department of Homeland16 Security's plan to site the National Bio-Agro17 Defense Lab in Butner, North Carolina.18 It will create significant public health19 and safety hazards for not only Butner but also20 the entire Triangle region. Here are some of my21 concerns. According to the EIS statement, page22 2-42, \"Should a release of a certain vector23 borne pathogen occur, impacts such as aerial24 spraying of insecticides could directly affect25 minority and low income communities and other2 cont.| 12.3 1 cont.| 25.3 1|25.3 2|21.3; 3|15.3 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 63 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.3 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site-specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. RVF and FMD SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. The potential consequences of pesticide use would be evaluated during the preparation of a site specific response plan. As described in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS an analysis was conducted to determine if the proposedChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2944 project alternatives would have a disproportionally high and adverse impact on low-income or minority populations under normal operations. The analysis determined that no disproportionately high and adverse effects to environmental or human resources are evident with any of the alternatives.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2945 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 90 1 populations immediately adjacent to the site.\" 2 This is simply not an acceptable risk.

This is not8 acceptable.

A listing of infrastructure and traffic improvements required for the construction and operation of the proposed NBAF at all site alternatives is located in Section 3.1.2, Table 3.1.1.1 - Infrastructure and Traffic Improvement Required for Construction and Operation of the Proposed NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Consideration of mechanisms for the public to serve in an advisory or oversight capacity of NBAF operations is not within the scope of the NBAF EIS, which presents the need for and evaluates the environmental impacts of the alternatives for constructing and operating the NBAF. However, should a decision be made to build the NBAF, DHS would begin transition and operational planning which would include consideration of policies and procedures for public participation, education, and also public advisory initiatives. After DHS determines the viability and nature of such a public advisory and oversight function, appropriate roles and responsibilities would be defined. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes the commentor's opinion regarding the length of the public comment period. Council on Environmental Quality regulation 40 CFR 1506.10(c) requires that a minimum of 45 days be allowed for public comment on the NBAF Draft EIS. A period of 60 days was provided for public review and comment on the NBAF Draft EIS, which spanned from June 27 through August 25, 2008. During this comment period, public meetings were held in the vicinity of the NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. DHS also accepted comments submitted by mail, telephone and fax lines, and online through the NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). All comments, both oral and written, received during the comment period were given equal consideration and were responded to in the NBAF Final EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2950 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 95 1 maker to hold an additional public comment 2 period.

Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program and has been as forthcoming as possible in disseminating information about NBAF as program planning has matured over time. The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. A period of 60 days was provided for public review and comment on the NBAF Draft EIS, which spanned from June 27 through August 25, 2008. During this comment period, public meetings were held in of the vicinity of the NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. DHS also accepted comments submitted by mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, and online through the NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). All comments, both oral and written, received during the comment period were given equal consideration and were responded to in the NBAF Final EIS. Decisions on whether to construct and operate the NBAF and, if so, where, will be based on the analyses presented in the NBAF EIS and other factors such as cost, engineering and technical feasibility, strategic considerations, policy considerations, and public input. A Record of Decision (ROD) that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.

In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Additionally, A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only)(TRA) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2957 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 102 1 safety monitors in whose interest it is to find 2 the safety problems.3 And I'm afraid that is just one hundred4 percent out of the culture of Homeland Security.5 It is not an organization that could possibly do6 it.

The NBAF EIS Chapter 3 Section 3.7.7 describes the Umstead Research Park Site alternative's water resources affects including permitting and planning options available to prevent and mitigate potential spill and runoff affects. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS held a competitive process to select potential sites for the proposed NBAF as described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS. A multi-disciplinary team of engineers, scientists, lawyers, academics and communicators from the departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Defense reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF.

Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement regarding lack of trust relative to DHS and greater openness. Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program and has been as forthcoming as possible in disseminating information about NBAF as program planning has matured over time. The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of a range of reasonable alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. State-of-the-art biocontainment facilities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. A period of 60 days was provided for public review and comment on the NBAF Draft EIS, which spanned from June 27 through August 25, 2008. During this comment period, public meetings were held in of the vicinity of the NBAF site alternatives and in Washington, D.C. DHS also accepted comments submitted by mail, %toll-free telephone% and fax lines, and online through the NBAF Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). All comments, both oral and written, received during the comment period were given equal consideration and were responded to in the NBAF Final EIS. Decisions on whether to construct and operate the NBAF and, if so, where, will be based on the analyses presented in the NBAF EIS and other factors such as cost, engineering and technical feasibility, strategic considerations, policy considerations, and public input. A Record of Decision (ROD) that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.

Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program, and it is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance. To date, DHS has provided two opportunities for the public to provide comment and input to the environmental impact analyses presented in the NBAF EIS. DHS gave equal consideration to all comments, regardless of how or where they were received. All comments received during the public comment periods have been considered in this NBAF EIS. Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The NBAF EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology, Jay M. Cohen, with other Department officials, will consider the factors identified above in making final decisions regarding the NBAF. A Record of Decision (ROD) that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2961 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 106 1 facility.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Appendix B to the NBAF EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections in the United States and world-wide. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site then site-specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of populations, including institutionalized populations, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation in response to an accident is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site- specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF.

The potential effects of NBAF operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS and includes the potential effects from traffic and NBAF operations. Site-specific effects at the Umstead Research Farm Site alternative are discussed in Section 3.4.7. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated using SCREEN3, a U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program. Conservative assumptions were used to ensure the probable maximum effects were evaluated. Once the final design is determined, a more refined air emissions model will be used during the permitting process. The final design will ensure that the NBAF %does not significantly affect% the region's ability to meet air quality standards. The NBAF EIS Section 3.4 describes both the 1997 and the 2008 ozone 8 hour standard.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2972 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 117 1 he said more than likely, the Triangle Area will 2 be a non-attainment again.

Since the inception of the NBAF project, DHS has supported a vigorous public outreach program. DHS has conducted public meetings in excess of the minimum required by NEPA regulations; to date, 23 public meetings have been held in the vicinity of NBAF site alternatives and in Washington D.C. to solicit public input on the EIS, allow the public to voice their concerns, and to get their questions answered DHS has also provided fact sheets, reports, exhibits, and a Web page (http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf). Additionally, various means of communication (mail, telephone and fax lines, and NBAF Web site) have been provided to facilitate public comment. It is DHS policy to encourage public input on matters of national and international importance. DHS is committed to free and open public involvement during development of the NBAF EIS and welcomes comments. DHS's decisions on whether the NBAF should be built, and, if so where, will be based on environmental analyses, public and agency comments, mission requirements, national policy considerations, life- cycle costs, site characterization, security, and other programmatic considerations.

Sections 3.3.7 and 3.11.7 of the NBAF EIS include an assessment of the current utility and transportation infrastructure at the Umstead Research Farm Site, the potential impact and effects from construction and operation of the NBAF, and the planned utility and transportation improvements to meet the operational requirements of the NBAF. While the potential costs of proposed actions are not a factor in the environmental impact analysis presented in the NBAF EIS, cost information of the NBAF alternatives is summarized in Section 2.5, Table 2.5.1-1, to provide pertinent information to the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology so that he may make a more informed decision with respect to the alternatives presented in the NBAF EIS. Infrastructure costs were analyzed and included in the final costs provided in the NBAF EIS. Additionally, the Site Cost Analysis Report, available on the NBAF Web Site for public review and discussed in Section 2.6, is one of several reports that will be considered in addition to the NBAF EIS, in selecting the Preferred Alternative for the Final EIS and ROD. Funding for the design, construction, and operations for the NBAF will come from the Federal Government. Proposals for offsets to the site infrastructure (part of thr construction costs) were requested by the Federal government. The decision as to what to offer (land donation, funding, other assets) is solely as the discretion of the consortium, state and local officials as part of the consortium bid site package. The amount of funding and how the funding is paid for (bonds, taxes, etc) is determined by the state and local government officials and not the decision of the Federal government. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS describes the processes that would be used to control and dispose of liquid and solid waste from the NBAF, with Sections 3.3 and 3.7 of the NBAF EIS describing the standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential effects of spills and runoff. Since the method of carcass disposal has not yet been determined, therefore, the facility design has not yet been finalized, the effects of alkaline hydrolysis, incineration, and rendering were included in the analysis presented in Section 3.13 of the NBAF EIS. Incineration has the potential to affect air quality, so the evaluation in Section 3.4 (Air Quality) of the NBAF EIS assumed only incineration would be used to assess the greatest adverse effect . Alkaline hydrolysis would have the greatest effect on sanitary sewage capacity, Section 3.3, so the sanitary sewage effects were determined using this method. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 18.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As discussed in Section 3.13.2.2 of the NBAF EIS, several different technologies are being considered for carcass and pathological waste disposal. Table 3.13.2.2-4 provides a brief description and comparison of the three most likely technologies being considered (i.e., incineration, alkaline hydrolysis, and rendering). As discussed in this section, the final design for the NBAF will probably include more than one technology for the treatment of these wastes. Factors that may be considered in making this technology decision include individual siteChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2975 requirements and restrictions, air emissions, liquid and solid waste stream by-products, and operation and maintenance requirements. Section 3.13.1.2 of the NBAF also presents information on the origins of, pretreatment requirements applicable to, and disposition of wastes that will be discharged to the sanitary sewer or sent offsite to a solid or hazardous waste management facility. Burial of animal carcasses and pathological wastes is not discussed in Section 3.13.2.2 because this method of waste disposal is not being considered for the NBAF. Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2976 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 120 1 Environmental Impact Statement that does not 2 include incineration or tissue digest or the --3 the alkaline hydrolysis.4 We do not know how you will get rid of5 thousands of carcasses or thousands of pounds of6 daily waste.

Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14. Once delivered to the NBAF, animals would be contained within inside holding areas, and only non- infected animals would be kept in this area. The indoor holding facility would reduce the possibility of an animal escaping, and experimented animals would be contained in the biosafety holding areas until decontamination and disposal. As described in Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, based on 70% utilization of the design maximum projected research demands resulted in a facility design that could house approximately 200 to 300 animals at any given time.

The international treaty, known as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and acquisition of such weapons. DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2980 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 124 1 Washington, one liter.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies. DHS would have site-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. The likelihood of a member of the public coming down with an illness as a result of an NBAF accident is low.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2981 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 125 1 You're up.

The evidence from Plum18 Island, you know, just shows that. It's been19 said, but I won't re-state it. So, my question20 is, how long -- you know, this is a trade-off.21 How long is acceptable for safety?

Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2982 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 126 1 MR.

Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.3 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2986 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 130 1 shouldn't. 2 What I want to tell you is, we've been3 here before. Therma-Chem was putting a4 hazardous waste incinerator out here, and we5 stopped 'em. They left the state. The state6 has lost -- it was either 3 or $4,000,000, but7 they left the state. And they had the8 governor's backing on it.9 I was in the room with the Council of 10 State when it was voted down, and they were11 voted out. We stood in front of a drill bit12 coming down like this (indicating) with blades13 all around it. My wife was one of 'em. She14 got hauled off in the prison bus -- if you don't15 think we're serious -- as did a lot of these16 people out here wearing GNAT shirts and some17 others also -- and taken to Oxford to the18 courthouse.19 I went home and beat 'em there.

The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2989 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 133 1 MR. COMBS: I don't know how many of 2 you people have ever worked in a laboratory. 3 Anybody? No. I've worked in labs for 404 years, basic research. Now, let me tell you5 what can happen. The man said, the engineer,6 about Murphy's Law. I was in the company and7 was working with U-235.8 And what happened was, I was elected to do9 the first part of the experiment. I was also 10 on the safety committee that approved all this. 11 We had a nuclear regulatory agent there with us12 to supervise and to see everything was13 copastetic.14 They went to eat, probably about from here15 to the back of the room, in the cafeteria. 16 There was about 120 researchers in there. What17 happened was, I was operating the experiment,18 and watching the view and everything, and I had19 a meter that measured temperature, 2000 degrees20 Centigrade.21 Then immediately, it went bang. I walked22 out of there, and I had full gear on to protect23 me from radiation. All I saw was smoke. I got24 scared. I went out, walked over to the people.25 They knew immediately when I got there something July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 107 of 115 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2990 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 134 1 was wrong. 2 By the time it took me to go to the back3 of the room and up here, this had gone through4 ten inches of concrete, three inches of steel5 subfloor, went into the basement. Now, you6 could see this. You people can't see viruses.7 The only way you're going to know if a8 virus has got out is when people start dying or9 animals start dying, or people who shoot deer 10 and eat the deer and pick up this. That's the11 only way you're going to know that you have a12 containment problem, because you can't see what13 you're working with.14 It's in the microscopic -- down into the15 nano-liters and lower to get into cells. So,16 you're all sitting up here, having no laboratory17 experience, and you're telling these people it's18 safe. Let me tell you, Murphy's Law happened19 with me in that experiment.20 There were three other experiments that I21 had -- to keep it short, something went wrong. 22 Two of 'em put me in the hospital. And I want23 to say to you tonight, and I know it's going to24 go wrong, and it went wrong. Nobody knows. 25 They even tried to duplicate one of the 1|21.0 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 108 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of an pathogen release on the local population, livestock industry, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Lastly, the Record of Decision would identify detection techniques, monitoring frequencies and enforcement programs for the control and regulation of releases from the facility. The determination of criminal or civil liability arising from an accidental or intentional release of a pathogen is beyond the scope of this EIS. It is also not possible to accept or reject a claim for damages until the specific facts of an incident are known and the applicable local, state or Federal law is applied.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2991 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 135 1 experiments, and they couldn't.

Earlier, the gentleman6 who was talking about the risks in the7 Environmental Impact Statement -- I'm not a8 scientist, and I don't know if I mis-heard. I'm9 hoping he mis-spoke. 10 The Nipah virus is used to look at the11 risk for all BSL-4 viruses, which y'all say12 would be studied here -- so Nipah and the Hendra13 virus. And I would like this answered in the14 final Environmental Impact Statement. What you15 said was that the Nipah virus -- \"We do not16 expect it to propagate at Butner because of the17 lack of vectors.\"18 And there's a packet of information that19 y'all gave us, and I was reading through it as20 you were saying this. Earlier in the very21 beginning, when you talked about risks, you said22 that common vectors were ticks and mosquitos.23 I looked at this. This virus is -- or is24 not known to cause disease in humans and pigs. 25 All four of these are things that are in 1|21.3 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Evening Page 109 of 115 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentors concern. The fruit bat is the vector for Nipah virus, and fruit bats do not occur in North America. Therefore, the Nipah virus is not expected to propogate at Butner because of the lack of vectors.

So, I'm not -- I don't 2 understand how that's a low risk. And as if3 that -- that was concerning enough, but when I4 read further in the packet that you gave us, it5 says, \"For the Nipah virus, the mode of6 transmission between animals and from animals to7 humans is uncertain.\"8 So, I would like for you to explain where9 you decided -- how you decided this was a low 10 risk. Given that we have humans, pigs,11 mosquitos and ticks, and you don't know how it's12 transmitted. Thank you.13 MR. RHEW: I just have one simple14 comment.

Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the pathogens that would be studied in the NBAF. By definition and as identified in Section 1.1 of the NBAF EIS, BSL-4 facilities are specifically designed to safely handle exotic pathogens that pose a high risk of life threatening disease in animals and humans through the aerosol route and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy. It is because of the risks posed that the NBAF is needed in order to provide a modern, integrated high- containment facility to safely and effectively address the accidental or intentional introduction of animal diseases of high consequence into the United States.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2993 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 137 1 it's important to note that the facility that is 2 planned for Butner is different, as was3 mentioned by one of the speakers.4 And the important distinction is that it's5 -- it's going to be a BSL-4 facility, which --6 although the -- it's been stressed that this7 facility is studying animal diseases, the -- the8 viruses that are studied in a BSL-4 facility are9 by definition lethal to humans. 10 They are zoonotic viruses that can jump11 from animals to humans. And according to the12 National Institute of Biology and Infectious13 Disease, the organisms to be studied at the14 facility, the proposed Butner lab, would be,15 quote, \"The most -- the world's most dangerous16 microbes; several capable of rapid widespread17 human depopulation.\"18 Now, this is a government organization that19 has been quoted as saying this. Some of these20 -- there's only one that I'm aware of in this21 category that has ever existed in the United22 States.

The international treaty, known as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and acquisition of such weapons. DHS's mission is to study foreign animal and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The purpose of the NBAF would be to develop tests to detect foreign animal and zoonotic diseases and develop vaccines (or other countermeasures such as antiviral therapies) to protect agriculture and food systems in the United States.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2994 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 138 1 it's a little bit difficult to understand how 2 these pose a threat to our food supply, except3 potentially from bio-terrorism.

As stated in the NBAF EIS, the housing market would be able to meet the increase in housing demand (326 employees in total), relative to the estimated growth of the existing population between 2007 and 2012 (188,278). It is possible that with the relocation of highly skilled workers to the immediate area, property values could increase due to an increase in demand, and there is no empirical evidence that a facility such as the NBAF would reduce property values in the study area. Therefore, the overall effect of the NBAF on housing market conditions would be negligible.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-2996 fd619e05-95cc-4f83-b516-8bbdc8e6aa21DHS Evening Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 140 1 area, you know, or how drastic would the drop -- 2 a drop it might be.3 And what's the -- what's the problem with4 sending it to a more remote area, such as, like,5 New Mexico where there's already been tests6 going on, you know -- just somewhere else like7 that.

As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the EOI.

The pathogens to be studied at the NBAF as provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS include Foot and Mouth Disease virus, Classical Swine Fever virus, Vesicular Stomatitis virus, Rift Valley Fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and African Swine Fever virus. Should the NBAF be directed to study any pathogens not included in the list of pathogens included in the NBAF EIS, DHS and USDA would conduct an evaluate of the new pathogen(s) to determine if the potential challenges and consequences were bounded by the current study. If not, a new risk assessment would be prepared and a separate NEPA evaluation may be required.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3004 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 33 1 purposes. 2 MS.

We don't know how11 many people from Plum Island -- no matter where12 the site, whether it's next door to Plum Island13 or on the mainland, we don't know how many14 people will actually transfer.15 We did try to estimate that, but no matter16 where it's sited, we have to fill a lot of the17 jobs from local communities. Currently, the18 scientists will be recruited not from the19 community but nationally. So, 326 jobs, as was20 said in the EIS for the facility.21 We suspect once the site is chosen, other22 small businesses may relocate to the area, and23 kind of piggyback off of that, and that's where24 you see the higher number.

Do you15 gentlemen know where science will be in 20 years?16 Twenty years ago when I was in school, I17 don't think there's anything left in my science18 book from school that still holds true.

Appendix E, Section E.4 of the NBAF EIS includes discussion of a scenario which in part considers a figure of approximately 600 NBAF staff. This conservative scenario was used to provide for bounding case results in demonstrating failure probabilities over the life of the NBAF rather than to reflect proposed staffing levels. As noted in Section 2.2.2.1, the proposed NBAF would employ between 250 and 350 workers at the facility once it becomes operational. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. The actual number of permanent NBAF jobs has not yet been determined; however, the number used in the socioeconomic analysis (326) was used by DHS to estimate operating costs for the NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3012 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 41 1 MS.

Appendix B of the NBAF EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections in the United States and world-wide. Of the nine FMD incidents at PIADC since 1954, only the one accident in 1978 resulted in the release of FMD from the biocontainment facility. The remainder of the incidents at the PIADC were cases of cross- contamination and did not result in the release of a pathogen outside the containment of the laboratory.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3013 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 42 1 MS. COGHILL: The question for 2 clarification purposes is there's one accident3 that was noted in 1978 that was considered, and4 there are nine in appendix B that were noted as5 a release.6 MR. JOHNSON: Yeah, I think as Dr.7 Barrett indicated, we had one release in 1978. 8 In the other cases, I think they were referred9 to as cross-contaminations. They never got out 10 of the laboratory. They stayed in the11 laboratory. They're not considered a release in12 the laboratory. Dr. Barrett, do you want to13 clarify that?14 DR. BARRETT: Yes. There were15 actually seven cross-contaminations in the16 laboratory. This would be a situation where you17 had an animal in one room, and then through a18 leak or something it was released across the19 room or something like that. That's considered20 a cross-contamination. You know, the agent was21 released within the facility, but we didn't have22 a release out of the facility there.

We're there to greet8 the package and take it through Customs and9 Border Patrol. From that point on, the package 10 which is very safely packed -- you know, it's a11 combination of a very sturdy box with the sample12 inside a container, inside a secondary13 container, inside the primary container.14 Anyway, this package is put inside one of15 our courier vehicles and is transported by16 certified couriers from, say, JFK Airport to17 Plum Island. Now, these courier vehicles are18 hardened. These vehicles actually have cages19 inside. So, no one can just reach through the20 window or open the door and take a box. Okay?21 Number two, these vehicles all have GPS22 units in them. So, whenever a courier goes to23 JFK to pick up a box, they are monitored in24 real time by GPS and also by cell phone.25 MS.

AUSTIN: Austin, and I'm from14 Butner and also with GNAT. In looking at your15 presentation, you said you looked at air16 quality, infrastructure, traffic and17 transportation and visual. In your draft and in18 your presentation, you did not note public19 support. At the scoping session that you20 conducted, part of your decision reads public21 support.22 I think that is a very major part that was23 overlooked in your EIS draft, sir.

Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The NBAF EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS; 3) applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment.

While public support will be part of the decision making process, the NEPA process requires that the public be informed of the proposed action and is provided with a mechanism to provide comments. DHS is committed to providing public access to pertinent information. To date, DHS has provided two opportunities for the public to provide comment and input to the environmental impact analyses presented in the NBAF EIS. An initial scoping comment period of 60 days followed the issuance of a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS. Once a draft of the EIS was published, another notice was issued that provided 60 days for comment. DHS accepted comments submitted by various means: mail, toll-free telephone and fax lines, NBAF Web page, and public meetings. DHS gave equal consideration to all comments, regardless of how or where they were received. All comments received during the public comment periods have been considered in this NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3018 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 47 1 Plum Island? 2 MS.

And it's11 not just comments made at these meetings. We12 also get comments from other mechanisms, from13 members of the public, stakeholders, local14 political boards, state and local officials and15 universities.16 We look at all of the comments, and17 certainly we look at the comments that are for18 and against, but it's much more than that. We19 also want to understand what people are thinking20 in terms of the facility and the EIS, itself.21 So, it was not an intentional thing to22 omit that, and that is part of the ongoing23 process.

Many bio-weapons agents like21 yellow fever, dengue, hemorrhagic, whooping22 cough, all used by U.S. para-military to infect23 African Americans can be spread by mosquitoes;24 and practically all modern biological weapons25 agents are or were animal diseases. 1|21.3 July 29, 2008, Butner, NC, Butner Afternoon Page 24 of 94 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentors concern. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. DHS notes the commentor's views on risk. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, would enable the NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the NBAF. The purpose and need for the proposed action is discussed in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS can not guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident. However, as discussed in Section 2.2.1.1, modern biosafety design substantially diminishes the chances of a release as the primary design goal is to provide an adequate level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the building. A discussion of human health and safety is included in Section 3.14.

The primary objective of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the no action and site alternatives for locating, constructing and operating the NBAF. As summarized in Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair comparison among the alternatives. The proximity of institutionalized populations to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative was considered in the preparation of the NBAF EIS as was the potential effects of a release of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus at all sites (see Section 3.8.9, Section 3.10.9, Section 3.14, and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS for economic, biological, and health and safety effects of FMD virus release). Section 3.3.7 of the NBAF EIS evaluates the baseline infrastructure and effects of the proposed NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative that identifies infrastructure upgrades needed to support the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. As described in Chapter 1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's mission is to study foreign animal, zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) and emerging diseases that threaten our agricultural livestock and agricultural economy. The NBAF would enable research on the transmission of these animal diseases and support development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and antiviral therapies for foreign animal, zoonotic and emerging diseases. By proposing to construct the NBAF, DHS is following policy direction established by the Congress and the President.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3025 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 54 1 For instance, it fails to even address the 2 institutional population that lives near the3 proposed site.

And early on, I asked13 how you will contain the mosquitoes. Well,14 apparently, you do it with aerial spray of15 insecticides; and I'm sure those insecticides16 are as safe as DDT was and Agent Orange.17 And, finally, other sites have been18 rejected due insufficient infrastructure and19 lack of community support. Well, from your20 DEIS, Butner's infrastructure is in last place21 among your sites; and contrary to what the22 Consortium tells you, we do not want the NBAF in23 our community.24 MS.

The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the Draft EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 23.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding safe facility operations. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. All animal holding areas would be inside the facility and all infected animals would be maintained in the appropriate biosafety level containment areas. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 8.3 DHS notes the commentor's statement. As summarized Section 3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS analyzed each environmental resource area in a consistent manner across all the alternatives to allow for a fair and objective comparison among the alternatives. DHS has identified its Preferred Alternative in Section 2.6 in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1502.14(e)) for implementing NEPA. The Preferred Alternative is one that an agency believes would best fulfill its statutory mission and responsibilities, giving consideration to economic, environmental, technical, and other factors. Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The NBAF EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Jay M. Cohen, with other department officials, will consider the factors identified above in making final decisions regarding the NBAF. A Record of Decision that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.

In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The NBAF would provide state-of- the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory- acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Appendix B describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF then site- specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed the NBAF. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3028 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 57 1 But we don't trust the organization DHS. 2 That is the key issue in this argument, trust. 3 As a scientist to another scientist, I trust Mr.4 Janke.

DHS is aware of the presence of the mental health facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the mental health facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 and Appendix E. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site, specific protocols and emergency plans would be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would include stipulations for any special-needs populations, including institutionalized populations. The need for an evacuation under accident conditions is considered to be very low probability event. An evacuation would not be necessary if FMDV were accidentally released from NBAF, since FMDV is not a public health threat. An FMDV release would not impact the health and safety of special-needs populations. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 20.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern that NBAF operations could result in an accident. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Once the ROD has been signed and prior to the initiation of NBAF operations, a site-specific emergency management plan will be developed that will be coordinated with the local Emergency Management Officer and will include contingency plans for potentially affected residents and institutions. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns. The NBAF EIS was prepared to provide a thorough analysis of the aspects of NBAF construction and operations at the six site alternative locations. The potential impacts of NBAF operations on environmental resources, health and safety, and on local transportation are discussed in Chapter 3 of the NBAF EIS. DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are aware of the proposed action.

Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address accident scenarios, including external events such as a terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) (designated as For Official Use Only) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high-consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns. The NBAF EIS was prepared to provide a thorough analysis of the aspects of NBAF construction and operations at the six site alternative locations. The potential impacts of NBAF operations on environmental resources, health and safety, and on local transportation are discussed in Chapter 3 of the NBAF EIS. Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. DHS cannot guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident; however, the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extremely low. The economic impact of an accidental release, including the impact on the livestock-related industries, is presented in Chapter 3, Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a potential ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's lack of trust in the federal government. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS state that the specific objective of the hazard identification is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The NBAF would provide state-of- the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory- acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Appendix B describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF then site- specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies thatChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3036 would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed the NBAF. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 9.0 DHS notes the commentor's air quality concerns. The potential effects of NBAF construction and operations on air quality are discussed in Section 3.4 of the NBAF EIS. Section 3.4.1 describes the methodolgy used in assessing potential air quality consequences at each site. Potential construction emissions were extrapolated from a similar facility's construction approach to ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide, and volatile organic compounds. For operations, the U.S. EPA dispersion modeling program, SCREEN3, was used to predict probable maximum effects at each site based on the current state of facility design. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and following site selection and final design, a complete emission inventory would be developed and refined modeling performed as necessary in accordance with state-specific air quality permitting requirements.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. As described in Chapter 3 and summarized in Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS, the impacts of activities during normal operations at any of the six site alternatives would likely be minor. Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large.

All of the candidate sites were evaluated for the presence of existing hazardous, toxic, or radiological waste contamination as discussed in Section 3.12 of the NBAF EIS. Section 3.12.7 specifically addresses evidence of contamination at the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative due to use by the Department of Defense during World War II and concludes that no construction or operational impacts are anticipated due to existing hazardous, toxic, or radiological waste contamination. This conclusion is based on a review of drinking well sampling data, the absence of unexploded ordinance (UXO) found at the site, and the fact that the closest former firing range to the site is more than 1.5 miles away. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 12.3 DHS notes the commentor's watershed concerns. As described in the Section 3.7.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority has 3 to 4 million gallons per day of excess potable water supply and could meet NBAF's need of approximately 110,000 gallons per day, less than 0.4% of the Authority's total current capacity. The NBAF potable water usage is comparable to 210 residential homes annual potable water usage. The Section 3.13.8 describes the process that would be used to control and dispose of liquid wastes and Sections 3.3.7 and 3.7.7 describe standard methods used to prevent and mitigate potential spill and runoff affects. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 17.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the reported potential for a large increase in average daily traffic volume from NBAF operations at the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative. This projected large increase in traffic volume from NBAF operations, as reported in Section 3.11.7.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, was based on incorrect values for average daily taffic (ADT) on the primary traffic corridors servicing the NBAF. The corrected values for average daily taffic volume on Range Road of 381 vehicles per day (impact to traffic of 2.6% increase) and on Old Highway 75 of 5,500 vehicles per day (impact to traffic of 0.2% increase) demonstrate low projected impact to the traffic and transportation infrastructure from the NBAF operations at the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.3 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the infrastructure improvements and associated costs required for the NBAF operation at the Umstead Research Farm site. Section 3.3.7 and Section 3.11.7 of the NBAF EIS includes an assessment of the current utility and transportation infrastructure at the Umstead Research Farm Site, the potential impact and effects from construction and operation of the NBAF, and the planned utility and transportation improvements to meet the operational requirements of the NBAF. While the potential costs of proposed actions are not a factor in the environmental impact analysis presented in the NBAF EIS, cost information of the NBAF Alternatives is summarized in Section 2.5, Table 2.5.1-1 of the NBAF EIS to provide pertinent information to the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology so that he may make a more informed decision with respect to the alternatives presented in the NBAF EIS. Infrastructure costs were analyzed and included in the final costs provided in the NBAF EIS.

A multi-disciplinary team of engineers, scientists, lawyers, academics and communicators from the departments of Homeland Security, Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Defense reviewed the submissions based primarily on environmental suitability and proximity to research capabilities, proximity to workforce, acquisition/construction/operations, and community acceptance. Ultimately, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences, and determined that they, in addition to the Plum Island Site, would be evaluated in the EIS as alternatives for the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern. DHS is aware of the presence of the mental health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the mental health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of a pathogen release on the local population, livestock industry, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols wouldChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3052 then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations, including institutionalized populations, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF.

The economic effects of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site are included in Section 3.10.7 of the NBAF EIS. The proposed action will create temporary jobs during the 4-yr construction phase and permanent jobs upon completion of the facility. Section 3.10.7.2 states that the majority of the construction workers would be drawn from the study area or would commute from the surrounding counties. Upon the facilty's completion, permanent employees will include scientific and support staff as well as operations, maintenance and security staff (Section 3.10.7.3). Household spending by these new residents and the operations of the NBAF are expected to create job opportunities that would be filled by the local labor force. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 26.0 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding safe facility operations. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. As described in Chapter 3 and summarized in Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS, the impacts of activities during normal operations at any of the six site alternatives would likely be minor. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide adequate funding for safe operation and maintenance.

Section 3.3.7.1 and Section 3.3.7.3 provide a multitude of citations for sanitary sewage system data and potable water system data resulting from direct communications with SGWASA personnel. Specifically the SGWASA wastewater treatment plant capacity, current utilization and excess capacity data was validated in a January 24, 2008 phone conversation with SGWASA Director of Utilities. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's viewpoint. The economic effects of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site are included in Section 3.10.7 of the NBAF EIS. DHS is not aware of any historical evidence that routine operations of a biological research facility adversely affect the local economy. On the contrary, operations and maintenance of the facility and household spending by its employees generates a positive economic impact. In addition, research facilities typically stimulate the formation of other high tech establishments in the surrounding region and can serve as engines of economic growth. As stated in the NBAF EIS, the overall effect of the NBAF on housing market conditions would be negligible. The housing market would be able to meet the increase in housing demand (326 employees in total), relative to the estimated growth of the existing population between 2007 and 2012 (188,278). It is possible that with the relocation of highly skilled workers to the immediate area, property values could increase due to an increase in demand, and there is no empirical evidence that a facility such as the NBAF would reduce property values in the study area. Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS presents a profile of the agricultural industry in the eight-county area surrounding the Umstead Research Farm Site. It is not expected that the agricultural industry would be negatively impacted by the construction or operations of the NBAF.

DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's lack of trust in the federal government. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS state that the specific objective of the hazard identification is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The NBAF would provide state-of- the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for laboratory- acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Appendix B describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF then site- specific protocols would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the local area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed the NBAF. Procedures and plans to operate the NBAF will include community representatives as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3061 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 86 1 concerns before any of the details of the 2 facility or what would be managed here was for3 our democracy here and what would happen to our4 very way of life.

Section 3.3.1 through Section 3.3.8 of the NBAF EIS provides an assessment of current infrastructure at each site, in addition to the potential effects from construction and operation of the NBAF at each site, to include required infrastructure improvements. All sites will require some level of infrastructure improvements for NBAF construction and operation as identified in Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.8 of the NBAF EIS. Should a site be selected for NBAF, any additional infrastructure improvements to ensure safe and reliable operation would be identified in accordance with the final facility design. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 17.3 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding the reported potential for a large increase in average daily traffic volume from proposed NBAF operations at the Umstead Research Farm Site. This projected large increase in traffic volume from NBAF operations, as reported in Section 3.11.7.3.1 of the NBAF Draft EIS, was based on incorrect values for average daily taffic (ADT) on the primary traffic corridors that would service the NBAF. The corrected values for average daily traffic volume on Range Road of 381 vehicles per day (traffic increase of 2.6%) and on Old Highway 75 of 5,500 vehicles per day (traffic increase of 0.2%) demonstrate that the projected impact to the traffic and transportation infrastructure from NBAF operations at the Umstead Research Farm Site would be low. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 9.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding affects on air quality from increased traffic. Section 3.4.3.3.2 of the NBAF EIS describes the traffic emission estimates developed from the Emissions Factor 2002 Burden Model for California Air Resource Board. Should a decision be made to build NBAF and following site selection and final design, a complete emission inventory would be developed which would account for predicted vehicle trips and refined modeling would be performed as necessary in accordance with state-specific air quality permitting requirements Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's statement regarding employment. The proposed action will create temporary jobs during the 4-yr construction phase and permanent jobs upon completion of the facility. The estimated number of jobs and tax revenues that are expected to be created by the construction and operations of the NBAF at the Unstead Research Farm Site are presented in Section 3.10.7 of the NBAF EIS. The employment and tax estimates were produced with IMPLAN, a widely used economic impact assessment modeling system which is described in Section 3.10.1.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3064 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 89 1 Butner.

Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large.

Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.

Chapter 3, Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents. Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan and individual facility plans regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF, and which would include stipulations for all special-needs populations.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3073 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 98 1 And as far as the aerial spraying goes, 2 where I work, I know that my friends have3 breathing difficulties in our beautiful, humid4 weather.

The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre- operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations, including institutionalized populations, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 19.3 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding aerial spraying resulting from an accident at the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. An analysis of potential consequences of a pathogen (e.g. Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus) becoming established in native mosquito populations was evaluated in Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures (SOP) and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the NBAF. RVF and foot and mouth disease SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan. The potential consequences of pesticide use would be evaluated during the preparation of a site-specific response plan.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3074 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 99 1 Piedmont region would be disastrous according to 2 official reports from Homeland Security.3 The projected cost from an accident, 3.54 billion.

The U.S. Congress and the President are responsible for determining funding priorities for government programs. DHS spends funds in accordance with congressional intent. DHS would maintain the NBAF and ancillary facilities in compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements and provide for safe operation and maintenance. As regards commentor's question regarding legal action, DHS prepared the NBAF EIS in accordance with the provisions of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and CEQ's NEPA (40 CFR 1500 et seq.). DHS therefore believes that the NBAF EIS is legally compliant, but DHS professes no immunity from litigation. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 4.0 DHS notes the commentor's questions regarding the criteria and timing for final site selection. Several factors will affect the decision on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where. The EIS itself will not be the sole deciding factor. The decision will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS and support documents; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable Federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the Federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment. A Record of Decision that explains the final decisions will be made available no sooner than 30 days after the NBAF Final EIS is published.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3076 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 101 1 Environmental Impact Statement lacking.

DHS cannot guarantee that the NBAF would never experience an accident; however, the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen from the NBAF is extremely low. The economic impact of an accidental release, including the impact on the livestock-related industries, is presented in Chapter 3, Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a potential ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 25.3 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Umstead Research Farm Site Alternative. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 2.0 DHS notes the commentor's lack of confidence in the DHS and concerns regarding safe facility operations. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Chapter 3, Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, then site- specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3078 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 103 1 Homeland Security is abysmal.

Section 3.3.7 of the NBAF EIS includes an assessment of the current infrastructure, a discussion of the potential effects from construction and operation of the NBAF, and the identification of any infrastructure improvements necessary to meet design criteria and insure safe operation. Funding mechanisms for identified utility improvements or updgrades are beyond the scope of the NBAF EIS. However, while the potential costs of proposed actions are not a factor in the environmental impact analysis presented in the NBAF EIS, cost information and the scope of the cost analysis performed is summarized in Section 2.5 of the NBAF EIS to provide pertinent information to the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology so that he may make a more informed decision with respect to the alternatives presented in the NBAF EIS. DHS notes the commentor's concern that the number of parking spaces on the facility drawings will not accomidate the projected number of jobs at the NBAF. The drawings shown in the NBAF EIS are conceptual design drawings. If the decision is made to build the NBAF, a site-specific building design will be completed and adequate parking will be available for NBAF employees and visitors. DHS notes commentor's concern that fuel oil will be stored in underground tanks for NBAF emergency generator operation at the Umstead Research Farm site. The current design of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm site specifies only above-ground tanks for fuel storage.

As I was mentioning earlier,7 one of the most blatant deficiencies is the lack8 of emergency plans for the institutions outside9 the three-kilometer perimeter, such as Murdoch 10 Center.11 As a member of the Human Rights Committee12 of Murdoch Center, which is home to 575 of North13 Carolina's most admittedly complicated,14 developmentally disabled, I would just love to15 invite you to visit Murdoch Center so you could16 see the individuals that cannot be evacuated.17 I promise you that you would never forget18 what you saw.

Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS investigate the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents,, external events, and intentional acts. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Umstead Research Farm Site, specific protocols would be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area and would include stipulations for any special-needs populations, including institutionalized populations. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.3 DHS notes the commentor's suggestion. DHS is aware of the presence of the health and correctional facilities, described in Section 3.10.7.1 of the NBAF EIS. DHS has held public meetings and conducted outreach efforts to ensure that the surrounding communities, including officials of the health and correctional facilities, are well aware of the proposed action. The risks and associated potential effects to human health and safety were evaluated in Section 3.14 of the NBAF EIS. The risks were determined to be low for all site alternatives. Nevertheless, should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies, that would consider the diversity and density of human populations residing within the area. DHS would offer coordination and training to local medical personnel regarding the effects of pathogens to be studied at the NBAF. Emergency management plans will also include training for local law enforcement, health care, and fire and rescue personnel.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3084 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 109 1 like to thank you for responding to our request 2 for a translator for the hearing-impaired.

That6 is an inherent risk with facilities like the7 NBAF, but if there -- there would be absolutely8 no risk involved if the lab was not here. So,9 why should we ever take that chance? 10 The people of Butner don't want the NBAF. 11 We want the Consortium, we want the Department12 of Homeland Security, and the NBAF supporters13 who do not live in Granville County to clearly14 understand that we don't want the NBAF here; and15 that last sentence is not very hard to16 understand.17 And if the NBAF is sited for Southern18 Granville County and Butner, we shall not19 threaten litigation.

Although some \"accidents\" are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the Expressions of Interest.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3086 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 111 1 the best solution of all, put it on a really -- 2 really remote island.

So, the cost of buying that18 land would have been three to $5 million19 dollars. Their budget was about a half a20 million dollars.

You also have a huge --13 there seem to be a population of people who are14 indigent.15 So, I don't really think there's going to16 be a chance of an outbreak if you have sites17 like this that are close to huge populations of18 people.

As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection process incorporated site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in subburban or sem-urban areas. It has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3092 e043e60d-7027-4300-890e-dd924f3ad32aDHS Afternoon Session 7-29-08 Hightower Reporting ServicePage 117 1 I think if both sides do that, you can 2 both come to a resolution that will work in both3 of your favors.

I'm the mayor of Manhattan and12 speaking on behalf of the citizens of our13 community.14 The City of Manhattan has been and15 continues to be very supportive of the National16 Bio and Agro-Defense Facility project. In17 February of 2007, Manhattan City Commission passed18 a resolution of support for the project and19 pledged up to $5 million dollars in economic20 assistance for the project. A copy of the21 resolution was submitted during the August 27th,22 2007, NBAF scoping meetings.23 The City of Manhattan is proud to be one24 of five finalist sites in consideration for the25 NBAF. I believe that our community should be 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 5 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3101 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 32 1 strongly considered for this facility for the 2 following key reasons: First, our community has3 an excellent track record of cooperation and4 collaboration between the city, county,5 University, Fort Riley, other state and federal6 agencies, as well as our business community to7 achieve results. The NBAF continues to have8 strong support from all levels of government in9 Kansas, and this coalition stands ready to make 10 the NBAF a reality and make the project a success11 long after the announcement of the site.12 Second, Kansas State University has13 outstanding research capabilities and has14 established itself as a national leader in food15 safety security.16 Finally, the existence of the BRI, the17 Bio Research Institute, a Bio Level 3 facility18 here at K-State is key because it demonstrates the19 commitment to the issue of national security and20 food safety, it shows that we can build a state of21 the art facility here in the heartland and the BRI22 is capable of supporting NBAF research today years23 before the final NBAF is constructed.24 The City of Manhattan continues to be a25 strong supporter of this project and look forward 1 cont.| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 6 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3102 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 33 1 to assisting the NBAF to become a reality in the 2 State of Kansas.

I wanted to speak to you today about the15 necessity of locating NBAF in Kansas. It is clear16 to me that Kansans know better than anyone17 anywhere the importance of our nation's health and18 food supply, and we understand better than anyone19 else the importance of keeping these things safe.20 If I've said it once, I've said it a21 thousand times, Kansas wins this one on the22 merits. Kansas is centrally located making23 transportation and access easy, and we supply many24 of our nations vital food resources.

We can build a safe lab that will lend9 itself to ground breaking research that is vital 10 to our national security, and I believe we, better11 than any other site, will attract industry experts12 to accomplish these goals. None of the other13 finalists can say that.14 Kansas has a great emergency plan putting15 safety first, and is a national leader in first16 response for animal disease outbreaks, and a17 vaccine for FMD is on the horizon. This vaccine,18 and others, will be made by companies like those19 located in Kansas City's Animal Health Corridor.20 This is the largest concentration of animal health21 companies anywhere in the world.22 Like I said, when we began this endeavor,23 Kansas wins this one on the merits. We have the24 experts, we have the drive, and we have the25 experience to keep our country safe. 3| 19.41 cont.| 24.4 1 cont.| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 8 of 109 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 19.4 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3104 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 35 1 I appreciate the chance to go on record 2 this evening with my continued support for NBAF in3 Kansas.

There's a very strong16 commitment by the State of Kansas, its people, its17 industry, and its leaders, for locating the18 Department of Homeland Security National Bio and19 Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan, Kansas.20 As an agricultural state, Kansans know21 that protecting U.S. agriculture from22 bio-terrorist attack must be a national priority.23 Kansas has a long history to dedication to24 biosciences and animal health, and its people25 understand and support NBAF, research that 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 9 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the Congressman's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3105 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 36 1 benefits their industries and their livelihoods. 2 Thousands of Kansans make a living3 through farming and ranching across our state.4 The Animal Health Corridor in Kansas City hosts5 the largest concentration of animal health6 companies in our country. Kansas State University7 is the nation's premier animal health research8 institution with a state of the art facility9 standing ready to immediately accept DHS 10 researchers and scientists.11 Kansas has the central location, skilled12 work force, the infrastructure, the collaboration13 capabilities, and the strong citizen support14 necessary to ensure that NBAF's mission is15 fulfilled.16 Mr. Secretary, as DHS continues the site17 selection process, I want to assure you that18 Manhattan, Kansas, holds the key to NBAF's19 success.20 Senator Sam21 Brownback.22 SENATOR BROWNBACK: -- the great23 State of Kansas, and thank you for allowing me to24 participate via this recorded statement during25 your two public meetings on the Environmental 1 cont.| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 10 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3106 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 37 1 Impact Statement for the National Bio and 2 Agro-Defense Facility.3 I'm sorry I can't be with you in person4 tonight. I'd love to be there, but there's simply5 too much going on in Washington. I've been proud6 to work diligently with my colleagues in7 Washington and our friends back in Kansas to8 promote the candidacy of Manhattan, Kansas, for9 the NBAF facility. 10 I believe Kansas State University, my11 alma matter, the City of Manhattan, and the State12 of Kansas, have put together an excellent13 proposal, what I believe to be a winning proposal.14 When based on the merits, Manhattan deserves to be15 the next home of NBAF.16 We in Kansas, particularly Kansas State17 University, have a long history with agricultural18 research. Supporting such research is second19 nature for us. For example, Manhattan is located20 within the Animal Health Research Corridor, a21 stretch of land from Manhattan, Kansas, to22 Columbia, Missouri, with the largest single23 concentration of animal health facilities in the24 world.25 One third of the $14 billion dollar 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 11 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the Senator's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3107 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 38 1 global market for animal health is located within 2 a short drive of Manhattan. This region is also3 home to 165 life science companies with 37 focused4 on protecting and securing animal health. I5 believe this concentration of commercial assets6 and expertise in animal health near Manhattan will7 further enable NBAF to succeed in its mission of8 studying zoonotic and foreign animal diseases.9 If Manhattan is chosen as the next site 10 for NBAF, you can rest assured it has the full11 support of the local community, Kansas State12 University, the State of Kansas, and the Kansas13 congressional delegation.14 This high level of cooperation between15 each group exemplifies what is best about Kansas.16 We enjoy setting lofty goals and working together17 to achieve them which benefits and befits our18 state motto of Ad Astra per Aspera, to the stars19 through difficulty.20 The support that NBAF enjoys in the21 Manhattan and State of Kansas is unanimous and22 genuine. We live in a dangerous world, and we23 must remain dedicated to ensuring the safety of24 our citizens and our food supply.

If chosen, the Manhattan site will5 be able to start high level research that6 contributes to NBAF's mission on day one.7 These are just a few of the reasons why8 Manhattan, Kansas, is the best site for the new9 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. I've 10 enjoyed working on this project and I look forward11 to your decision. When based solely on the12 merits, Manhattan has put together the best13 proposal and offers NBAF the greatest chance for14 success.15 Thank you for allowing me to participate.16 MODERATOR COGHILL: The next speaker17 is Teresa Ardery-Minton.

At first, I was excited about the 2 prospect of a sophisticated laboratory locating in3 our community. The positives are obvious, both4 financially, professionally and academically.5 As I thought about it more deeply,6 however, my enthusiasm waned. Having dangerous7 pathogens located in the center of our town and in8 the middle of agricultural America seemed9 counterintuitive. 10 There is no question that our nation11 needs a facility of this nature. That is not in12 question. I came to the conclusion, however,13 there is just no compelling reason to place such a14 facility in an area that is surrounded by the very15 plants and animal species that are most16 susceptible to the pathogens that will be studied.17 The accidents that have occurred at other18 facilities are common knowledge to you and to many19 others who are attending this meeting tonight. It20 only takes one individual who's careless, or one21 who has malicious intent, to make every advantage22 gained from NBAF seem trivial, meaningless and23 shortsighted. Professional research scientists24 and technicians, as we've seen in Europe, are not25 above hatred and vindictive acts against our 1| 5.0 1 cont.| 5.0 2| 21.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 14 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.0 As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern regarding a careless or malicious and criminal act perpetrated by a NBAF employee.. Section 3.14 addresses accident scenarios, including internal and external events, such as, an \"insider\" criminal act and terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only)(TRA) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Additionally, Section 3.14 investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.

There are people and organizations who4 have made it their full time jobs to circumvent5 all of the road blocks you have put in their way.6 As we have seen in the past, people who wish us7 harm are willing to wait years to realize their8 glory at our expense.9 The weather, of course, must be factored 10 in as well. My brother, who works as a11 firefighter in Oklahoma City, was present when the12 EF5 tornado hit several years ago. He described13 to me extraordinary destruction. Asphalt was14 pulled up off the road and foundations were15 scoured free of all conduits and pipes down to16 foundation.17 I question exactly how one can engineer a18 facility to withstand such an event unless it is19 built below ground. So when we add the20 unpredictability of mother nature to the21 unpredictability of human nature, the22 possibilities of failure increase substantially.23 When you factor in these risks, no matter how24 small, it begs the question as to why anyone would25 want to bring these dangerous pathogens from an2 cont.| 21.4 3| 21.4 4| 5.0 3 cont.| 21.4 5| 5.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 15 of 109 Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years. This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement. Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS describes other alternatives considered including building the NBAF beneath a mountain. However, this was dismissed from further consideration since the due to the prohibitive cost and feasibility of such construction. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The Plum Island Alternative is evaluated as a reasonable alternative for the NBAF, as described in Section 2.3.5 of the NBAF EIS.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3111 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 42 1 island to the center of the United States. 2 The majority of people who have spoken3 here tonight have a vested interest in seeing NBAF4 come to Manhattan, the professional opportunities5 it will create, the academic partnership, and the6 money it will bring to our community are all very7 tempting.

The economic effects of the NBAF at the Manhattan Campus Site are presented in Section 3.10.7 of the NBAF EIS. The proposed action would create temporary jobs during the 4-yr construction phase and permanent jobs upon completion of the facility. Section 3.10.7.2 states that the majority of the construction workers would be employed from the immediate area or would commute from the surrounding counties. Upon the facility's completion, permanent employees would include scientific and support staff, as well as operations, maintenance and security staff as described in Section 3.10.7.3. Because many jobs at the NBAF would be highly specialized, it is anticipated that the majority of the employees would relocate to the four-county region from elsewhere in the country. In addition, household spending by these new residents and the operations of the NBAF would likely create job opportunities that would be filled by the local labor force.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3114 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 45 1 For decades there have been concerns 2 about the conditions at Plum Island laboratory and3 its ability to protect against outside4 contamination of some of the most dangerous animal5 diseases.6 In the late 1990's, Plum Island was7 insinuated in outbreaks of West Nile Virus and8 Lyme Disease as well as cases of malaria that even9 prompted closure of a Boy Scout Camp in Suffolk 10 County on Long Island.11 The facility was responsible for an12 accidental release of Foot and Mouth Disease. The13 consequences from that accidental release could14 have been disastrous as evidenced by a 200115 incident in England. There, an outbreak of Foot16 and Mouth Disease cost the economy nearly17 $20 billion dollars, and led to the destruction of18 6 million animals.19 Not only is the current Plum Island20 facility inadequate to fulfill the mission of the21 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF,22 its geographical location is far from ideal should23 there be a crisis along the Pacific coastline of24 the United States, and while Plum Island is three25 miles from shore, these diseases can travel 70 1| 25.1 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 19 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.1 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3115 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 46 1 miles by air which makes the issue of a poor 2 response time an even greater concern.

We believe Manhattan offers an4 exceptional location for the National Bio and5 Agro-Defense Facility.6 Earlier this month, Classified Senate7 gave all classified employees an opportunity to8 contact me if they had strong concerns about the9 possibility of NBAF being located in our 10 community.11 Not surprisingly, I received no negative12 comments in response to that request. The13 comments I did receive were positive and hopeful14 in regards to what NBAF could do for our work15 force, our regional community, and most16 especially, our national security.17 As you are probably aware, Manhattan and18 the surrounding communities were built to support19 a land grant university and a military base. We20 are fortunate to have two major employers in the21 area to fine tune and train our work force. Many22 classified employees have already been trained to23 provide maintenance and clerical support for BSL-324 lab and other secure labs located on the K-State25 campus.1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 23 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3119 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 50 1 We believe K-State will prove to be an 2 excellent community to recruit scientific support3 staff from, and provide exceptional work force4 recruitment and training services for NBAF.5 As K-State's mission statement states,6 the mission of Kansas State University is enhanced7 by symbiotic relationships among the discovery of8 knowledge and improvement in the quality of life9 through research applications. Coordinated 10 teaching, research and extension services help11 develop the highly skilled and educated work force12 necessary to the economic well-being of Kansas,13 the nation, and the international community.14 Classified Senate believes K-State's and15 NBAF's mission are closely aligned. If you choose16 to locate NBAF in Manhattan, we think you'll find17 our work force to be highly supportive of your18 mission to protect our national food supply.19 After all, research is what K-State does best.20 Coordinating with NBAF will allow K-State to take21 its research mission to a whole new level.22 Thank you for the opportunity to speak on23 behalf of K-State's Classified Senate. We24 appreciate the opportunity to officially welcome25 NBAF to our community. 1 cont.| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 24 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3120 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 51 1 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you, 2 Jennyfer.3 Jerry Jaax.4 MR. JAAX: Good evening. My name is5 Jerry Jaax, and I work at K-State. I'm also a6 Riley County rancher with economic assets at risks7 from agricultural diseases. Except for the8 federal scientists in attendance, I'm also one of9 the few people here who actually has experience 10 working in BL3 and BL4 facilities, so from the11 context of my 20 years of experience in12 bio-containment research and not from hearsay,13 conjecture, or even well-intentioned14 misinformation, I'd like to provide my thoughts15 about some of the questions that are being asked16 in Manhattan and elsewhere about NBAF and its17 impact.18 Some would say we support NBAF, not just19 here. For most communities, safety concerns drive20 this issue. I personally believe that our answer21 should be clear cut. If NBAF cannot be built22 safely in Manhattan, we should not build it23 anywhere. We shouldn't build it in Georgia,24 Texas, North Carolina, Mississippi, not even on25 Plum Island. 1| 5.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 25 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3121 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 52 1 Fortunately, we can build NBAF safely in 2 all of these sites. Why? Bio-containment works.3 The stratified, comprehensive strategies that4 comprise modern bio-containment programs, protect5 the environment and the surrounding communities.6 Decades old BL4 facilities in Atlanta and7 Frederick, Maryland, have never had a community8 exposure. It is significant that less new major9 bio-containment projects, including BL4 10 laboratories in Galveston, Boston and Chicago, are11 all located in populated areas. Not in the12 desert, not on a remote island. Bio-containment13 facilities work and they are safe.14 I would like to comment, though, about15 the effects of a laboratory release of FMD virus16 discussed in the EIS. By design, the EIS process17 mandates that all possible negative events,18 however remote, are duly considered in the19 process. Accordingly, a theoretical release of20 FMD virus was evaluated for each of the possible21 sites. It's important to understand that this22 analysis is based on the statutory requirement to23 consider the worse case scenario. For reasons24 I've discussed above, the actual risk of a lab25 escape is exceedingly remote. 2| 5.0 3| 21.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 26 of 109 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.0 As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the Expressions of Interest. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for the NBAF and understanding that the proposed research would be safely conducted regardless of NBAF location.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3122 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 53 1 Obviously, a lab release would be a 2 national tragedy that would transcend regional3 impact, regardless of where the NBAF would be4 located.5 With that said, the Kansas site fared6 somewhat unfavorably in this FMD release analysis7 based primarily on the proximity of the cattle8 industry. Clearly an outbreak here, as elsewhere,9 would be exceedingly serious. However, I would 10 like to know if DHS's analysis methodology11 included assessment for the proximity of both12 cattle and swine. As an amplification posed for13 FMD, pigs produced up to 10,000 times the virus of14 an infected cow. All proposed sites have15 susceptible populations of cloven-hoofed animals16 in relatively close proximity.17 Those in the southeast, however, also18 have substantial swine production industries19 roughly comparable to Kansas cattle interests.20 Additionally, the presence of significant21 populations of feral, or wild hogs, would pose22 daunting challenges in the event of a lab release.23 For clarification, however, I would say24 that I believe this lab release scenario is25 largely theoretical, so I raise this issue only in 4| 21.4 5| 21.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 27 of 109 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's question. The presence of wildlife ungulates and specifically wild boar at the Manhattan Campus Site is acknowledged in Section 3.8.4.1.4 of the NBAF EIS. The susceptibility of wild boar to FMD, Rift Valley fever, and Nipah were addressed in Section 3.8.9. This information and additional information on the swine livestock in the Manhattan Campus Site area was used in the risk assessment described in Section 3.14.4.2. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern with the risks associated with a pathogen release and the impact of such a release within wildlife populations. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. Chapter 3, Sections 3.8.9, 3.10.9, and 3.14 (Health and Safety), and Appendices B, D, and E of the NBAF EIS, provide a detailed analysis of the consequences from a accidental or deliberate pathogen release. Pathogen release scenarios include for example, an analysis of the potential consequences of Rift Vally Fever (RVF) virus becoming established in native mosquito populations. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF then site specific protocols and emergency response plans would be developed, in coordination with local emergency response agencies that would consider the diversity and density of human, livestock, and wildlife populations residing within the area. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. RVF and FMD SOPs and response plans would likely include strategies that are similar. However, the RVF response plan would also include a mosquito control action plan.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3123 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 54 1 the context that the report could unduly alarm 2 regional producers, and might ultimately be an3 unfair discriminator in the site selection4 process. MS. JAAX: Thank you. Good evening.9 My name is Nancy Jaax. I graduated from Kansas 10 State in 1973 and spent the bulk of my11 professional career as a veterinary pathologist12 working in medical bio-defense programs at the13 national and international level.14 I have over 25 years of experience15 working in BL3 and BL4 facilities. During my16 career, I worked with many zoonotic high hazard17 diseases including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa Fever,18 Rift Valley Fever, and anthrax, to mention a few.19 All of these pathogens require special20 bio-containment facilities.21 There's clearly a degree of occupational22 risk that is completely understood and accepted by23 those of us who choose to do this work. We choose24 because we believe it is important and for the25 greater good. Rigorous training, programs, and July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 28 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3124 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 55 1 specialized facilities combine to reduce personal 2 occupational risks to the lowest possible level.3 Perhaps most significantly, the safety4 record over decades of bio-containment operations5 has demonstrated that occupational risk does not6 extend to the community.7 For years, I trusted my life, and the8 life of my family, to the principals of9 bio-containment. Despite what many would consider 10 to be extreme occupational risk, I never became11 infected with any pathogens that I worked with in12 the laboratory.13 This fact, and my experience, leads to14 the main point of my testimony. I find it ironic15 that contracted West Nile Fever, a newly emergent16 viral exotic disease from Africa in my own yard17 when I was routinely working with some of the18 world's most dangerous hemorraghic fever viruses19 in the laboratory.20 Ten years ago, West Nile Virus was one of21 exotic diseases that was unimportant and22 irrelevant to U.S. citizens. This once obscure23 disease has had a dramatic affect on human,24 livestock, and wildlife in the United States, and25 there are dozens of similar diseases, many of 1| 27.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 29 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 27.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3125 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 56 1 which would be more serious, just waiting for the 2 right circumstances to arrive in this country.3 My point is that people or livestock in4 the U.S. are not likely to be infected with5 disease like West Nile, SARS, Nipah, Rift Valley,6 FMD, Hendra, African Swine Fever, Exotic7 Newcastle, or a host of others, as a result of a8 laboratory release. We are at risk for unexpected9 outbreaks of disease because of the realities of 10 the shrinking world that we live in.11 Tomorrow could be the day that another12 serious emerging pathogen arrives in the U.S.13 This is the harsh reality of infectious disease.14 Microorganisms know no borders. For reasons that15 go far beyond the scope of this discussion,16 naturally occurring or even intentionally17 introduced diseases pose increasingly serious18 threats to our country and to our food supply.19 We have tremendous agricultural20 production capability. We must enhance the21 critical infectious disease research22 infrastructure necessary to protect it from23 emerging diseases that can threaten our food24 supply and our population.25 It is clear that our strategy cannot be, 2| 21.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 30 of 109 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.0 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3126 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 57 1 \"we hope that it won't happen here,\" or, \"not in 2 my back yard.\"3 Kansas through the NBAF is committed to4 helping DHS to accomplish this COGHILL: you very7 much.8 is our next speaker,9 followed by Fred Fairchild, and then Gary Micheel. 10 MS.

And so I would feel that8 a majority of our Faculty Senate members either9 did not voice their opinion, or do not appose it. 10 Obviously, there are some who may and they're11 willing to speak and I'll gladly allow them to12 speak for themselves.13 One of the things that you might not14 realize is some 20 years ago, if you'd come to15 Kansas State, you'd found a mediocre average16 University struggling in working like so many17 others.18 Over that 20 years, Kansas State has19 developed into a top 10 university as measured by20 many different standards.

We believe3 all sites should be assessed using this radial4 floor plan.5 On the topic of construction costs, area6 adjustment factors, we contend that the use of7 area cost adjustment factors from major8 metropolitan areas far removed from the project9 sites is not an accurate method. I would site two 10 recent comparable projects near the Manhattan11 site. One, the $58 million dollar BRI that we've12 heard mentioned several times today. The second13 being the $150 million dollar Fort Riley BRAC14 contracts. A large portion of the contract volume15 for both these projects was performed by16 subcontractors from smaller, nearby cities, with17 lower area adjustment factors.18 On the topic of cost construction19 escalation, the engineering used record20 percentages as used by DHS we believe are not a21 good method for comparing escalation between22 cities. Using data from the previous five years23 to predict the escalation for the next five years24 is flawed in our belief. Only an in-depth city by25 city comparison is valid for this kind of1 cont.| 27.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 36 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3132 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 63 1 forecasting. In the absence of a detailed study 2 such as this, a single national escalation should3 be applied to all the sites.4 On maintenance costs, we contend that the5 same area adjustment factors that we recommend for6 construction costs should be used for maintenance7 costs as well, and we believe that a uniform8 escalation factor should be used for all sites.9 Finally, on the topic of site development 10 costs, the true cost of the facility includes the11 in-kind contributions and site specific12 contributions, and the final cost decision should13 take all of this into consideration.14 So in brief summary, we respectfully urge15 that the DHS first use the radial floor plan for16 all the sites; secondly, use area adjustment17 factors from nearby smaller cities; third, use a18 single escalation factor for all sites; and19 lastly, consider the entire package that Kansas20 brings to the table.21 Thank you for your consideration and your22 time.23 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you, sir.24 Michael Beckloff is next, followed by25 Keith Gary, and Fred...

Nancy Jaax made one of them more9 eloquently than I can, but it's to compliment the 10 Department of Homeland Security, USDA, and APHIS11 for the development of this concept.12 I've had the opportunity to travel13 internationally for the USDA for a number of14 years. I've seen the devastation of some of these15 diseases and I fully understand the ability of16 these diseases as Nancy, once again, very, very17 eloquently spoke to.18 As I've seen that, and I have gotten a19 greater understanding of the potential of these20 diseases, that's why I compliment you and21 encourage you to develop this facility to protect22 not only our livestock industry but also protect23 our economy, and also to protect our consumers of24 our food.25 The second point I really want to make 1| 24.0 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 44 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.0 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. The decision on whether or not the NBAF is built, and, if so, where will be made based on the following factors: 1) analyses from the EIS; 2) the four evaluation criteria discussed in Section 2.3.1; 3) applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulatory requirements; 4) consultation requirements among the federal, state, and local agencies, as well as federally recognized American Indian Nations; 5) policy considerations; and 6) public comment.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3140 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 71 1 revolves around a very simple concept, and it's a 2 concept that I call focused areas of excellence.3 I've had the opportunity to be at K-State for a4 little over four years now, and one of the first5 things I learned is that Kansas State University6 has a focused area of excellence in its food7 safety and food security.8 Specifically within the College of9 Agriculture I want to use some examples. We house 10 the Food Science Institute. The Food Science11 Institute is a collaborative program that works12 across five colleges in 14 departments at Kansas13 State University, but it's more than work14 collaboratively in that nature. It works with15 research, it works with teaching, and it works16 with extension. It develops new knowledge and17 products. It empowers that knowledge and products18 with our consumers both within the state,19 globally, and in the world. For example, next20 month, we'll have the food safety workshop21 conducted in Hyderabad, India, looking at some of22 their food safety issues.23 But it also engages the students, and24 that's the point that I probably what to engage25 you most in this.

That is the human resource that's going4 to replace all of us some day in our professional5 roles some day, and now I'm going to quote the6 President of Kansas State University when he says,7 we're a student focused research intensive8 institution. To me, that's very important that9 human resource development that Kansas State can 10 bring to NBAF to me is absolutely critical.11 I want to use another example I think12 that's critical to us, and that's in the focused13 areas of excellence, and it deals with the entire14 food system. We work with production, obviously,15 because you've heard the value of production of16 agriculture to the State of Kansas and I believe17 the nation and the world, but we also deal with18 processing. We also deal with consumer issues.19 So essentially the entire food chain that we deal20 with which I think is very critical when you take21 a look at the consequences and the benefits that22 NBAF will bring.23 These are some of the things that Kansas24 State University, the College of Ag can bring to25 this endeavor to make it successful.

Often we hear that government doesn't4 listen, or the government fails to plan, or that5 agencies can't work together, and I think this is6 living proof that it does, and I certainly do7 thank you for that.8 The Kansas Legislature unanimously9 supports the building of the NBAF facility here in 10 Manhattan because we believe it is the best11 location to meet our national security needs in12 this critical area. To that end, the Kansas13 legislature's committed over $100 million dollars14 for infrastructure support should Manhattan be15 selected as the final site.16 Kansas is an agriculture state and as17 such, we truly do understand the importance of18 agriculture, not only to our producers, but our19 nation's food supply, our economy, and more20 importantly, our national security.

More importantly,8 state and county plans are exercised on a regular9 basis to ensure that all partners are trained, and 10 that plans are continually updated.11 Much has been said about the risk of a12 facility of this type, as it should be. However,13 I believe that the benefits of having this14 facility far out weigh the risk.

The growing threat of agro-terrorism18 makes NBAF a national priority to protect our19 nation's food supply.20 Certainly, there are risks, but those21 risks can be mitigated to an acceptable level22 through the checks and balances associated with23 this type of facility.24 Kansas is strategically suited for the25 NBAF facility.

We might all wish that12 things were like they were 50 years ago, but the13 level of globalization in the 21st century and the14 emerging threats of introduced, intentionally or15 accidental, foreign animal diseases is just simply16 too consequential not to accomplish this great17 mission.18 In that stead, I think it bears repeating19 again that there's not been one public outbreak20 from BSL-4 level labs in these very populated21 areas, and certainly one that should not fear that22 in Manhattan, Kansas, with the demonstrated23 competence that K-State has done with their BSL-324 lab and the many, many research areas that they've25 worked on in these emerging threats.

CARLIN: Good evening, I'm John 10 Carlin, former governor of Kansas and a former few11 other things, but now teaching here at this12 University.13 I come to you as a strong proponent of14 the project, and a strong proponent of our site15 here. I acknowledge there are individuals that16 have questions and are opposed. Personally, as a17 proponent, I think that's healthy. This is a huge18 project with a lot of challenges, and having the19 questions asked and being pushed is only a plus20 for the ultimate success of this project.21 In your presentation tonight, you talked22 a lot about research. In trying to think of23 something that hasn't already been said, I would24 say this: I think it's amazing the number of25 researchers from other states that are very1| 24.4 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 63 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.

I think it4 indicates a credibility in terms of our research5 operation here, and the potential for what can be6 done to accomplish what you've laid out, the real7 need for a lot of research in a number of areas.8 And I would add as a member of the Kansas9 Bioscience Authority, I think it's a huge asset so 10 that as we talk about research in the future, yes,11 we'll probably be coming to the federal government12 and applying for various proposals, but in the13 Bioscience Authority, we have within the State a14 huge capacity to support and complement other15 resources to really get the job done. I think16 it's one of the main reasons why we've been as17 successful to this point, and will be successful18 in the end, not just in convincing you on the19 merits of coming to Manhattan, but most20 importantly, delivering a facility that'll be used21 and carry out the goals that you've laid out so22 appropriately tonight. Thank you.23 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you,24 Mr. Carlin.25 Linda Schmidt is our next speaker. 1 cont.| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 64 of 109 Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3160 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 91 1 MS. SCHMIDT: Hello, I'm Linda 2 Schmidt, and I'm a resident of Manhattan, and I3 wanted to make my comments known tonight.4 Initially, I requested the EIS document5 so I could make an informed opinion regarding6 whether Manhattan was an appropriate site for the7 proposed facility. Having been in the health care8 profession for a long time, and also being related9 to people in the agricultural profession, I'm 10 aware of the importance of research to diagnose11 and treat diseases.12 I'm also aware that humans are not13 perfect. Needle pricks occur, people get mental14 fatigue. I've seen sloppiness in procedures in15 different situations when people are preoccupied16 or not feeling well.17 However, this afternoon, as well as18 tonight, I have repeatedly heard from various19 speakers that there is a low or minimal risk of20 accidental release of pathogens that could21 accidentally be released into the community and22 area livestock. Okay.23 So I then wondered, what is the overall24 risk rank for the Manhattan site versus the other25 sites if an accidental release did occur. Nothing 1| 21.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 65 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's position and concern for locating NBAF on a mainland site. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated with a minimal degree of risk, regardless of the site chosen. The NBAF would provide state-of-the-art biocontainment features and operating procedures to minimize the potential for laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3161 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 92 1 is 100 percent. 2 So in looking at the document on3 Page 3-359 in the document, it states, and I4 quote, because of the potential for easy spread of5 FMDV, or RVFV and Nipah Virus diseases via6 infected livestock, wildlife and vectors, the7 overall risk for the Kansas State is designated as8 risk rank two, moderate. Okay.9 How does that compare to the other sites? 10 The other mainland sites were designated as risk11 rank two, also. Okay.12 So how does that compare to Plum Island?13 According to your document regarding Plum Island,14 on Page 3-478 in the EIS it states: Given the low15 likelihood of infected animals or vectors getting16 off of the island, thereby significantly reducing17 the potential for the spread of disease, the18 overall risk for the Plum Island site is19 designated three, which is low or none. So, it20 seems to me that the wisest choice is to put the21 facility at the lowest risk site, even if it costs22 more to build there.23 So my opinion is knowing, and again, I24 want to emphasize, I know the value of research25 and vaccines and treatment of disease, but my 2| 24.1 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 66 of 109 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3162 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 93 1 opinion is after reading your documents, that this 2 type of research should be kept on Plum Island.3 You can still get the needed research done at a4 lower risk rate, which is a win-win situation as5 far as I'm concerned, even though it might cost6 more. Thank you for allowing me to express my7 opinion.8 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you, Linda.9 Representative Sharon Schwartz, please. 10 REPRESENTATIVE SCHWARTZ: Good11 evening, I am Sharon Schwartz, and I'm here in two12 roles tonight. First, as a farmer and rancher,13 and also as a State Representative representing14 the 106th District.15 As a farmer and rancher, I want to speak16 from that to begin with, as a livestock and grain17 producer, I know first hand the unique bioscience18 strengths that the site on the campus of K-State19 University provides.

We cannot afford to wait several days 2 for samples to be moved to the coast for the3 results to be determined.4 Nearly 20,000 head of pigs move from our5 facilities annually. In fact, one half of the6 nation's fed cattle, 40 percent of the hog7 production, and this has been talked about before,8 20 percent of beef cows and calves are raised9 within a 250 mile radius in Kansas. 10 We, I'm talking about me and my family,11 are confident that the safe guards built into the12 design of the proposed facility are more than13 adequate to contain any present or future disease14 that is being studied.15 In fact, if there's anything we would be16 concerned about, it's about the integrity of17 moving samples all across the United States to the18 coast and having to wait several days to get the19 results.20 As a member of the house of21 representatives, I currently serve as22 appropriations chair, and as Lee Tafanelli, my23 Vice-Chair of Appropriations just spoke, he spoke24 about the unanimous support of the House of25 Representatives and of our legislature for the 1| 17.4 2| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 68 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 17.4 DHS notes the commentor's statement.

Anything we proposed moved through3 very fast.4 I would keep my comments short, but just5 want to end with this. Because of the Kansas6 agriculture heritage and its expertise, Kansans7 understand why this facility is a top priority for8 the nation and why we need to identify new ways to9 prevent and treat diseases that affect public 10 health, animal health and our food supply.11 I strongly encourage the Department of12 Homeland Security to consider the State's existing13 building and security infrastructure as well as14 the human resources already in place that make15 Kansas a natural fit for the location of the new16 facility being proposed.

Before I want to tell you24 why I believe NBAF is to be built in Manhattan, I25 want to make the following statement: We 2 cont.| 24.4 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 69 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3165 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 96 1 definitely need NBAF in this country, and we have 2 to build it safe and secure. People like me have3 to go to Canada, to Winnipeg, north of the border4 of North Dakota to do research. We don't have a5 facility here in this country to do it.6 So why is NBAF -- why is Manhattan a good7 place for NBAF? Number one, the people here, the8 community is supporting this kind of research.9 When I interviewed here nine months ago, I was 10 welcomed by the infectious and emerging diagnosis11 disease research. In welcoming me and family, not12 only the Professor from the College of Veterinary13 Medicine went to dinner with me, but the people14 from the Chamber of Commerce and other people from15 the State. They are greatly embracing what I do,16 so my family is welcomed and not questioned.17 Secondly, what can K-State offer to NBAF?18 Number one, it's centrally located. You can fly19 into Manhattan airport. I realize that I'm recent20 relocation here, you can get direct commute to21 Denver, great international airport and direct22 flights to -- many direct flights to Kansas City,23 national carriers.

I think the government's done an17 outstanding job of presenting its case, as well as18 an excellent algorithm of how to derive it.19 I'm from Kansas, I live in Kansas, I'm a20 Kansas Stater. I'm a person who creates jobs.

The number one industry in Kansas is the3 beef cattle industry.4 Our academicians, our politicians, view5 this from one perspective. As a person in Kansas6 who creates jobs, creates wealth, creates an7 environment for people to live, I look at it in a8 different perspective.9 I have a lot of common sense, and that's 10 what I'm looking at here. If I were the11 government, why would you want to put a facility12 where a rumor of an outbreak or an outbreak would13 devastate and destroy the entire beef production14 of our government, of our entire country.15 Nebraska, Colorado, Missouri, Kansas, and16 Oklahoma, produce the vast majority of the beef in17 our country. People eat that. It's a big source18 of protein. Just a rumor of an outbreak or an19 actual outbreak would destroy a very large segment20 of the beef industry and the beef production for21 our country.22 I also think that Kansas is so tightly23 wound around agriculture that if there was a rumor24 of an outbreak, just a rumor, it would jeopardize25 Kansas' brand of beef, and it would forever taint 1| 5.4 2| 15.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 73 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 5.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the five mainland site alternatives. The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 show that even though Plum Island has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. The lower potential effect is due both to the water barrier around the island and the lack of livestock and suseptible wildlife species. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.4 The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible economic effect would be significant for all sites. Section 3.10.9 presents estimates of the possible economic effect of an accidental release.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3169 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 100 1 our ability to sell beef outside of our State into 2 foreign countries. I think a more reasonable3 place would be to locate this where there's not4 much food being produced, so if there was an5 outbreak, it would have little effect on the6 ability of Americans to acquire beef or acquire a7 protein source.8 That being said, Kansas would be the9 perfect place for your facility. It has the great 10 University, it wants the money, it wants the11 prestige, the scientists are here, but from a12 common sense perspective, it doesn't make any13 sense to have it here.14 But I appreciate what you've done and I15 appreciate your methodology and look forward to16 the outcome.

Much to the3 contrary, I support research in the area of4 foreign animal diseases. We need to be prepared5 to combat the threat of agro-terrorism in this6 country. A release of foreign animal disease,7 either intentional or negligent, would be8 devastating to the livestock industry and to the9 State of Kansas. I commend DHS and the USDA for 10 undertaking this process.11 I do, however, strongly oppose the citing12 of NBAF in Manhattan, Kansas. This laboratory13 should not be constructed in the heart of cattle14 country. We've heard many speakers tonight talk15 about the importance of the Animal Health16 Corridor.17 Why is the Animal Health Corridor here?18 It's because the concentration of animals is here.19 They want to be located proximate to those20 animals. That's why they're here, and that's why21 the facility should not be built here.22 This facility should be built, however,23 on Plum Island. Common sense and science must24 prevail in the decision process of where to locate25 NBAF. 1| 25.4 2| 5.4 3| 24.1 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 75 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 5.4 As described in Section 2.3.1 of the NBAF EIS, DHS's site selection criteria included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in suburban or semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 24.1 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Plum Island Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3171 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 102 1 The government accountability office 2 released a report on May 22nd, and in that report,3 they said this facility should not be built on the4 mainland because there's no evidence to support5 that it can be done safely on the U.S. mainland.6 I hope you folks take that into consideration in7 your final draft of the EIS.8 There are a couple of other points that I9 think you should take into consideration in the 10 final EIS. One is the proximity of the laboratory11 to the purebred beef teaching unit at Kansas State12 University. If you look at a map, the purebred13 beef teaching unit is just north of this proposed14 facility. There's a lot of traffic in and out of15 that facility on an annual basis, and the -- there16 are animals that are moved in and out of there all17 across the U.S., so I think that's something18 important to consider.19 Also, we live in the heart of the Flint20 Hills, and the importance of that is that the21 pasture season for cattle in Kansas is May 1 to22 November 1, and part of the importance of stamping23 out Foot and Mouth, if it's released, is early24 detection, and when you put cattle out into the25 pasture, you don't look at them every day.

Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the monitoring for pathogen release and the impact of a pathogen on the local population, livestock, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and the site specific consequences of each accident scenario to human populations, agriculture and livestock and wildlife. The chances of an accidental release are low. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Manhattan Campus Site, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area, to include agricultural livestock. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. DHS also notes the commentor's concern with monitoring for disease releases.

He's a fine man.6 Obviously, an able scientist, and I can see why7 K-State wants him on their team. I would like to8 quote from him from his testimony before Congress9 earlier this decade. In terms of an economic 10 impact, it would be devastating if Foot and Mouth11 were released, and any outbreak of Foot and Mouth12 Disease could mean the destructions of thousands13 of animals, immediately impact our capacity to14 export agricultural products, and create severe15 financial losses in only a matter of days and16 weeks, he stated.17 I hope that we do not trade our community18 safety for money and prestige.

Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 15.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible economic effect would be significant for all sites. The potential effects to livestock-related industries is discussed in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease free. Other economic impacts were considered negligible in comparison to the foreign trade ban impacts.

What is it going to do12 to our exports of beef if they're scared right now13 if we build this facility in Manhattan, Kansas,14 because that's the heartland of the beef industry.15 Now, I also want to tell you this.

Section 3.6.1 of the NBAF EIS describes the methodology used to assess each site's potential seismic consequences; and Section 3.6.4 specifically describes the Manhattan Campus Site. Section 3.6.4.1 discusses the Humboldt Fault system and was considered in the analysis of seismic risk to the Manhattan Campus Site.

Section 3.14.3.2 further addresses NBAF design criteria and accident scenarios associated with natural phenomena events such as earthquakes, high winds, lightning, floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes; and the natural phenomena effects are combined into a single bounding accident analysis.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3175 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 106 1 many of you remember the tornado that went through 2 Manhattan in 1966?

The economic impact of an accidental release, including the impact on the livestock-related industries, is presented in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a potential ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years. This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. In the unlikely event that a 500-year wind storm strikes the facility, the interior BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be expected to withstand a 200 mph wind load (commonly determined to be an F3 tornado). If the NBAF took a direct hit from an F3 tornado, the exterior walls and roofing of the building would likely fail first. This breach in the exterior skin would cause a dramatic increase in internal pressures leading to further failure of the building's interior and exterior walls. However, the loss of these architectural wall components should actually decrease the overall wind loading applied to the building, and diminish the possibility of damage to the building's primary structural system. Since the walls of the BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be reinforced cast-in-place concrete, those inner walls would be expected to withstand the tornado. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concerns regarding the impact of a pathogen release on the local population, livestock industry, businesses and infrastructure. The NBAF would be designed, constructed, and operated to ensure the maximum level of public safety and to fulfill all necessary requirements to protect the environment. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, including releases due to weather events. The chances of an accidental release are low. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release based on human error are low in large part due to the design and implementation of biocontainment safeguards in conjunction with rigorous personnel training. For example, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the NBAF EIS, all laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handling of hazardousChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3176 infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Appendix B to the EIS describes biocontainment lapses and laboratory acquired infections. Laboratory-acquired infections have not been shown to be a threat to the community at large. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations, including institutionalized populations, residing within the local area. The need for an evacuation under an accident conditions is considered to be a very low probability event. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF, would enable the NBAF to be safely operated.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3177 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 107 1 article on Foot and Mouth.

Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS, investigates the chances of a variety of accidents that could occur with the proposed NBAF and consequences of potential accidents, Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. As set out in Section 3.14.3.4 of the NBAF EIS, employees and contractors will be screened prior to employment or engagement and monitored while working, among other security measures. In addition, oversight of NBAF operations, as described in Section 2.2.2.6 of the NBAF EIS, will be conducted in part by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which includes community representative participation, and the APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. While the risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Should the NBAF Record of Decision call for the design, construction, and operations of the NBAF at the Manhattan Campus Site, site specific protocols would then be developed in coordination with local emergency response agencies and would consider the diversity and density of populations residing within the local area, to include agricultural livestock. DHS would have site-specific standard operating procedures and emergency response plans in place prior to the initiation of research activities at the proposed NBAF. Emergency response plans will include the current USDA emergency response plan for foot and mouth disease (FMD) which includes compensation for livestock losses.

If indeed Manhattan13 and Kansas State University are the center of the14 global animal health corridor, that alone should15 be argument enough to not locate the NBAF here.16 Co-locating your high level biological17 research facility in the middle of, or adjacent18 to, the nation's largest food animal population19 area you assert you're trying to protect, makes20 the area a prime target, intentionally or21 unintentionally, for an attack or a disaster.22 History is full of tragic events that the23 public was told would never happen by24 self-interested scientists, engineers and25 politicians, and we saw that here today.

Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern that the NBAF would be a prime terrorist target. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address accident scenarios, including external events such as a terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (TRA) (designated as For Official Use Only) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high-consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process. Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts.

The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphereChapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3180 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 110 1 self-interested individuals offer exaggerated 2 claims regarding the economic benefit to the area3 should the NBAF be cited here.4 However, these same individuals are5 unable or unwilling to provide any information6 regarding the economic, environmental, or health7 risk of a worse case scenario.8 We hear all the reasons why Manhattan9 should be the site for NBAF, but we never hear any 10 reasons why it should not be.

As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the EOI.

The potential biological and socioeconomic effects from a pathogen release from the NBAF are included in Sections 3.8.9 and 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, respectively. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites. As noted in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D, the major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. The mainland sites have similar economic consequences regardless of the livestock populations in the region.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3187 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 117 1 livestock. We background about 150 cattle each 2 year.3 That said, I'm very interested in seeing4 this facility located here. I was just5 recently -- in fact, I got back from New York City6 at 2:30 a.m. this morning, so I've been there7 recently. I probably talked to 15 or 20 people at8 Central Park last week and there wasn't one of9 them who knew what a cow looked like, so why would 10 they want to have that on Plum Island?11 We need the facility here in Kansas,12 where there's cattle. You put a research facility13 close to what you're trying to research. It's not14 on an island where there's fish. We need it here15 for cattle.16 The need for this facility is such that17 if something does break out, the quicker we can18 get it stopped is the better thing. Not let it19 gradually work from the east coast or the southern20 coast to this area. We need it right here. All21 the researchers are here and this is where it22 needs to be done.23 With that in mind, please select24 Manhattan, Kansas.

MCKEE: Good evening, and thank3 you for the opportunity to testify. I'm a school4 administrator. I have been a school administrator5 in Manhattan. Prior to that, I spent 34 years in6 agriculture in Western Kansas and was a county7 commissioner in Ford County. Ford County is one8 of the corners of the triangle of beef production9 in the western part of the State, and people out 10 there have great respect for the research and the11 ability of Kansas State University in helping keep12 cattle industry viable and protect it against the13 kinds of diseases that NBAF would research.14 We all forget that this could occur15 accidentally or because of some sort of security16 attack, and having the answers is very important17 in order to solve that particular part of the18 crisis that can come from an attack on cattle.19 I think that respect -- the University is20 very important and the fact that there is21 extension out there that continues to feed to22 people makes us, representing western Kansas and23 still having a farm, eager to see that kind of24 information developed and be part of it.25 I want to also say I have five 1| 21.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 92 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's statement.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3189 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 119 1 grandchildren here in Manhattan, Kansas, and three 2 children, and I am willing to have this sort of3 research in this place so that those children can4 have the kind of future that they need to have and5 they can be surrounded by the researchers and the6 people who are doing the discussion so that in7 their K-12 education, they are inspired to find8 answers that help the rest of the country.9 I think Kansas has been much interested 10 in service to people and I have four nephews who11 are in the military active right now, I'm willing12 to give part of my agricultural risk into this13 because they went over to give their lives, I can14 give a little bit of risk, a little bit of15 potential to make sure that every aspect of16 freedom is served and I think Kansans do that for17 this country, and so I'm in favor of NBAF and the18 best way to build the future is to have control of19 it and take the initiative to get to the answers,20 so I would encourage its placement here in21 Manhattan.

What I want to talk about a3 little bit tonight addresses both the board and4 the community about these types of facilities.5 As part of construction, a lot of times6 you want to know what you're building, how to do7 it right, so as part of that, when I was8 superintendent, I went to other facilities9 throughout the country and studied how they were 10 set up, how they were managed, how they were11 built. And in that, you learn what works and what12 doesn't and you get to see the technology change13 as they occur. Over even just the last five14 years, and in building the BRI, we have top level15 technology. It's very impressive when you come16 through. Some people have toured the facility and17 seen that.18 And what I want people to understand is19 that when the original Plum Island was set up, the20 reason it was on an island is because they didn't21 have containment, they didn't know what22 containment was, and over the last 50 years or so,23 it has -- it's light years, it's like NASA. The24 technology has increased exponentially. We're25 still increasing technology eve to this very day.

I think you9 have more concern with the study of bombs and 10 explosives, things that are put up in the air on11 purpose. And they work on biological agents,12 they're inside small safety cabinets that are13 filtered. We filter the air in our building every14 five minutes, so we clean the air in Manhattan15 literally in our facility.16 I've been a resident here for over 2017 years. I have a family, and I certainly don't18 want to see any harm come to them or any of you19 folks, and so I speak to the public on that.

The BRI, which is BSL-3Ag3 facility, a lot of similarities to what the NBAF4 would be, was built for about $500 a square foot,5 which is almost half of what it cost to build that6 type of facility anywhere in the country. I've7 had many people come in and look at our facility8 and are astounded that we were able to build it9 for that price. Certainly I would like to 10 attribute that to lower labor costs here, but also11 to good construction management and good skilled12 labor.13 The people that built that facility14 obviously are from these areas. There were few15 specialty contractors that came in from out of16 state but certainly, that building can be built17 here for a good cost and safely and be a benefit18 to the community.

The potential economic effects including those from an accidental release are discussed in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D of the NBAF EIS. The primary economic effect of an accidental release would be the banning of U.S. livestock products regardless of the location of the accidental release, which could reach as high as $4.2 billion until the U.S. was declared foreign animal disease free. DHS believes that experience shows that facilities utilizing modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF, would enable NBAF to be safely operated regardless of the location.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3195 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 125 1 However, the meeting is open until 10 o'clock, and 2 what we'd like to do is if there's anyone here who3 wishes to speak who did not sign up, who would4 like to do so now, please feel free to come5 forward and present some comments.6 Yes, sir.7 MR.

I realize the4 economic and scientific impact it would have for5 Manhattan and KSU. Naturally, I have many6 reservations with respect to locating the facility7 in Manhattan. It could be construed that we just8 don't want it in our front or back yard. There's9 more to it than that. 10 Why not in an area not populated by11 people or livestock?12 The hazard to surrounding population and13 research outweighs any perceived advantage of14 locating in Manhattan. Years and years of15 research by many K-State scientists could16 momentarily be destroyed.17 We are aware of what happened in Britain.18 It was worse than we can imagine because we were19 not there. The collateral damage to the livestock20 industry of Kansas and surrounding states cannot21 realistically be anticipated. In Kansas alone,22 farmers and ranchers face the possibility of23 various natural disasters: Weather, drought,24 hail, wind, floods and tornadoes, as well as hot25 and cold, so why develop another possible hazard 1| 25.4 2| 21.4 3| 15.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 101 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative. Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 21.4 Accidents could occur in the form of procedural violations (operational accidents), natural phenomena accidents, external events, and intentional acts. Although some accidents are more likely to occur than others (e.g., safety protocol not being followed), the chances of an accidental release are low. The specific objective of the hazard identification, accident analysis, and risk assessment is to identify the likelihood and consequences from accidents or intentional subversive acts. In addition to identifying the potential for or likelihood of the scenarios leading to adverse consequences, this analysis provides support for the identification of specific engineering and administrative controls to either prevent a pathogen release or mitigate the consequences of such a release. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but the economic effect would be significant for all sites. As described in Section 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, the economic impact of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus has been previously studied and could result in a loss in the range of $2.8 billion in the Plum Island region to $4.2 billion in the Manhattan, Kansas area over an extended period of time. The economic loss is mainly due to potential foreign bans on U.S. livestock products. Although the effects of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus on the national economy has not been as extensively studied, the potential economic loss due to foreign bans on livestock could be similar to that of foot and mouth disease outbreak, while the additional cost due to its effect on the human population could be as high as $50 billion. There is little economic data regarding the accidental or deliberate Nipah virus release. However, cost would be expected to be much lower then a release of foot and mouth disease virus or Rift Valley fever virus as the Nipah virus vector is not present in the western hemisphere. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 15.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The potential effects to livestock-related industries is discussed in Section 3.10. As noted in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D, the major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. The mainland sites have similar economic consequences regardless of the livestock populations in the region.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3198 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 128 1 for them to face. 2 I would think that an alternate facility3 could be used to research the capability of a4 facility to withstand earthquakes and tornadoes.5 There are wind tunnels used for various types of6 research. With respect to earthquakes, millions7 are being spent on Tuttle Creek Dam to, hopefully,8 withstand earthquakes of a certain magnitude. I9 imagine there were unbelievable resources made 10 available to provide for nuclear testing in the11 Yucca Flats. I realize the cost to develop there12 would be great and take time, but that cost could13 be possibly be far less than losses we could14 anticipate to occur by putting a facility in the15 midst of people, livestock and already existing16 research.17 We hear they're protecting the interest18 of the police department as to a worse case19 scenario. With respect to radius of20 contamination, would there be time to leave the21 area or would it immediately be too late?22 I am not a scientist, as you undoubtedly23 realize. I live a half mile from the proposed24 site. Others live across the street from the vet25 med complex that adjoins the site. Additionally,4| 21.4 5| 5.0 4 cont.| 21.4 5 cont.| 5.0 6| 19.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 102 of 109 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commenter's concern regarding potential tornado impacts to the NBAF. The NBAF would be designed and built to withstand the normal meteorological conditions that are present within the geographic area of the selected site (hurricanes, tornados, etc.). Given the nature of the facility, more stringent building codes are applied to the NBAF than are used for homes and most businesses, regardless of which NBAF site is chosen. The building would be built to withstand wind pressures up to 170% of the winds which are expected to occur locally within a period of 50 years. This means the building's structural system could resist a wind speed that is expected to occur, on the average, only once in a 500 year period. In the unlikely event that a 500-year wind storm strikes the facility, the interior BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be expected to withstand a 200 mph wind load (commonly determined to be an F3 tornado). If the NBAF took a direct hit from an F3 tornado, the exterior walls and roofing of the building would likely fail first. This breach in the exterior skin would cause a dramatic increase in internal pressures leading to further failure of the building's interior and exterior walls. However, the loss of these architectural wall components should actually decrease the overall wind loading applied to the building, and diminish the possibility of damage to the building's primary structural system. Since the walls of the BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 spaces would be reinforced cast-in-place concrete, those inner walls would be expected to withstand the tornado. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 5.0 DHS notes the commentor's concern. As described in Section 2.4.3 of the NBAF EIS, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evaluation by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitable (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce. The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still meeting the requirements listed in the EOI. Comment No: 6 Issue Code: 19.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern. A site-specific emergency response plan would be developed and coordinated with the local emergency management plan regarding evacuations and other emergency response measures for all potential emergency events including accidents at the NBAF. The type of, duration, and geographical extent of quarantine would be determined by the appropriate authorities depending on the pathogen released and contamination level.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3199 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 129 1 livestock is equally close. 2 With respect to the present location of3 Plum Island, is that area reluctant to lose the4 facility, or are they looking forward to that5 possibility?6 For my unsophisticated concerns, I just7 cannot be supportive having the NBAF located in8 Manhattan.

The conclusions expressed in Section 3.14 show that even though Plum Island has a lower potential impact in case of a release, the probability of a release is low at all sites. The lower potential effect is due both to the water barrier around the island and the lack of livestock and suseptible wildlife species.

This was a local area, so22 common sense will just show that it shouldn't be23 here.24 Like I say, everyone that's for it, it's25 just all about the money, lining their pockets. 2| 15.4 3| 25.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 105 of 109 Comment No: 2 Issue Code: 15.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern. The potential biological and socioeconomic effects from a pathogen release from the NBAF are included in Sections 3.8.9 and 3.10.9 of the NBAF EIS, respectively. The risk of an accidental release of a pathogen is extremely low, but DHS acknowledges that the possible effects would be significant for all sites. As noted in Section 3.10.9 and Appendix D, the major economic effect from an accidental release of a pathogen would be a ban on all U.S. livestock products until the country was determined to be disease-free. The mainland sites have similar economic consequences regardless of the livestock populations in the region. It is beyond the scope of the EIS to speculate on reaction of foreign markets to the construction and operation of NBAF. Comment No: 3 Issue Code: 25.4 DHS notes the commentor's opposition to the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3202 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 132 1 It's time we stand up and say, hey, let's spend a 2 little more money, let's put it out away from the3 public, and as Nancy Boyda said, there's problems4 in New York. People were almost hospitalized or5 possibly killed, so gee, let's put it in Kansas6 where people can get hospitalized or possibly7 killed.8 Let's get it out as far away from the9 population as we can so everything can be safe. 10 We have the internet and all information can be11 shipped just as quick 2,000 miles as it can be a12 hundred miles, so information, like I say, won't13 be a problem. Transportation won't be a problem,14 but it's best just to keep everything away. Let's15 not help the -- everybody talks about foreign16 terrorists, but I'm just as skeptical of the PETA,17 animal rights people, they will go to no bounds,18 and that's just bringing it right close. Just19 helping them out that much closer to destroying20 what they are trying to destroy, so just leave it21 where it belongs, spend the extra money, everybody22 will be a lot happier. Thank you.23 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you, sir.24 Is there anyone else who'd like to speak25 this evening?4| 5.0 4 cont.| 5.0 5| 21.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 106 of 109 Comment No: 4 Issue Code: 5.0 As described in Section 2.3.1, DHS's site selection process including site selection criteria that included, but were not limited to, such factors as proximity to research capabilities and workforce. As such, some but not all of the sites selected for analysis as reasonable alternatives in the NBAF EIS are located in subburban or sem-urban areas. Nevertheless, it has been shown that modern biosafety laboratories can be safely operated in populated areas. An example is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, where such facilities employ modern biocontainment technologies and safety protocols, such as would be employed in the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Comment No: 5 Issue Code: 21.4 DHS notes the commentor's concern that the NBAF would be a prime terrorist target. Section 3.14 and Appendix E of the NBAF EIS address accident scenarios, including external events such as a terrorist attack. A separate Threat and Risk Assessment (designated as For Official Use Only)(TRA) (designated as For Official Use Only and not available to the public for security reasons) was developed outside of the EIS process in accordance with the requirements stipulated in federal regulations. The purpose of the TRA was to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses associated with the NBAF and are used to recommend the most prudent measures to establish a reasonable level of risk for the security of operations of the NBAF and public safety. Because of the importance of the NBAF mission and the associated work with potential high-consequence biological pathogens, critical information related to the potential for adverse consequences as a result of intentional acts has been incorporated into the NEPA process.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3203 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 133 1 Yes, sir, please come to the microphone. 2 MR. BROWN: My name is Bill Brown,3 I'm a veterinarian locally here in Wamego, Kansas.4 I practiced in western Kansas for 20 years and the5 last 15 years I've been with a swine genetics6 company, and my role today is moving live animals7 across state lines and internationally.8 I had the opportunity a few years ago to9 go to Plum Island, to their foreign animal disease 10 diagnosticians course, and saw firsthand that lab,11 and became instantly aware of the shortcomings of12 that lab. They do a tremendous service there, and13 that service needs to continue.14 Over the years, I've been able to observe15 several labs, working in the animal health side of16 the house, and we've seen it, heard a lot of the17 speakers tonight talk about the increase in18 technology and we've seen that over and over.19 The opportunity to go to USAMRIID during20 the first Gulf War with an equine botulism21 department check allowed me firsthand to visualize22 that lab and, again, the technology has just23 increased over time, so I would support the lab,24 NBAF lab coming to Manhattan for several reasons,25 but I think a couple of the most important things 1| 24.4 July 31, 2008, Manhattan, KS, Manhattan Evening Page 107 of 109 Comment No: 1 Issue Code: 24.4 DHS notes the commentor's support for the Manhattan Campus Site Alternative.Chapter 2 - Comment Documents NBAF Final Environmental Impact Statement December 2008 2-3204 NBAF EIS SCOPING MEETING JULY 31, 2008 (evening) KSU MANHATTAN, KANSAS Page 134 1 are, one, it is strategically located, and there's 2 a lot of second and third order effects from being3 in that strategic location.4 Kansas is focused, K-State is focused,5 and there's many benefits and there's many merits6 in locating that NBAF lab here at this university.7 Thank you.8 MODERATOR COGHILL: Thank you, sir.9 Anyone else at this point in time? 10 All right, at this point, I'd like to11 turn it back over to Jamie.12 MR.
