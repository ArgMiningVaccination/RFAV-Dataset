Check out this overview of how to make natural dyes from Spencer's course on how to dye fabric using products from nature. The first step in how to make natural dyes for fabric is to figure out what organic materials you're going to use. Most of the time, this will depend on what colors you want to make, however you could also just use what you have around the house and see what colors you can create. Other materials that you'll need include: Check out the full course to learn about optional additional materials, including the materials you'll need to actually dye your fabric. The process of turning organic materials into dye is called \"extraction,\" since you're extracting the natural colors from the product. You have a couple of options for how to extract. Spencer recommends adding your ingredient and cool water to a jar and placing it on a windowsill for a week or so to let the sun do the work for you. Even an overnight soak will get you some good, usable color. Want to use your dye sooner? A quicker extraction method is to simply chop up your desired ingredient and add it to a saucepan with enough water to fully cover it. Bring the water to a simmer over medium heat and allow to simmer for one hour. Then allow the water to come to room temperature. With both solar extraction and the quick heated extraction method you'll want to finish making your dye by straining it. That's where the cheesecloth (or coffee filters or fabric scraps) will come in handy. If you're not totally satisfied with the colors that you've achieved\u2014or if you just want to play around a little more\u2014you can switch up the hues by modifying their pH levels. Many natural dyes are pH sensitive, which allows you to change the color with the addition of something acidic (like lemon juice or vinegar) or something alkaline (like baking soda). If you're intent on darkening your dye, then a good way to do it is to add something that rusts. Spencer notes that she'll sometimes add steel wood nails to darken her colors, or even create [iron-based natural dyes](https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/4-Binding-Techniques-to-Rust-Dye-Cotton-Fabric/331118811) by adding nails to equal parts vinegar and water. To actually use your dyes on fabric, you'll need to set them first. This is done by applying a fixative\u2014also called a mordant\u2014to your fabric prior to dyeing. Salt and vinegar are both natural fixatives and a good way to go with these types of dyes, with salt being ideal for dyes made from fruits and berries and vinegar ideal for dyes made from plants. Combine either \u00bd cup salt with eight cups water or equal parts vinegar and water in a saucepan, then add your fabric and simmer for one hour. When you're done, run the fabric under cool water and then start applying your dye.
