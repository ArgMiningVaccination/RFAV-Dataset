The majoroffers the B.S. degree and is unified by the LifeSciences core curriculum (see below, Major106 / Programs and Courses Requirements), which students complete during their initial years at UCR or at anothercollege or university (transfer students). For advanced study in the junior and senior years, students select an area of specialization(track) from the nine that are now available:Bioinformatics and Genomics; Biology; Cell,Molecular Med ical Biology;Microbiology; and Plant Biology. Each trackprovides the opportunity to combine broadbasic training in biological sciences with anemphasis in an area of particular interest to thestudent. Both the name of the major (Biological Sciences) and the track are included on the official transcript. The organization of the major into tracks and the participation of a large number of facultyallows a diversity of student choices that couldnot be provided by a single department. Thetrack structure allows flexibility to incorporatenew faculty and research areas so studentscan prepare for graduate study and careers inemerging fields of biology. As their interestschange and develop during the initial years atUCR, students can easily change their trackselection for the junior and senior years. As can be seen from the track descriptions and other items below, the Biological Sciencesmajor provides preparation for a broad diversityof professional schools, graduate schools andcareers. Students in this major and all others atUCR are eligible to complete admissionrequirements and apply to medical schoolsthroughout the United States, including the 24positions reserved for UCR students in the jointUCR/UCLA medical school (Thom as HaiderProgram in Biomedical Sciences). For additional information, see below, Admis sionRequirements for Medical and HealthProfessional Schools. University Requirements See Undergraduate Studies section. College Requirements See College of Natural and AgriculturalSciences, Colleges and Programs section. Major Requirements Some of the following requirements for themajor may also fulfill the college's breadthrequirements. Consult with a department advisor for program planning. The major requirements for the B.S. in Biolog ical Sciences are as follows: 1. Life Sciences core requirements (68-72 units) Students must complete all required courses with a grade of \"C-\" or better and with acumulative GPA in the core courses of atleast 2.0. Grades of \"D\" or \"F\" in two corecourses, either separate courses or repeti-tions of the same course, are grounds 110A 2. As specified in the individual tracks, at least 36 upper-division units for the major and 16 units of substantive course work related to the major. Courses in Statistics and Biochemistry taken as part of the core maybe included. A student is subject to discontinuation from the major whenever the GPA in upper-divisioncourse work is below 2.0. Students findingthemselves in this circumstance must meetwith an advisor. Bioinformatics and Genomics Track Bioinformatics and Genomics are popular newfields whose emergence is catalyzed by theexplosion of data made available throughautomated DNA sequencing. They meld in aseamless fashion genetics, mo lecular andcellular biology, statistics, and computer science. This curricular track has been care-fully designed to be flexible so that avenuesof study can be computational or experimen-tal, or both, and therefore has wide appeal tostudents of varying interests. This track isunique in its ability to accommodate agricul-tural, microbial, and animal bioinformaticsand genomics under a single programmaticumbrella and allow students to interface withinstructors from a broad array of departments.The interdisciplinary nature of Bioinformaticsand Genomics prepares students to be highlycompetitive for further graduate education orfor immediate placement in biotechnology andallied industries. 1.

Biology Track The Biology track provides up-to-date prepara-tion for postgraduate study and careers in thefields of medicine, health science, teaching,and research. These options require under-standing and integration of the different levelsand processes of biological organization. Thelevels include cell and molecular, organismal,community and population; im portant lifeprocesses are reproduction, development, andevolution. An overview onthe unifying principles of the discipline. The upper-division courses are more special- ized and provide in-depth examination of spe-cific subfields of biology. From a list of coursesin each area, students select three upper-divi-sion courses in cell or molecular biology, twocourses in the structure and function of organ-isms, and two courses in a subfield with thefollowing integrated and overlapping topics:ecology, evolution, systematics, and behavior.Hands-on learning is encouraged so that stu-dents can participate rather than just observescience in this age of technology. Among theupper-division biology courses, there must beat least two courses that have a laboratory orfield component. Students in this track also select two courses from a number of options in computer scienceand statistics. Statistics is needed to plan andcarry out experiments, read and understandscientific literature, and interpret data in medi-cine and other fields of science.

BCH Conservation biology seeks to understand theconsequen ces of the rapid loss of Earth's diversity of life and to preserve biodiversity.Conservation Biol ogy is a multidisciplinary science that applies principles of ecology, population gen etics, evolutionary biology, andother sciences to solve problems related to theloss of biodiversity. The emergence of conservation biology stems from the recognition that Earth's ecological sys-tems face critical problems from rapid growthof human populations and per capita resourceconsumption. A major focus of the discipline isthe study of human im pacts on biodiversity,with special emphasis on managementprocesses that prevent species extinctions andameliorate anthropogenic damage to ecosys-tems. People rely on a healthy bio sphere formost of their basic requirements for food, med-icines, chemicals, fibers, and building materi-als. Ecosystem processes are dependent on biodiversity and are critical for nutrient recycling, degradation of human wastes and pollutants,and maintenance of the chemical composition ofthe atmosphere. Bio diver sity also providesimportant aesthetic benefits, as well as a vastgenetic library that provides vital resources forthe developing enterprise of biotechnology. Students earning a bachelor's degree in Bio logical Sciences with the Conservation Biol ogy track aretrained to help society understand the extent andconsequences of biodiversity loss, and to provideobjective scientific data to resource managers andsocial planners. Stu dents who are broadly trainedin fields relevant to Conservation Biology, such asecology, population genetics, evolutionary biology,and earth or environmental sciences, will be pre-pared for graduate study and a variety of ca reersin research, education or environmental consult-ing and management. Suggested areas of specialization include ecol- ogy, evolution and systematics, and earth orenvironmental sciences. Because Conserva tionBiology is broadly interdisciplinary, students areadvised to select lower-division courses inhumanities and social sciences with an eye tothe prerequisite structure of upper-divisioncourses in Geology, Environmental Sciences,Anthropology, or Economics that might formtheir upper-division specialization. 1.

Students in the pro-gram are required to complete BLSC 192H andBLSC 193H, seminar/thesis courses for a totalof 4 The students are also required toenroll in BLSC 198H and BLSC 195H to workon and complete an honors thesis under thesupervision of a faculty member, for a total of12 units distributed over three to six quarters in their junior and senior years. Selecting a Track The requirements of the Life Sciences corecurriculum occupy most of the first two years ofstudy; therefore, Biological Sciences majorsneed not select their area of specialization(track) until the beginning of the junior year.However, if a student desires, a track can beselected earlier. For assistance in selecting atrack, a student should consult with a facultyadvisor in the area of interest. Consultations ofthis kind are conducted in the CNAS AcademicAdvising Center (1223 Pierce Hall). To declarea track or transfer from one track to another,students inform the Advising Center staff.Comparison of Tracks in Bio log ic al Sciences Major with Dep art mental Majors Also available at UCR are some departmentalmajors similar to certain tracks within theBiological Sciences major. The upper-divisionrequirements for the departmental majors inBiology and Plant Biology (see those sectionsin this catalog) are similar to the requirementsin the Biology and Plant Biology tracks, respec-tively. The Life Sciences core curriculum isrequired for these departmental majors as withall the tracks in the Biological Sciences major,so students in good standing can easily transferfrom one major to another simply by filing theChange of Major form. A choice of a B.A or B.S. degree is available for the departmental Biology major, whereas onlythe B.S. degree is offered for the Biology trackand all other tracks in the Biological Sciencesmajor. In comparison with the dep artmentalBiology major, the Biology track has a moreprescribed selection for the upper-divisioncourses. The Biology major requires genetics(BIOL 102) and an additional 32 up per-divisionunits to be selected from courses on theapproved list. The Biology track is intended toensure a breadth of course work in life sci-ences in contrast to the other more specializedtracks in the Biological Sciences major. Asdescribed below, the 36 units of upper-divisioncourses for the Biology track must include atleast two laboratory or field courses, threecourses in the cell/molecular area (includinggenetics), two courses in the functional biologyof organisms, and two courses in the integratedfields of ecology/evolution/systematics/behavior. The departmental Plant Biology major differs from the Plant Biology track primarily in offer-ing a B.A. option in addition to the B.S. option.The upper-division course requirements areidentical for the departmental major and thePlant Biology track. Enrollment Options and Advising The CNAS Academic Advising Center (1223Pierce Hall, [951] 827-3579) is the advisingoffice for all students majoring in Biology,Biological Sci ences, Plant Biology, andNeuroscience. The CNAS Academic AdvisingCenter is open Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. Faculty advisors areusually available for advising Tuesday throughFriday, 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 3 p.m. Advising is on a walk-in basis. Students sign in at the counter indicating what is needed. Aquarterly schedule, available at the counter,lists faculty advisors, their advising hours, andareas of specialization. Prospective, new, and continuing students considering enrollment in the above majors arewelcome to visit or phone the CNAS AcademicAdvising Center. Information is provided aboutthe majors, policies and procedures, and courseenrollment. Petitions and other related businessrequiring a signature or approval are routedthrough the CNAS Academic Advising Center. Students visit the CNAS Academic Advising Center as needed, but those in academic diffi-culty are especially urged to meet with a facultyadvisor to review study procedures and plan aprogram of study to correct deficiencies andachieve academic success. With informationalhandouts and advising, all students are urgedto create a long-range academic plan so thatcourse prerequisites are met and courses aretaken in the best possible sequence for theindividual's interests, aptitude, and careergoals. Note that a course load of approximately16 units per quarter is required for normative progress toward the degree. Grading Basis: Letter Grade or Satisfactory (S)/No Credit (NC) Students must enroll for letter grade credit in science and mathematics courses used to satis-fy major requirements. This in cludes all coursesin the Life Sciences core curriculum, the 36upper-division units for the major, and the 16units of substantive course work related to thefield of the major. After completion of the corerequirements and up per-division requirementsfor the major, science and mathematics coursescounted as electives may be taken on a Sat is -fac tory (S)/No Credit (NC) basis. Basic Writing and English Composition (ENGL00lA, ENGL 00lB, ENGL 00lC) may betaken on an S/NC but this is strongly notrecommended. English composition is essentialand so important that students should aim forexcellence rather than a satisfactory level ofachievement. Foreign language courses maybe completed on an S/NC basis, but this is alsonot recommended. Since language courses areoften taken in series, progress is cumulative,and students may fall behind if only a satisfac-tory level is attempted in early courses in thesequence. For policies on S/NC grading, see the Aca dem ic Regulations section of this catalog. Full- or Part-time Study Students ordinarily enroll full-time in 12 to 18units of course work each quarter. Advisorapproval is required for exceptions. The dean'sapproval is required for any change in the academic program that reduces enrollmentbelow 12 units for the quarter. Students whoare unable to enroll full-time because of health,family responsibilities, or outside em ploymentmay apply to the CNAS Academic AdvisingCenter (1223 Pierce Hall) for permission to en roll part-time. Doc umentation of hours ofemployment is required. Part-time studentsmay take no more than 10 units in one quarter,and they receive a 50 percent reduction in theEducational Fee for that quarter. Minor The Biological Sciences major does not offer aminor in Biological Sciences, but seven discipli-Biological Sciences / 111 nary minors (Applied Statistics, Botany and Plant Sciences, Chemistry, Entomology, Envir on -mental Sciences, Mathematics, Neuro sci ence,Physics) are offered by departments within theCollege of Natural and Agricultural Sciences.Interested students are referred to those sectionsof this catalog. Other available minors in cludeCom puter Science in the College of En gineer ing,and more than 40 minors in the Col lege ofHumanities, Arts and Social Sciences. For students enrolled as a Biological Sciences major, a minor added to the program must bein an area that is distinctive and different fromthe chosen track (e.g., a minor in Botany andPlant Sciences is not permitted with the track in the same field). Double Major A double major can be completed with a track in Biological Sciences and another major, aslong as the chosen majors are in distinct anddifferent fields. Biological Sciences can beeither the first (primary) or second major,depending on which one is chosen for matricu-lation and emphasis. The Life Sciences corecurriculum and requirements for one of thetracks in Biological Sciences must be complet-ed. Completion of two tracks within BiologicalSciences does not count as a double majorsince both tracks are within the same major. Double majors are not allowed between certain tracks in Biological Sciences (Biology, PlantBiology) and the similar dep art ment al major inthe same field (Biology and Plant Biology). Someor all of the requirements may be completed formore than one track, but only one track will beapproved for inclusion on the transcript. Transfer Students Students planning to transfer to UCR with amajor in Biological Sciences, Biology, or PlantBiology must have \"C\" or higher grades in gen-eral chemistry (item 1, below) and at least twoof the remaining sequences in the recommend-ed priority 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a minimal courserequirement for transfer to the above majorsfrom community colleges and four-year col-leges and universities, but all five sequencesare necessary for graduation in these majors atUCR. Transfer students will usually find itadvantageous to complete most or allsequences before starting at UCR. All prospec-tive transfers should try to complete thesequences they begin rather than divide asequence between two campuses. 1. General chemistry, equivalent to CHEM001A, CHEM 001B, CHEM 001C, CHEM 01LA, CHEM 01LB, 2. First-year calculus, equivalent to MATH009A, MATH 009B 3. Introductory biology (for science majors), BIOL 05LA, andBIOL 005B (and chemistry, equivalent to CHEM112A, CHEM 112B, CHEM 112C5. General physics thePHYS002 and PHYS 040 sequences. To be eligible to transfer into one of the abovemajors, students must also have a minimumGPA of 2.70 in transferable college courses. If the equivalents of BIOL 005A, BIOL 05LA, and BIOL 005B are not accessible prior totransfer, students are strongly recommended tocomplete organic chemistry and take theBIOL005 sequence at UCR rather than the equivalent of BIOL 002 and BIOL 003 (intro- ductory biology for nonscience majors) beforetransfer. Completion of calculus is strongly recommend- ed before transfer. If sequences 1-3 are com-pleted, students are also encouraged to com-plete one year of organic chemistry with labora-tory (for which a one-year general chemistryseries is a prerequisite). Partial satisfaction ofthe breadth requirements (e.g., English,humanities, arts, social sciences, and ethnicstudies) also accelerates the student'sprogress, but priority should be given to theabove mathematics and science sequences. UCR has articulation agreements with most of the California community colleges. Theseagreements list specific community collegecourses that have been designated as compa-rable to UCR courses (see the statewide articu-lation Web site at www.assist.org ). To integrate transfer credits with a program of study at UCR, it is important that all newtransfer students consult with an advisor beforeor early in their first quarter on campus. Pro -spective UCR students are welcome to discusstheir past and future academic program withan advisor. Phone the CNAS AcademicAdvising Center, (951) 827-3579, to arrange anappointment. Independent Study and Research The various departments and programs in theCollege of Natural and Agricultural Sciencesoffer courses in which students can enroll to doindependent laboratory or field research or anin-depth library study of a topic of special inter-est. These courses are numbered 194-199 andusually have variable unit credit al lowing for dif-ferences in emphasis and time available forresearch in the student's academic program. The departments have different names and pol icies for the 190-series courses: Inde pen -dent Reading, Introduction to Research,Research for Undergraduates, Junior/SeniorResearch, Senior Research, Senior HonorsResearch. Interested students should consultwith a professor who is willing to supervise theproject. The student may suggest a specificquestion or formulate a project after consulta-tion with the instructor. Information about theresearch fields of the professors is availablefrom the CNAS Academic Advising Center (1223Pierce Hall) or at cnas-ugresearch.ucr.edu.The procedure for enrolling in these coursesdepends on the policies of the department oracademic unit sponsoring the research. ForBIOL 194, BIOL 197 and BIOL 199, the stu-dent must obtain an application form from theCNAS Academic Advising Center. Instructionsfor writing a brief description of the proposedproject are provided with the form. The com-pleted application, signed by the professor incharge of the project, is submitted to the CNASAcademic Advising Center preferably before thefirst day of the quarter but no later than theend of the second week of the quarter.Applicants for independent research shouldordinarily be sophomores, juniors or seniors in good standing and achieving well in their aca- demic program. Courses numbered 194, 197, 199 and 199H may be taken for a letter grade or \"S/NC\" dep -ending on the department or program offeringthe course. Up to 9 units of credit in the 190series may be counted as part of the 16 sub-stantive units related to the major for the B.S.degree. Internships Internships provide students with practical,part-time work experiences in conjunction withtheir academic studies. The internships aredesigned to relate a student's academic prepa-ration in the major with professional work at theentry level in community businesses andorganizations. They can be one or more quar-ters in duration. For more information or toarrange an internship, see the In ternshipCoordinator in Career Services (Veitch StudentCenter). As much as possible, the internships are ar - ranged to accommodate the student's specificinterests. Students majoring in Bio logicalSciences (or Biology, Plant Biology,Neuroscience) commonly work in local hospi-tals, clinics, museums and medical researchlaboratories. Some students do in ternships inhealth administration, environmental planningand natural resource management. Those considering high school teaching as a possiblecareer can work as tutors or teacher's aides inlocal high schools (e.g., EDUC 100). Students majoring in Biological Sciences are welcome to participate in the internship pro-gram, but they are not paid for this work. Aca -demic credit is not awarded unless a facultyadvisor approves, and the student is en rolled ina 198 course in the College of Natural and Agri -cultural Sciences. Students frequently find in -ternships helpful in investigating a possiblecareer, and some experience in the work envir -onment is helpful or required for admission toprofessional and technical training schools. Teaching Credential Teachers in the public schools of Californiamust be certified by the California Com mis sionon Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). The creden-tial requires an undergraduate major, bacca -laureate degree, and completion of a graduatecredential program such as that offered by the112 / Programs and Courses Graduate School of Education at UCR (see Education section, Credential Programs, in thiscatalog). The latter usually requires three quar-ters and includes education courses andsupervised teaching. Before admission and student teaching in a graduate credential program, candidates mustpass the California Basic Education Skills Test(CBEST) and demonstrate subject-matter profi-ciency in the fields in which they will teach.Candidates can demonstrate proficiency eitherby passing the commission's subject-matterassessment examination (CSET), or by complet-ing an undergraduate program that is CCTCapproved for teacher preparation. For students in Biological Sciences and all other majors at UCR, this campus has a CCTC-approved undergraduate program leading to aMultiple Subjects Credential and teaching inthe elementary (K-6) grades. A breadth ofcourse work is necessary in addition to thespecified requirements for the major. Studentsare urged to start early, preferably as freshmen,selecting courses most helpful for this career.Students who want a Multiple SubjectsCredential must pass the subject-matter profi-ciency examination (CSET, Multiple Subjects). UCR does not have a CCTC-approved undergrad- uate program for Biological Sciences or other sci-ence majors who wish to teach at the secondarylevel. The single-subject, Teaching Creden tial inScience, biology emphasis, is required for biologyteachers, grades 7-12, and adults. Students whoplan to get this credential must take the CSETand should make certain that their academic pro-gram includes preparatory course work. This ismost easily achieved with the breadth of coursesrequired in the Biology track of the BiologicalSciences major, but other tracks or majors maybe used, provided there is sufficient breadth topass the CSET exam. For the Teaching Credential in Science with emphasis in biology, the subject-matter exami-nation (CSET) includes 1) biology/life science indepth and 2) general science with introductory,college-level biology, chemistry, physics, andgeoscience (geology, meteorology, oceanogra-phy, astronomy). Introductory biology, chemistry,and physics are included in the Life Sciencescore curriculum, but some additional coursework in geoscience should be taken to strength-en preparation in this area. The intent is thatcandidates for the Teaching Credential inScience are prepared to teach unifying themesand principles in general and specialized science courses. There are other credential options (e.g., BCLAD) and requirements that may be completed duringthe undergraduate years. Re quire ments includeknowledge of the U.S. cardiopulmonary resusci-tation, and mainstreaming (EDUC 116).Additional information is provided in orientationmeetings Educ Initiative (CaTEACH-SMI) has agoal of addressing the critical need of highlyqualified K-12 science and mathematics teach-ers in California. With an economy increasinglyreliant on science, technology, engineering, andmathematics (STEM) and the anticipated largescale retirement of qualified teachers, this is anessential time to explore and prepare for acareer in teaching science or mathematics. CaTEACH-SMI at UCR offers undergraduate students paid/unpaid opportunities to explore STEM teaching as a career option. Through CaTEACH-SMI, students receive advising andmentoring to prepare for entrance into an internteaching credential program while diligently coordinating with academic advisors to ensure completion of STEM degree requirements. TheCaTEACH-SMI Resource Center provides futureSTEM teachers with material and financialresources to promote planning and professional development towards a science/mathematics education career. For more information about the CaTEACH-SMI program, please visit http://smi.ucr.edu or at the Resource Center at 1104 Pierce Hall. Preparation for Graduate School All the tracks in the Biological Sciences major and the departmental majors in life science(Biology, Plant Biology, Entomol ogy,Neuroscience) are appropriate as preparationfor those planning to attend graduate school foradvanced degrees (Master's, Ph.D.). The facul-ty advisor assists in selecting combinations ofcourses appropriate for advanced study in thevarious fields of biology. Students consideringgraduate study are en couraged to do un -dergraduate research and include courses incomputer science and statistics in their program. The campuses and departments of the UC set their own requirements for admission to gradu-ate school, but students should expect that atleast a \"B\" average is required to be eligible forconsideration. Higher levels are usually necessaryfor applicants to be competitive for admission aswell as financial assistance (e.g., graduate fellow-ship, teaching assistantship). Letters of recom-mendation, undergraduate research, and resultson the nationwide Grad uate Record Examinationare also considered. A minimum GPA of 2.50 inthe last 60 units of undergraduate course work isnecessary to be eligible for admission to master'sdegree programs in the California State Universitysystem, but campuses and departments usuallyhave additional or higher requirements. Preparation for Medical/Health Professions or Veterinary Medicine Suggestions for Elective Units Students must complete a minimum of 180 units for a bache-lor's degree at UCR, and each of the ninetracks in the Biological Sciences major and thedepartmental majors in life science have someunit space for elective courses. Depending onthe courses chosen to meet other require-ments, about 30 elective units remain amongthe 180 units required for graduation, aftercompletion of English composition, humanitiesand social sciences breadth courses, the LifeSciences core curriculum, and the 52 upper-division and substantive units in the field of themajor. Stu dents planning a career in medicineor health science or other areas should givecareful consideration to the use of their electiveunits to add breadth, perspective, and practicalexperience as part of the preparation for theprofessional schools and careers they have chosen. The following suggested activities were prepared after consultation with some medicalschool representatives. Communication Skills, Intern ships, Volun teer WorkInteraction with co-workers and patients is an integral part of health care professions.Stu dents planning a career in this area needexcellent social and communication skills andleadership experience. Patients must have con-fidence in the competence and judgment ofmedical professionals and know that recom-mendations and decisions are being made forthe patient's benefit. Experiences that broadenunderstanding of the human condition and/orincrease sensitivity towards the medicallyunderserved will increase an applicant'schances for admission to medical school orother health professional programs. As interest, time, and units permit, students should take more than the minimum requiredcourses in English, humanities, arts, and socialsciences. Volunteer work in health care facilitiesand community service agencies provides valu-able experience and helps students clarifycareer interests and goals. EDUC 100 (2 units)can be taken for tutoring in the public schools,and coordinators in Career Services (VeitchStudent Center) arrange for internships in localclinics, hospitals, laboratories, and communitycenters. Foreign Language, Study Abroad There is much ethnic diversity in California and the United States, so proficiency in a foreign language(e.g., Spanish) is highly desirable for healthcare workers. Participation in the EducationAbroad Program (EAP) is encouraged (see theEAP section of this catalog). Students interest-ed in the language, literature, science, art, cul-ture, history, government, or social institutionsof the EAP countries have the opportunity tolearn from first-hand experiences. Opportunitiesare available at each level, but the traditionalyear abroad is generally taken in the junior year.Short-term (one quarter or less) options areavailable in sel ected countries in numerous academic fields. Search for programs by specificareas at eap.ucop.edu/programwizard . Minor, Second Major Students succeeding in their primary major may wish to add a minor orsecond major to the academic program. Morethan 40 minors are of fered in the College ofBiological Sciences / 113 Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, seven in the College of Natural and AgriculturalSciences, and one (Computer Science) in theCollege of Engin eering. Add itional lower- orupper-division course work, a minor or secondmajor in a field distinct from the primary majoradds breadth and individuality to the academicprogram and shows that the student has interestand proficiency beyond the field of the major.Infor ma tion about minors and second majors isprovided in other sections of this catalog. Expected Level of Computer Proficiency Rapid changes and improvements in the health sci- ence field are occurring as a result of newtechnology and discoveries. Computers andcomplex instrumentation are routinely used inclinics and laboratories, so it is necessary tohave computer skills and experience with labequipment as provided in laboratory or fieldscience courses. Undergraduates planning acareer in medicine or other areas of sciencemust have a knowledge of computer operatingsystems, word processing, spreadsheets, data-bases, E-mail, and the Internet. For those who have not reached this level of proficiency,CS 008 (Introduction to Computing, 4 units) isavailable as an elective. Genomics and Bioinformatics These new research fields, along with clinical applications of proteomics, are having an increasing impacton all aspects of medical practice, includingdiagnosis, treatment and delivery of services.Information derived from these fields is includ-ed in the Life Sciences core and upper-divisionscience courses, and students may wish toinclude more than the minimum requirementas part of their undergraduate and postgradu-ate studies. Independent Study and Research Indep endent study is encouraged for future wor kers in medi- cine and other science research areas, and thevarious departments and programs on campusoffer courses (numbered 194, 197, 199, 199H)in which students can enroll to do independentlaboratory and/or field research or an in-depthlibrary study of a topic of special interest.Students desiring to do such independent workshould consult with a professor who is willing tosuper vise the project. Admission Requirements for Med ical and Health Professional Schools Most of the course work required for admission to professional schoolsis met by 1) the UCR requirements in Englishcomposition, humanities, arts, and social sci-ence and 2)the core curriculum for the variouslife science majors and tracks. Professionalschools commonly require biochemistry, 100A), some computer proficiency (e.g.,CS 008), and one year of each of the following(with lab): introductory biology, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry and physics. Most schools require one or two years of col- lege-level biology or zoology classes withoutspecifying certain courses. Some schools, how-ever, do require or highly recommend specificcourses. Because of the amount and complexi-ty of information in medical science, under-graduate students are urged to acquire strongpreparation in major areas (e.g., biochemistry,genetics, microbiology, vertebrate anatomy andphysiology, cell and molecular biology) so thatthey will not be overwhelmed with new informa-tion in professional school. Information about required course work and admission tests (DAT, MCAT, VCAT, PCAT,GRE), can be obtained from Career Services(Veitch Student Center) and the Medical andHealth Careers Program (visit 1114 Pierce Hallor mhcp.ucr.edu ). Students must attend one orientation meeting prior to making an individ-ual appointment at the Medical and HealthCareers Program office. Several meetings areavailable each quarter (the schedule is avail-able on the Web site or from 1114 Pierce Hallor 1223 Pierce Hall). Joint UCR/UCLA Medical School Each year, 24 students at UCR are selected for admission to the UCR/UCLA medical school (Thomas HaiderProgram in Biomedical Sci ences). For theclasses starting medical school Fall 2006 andlater, eligible students in Med ical Biology andother tracks and majors at UCR can completethe admission requirements and apply for the24 positions reserved for UCR students. Thefirst two years of medical school are taken atUCR, while the next two (clinical) years arecompleted at medical facilities at or associatedwith UCLA (Geffen School of Medicine). Infor -mation about course work and other admissionrequirements for the UCR/UCLA medical pro-gram are provided at www.biomed.ucr.edu , under Biomed ical Sciences in this catalog, atthe Student Affairs Office for the program(B600 Statistics-Com puter) and in orientationmeetings held at UCR. Other o icine, Pharmacy, Dent istry, Optom etry, Po diatry A national organization for each medical profession publishes admission requirements,enrollment data and the curriculum for eachschool in that profession. The Medical School Admission Requirements book is usually available in the UCR Book store. Publica tionsthat outline requirements for other professionalschools may be ordered from the bookstore,and they are available in Career Services(Veitch Student Center). The most commonly required or recommended courses for professional schools in the aboveareas are biochemistry, genetics, cell andmolecular biology, embryology or development,and (for pharmacy, optometry) human anatomyand physiology. Most professional schoolsrequire that physics, chemistry and other science courses be taken with laboratory if possible. Some dental and optometry schoolsrequire one or two courses in psychology (e.g.,PSYC 001, PSYC 002). Some dental schoolsrequire principles of management (e.g., BUS010). Helpful electives for dental schoolinclude economics, social science, nutrition,and basic accounting. Some medical schools recommend physical chemistry (e.g., CHEM 109) and one year ofcollege-level mathematics (e.g., MATH 005,MATH008B or MATH 009A, and MATH009Bor the MATH009A, MATH 009B, MATH 009Csequence). Medical schools usually do notoffer substantive instruction in parasitology, so students can gain lecture and laboratorystrength in this area by including BIOL 157 in the undergraduate program. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), Dental Admissions Test (DAT), and tests forother health professions are commonly taken inthe spring or summer of the junior year, sochemistry, physics, mathematics and some up -per-division courses (e.g., biochemistry, genet-ics, cell and molecular biology, vertebrateanatomy and physiology) should be completedas much as possible before the exam is taken.The medical schools strongly urge applicants tocomplete the MCAT by April of the year inwhich they are applying so that evaluation ofthe application will not be delayed. Veterinary Medicine The UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine requires a course in statistics (e.g., STAT100A), genetics (e.g.,BIOL102), physiology (e.g., BIOL 171 andBIOL171L) and 168, of Health Sci ences (Pomona, CA)requires the following for ad mission to and macroeconomics (e.g., ECON 002). Physical Therapy, Physician's Assistant, Health, Nu tri tion, Nursing, Occupa tional Ther apy,Dental Hygiene In most of the schools that have specializations in these areas, the clinical/professional training is at the graduate level.Preparatory course work and a baccalaureatedegree can be obtained at UCR, with applicationto the desired graduate program. Each profes-sional school may have specific requirementsthat must be met in the undergraduate years, in addition to the courses required for all UCRbiology students (e.g., English composition,humanities and social sciences, science andmathematics core curriculum). In their secondor third year at UCR, students interested in theabove professional schools and careers shouldattend one of the orientation meetings held bythe Medical and Health Careers ProgramAdvisor. Prac tical volunteer or paid work experi-ence is required or helpful for admission tothese programs, especially physical therapy and physician's assistant. Visit the internship coordi- nator (Career Services, Veitch Student Center)to arrange volunteer work at local institutions. For some of the above specializations, clinical training is provided as part of an undergraduate114 / Programs and Courses curriculum. For a certificate or baccalaureate degree in nursing, nutrition, dental hygiene, orphysician's assistant, students are well-advisedto enroll initially in a school with the specificundergraduate program they want. Students cantake some of the preparatory course work (e.g.,English composition, introductory biology, chem-istry) at UCR for such programs and then trans-fer, but this may increase the overall time to getthe certificate or degree. Students wishing toobtain their degree at UCR before transferringshould select additional upper-division coursework in biology and related fields appropriate for the desired professional school and careerobjective. Laboratory Technology Students who plan to apply to a laboratory technology school must obtain a Clinical Laboratory Scientist Traineelicense, which certifies that they have complet-ed the required courses for admission to atraining program. In addition to the coursesrequired in the core curriculum, the followingcourses are re quired by the California StateDepartment of Health for a trainee license inClinical Lab or CHEM 005Hematology Students should inquire at the CNAS Academic Advising Center (1223 Pierce Hall) concerninghematology, since a separate course is not avail-able at UCR. For admission to training laboratories ap proved by the American Medical Association, studentsmust have one year of organic chemistry. Thisis completed as part of the core curriculum forthe life science majors and tracks. Statistics(e.g., STAT 100A, STAT 100B) and parasitology(BIOL 157) are strongly recommended.Preparation is further strengthened with courses in cell and molecular biology (e.g., BIOL 107A, CBNS 101). The Medical and Health Careers Program Advisor and Career Ser vices staff can provideinformation about laboratory technology schools.For current information regarding requirementsfor clinical training and applications for theClinical Laboratory Scientist Trainee License(required for admission to any laboratory technology program), students should call (510) 873-6327, or write State of CaliforniaDepartment of Health, Laboratory Field Services,2151 Berkeley Way, Annex 12, Berkeley, CA94704.Education and Research Cen ters, Institutes, and Resources Undergraduate students benefit greatly from the rich variety of centers, institutes, naturalreserves and other research facilities that arepart of UCR. Each center or institute hasresearch and teaching focused on a specificarea of science or engineering or a specificaspect of culture, behavior, or society. Facultyassociated with these resources provide cours-es, field trips and opportunities for undergradu-ate research and part-time employment.Research opportunities for undergraduate stu-dents can be explored at cnas-ugresearch.ucr.edu .

Walton, Ph.D (Entomology) Major The Department of Biology offers B.A. and B.S. degrees in Biology. Both programs are based onthe conviction that broad undergraduate trainingin biology, mathematics and the physical sci-ences, together with study in the humanities andsocial sciences, are fundamental to the educa-tion of a biologist. In addition to English compo-sition, humanities, social sciences and the LifeSciences core curriculum (see below, MajorRequirements), both degrees require 36 units ofupper-division (numbered 100-199) biologycourses. The degrees differ in the humanitiesand social sciences requirements; also 16 unitsof a foreign language are required for the B.A.,whereas the B.S. requires 16 additional units insubstantive courses in biology or related fields. The research and teaching of the Department of Biology includes different levels (e.g., molecules,cells, organisms, populations, communities) andprocesses (e.g., development, evolution) of bio-logical organization. An overview is presented inthe introductory courses (BIOL005A, BIOL05LA, BIOL 005B, and BIOL005C), andemphasis is placed on the unifying principles ofthe discipline. Because of the diversity within biology and the wide range of career options, much latitude isallowed in selecting upper-division biology courses for the 36 units required for the major.Each student can select courses and plan a program of study to meet her/his specific interests and career goals. For assistance withthis, faculty advisors are available in the CNASAcademic Advising Center (1223 Pierce Hall,(951) 827-7294). The section below, Programsof Specialization, is provided as a guide forcourse selection for graduate schools, medicaland health science professional schools and thebroad range of careers that are possible with theBiology major. The 36 upper-division units are selected from a list which includes courses offered by theDepartment of Biology (BIOL 100-199) and a limited number of courses in Biochemistry(BCH), and Cell Biology and Neuroscience(CBNS). Qualified undergraduates (GPA 3.0 orabove) may participate in graduate-level biologyseminar courses with consent of the instructor,and up to 4 units (with letter grade) may beincluded in the major. Those who choose to obtain a B.S. degree have as a college requirement an additional 16 unitsin upper-division biology courses and/or sub-stantive courses in a field or fields related to themajor. The purpose of this related area is to addstrength and breadth to the major and to meetspecific requirements for postgraduate study ora chosen career. The substantive courses infields related to the major may be lower orupper division, but they usually have science ormathematics prerequisites (e.g., CBNS120/PSYC 120, CHEM 005, STAT100A, STAT100B, MATH 009C). UCR/UCLA Thom as Haider Program in Biomedical Sciences Students in this major and all others at UCR are eligible to com pleteadmission requirements and apply for the 24 positions reserved for UCR students in thejoint UCR/UCLA Thom as Haider Prog ram inBiomedical Sciences. The first two years ofmedical school are taken at UCR, while thenext two (clinical) years are completed at medical facilities at or associated with UCLA(Geffen School of Med icine). Infor mation is provided at www.biomed.ucr.edu , in the program's section of this catalog, in the Student AffairsOffice for the program (B600 Stat-Comp, (951) 827-4334), and at orientation meetings held at UCR. University Requirements See Undergraduate Studies section. College Requirements See College of Natural and AgriculturalSciences, Colleges and Programs section. Major Requirements Some of the following requirements for themajor in Biology may also fulfill the College'sbreadth requirements. Consult with a department advisor for course planning. 1. Life Sciences core or BCH110A The core curriculum must be completed with a grade point average of 2.0 or betterand no grade lower than \"C-.\" If a grade ofD or F is received in two core curriculumcourses, either in separate courses or repeti-tions of the same course, the student willnot be permitted to continue in the major. 2. Upper-division requirements (36 units) a)BIOL 102 b)Thirty-two (32) additional Biology units to be taken in consultation with a faculty advisor 3. Other requirements For the Bachelor of Arts only (0-16units): The foreign language requirement may be fulfilled by completing level four or thedemonstration of equivalent pro ficiency inone foreign language. For the Bachelor of Science only (16units): An additional 16 units in upper-division biology courses and/or substantive cours es in a field or fields related to the major. A listof acceptable courses is available in theCNAS Academic Advising Center. Programs of Specialization The Life Sciences core curriculum (item 1 above) fulfills many of the requirements foradmission to graduate schools in biology orprofessional schools in the medical and healthscience fields. In addition to IntroductoryGenetics (BIOL 102, 4 units), a wide choice isavailable for the remaining 32 upper-divisionunits required for the Biology major (item 2.b)above) and the 16 additional units related tothe field of the major (B.S. degree, item 3above). Each student selects upper-divisionand related courses depending on the type of school and career chosen (e.g., education,medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, nursing, physical therapy,public health, graduate school in one of thefields below). In planning an academic program to prepare for teaching or one of the medical fields, pres-ent and prospective Biology majors are referredto relevant topics in the Biological Sciencessection of this catalog. That section has infor-mation for those planning to attend graduateschool in education to obtain a teaching cre-dential (subsection, Teaching Credential)and/or a master's or Ph.D. degree in education(subsection, Preparation for Graduate School).Also included are guidelines to help studentsselect courses to prepare for admission to professional schools in the medical field (subsections, Medical Biol ogy, Suggestions forElective Units for Medical/Health Professions,Admission Requirements for Medical andHealth Professional Schools). Additional information about required course work andadmission tests (MCAT, OAT, VCAT, PCAT, GRE)can be obtained from Career Services (VeitchStudent Center) and the Medical and HealthCareers Program (visit 1114 Pierce Hall ormhcp.ucr.edu ). Suggested courses of study are provided belowfor those interested in various biological fields.These programs meet most of the requirementsfor admission to corresponding graduateschools for those students who wish to pursuea master's and/or Ph.D. degree. The facultyadvisor assists in selecting combinations ofcourses appropriate for advanced study in thefields below and others. Students consideringgraduate study are encouraged to do under-graduate research and take courses in computerscience and statistics. The Biological Sciences section of this catalog (subsection, Preparation for Graduate School)has additional information for those planninggraduate study in a life science field. In somecases, a course of study differing substantiallyfrom the examples given below will best meetthe needs of the student. In consultation with a faculty advisor, a student may prepare a 116 / Programs and Courses program in some other biological specialization such as animal behavior, evolution/developmentor developmental biology. Cell and Molecular Biology 116,CBNS169. Students are also couraged to take laboratory courses (e.g., BCH Initiative (CaTEACH-SMI) has agoal of addressing the critical need of highlyqualified K-12 science and mathematics teach-ers in California. With an economy increasinglyreliant on science, technology, engineering, andmathematics (STEM) and the anticipated largescale retirement of qualified teachers, this is anessential time to explore and prepare for acareer in teaching science or mathematics. CaTEACH-SMI at UCR offers undergraduatestudents paid/unpaid opportunities to exploreSTEM teaching as a career option. ThroughCaTEACH-SMI, students receive advising andmentoring to prepare for entrance into anintern teaching credential program while dili-gently coordinating with academic advisors toensure completion of STEM degree require-ments.

Applicants for BIOL 194 and BIOL 199 should ordinarily be juniors or seniors with a GPA of3.00 or higher. Sophomore students with a GPAof 3.00 or higher may apply to enroll in BIOL 197(Introduction to Research), since the purpose of this course is to enable the student to do preliminary reading and laboratory researchto explore with the professor the feasibility ofundertaking a project for later en rollment inBIOL 199. Enrollment in BIOL197 is not requiredbefore enrollment in BIOL199, but the formercourse is available for those situations wherepreliminary work will be helpful. For BIOL 194 and BIOL 199, the student writes a report of the library study or laboratory re sultsfor the quarter, which is reviewed by the spon-soring professor and submitted to the CNASAcademic Advising Centerby the last day ofinstruction of the quarter. BIOL 194, BIOL 197, and BIOL 199 are graded \"S/NC\", and up to 9 units of credit may becounted as part of the 16 substantive unitsrelated to the major for the B.S. degree. Natural Reserve System This system was formed by the UC in 1965 to preserve for study a ser ies of undisturbednatural areas representing the state's vast ecological diversity. Since then the system hasgrown to include twenty-seven reserves, eightof them administered by the UCR campus. See Research Opportunities in this catalog. Most of the reserves are undeveloped except for fencing, roads and trails, but laboratory facilities,housing and campgrounds for class use areavailable at some sites. The reserves are used as outdoor classrooms and laboratories bystudents, teachers and researchers fromeducational institutions, public and private,throughout the state, across the nation andaround the world. Some of the coursesoffered by the UCR Department of Biologyinclude field trips and overnight campingtrips to the reserves. In the field, studentsare introduced to the great diversity of plantand animal organisms in Southern California,and to the effect of environmental factors onthis diversity. Undergraduate and graduate students who wish to use the reserves in their individualresearch projects should contact Dr.John T.Roten berry, Department of Biology, 3372 SpiethHall, (951) 827-3953, to obtain an application,map and list of rules and regulations.Biology / 117 Graduate Program The Department of Biology administers pro- grams leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees inEvolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology,with specializations in Evolutionary Biology,Ecology, and Physiology and Biophysics.

UCR provides a unique path of entrance to one of the country's leading medical schools.Undergraduate students at UCR have exclusiveaccess to 24 seats in medical school each yearthrough the university's joint program with theDavid Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.UCR students admitted to the program com-plete years 1 and 2 of their medical educationat UCR. They follow a state-of-the-art disease-based integrated curriculum taught by basic-science research faculty who work closely witha special cadre of highly qualified, community-based, physician faculty. This curriculumfocuses on developing the process of life-longlearning, employs problem-based learning, andrequires extensive computer use. Years 3 and4 of medical school are completed at UCLA,after which students receive their M.D. degreesfrom UCLA. Only undergraduates who entered UCR as freshmen or as transfer students may apply to the UCR/UCLA Program. Students must beenrolled at UCR for at least two years (six con-tinuous full-time quarters) in the pursuit of abachelor's degree before entering the program.Only under truly exceptional circumstances willthe program matriculate a student without aUCR baccalaureate degree. Applicants apply through the American Med ical College Application Service, at www.amcas.org , following its guidelines and deadlines. Studentsmay submit their applications at any time duringthe application period, as early as June (14 months before medical school classes beginin August at UCR) or as late as November 1 (9 months before classes begin). Applications without recent MCAT scores are consideredincomplete. Review the application guidelines at www.biomed.ucr.edu and the application process at www.amcas.org . Unique aspects of the program include the following: The 24 annual seats in the program are open to UCR undergraduate students and alumni only. Students from any major may apply for one of the 24 seats as long as they will havecom pleted the prerequisite course work andfulfilled other application re quirementsbefore entering the program. Students accepted into the UCR/UCLA Pro gram complete their first two years ofmedical school on the UCR campus andthen move to UCLA to complete their medical education and graduate with anM.D. from UCLA. Prerequisite Courses Students preparing to apply to the UCR/UCLA Prog ram should excelin their undergraduate academic program and complete specific course work before admis- sion to the UCR/UCLA Program. Students whoplan to transfer to UCR from another college oruniversity for their undergraduate studies andthen apply to the UCR/UCLA Program shouldcomplete, where possible, courses that havebeen designated as being equivalent to UCRcourses. Transfer students from communitycolleges are encouraged to view the UCR/UCLAProgram as an attractive and viable avenue tomedical school. The UCR/UCLA Program prerequisite course curriculum is identical to the admissionsrequirements of the David Geffen School ofMedicine at UCLA. Shown as UCR coursework, it is as follows: English \u2014 one year of college English to include the study of English composition (ENGL 001A, ENGL 001B, ENGL 001C orequivalent) Physics (PHYS 002A, PHYS02LA,PHYS002B, PHYS 02LB, PHYS 002C,PHYS02LC or equivalent) Chemistry \u2014 two years of college chemistry to include the study of inorganic chemistry andorganic chemistry with laboratory (CHEM001A, CHEM112C or equivalent) Biology lab- oratory (BIOL 005A, BIOL 05LA, BIOL005B,BIOL 005C or \u2014 one year of college math - ematics to include introductory calculus andstatistics (MATH 009A, MATH009B,STAT100A or equivalent) A one-quarter course in biochemistry to coverstructure, function, and metabolism of biologicalmolecules (BCH 100 or BCH 110A, BCH110Bor equivalent), while not required for admission,is highly recommended. Courses in Spanishlanguage and the humanities are also highlyrecommended. AP results are not accepted as substitutes for the required science courses. Related Literature and References UCR current- ly has articulation agreements with most of theCalifornia community colleges. These agree - ments list specific community college coursesthat have been designated as com para ble toUCR courses. See the statewide articulationWeb site, at www.assist.org , or California community college Web sites. Academic Advising UCR undergraduates receive academic advising from professional staff and faculty of the department or programof their chosen major. AdmissionStudents from any UCR major are eligible to apply for one of the 24 seats in the medical school each year. The admissionrequirements for the UCR/UCLA Prog ram are identical to those for UCLA's Geffen School of Medicine, but UCR students have a distinctadvantage when applying to the UCR/UCLAProgram. They compete only with other UCRstudents for those 24 seats in the program andthe opportunity to earn an M.D. degree fromUCLA's Geffen School of Medicine. Admission considerations A strong candi date for admission to the UCR/UCLA Program has: Completed the UCR/UCLA Program prerequisite course curriculum An excellent undergraduate academic record An excellent score on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) The strong candidate also shows a commitment to a career in medicine as demonstrated byvolunteerism in medicine, clinical experience,or research. A solid record of community service is highly desired. It is important that applicants havemade a difference to those around them. Ex -amples of community service pursuits includevolunteer work, leadership in campus organiza-tions, mentor service for a peer or youth group,and commitment to and participation in reli-gious or service organizations. Letters of Reference Applicants must submit letters from individuals such as professors and those who can speak about the applicant'seducational talents, character, work ethic, mo -tivation, special traits, and positive influence onothers. Admission Interview Qualified applicants will be invited to interview and have the op por tunity to talk about themselves, their special qualities,and demonstrate their ability to interact withothers. A Four-Year Medical Program Years 1 and 2 Students admitted to the UCR/UCLA Program are jointly enrolled at UCRand UCLA's Geffen School of Medicine andtake their first two years of medical school atUCR. Unlike other medical schools where stu-dents are taught in classes of 100 or more, theclas ses in the UCR/UCLA Program are smalland comprised of 24 students during each ofthe first two years. This allows students to getto know their professors and receive the indi-vidual help and guidance they need to suc-124 / Programs and Courses ceed. Clas ses in years 1 and 2 are taught by the UCR/UCLA Program faculty who are at theforefront of teaching and research and by com-munity-based physician faculty with real-worldunderstanding of medicine. Years 3 and 4 Students move to UCLA's Gef fen School of Medicine for the third and fourth years, where they participate in re quired and electiveclinical rotations. UCLA Medical Center and thenetwork of affiliated hospitals provide diverse set-tings for students to receive exemplary clinicalexperiences and utilize cutting-edge technology.In the fourth year, most graduating students arematched with one of their three top choices for aresidency program. Students also have the opportunity to spend up to 12 weeks away at other universities to ex -plore a particular area of interest. Extern shipsin foreign countries exist as well.

The aim of the graduate program is to provide students with training that crosses traditionalboundaries between scientific disciplines andallows them to address modern biomedicalresearch questions. The objective is to trainscientists who have a broad knowledge of basicmedical sciences, a high degree of ex pertise inan area of specialization, and effective teachingskills for a medical school or university environ-ment. The need for scientists who understand the interrelationships of various areas of medicalscience is readily apparent. For example, it isclearly advantageous for a scientist studyingdiabetes to understand the disease in depth.This requires a fundamental understanding ofendocrinology (hormone secretion and action),cell biology (cell types that produce insulin andupon which insulin acts), biochemistry (insulin-receptor interactions, biochemical pathwaysregulated by insulin), genetics (hereditary fac-tors in the development of diabetes), immunol-ogy (autoimmune mechanisms in diabetes),Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program / Botany and Plant Sciences / 127 and anatomy (microvascular pathology). There is a growing need for scientists who can com-municate among disciplines so that very effec-tive research collaborations can be developed. Cell Biology/Physiology research areas include function of transcription factors in develop- ment, disease, and in the promotion of regen-eration; fluid and electrolyte pathophysiology incystic fibrosis; molecular genetics of humancell response to environmental carcinogens;tumor suppressor genes in malignant mela -noma; molecular basis of Down syndrome; ininfectious disease; and mucosal immunity andmolecular approaches to vaccine development. Endocrinology/Pharmacology research areas include regulation and actions of the vitamin D endocrine system; mechanism of action of in sulinand insulin-like growth as agrowth factor in health hormon aland electric field regulation of bone developmentand growth; and molecular mechanisms for car-cinogenesis (glioblastoma, breast and prostatecancer). Neurosciences research areas include studies of the hypothalamic control of homeostatic and sexual function; molecular mechanisms of neu-rodevelopment, neuronal death and neurode-generation with emphasis on the AdmissionApplicants should have completed an undergraduate degree in one of the physical or biological sciences and must submit scores fromthe GRE General Test (verbal and quantitative).(GRE requirement not applicable to UCRBiomedical Sciences students applying for theM.D.-Ph.D.) Courses required for admissioninclude one year each of general chemistry,organic chemistry, physics, and calculus and atleast two years of biological sciences. Preferredupper-division courses in biology include verte-brate or human anatomy and physiology, embry-ology, genetics, cell biology, microbiology,immunology, and neurosciences. Doctoral Degree The aim of the graduate program in Biomed icalSciences is to train Ph.D. scientists in a specif-ic area of research specialization who also haveenough general knowledge in the basic medicalsciences to apply their research expertise tounraveling the basis of disease. This approachincludes understanding not only pathogenicmanifestations of disease but also the normalphysiologic state. To accomplish this, the stu-dent completes a core and elective curriculum,the latter tailored to the student's researchinterests. Core requirements include: 1. BMSC 229: Foundations Research 2. BMSC 232, 233, 234 and 235: BMSC 260A, BMSC 260B, BMSC 260C: Topics in Biomedical Research. The entire 3 quarter series is required in the first year ofgraduate education. 4. BMSC 261: Methods in Biomedical Research. Enrollment required all 3 quartersof the first year of graduate education. 5. BMSC 252: General seminar in Biomedical Sciences (enrollment required each quarter) 6. BMSC 254: Graduate seminar in Biomedical Sciences (enrollment required each quarter) 7. BMSC 302: (one-quarter requirement, not required of M.D.-Ph.D. students) Under normal circumstances, each studentshould complete course work requirementsduring the first year of studies. At the end of the student's first full year of resi- dence, the advisory committee for each studentevaluates the progress of the student and rec-ommends to the faculty whether the studentshould continue in the program. In addition, prior to advancement to candidacy and at the beginning of each academic year,the student presents a written summary of theresearch progress and plans to the advisorycommittee. Continuation in the programdepends on the advisory committee's positiveevaluation of the student's research prog ress. Written and Oral Qualifying Examina tions Prior to advance ment to candidacy, students must com- plete both parts of a qualifying examination. PartI consists of the preparation of a research pro-posal, to be written in the form of a grant propos-al, including literature review, description ofmethods and experimental plans for the disserta-tion. This proposal should outline the researchprogress of the student to date and delineate theplanned dissertation research aims and objec-tives. Part I is usually completed in the springquarter of year 2 and no later than the fall quar-ter of year 3 of a student's graduate training. PartII consists of an oral comprehensive examinationadministered by a committee of five facultymembers, at least one of whom is from outsidethe program. The student's research advisor doesnot serve on the oral qualifying committee. Theoral comprehensive examination includes exami-nation of the student's knowledge and under-standing of material covered in the core coursesand in the student's area of specialization. Part IImust be completed no later than the end of year3 of the student's graduate training. Research Project, Dissertation and Final Oral Examination After successful completion of the qualifying exam and advancement to candida-cy, the student completes the research project,submits a written dissertation, and defends thedissertation in a final oral examination. Normative Time to Degree 15 quartersM.D.-Ph.D. Combined Degree AdmissionThe combined degree is offered to students admitted to the medical school phase of the Biomedical Sciences Program and toexceptional students from other four-year LCME-accredited medical schools. Normally, a studentcompletes the first two years of medical school,and then spends approximately three years inthe Ph.D. part of the program before completingthe M.D. degree. However, the track is alsooffered to students who have completed theM.D. degree. UCR Biomedical Sciences stu-dents may apply for admission concurrently withtheir applications to the medical school phase orany time after acceptance to the medical phase.For these students only, the MCAT is acceptedin lieu of the GRE. Students from other medical schools should apply in the fall of their sophomore or senior year.Applications from sophomores must be accom-panied by official permission for an appropriateleave of absence. The GRE requirement is thesame as for regular Ph.D. students. Master's Degree The Biomedical Sciences Graduate Group offersan M.S. degree. No students are admitteddirectly into the program for work toward themaster's degree. However, a Plan I (Thesis) orPlan II (Compre hensive Ex amin a tion) M.S.degree is available in special circumstanceswhen work leading to the Ph.D. degree cannotbe completed. The student's advisory committeedecides whether the master's degree is anappropriate alternative to the Ph.D. degree. Thisdecision may be made at the end of the stu-dent's first year of residence or at other times inthe student's career, particularly at the time ofthe qualifying examination.

Fields of specializa-tion include biochemical engineering and bio-engineering, envir on mental biotechnology, airquality systems engineering, water quality sys-tems engineering, thermodynamics, advancedmaterials, and nanotechnology. Combined B.S. + M.S. Five-Year Program The college offers combined B.S.+ M.S. programs in both Chemical Engineering and EnvironmentalEngineering designed to lead to a Bachelor ofScience degree as well as a Master of Sciencedegree in five years. Applicants for this programmust have a high school GPA above 3.6, a com-bined SAT Reasoning score above 1950 (or ACTplus Writing equivalent), complete the EntryLevel Writing Requirement before matriculation,Chemical and Environmental Engineering / 143 and have sufficient mathematics preparation to enroll in calculus in their first quarter as fresh-men. Interested students who are entering their junior year should check with their academic advisorfor information on eligibility and other details. AdmissionApplicants should have a degree in chemical and environmental engineering or closely related fields, have a satis factory overallGPA from their undergraduate studies, goodletters of recommendation, and high scores onthe GRE General Test. Nor mally, studentsadmitted to regular standing have satisfied allprerequisite course work. Under special cir-cumstances, students who have not completedall undergraduate requirements may be admit-ted provided that the deficiencies are correctedto the satisfaction of the student's advisorycommittee within the first year of graduatestudy. Courses taken for this purpose do notcount towards an advanced degree. Interna -tional students, permanent residents, and evenU.S. citizens whose native language is notEnglish and who do not have a bachelor's orpostgraduate degree from an institution whereEnglish is the exclusive language of instructionmust complete the Test of English as a ForeignLanguage (TOEFL) with a minimum score of550 (paper-based test), 213 (computer-based),or 80 (internet-based). Language Requirement All students whose native language is not English must achieve a \"clear pass\" on the TAST or SPEAK test before thecompletion of their first year or they will beasked to leave the program. How ever, for thosewho receive a \"conditional pass,\" a departmen-tal committee will evaluate their English profi-ciency before a final decision is made. Course Work To ensure that advanced degree recipients in the graduate program have advanced knowledge in mathematics andchemical engineering principles that form thefoundation for chemical and environmentalengineering, a core course program has beenimplemented. All M.S. and Ph.D. studentsmust participate in the core course program.Students who have completed these (or equiv-alent) courses elsewhere may petition to havethe core course requirement waived or some oftheir units transferred (see the Grad uateDivision policy for transferring course units).Competency in these areas will be tested aspart of the comprehensive exam for M.S. stu-dents and in the written preliminary examina-tion for Ph.D. students. The current core cours-es are as follows: CEE 200 (Advanced Engineering Computa - tions) CEE 202 (Transport Phenomena) CEE 204 (Advanced Kinetics and Reaction Engineering) CEE 206 (Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics) Incoming students without a B.S. degree inchemical or environmental engineering must demonstrate competency in these areas eitherby taking the appropriate undergraduate coursesand/or by passing the written preliminary exam.At UCR, the required courses are CHE100,CHE 110A, CHE 110B, ENVE 171, CHE 114,CHE 116, CHE 120, CHE 130, and ENGR118.Students may also be required to take some ofthe above courses to satisfy the prerequisites ofthe core graduate courses. Each quarter, all M.S. and Ph.D. students in res- idence must enroll in CEE 286 (Colloquium inChemical and Environmental Engineering). Inaddition, all M.S. and Ph.D. students must par-ticipate each year in the CEE Graduate StudentSymposium, usually held just before the begin-ning of the fall quarter. Master's Degree The Department of Chemical and Environ -mental Engineering offers the M.S. degree inChemical and Environmental Engineering. Plan I (Thesis) requires completion of a mini- mum of 36 units of approved course work including the core courses and submission ofan acceptable M.S. thesis. At least 24 of theseunits must be in regular lecture graduatecourses (200 series courses). No more than 4units of CEE290 or CEE 297 combined and 6units of CEE 286 or special topics courses(CEE 250 or CEE 260 series) may applytowards the 36 units. Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) requires completion of a minimum of 36 units of approved course work including the corecourses and successful passage of a compre-hensive examination. At least 28 of these unitsmust be in regular lecture graduate courses(200-series courses), and none may be incourses numbered CEE 286, CEE 290,CEE297, CEE 299, or CEE 302. Typically, the examination is a six-hour written, closed-bookexamination em phasizing fundamental knowl-edge and breadth of the study area rather thanspecifics covered in individual courses. An oralfollow-up session may be requested by theexamination committee following its evaluationof the written exam. No more than twoattempts to pass the exam are allowed. Stu -dents who fail the exam once and then want toswitch to the thesis plan should contact thegraduate advisor. Students who fail the examtwice may not switch to the thesis plan. For the M.S. degree, students must complete a minimum of three quarters in residence in the UC with a GPA of 3.00 or better in all 100- and200-level course work related to the degree. Thesis Committee The committee consists of three members. The student and advisor nomi- nate the committee before the end of the firstyear with the concurrence of the graduatecommittee. After review of the nominations, thedean of the Graduate Division appoints thecommittee on behalf of the Graduate Council.The committee, once approved by the graduatedean, rather than the department, becomesresponsible for the student's academic guid-ance and evaluation. The chairman of the com-mittee is the director of the candidate'sresearch and is normally a faculty member ofthe CEE department or a cooperating facultymember. A member may be appointed who isa researcher on campus, from off-campus, or avisiting lecturer within the department; howev-er, a memo indicating the academic degreeand affiliation of the nominated member, aswell as a curriculum vitae, must accompanysuch a request. (Memos need not accompanythe nomination of an adjunct faculty member.)After the committee is formed, the committeemust approve the subject of the thesis. A jointmeeting of the committee members and thestudent should be held before work on the the-sis is begun to ensure the topic is clear andacceptable to all. Once the thesis is completed,all three members of the committee mustapprove the thesis and sign the title page. Stu -dents must give a departmental seminar pres-entation of their thesis work to the departmentand members of the academic communitybefore completing the thesis. Normative Time to Degree 6 quarters Doctoral Degree The Department of Chemical and Environ - mental Engin eering offers the Ph.D. degree inChemical and Environmental Engineering.Satisfying the requirements for the degree con-sists of four parts: 1. Successful completion of an approved program of course work 2. Passing a written preliminary examination3. Approval of a dissertation proposal4. Defense and approval of the dissertationCourse Work Upon choosing a faculty advisor, each Ph.D. student is appointed a Ph.D. advi- sory committee consisting of two CEE facultymembers and the faculty advisor. This advisorycommittee is responsible for guiding the stu-dents in formulating their research activitiesand preparing for the preliminary and qualify-ing exams. The program of course work is formulated by each student and a faculty advisor in the first orsecond quarter after admission to the programand must be approved by the student's advisorand advisory committee. Every student mustcomplete a program of study that includes: 1. A major area of study intended to increase the student's depth of knowledge in an engi- neering research specialty and 2. A minor area of study intended to support and increase the student's breadth of knowl-edge in the major area The CEE graduate program requires a coherentprogram of 1. Sixteen (16) units of core courses and2. Eight (8) units of graduate and/or upper-div - ision work approved by the advisory committee144 / Programs and Courses None of these credits may be in courses num- bered between CEE 250 and CEE 270, CEE286,CEE290, CEE 297, CEE 299, or CEE302. Preliminary Examination The preliminary exami- nation tests students' understanding of the fun- damental principles of chemical and environ-mental engineering at the undergraduate level.This comprehensive examination consists ofthree written tests in three different areasselected from the following five subjects: 1. Thermodynamics 2. Kinetics3. Transport (heat and mass transfer, fluid dynamics) 4. Air pollution control and engineering5. Water quality engineering The three subjects selected should be closely connected to the student's undergraduatetraining and approved by the student's advisorycommittee. Students who fail any portion of theexam are granted a final attempt to pass amakeup written examination that includes anoral defense of their answers in front of a facul-ty committee. Students who fail one or two sub-jects after the retest must enroll in remedialundergraduate courses and pass with a gradeof \"B+\" or better. Credits from these remedialcourses do not count toward the Ph.D. coursework requirement. Students who fail all threesubjects after the retest must leave the Ph.D.program. Teaching Requirement All students must be employed as teaching assistants for at least one quarter. All TAs must take CEE 302(Teaching Practi cum) to help them learn effec-tive teaching methods such as handling discus-sion sections; preparing and handling laborato-ry sections; preparing ina tions, and lab reports; and studentrelations. Oral Qualifying Examination Selection of the Qualifying Committee is as follows: 2 members are selected by the Graduate Committee, 2members are selected by the student, and thestudent's advisor will chair the committee. Allmembers of the qualifying committee areexpected to have the appropriate expertise toguide and evaluate a candidate's research. Nomore than 1 member can be a non-academicsenate member. After review of the nomina-tions, the dean of the Graduate Div ision ap -points the committee on behalf of the Grad uateCouncil. This committee becomes responsiblefor the student's academic guidance and evalu-ation until advancement to candidacy andadministers the qualifying examination. Dissertation Proposal After successful comple- tion of the written preliminary examination, each student, with advise ment from an advisor,prepares a dis sertation proposal. Typically, stu-dents submit a dissertation proposal to theirqualifying committee within one year after suc-cessfully completing the written preliminaryexamination. The proposal should clearlydemonstrate the student's adequate prepara-tion for the completion of the thesis research,which includes but is not limited to a thoroughreview of the pertinent literature, a presentationand discussion of the candidate's ownresearch, and a detailed research plan withsufficient breadth and depth for the completionof the thesis. The qualifying committee chairschedules an oral defense normally within onemonth of the written proposal submission. Thepresentation is given only to the dissertationcommittee members. The oral presentation/defense of the proposal focuses on the dissertation problem. Students should demonstrate considerable depth of knowledge in the student's area of specializa-tion and a clear understanding of the researchmethods that are needed for successful com-pletion of the dissertation research. The oralpresentation/defense begins with a presentationby students on their dissertation topic and isfollowed by questions and suggestions from thequalifying committee. On the basis of the written proposal and oral de fense, the qualifying committee decideswheth er the student should be ad vanced tocandidacy, asked to modify and enhance thepropo sal, or requested to withdraw from theprog ram. Dissertation and Final Oral Examina tion Following advancement to candidacy, students formally focus on their dissertation research. Theprogress of the dissertation is monitored by thestudent's dissertation committee. Candi datesshould interact frequently with members of theirdissertation committee to insure that dissertationprogress is acceptable. The graduate committee nominates and approves the dissertation committee after con-sideration of the suggestions made by the stu-dent and thesis advisor. The dissertation com-mittee consists of a minimum of three UCRAcademic Senate members. The chair andmajority of members must be from Chemicaland Environmental Engineer ing. All committeemembers should be in a position to offer guid-ance and be able to judge the scholarship of thedissertation work. Upon recommendation of thegraduate advisor, doctoral dissertation commit-tees are appointed by the dean of the GraduateDivision. After completing the dissertation research, stu- dents must submit a written copy of the disser-tation for approval for defense by the student'sdissertation committee. Once a draft has beenapproved, an oral defense of the dissertation isscheduled. This defense consists of a seminaropen to the entire academic community, fol-lowed by a question-and-answer period con-ducted by the dissertation committee. Students must complete at least six quarters in residence in the UC with a GPA of 3.00 or bet-ter in all 100- and 200-level course work relat-ed to the degree.

Ziemann, Ph.D. (Environmental Sciences) Major The Department of Chemistry offers a B.S. and B.A. degree in Chemistry and a B.S. in Chem -istry with a Chemical Physics option or anEnvironmental Chemistry option. The B.S. program is certified by the American Chemical Society and is designed for studentsinterested in a professionally oriented majorleading most often to a career or advancedstudy in chemistry. The B.A. program is designed for students who wish to obtain a broad educational backgroundwith less intensive emphasis on chemistry. Inthis program, students have increased ease inmeeting requirements for such areas as pre-medical, ence; education; and administration. Checkwww.careers.ucr.edu . A Chemical Physics option is available for stu- dents who wish to prepare for admission to agraduate program in chemical physics. The Environmental Chemistry option is available for students who wish to become fa miliar with environmental processes and problems relatedto air, water, and soil, and to ap ply their chemi-cal knowledge working in environmental-relatedareas. This option also prepares students foradmission to a graduate program emphasizingenvironmental chemistry. Pre-Health Science Chemistry majors in either the B.S. or B.A. programs can prepare for admission to medical, pharmacy, or dental schools by care-fully planning their programs of study. Studentsplanning to apply for post-graduate studies in thehealth sciences should make it a special point toconsult with their Chemistry advisor early in theirstudies at UCR. Check www.mhcp.ucr.edu .Teaching Credential Teachers in the public schools in California must have a credential approved by the State Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The cre -dential requires an undergraduate major, bac-calaureate degree, and completion of a gradu-ate credential program such as that offered bythe Graduate School of Education at UCR (seeEducation in this catalog and www.education.ucr.edu ). UCR has an approved undergraduate programfor Chemistry majors who plan to get a Mul tipleSubjects Credential and teach in the elemen-tary (K-6) grades. A breadth of course work isnecessary, in addition to the specified require-ments for the major. Students are urged to startearly, preferably as freshmen, selecting coursesmost helpful for this career. Details and coun-seling on the Bridge to Teaching Prog ram, apreparation program for the multiple subjectscredential, are available in the Office ofInterdisciplinary Programs, 2416 Humanitiesand Social Sciences, (951) 827-2743;www.lsnid.ucr.edu . De tails and counseling on other programs are available in the GraduateSchool of Education and www.education.ucr.edu/ programs.html.UCR does not yet have a state-approved under-graduate program for chemistry majors whowish to teach at the secondary level. TheTeach ing Credential in Science, chemistryemphasis, is required for chemistry teachers,grades 7-12. Students who plan to get this cre-dential must take the commission's subject-matter assessment examination and shouldmake certain their academic program includespreparatory course work. The examinationincludes chemistry in depth and general sci-ence with introductory, college-level biology,chemistry, physics, and geoscience (geology,meteorology, oceanography, astronomy).Further information about courses, require-ments, and examinations can be obtained inorientation meetings and the Graduate Schoolof Education (1124 Mathematics Initiative (CaTEACH-SMI) agoal of addressing the critical need of highlyqualified K-12 science and mathematics teach-ers in California. With an economy increasinglyreliant on science, technology, engineering, andmathematics (STEM) and the anticipated largescale retirement of qualified teachers, this is anessential time to explore and prepare for acareer in teaching science or mathematics. CaTEACH-SMI at UCR offers undergraduate students paid/unpaid opportunities to explore STEM teaching as a career option. Through CaTEACH-SMI, students receive advising andmentoring to prepare for entrance into an internteaching credential program while diligently coordinating with academic advisors to ensure completion of STEM degree requirements.

All of the upper-division courses in chemistryhave a prerequisite of CHEM 001A, 1HLB, CHEM01HC and CHEM 1HLC and most haveCHEM005 as a prerequisite. Students with a minor in Chemistry should con- sult with their Chemistry advisor to construct aspecific program consistent with their careergoals. See Minors under the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences in the Colleges andPrograms section of this catalog for additionalinformation on minors.Graduate Program The Chemistry Department offers the M.S. andPh.D. degrees in Chemistry. Fields of specialization (subdisciplines) are analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry,organic chemistry, and physical chemistry.Research is also carried out in bioanalytical,bioinorganic, bioorganic, and biophysicalchemistry and in chemical chemistry,and neuroscience. For additional infor mationon the latter, please see Neuro science Grad -uate Program in the Programs and Coursessection of this catalog. AdmissionAll applicants must submit scores from the GRE General Test. A score from the Advanced Chemistry GRE is not required foradmission. It is strongly recommended, howev-er, that applicants submit this score in order toreceive maximum consideration for fellowships.The department normally considers applica-tions for teaching and research assis tant shipsat the same time as fellowships; therefore, stu-dents are strongly encouraged to completetheir applications for admission and support asearly as possible. Normally applications for fel-lowships are awarded by February for studentsentering in the following fall quarter. Althoughmost students begin in the fall quarter, stu-dents may begin their studies in the winter orspring quarter. Orientation Examinations Admitted students must, at the beginning of their first quarter in residence, take orientation examinations. Theexaminations are normally given during twoconsecutive days starting up to one week priorto the first day of instruction. Although a noticeof the times and places of these examinationsis sent to each student admitted to regulargraduate status in chemistry, it is the student'sresponsibility to be on the campus earlyenough to check the bulletin boards in Phys icalSciences for this information. Students takethese examinations in the four subdisciplines:analytical, inorganic, organic, and physicalchemistry. The purpose of these examinationsis to assess the student's undergraduate prepa-ration. The results permit the faculty to deter-mine the course program that will most effec-tively aid the students' development in theirchosen subdisciplines. Master's Degree The Department of Chemistry offers the M.S.degree in Chemistry. Requirements are: 1. Satisfactory performance in orientation examinations in analytical, inorganic, organ- ic, and physical chemistry 2. General university requirements; and depart- mental requirements for either PlanI or Plan II. Plan I (Thesis) Students must take at least 36 units of approved courses and graduateresearch of which five regular lecture coursesin the CHEM200-249 series (CHEM 110A orCHEM 110B, CHEM 113, 125, andCHEM 150A or CHEM 150B may apply undercertain circumstances). A maximum of 12units of seminar courses (CHEM 250-259) anda maximum of 12 units of graduate research;(but not those numbered CHEM 260-289) mayapply towards the 36 units. Students mustcomplete a thesis, and a final oral examinationon the thesis may be required. Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) Stu dents must complete at least 36 units of ap proved courses of which at least 18 must be in regularlecture courses numbered CHEM200-249(CHEM 110A or CHEM 110B, CHEM113,CHEM 125, and CHEM 150A or CHEM 150Bmay apply under certain circumstances) andup to 12 units of graduate seminar coursesnumbered CHEM 250-259. Those numberedCHEM260-289 are specifically excluded. Doctoral Degree The Department of Chemistry offers the Ph.D.degree in Chemistry. The requirements are orientation examinations in analytical, inorganic, organic, and physicalchemistry; general university requirements; anddepartmental requirements. Program of Study The departmental committee on graduate study determines a program of study on the basis of the students' perform-ance on the orientation examinations and aconsideration of their subdisciplines. For stu-dents with a normal B.S. level preparation, thetypical course pattern for each subdiscipline isas follows: 1. Analytical (a minimum of three cour ses selected from CHEM 221A, CHEM 221B, CHEM 221C, CHEM 221D, CHEM221Eplus two 2. Inorganic (CHEM 231A, CHEM 231B, CHEM 231C plus two other courses) 3. Organic (CHEM211A, CHEM 211B, CHEM211C plus two other courses) 4. Physical (a minimum of three courses selected from CHEM201A, CHEM 201B,CHEM 201C, CHEM201D, CHEM201Eplus two other courses) Second Year Research Evaluation Students seek- ing advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D.degree must undergo a Second-Year ResearchEvaluation (SYRE). The SYRE must take place bythe end of the student's fourth academic quarterof residency and is administered by a four-mem-ber committee of the Chemistry faculty, one ofwhom is the student's dissertation advisor. TheChair of the SYRE Committee will be someoneother than the dissertation advisor. Typically,these same four faculty members would alsoserve on the oral qualifying examination commit-tee, with the Chair of the SYRE Committee contin-uing on as Chair of the oral qualifying examinationcommittee. The SYRE consists of both a written and oral component and the student is assessed on both152 / Programs and Courses components. The written SYRE document should provide an introduction to the dissertationresearch, an outline of the goals and objectives, adescription of the progress to date, and a delin-eation of the path forward. The SYRE documentis limited to five single-spaced pages (12-pointtype), excluding references. The oral componentof the SYRE will be a presentation of the writtendocument. After presentation of the SYRE docu-ment, the student will be queried by committee toassess the student's general knowledge of thematerial. A student will receive a single grade ofPass, Qualified Pass, or Fail. A Pass signifies thatthe student has made satisfactory progress inresearch and is on track to pass the oral qualify-ing examination. A Qualified Pass signifies that astudent's progress in research is reasonable, butthat improvement is needed, and should bedemonstrated at the time of the oral qualifyingexamination. A Fail signifies that a student has todate, not made satisfactory progress in research.A student who fails the SYRE would not berequired to undergo a second evaluation; howev-er, such students would be placed on notice thatthey are not on track to pass the oral qualifyingexamination unless major steps are taken to cor-rect serious deficiencies in research performance. Foreign Language Requirement A reading knowl- edge of German, French, or Russian is recom- mended but not required. Oral Qualifying Examination This exa mina tion consists in part of defending an original proposi- tion and is designed to test the ex tent of thecandidates' development and their breadth ofknowledge in chemistry and related fields.

It alsohas programs in Comparative Literature,Comparative Ancient Civilizations, and Ling -uistics. The department believes in the impor-tance of offering fundamental training in thehumanities in their own literary and linguisticcontexts as well as in their cultural and inter-disciplinary dimensions. Accordingly, studentsmay obtain degrees or take courses in a spe-cialized field, while at the same time enhancingthe breadth of their education within and out-side of the department. The department offers the following majors leading to the B.A. degree. Asian Literatures and Cultures The B.A. degree in Asian Literatures andCultures offers a diverse, flexible program forstudents interested in the study of Asian lan-guages, cultures, and literatures. Under thisheading, students can choose either theChinese or Japanese track. Classical Studies The B.A. in Classical Studies combines thestudy of Greek and/or Latin language and liter-ature with courses which explore the historical,philosophical, political, and cultural develop-ments of Greece and Rome and their impacton Western civilization. The department is ajoint member of the UC Tri-Campus GraduateProgram in Classics UCSD), whichoffers M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Classics.158 / Programs and Courses Comparative Ancient Civilizations For the B.A. in Comparative Ancient Civiliza - tions, students employ the methods of humani-ties and social sciences in the comparisonstudy of several major cultures of the past.They acquire skills of historical and socialanalysis, multicultural awareness, and insightinto constructions of civilizations in general. Comparative Literature The department offers the B.A. degree inComparative Literature and the M.A. and Ph.D.graduate degrees. While students majoring in Comparative Literature must have a knowledge of the languages involvedin the literatures of their choice, ComparativeLiterature courses themselves are open to allstudents. All work is done in translation and thecourses are given in English. French, Germanic Studies, and Russian Studies The B.A. degree is offered in French, Ger man ic Studies, and Russian Studies. Requirementsfor degrees include proficiency in the languageof the literature. (a) The Literature Option is available for majors in French (b) The Civilization Option is available for majors in French. Civilization studies are concerned with the culture of the lan-guage or literature of a student's focus,and with the people of the country wherethat language or literature exists or exist-ed. Specific requirements for the variouscivilization options are listed underFrench. Language The Language Major allows a student to specialize in two or three foreign languagesthrough a knowledge not only of the languagesthemselves but also of the bases of language(linguistics), examples of their creative use (literature), and the cultures which they reflect(civilization). Linguistics A B.A. in Linguistics is available through a pro-gram administered by an interdepartmentalcommittee. Some foreign language study isessential for specialization in this discipline, aswell as the pursuit of research projects andother kinds of practical work in linguistic-relat-ed areas. Other Course Work The department also offers course work inAsian literature, Chinese (language, literature,and culture), Civilization, Italian (language andliterature), Japanese (language, literature, andculture), Korean (language), Tagalog (language),Vietnamese (language, literature, and culture),and World Literature.Graduate Degrees Comparative Literature (interliterary) M.A. Comparative Literature or interdis- ciplinary) Ph.D. and Fellowships Teaching fellowships areavailable. Teaching assistants are normally heldfor CPLT 301 (Teaching of Foreign Language atthe College Level). Course work and/or teachingexperience at another college-level institution maybe accepted in fulfillment of this requirement.

Students accepted into the program may enroll at any of the three campuses, but they normally apply for admission to the Tri-Campus program through UC Irvine, which is the main lo cation forinstruction and administration. Ap pli cations tothe Tri-Campus program are re viewed by anadmissions committee composed of facultymembers from all three campuses. The goal of the program is to provide a graduate education that unites the main currents of mod-ern literary, cultural, and social-scientific theorywith the traditional skills and methodologies ofclassical philology. Candidates for degrees mustexhibit facility in Greek and Latin, competencein research, including theoretical approaches totexts and objects, technical mastery of comput-ing for research and teaching, and experience inteaching. These goals are realized through the four core courses (CLA 200A, CLA 200B, CLA 200C,and CLA 201), seminars (UC RiversideCLA250/UCIrvine CLASSIC 220) and readingcourses (UCRiverside CLA 292/UC IrvineCLASSIC 205). All students are admitted into the Ph.D. pro- gram. With the exception of those grantedadvanced standing because they hold the M.A.degree in Classics from another institution,entering students are concurrently enrolled inthe M.A. program. Master's Degree Students are admitted into the Ph.D. programonly. Entering students who do not already holda master's degree in Classics from another insti-tution will be required to complete M.A. require-ments while pursuing the Ph.D. The requirements for the M.A. degree in Clas - sics are two years (six quarters) of course work,passage of a special set of examinations, andcompletion of a master's paper. The normalcourse load is three 200-level courses eachquarter. Minimum course requirements are fourquarters of CLA 200A, CLA 200B, CLA200C,and CLA 201; four quarters of UC River sideCLA 292/UC Irvine CLASSIC 205; and fourquarters of UC River side CLA250/UC IrvineCLASSIC 220. (UC Riv er side CLA290/UC Irvine CLASSIC 280 may be substituted forthese courses at the discretion of the faculty.)Re quires a reading knowledge of either Ger -manic Studies, French, Italian, or equivalentlanguage, demonstrated by examination orother means. Normative Time to Degree Two years Doctoral Degree The requirements for the Ph.D. degree in Clas -sics are three years (nine quarters) of coursework. Minimum course requirements are fourquarters of CLA 200A, CLA 200B, CLA 200C,and CLA 201; five quarters of UC River sideCLA292/UCIrvine CLASSIC 205; and six quar-ters of UC Riverside CLA250/UCIrvine CLAS -SIC220 or an equivalent course. (UC River sideCLA290/UC Irvine CLASSIC 280 may be sub-stituted for these courses at the discretion ofthe Program faculty.) Students are encouragedto take courses and seminars in relevant areas outside the program at any of the three campuses. Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in a second modern language by the end ofthe third year. By the end of the third year andduring the fourth year of study, students musthave read extensively in the primary texts andin literary history and theory and in ancient his-tory. To qualify as a candidate and enter thedissertation stage, a student must pass an indi-vidually designed set of qualifying examina-tions, including translation examinations inGreek and Latin, written examinations orlengthy papers in special authors and field, andan oral examination. The facilities, course offerings, programs, and individual faculty mentorship of all three cam-puses are available to students in the Tri-Cam -pus degree program. The resources of the pro-gram are enhanced through a cooperativeteaching arrangement among the Tri-Campusprogram and the Classics graduate programs ofUC Los Angeles and the University of South ernCalifornia. Foreign Language Requirement Stu dents must demonstrate reading proficiency in a second modern language by the end of the third year. Teaching Requirement Experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity is normally required.

Comparative and Foreign Languages Literature and Karl Taube, Ph.D. (Anthropology) Stephen E. Cullenberg, Ph.D. Dean, College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, ex officio The Comparative Ancient Civilizations B.A. combines the breadth of an interdisciplinarymajor with the focus of more traditional majorslike History or Classical Civilization. By under-taking a comparison of several major culturesof the past that have continued im portance inthe construction of our present world, the pro-gram affords a truly liberal education. Studentshave a unique opportunity to employ the meth-ods of humanities and social sciences in theirmajor study. They acquire skills of historicaland social analysis, multicultural awareness,insight into constructions of gender and sexual-ity, and mental flexibility. The major is an excellent choice as a double major taken along with any of the traditionaldisciplines to add distinction and intellectualbreadth to one's background. Major 1.

Harvey, Ph.D. Rosenblum, Ph.D. (Philosophy)Stephen E. Cullenberg, Ph.D. Dean, College of Humanities, Arts, and SocialSciences, ex officio Linguistics is the science of language. It seeks to discover the psychological and motor mech -anisms of human speech, the similarities anddifferences among languages, how languagescha0nge, and the way in which language isacquired. Because linguistics is largely inde-pendent of fields with which the student is like-ly to be familiar, no special background isrequired for students entering the major. Linguistics interacts with a wide variety of fields, such as articulatory phonetics (biology),acoustic phonetics psycholinguistics, neu-rolinguistics, logic, the philosophy of language,and the study of particular languages (includ-ing their history). This interaction providesopportunities for students with varied interestsand can give new perspectives to those inrelated disciplines. Major Upon electing the linguistics major, and cer-tainly no later than the middle of the sopho-more year, a student should see the Director ofthe Linguistics Committee for advising. The director can help students find a suitable advisor to file the necessary forms. In consulta-tion with an advisor, a student plans a co herentprogram of specific courses to meet therequirements below. The student and the advi-sor must then submit a copy of the program tothe full Committee on Linguistics for approval.Students interested in the linguistics majorshould request from the committee directorinformation concerning the many possiblecourse programs. Many of them permit doublemajors, thus providing strong preparation forfurther study in two fields. Students may add variety and depth to their UCR linguistics major by attending a SummerProg ram in Linguistics (held in various places)or by participating in the Education AbroadProg ram (EAP). This is an excellent op por tun ityto be come deeply familiar with another countryand its culture while earning academic unitstowards graduation.

MilestonesThe Department has established three milestones to mark progress towards thePh.D. degree in Computer Science: advance-ment to candidacy, presentation of the disserta-tion proposal, and final oral examination. APh.D. student must also satisfy all applicableGraduate Division requirements for each mile-stone. Milestone I: Advancement to Candidacy. A stu- dent advances to candidacy after he/she has completed all the Ph.D. course requirementsdescribed above, and passed both the writtenqualifying examination and oral qualifyingexamination described below. These two examsare intended to verify three components of thestudent's preparation for Ph.D. research: (1)breadth of comprehension sufficient to enableComputer Science research in areas beyondthe topic(s) of the research exam and disserta-tion; (2) ability to perform critical study, analy-sis and writing in a focused area; and (3)demonstrated research experience or ability todo research. The Written Qualifying Exam. The written quali- fying examination consists of a high-quality paper, solely authored by the student. This canbe either a research paper containing an origi-nal contribution or a focused critical surveypaper. The paper should demonstrate that thestudent understands and can integrate andcommunicate ideas clearly and concisely andshould be approximately 10 pages, single-spaced. The organization and writing style ofthe paper should be suitable for submission toa first-rate technical conference or journal. Itmust represent work that the student did as agraduate student at UCR. Any contributionsthat are not the student's own, including thoseof the major professor, must be explicitlyacknowledged in detail. The paper must beapproved by the student's major professor priorto submission and must have a cover page withthe advisor's signature, indicating approval.After submission, the paper is reviewed andmust be approved by at least two other mem-bers of the faculty selected by theDepartment's Graduate Committee. The norma-tive time for taking the Written Exam is the firstquarter of the second year of graduate studiesat UCR. The student must complete thisrequirement in no more than two attempts. Oral Qualifying Examination The student is expected to demonstrate research aptitude by undertaking a research study on some topic(typically a problem from student's chosenresearch specialty that may be a promisingarea in which to conduct the dissertationresearch), under the guidance of his or her fac-ulty major professor. The research must be pre-sented orally to a Qualifying Committee, whichis appointed by the Graduate Division based onnominations from the department. The commit-tee evaluates the merits of the work and thestudent's aptitude for research. The work mustrepresent significant progress towards originaland publishable research. A written reportsummarizing the oral presentation must besubmitted to the Qualifying Committee at leasta week before the exam. The student mustcomplete this requirement in no more than twoattempts. The normative time for taking theOral Qualifying Exam is by the end of the sec-ond year. Dissertation Committee After advancing to can- didacy, the student must form a Doctoral Examination Committee chaired by her or hismajor professor. The committee must includeat least three CSE department senate facultymembers and at least one member from out-side the CSE department. Milestone II: Dissertation Proposal Examination After advancement to candidacy, the studentprepares a dissertation proposal that describesthe dissertation topic, summarizes the relevantbackground literature, and presents a compre- hensive research plan for the doctoral disserta-tion. The Dissertation Proposal Examinationevaluates appropriateness of the research topicand the feasibility of the research plan. It alsoestablishes a realistic timeline for the comple-tion of the Dissertation. The DissertationCommittee administers this exam. The norma-tive time for the Dissertation Proposal Exam isby the end of the third year. The DissertationProposal exam must be taken at least sixmonths prior to the Final Doctoral Examination. Milestone III: Final Doctoral Examination The student is required to write a dissertation in accordance with the Graduate Division require-ments and may be required to defend it in apublic oral final doctoral examination to theDissertation Committee. After a satisfactory per-formance on the final doctoral examination, theDissertation Committee recommends grantingthe PhD degree. The student's research andthe dissertation must both meet the higheststandards of originality and scholarship. The normative time for the completion of a Ph.D. in CS is five years.

Wilhelm, Cooperating Faculty Bai-Lian \"Larry\" Li, Ph.D. (Botany and Plant Sciences) Major The Department of Mathematics offers a B.A. and B.S. degree in programs that share a com-mon, solid mathematical foundation but differin their specializations in the pure and appliedareas of mathematics. These programs canprovide the basis for careers in mathematicsitself or within the many scientific and businessfields, which, in today's technological society,depend on a basic knowledge of mathematicalmethods. The B.A. in Mathematics , following the liberal arts tradition, combines a broad coverage of the humanities and social sciences with a mod-erate amount of advanced mathematics in themajor. It is selected most often either by students who intend to obtain a teaching cre-dential with a specialty in mathematics or bystudents who wish to pursue graduate work inbusiness or the social sciences. The B.S. in Mathematics is more technical and contains a greater concentration of work in the major field. The Pure Mathemat ics program isdirected toward students who may wish to pur-sue graduate work in mathematics. TheApplied Mathemat ics programs, with options inBiology, Chemistry, Economics, EnvironmentalSciences, Physics, and Statis tics, are designedto provide a rigorous training in mathematicstogether with a substantial background in thediscipline of the option. The ComputationalMathematics program is de signed to preparethe student for professional work with comput-ers and computer systems and for graduatework in computer science. The B.S. in Mathematics for Secondary Teachers is intended for students planning to pursue a career in secondary education. Its courses cover the high school curriculum froman advanced perspective. Students arerequired to complete mathematics educationand education courses in order to facilitatepresence in the classroom early in their under-graduate career and to better prepare them forentry in a credential program. Academic Advising Each Mathematics major is assigned a facultyadvisor who assists the student in formulatingeducational goals and monitors the student'ssubsequent progress in an academic program.Each quarter a study list must be approved bythis advisor. Advising for all math majors isconducted by the CNAS Academic AdvisingCenter in 1223 Pierce Hall. Teaching Credential Teachers in the public schools in Californiamust have a credential approved by the StateCommission on Teacher Credentialing. The cre-dential requires an undergraduate major, bac-calaureate degree, and completion of a gradu-ate credential program such as that of fered bythe Graduate School of Education at UCR (seeEducation in this catalog). The Bachelor ofScience in Mathematics for SecondaryTeachers assists students in their preparationto face the challenges of a credentialing pro-gram. Before admission and student teaching in a graduate credential program, the candidatemust pass the California Basic Education SkillsTest (CBEST) and demonstrate subject-matterproficiency in the fields which the candidatewill teach. The candidate can demonstrate pro-ficiency either by passing the commission'ssubject-matter assessment examination orcompleting an undergraduate program that isstate approved for teacher preparation. California Teach-Science/Mathematics Init ia tive (CaTEACH-SMI) California Teach-Science Mathematics Initiative (CaTEACH-SMI) agoal of addressing the critical need of highlyqualified K-12 science and mathematics teach-ers in California. With an economy increasinglyreliant on science, technology, engineering, andmathematics (STEM) and the anticipated largescale retirement of qualified teachers, this is anessential time to explore and prepare for acareer in teaching science or mathematics. CaTEACH-SMI at UCR offers undergraduate students paid/unpaid opportunities to explore STEM teaching as a career option. ThroughCaTEACH-SMI, students receive advising andmentoring to prepare for entrance into an intern teaching credential program while diligently coordinating with academic advisors to ensurecompletion of STEM degree requirements. TheCaTEACH-SMI Resource Center provides futureSTEM teachers with material and financialresources to promote planning and professionaldevelopment towards a science/mathematicseducation career.

Doctoral Degree The Department of Mechanical Engineering of fersthe Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engin eering. AdmissionAn M.S. or equivalent degree in engi- neering or physical sciences or mathematics is normally required for admission to the Ph.D.program, although applicants with exceptionalundergraduate or research record may be ad -mitted directly into the Ph.D. program withoutan M.S. degree. Applicants for the Ph.D. degreemust also meet the same requirements as forthe master's programs. Students in the M.S.program of Mechanical Engineering who desireto pursue the Ph.D. degree must formally applyfor admission to the Ph.D. program. The procedure for satisfying the requirements for the Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineer ingat UCR consists of four principal parts: 1. Successful completion of an approved program of course work 2. Passing a written and oral preliminary examination 3. Oral defense of a dissertation proposal written and submitted by the candidate 4. Defense and approval of the dissertationCourse Work Although there is no strict course or unit requirement, the department recommends a minimum of 36 units of graduate-level andupper-division courses, exclusive of seminarand research (ME 250, ME 297, and ME 299).In addition, students must fulfill a six-quarterresidency requirement. Students must take aseminar (ME 250) for at least three quarters.They must pursue a program of study thatincludes the following: 1. A major area of study intended to increase the student's depth of knowledge in a major area (i.e., an area of specialty in mechanicalengineering); and 2. A minor area of study intended to support and increase the student's breadth of knowl-edge in the major area, the minor area beingin a basic science area related to the stu-dent's area of specialty. A coherent program of at least 24 units ofgraduate course work (including 16 units ofMech an ical Engineering graduate courses) inthe major area should satisfy the major require-ment. A coherent program of at least 12 unitsof graduate or upper-division course work, orboth, in the minor area should satisfy the minorrequirement. The student and the faculty advi-sor should formulate this program within twoquarters after admission to the program, and itmust be approved by the student's advisor andgraduate committee. Changes to the programmay occur as the student's research progressesand should be documented after consultationwith the advisor and graduate committee. Written and Oral Preliminary Exam in a tion The examination aims to screen candidates for pur- suing doctoral studies. It is administered by thegraduate program committee and is composedof two sessions: Session 1: Engineering PrinciplesSession 2: An area of specialty in mechanical engineering Normally, both sessions are completed within a one-week period. Session 1 is a written exami-nation designed to test understanding of con-cepts and methods used in mechanical engi-neering. It covers three subject areas to beselected by the student. For details, consult thedepartmental guidelines. Problems will be typi-cal of those encountered in upper-divisioncourses of undergraduate engineering curriculain U.S. schools with graduate-level understand-ing. Session 2 is conducted orally and assessesthe student's ability to conduct independentresearch. Consult departmental guide lines fordetails. The preliminary examination is normallyoffered once every year in the spring quarter. Dissertation and Final Oral Examina tion After successfully completing the preliminary exami- nation, the student, with advice from the advi-sor, recommends a qualifying committee andprepares a dissertation proposal. The disserta-tion proposal consists of a written document and an oral presentation or defense. Typically, the student submits a dissertation proposal tothe qualifying committee within one year aftersuccessfully completing the preliminary exami-nation. The qualifying committee chair normallyschedules an oral defense within one month ofthe written proposal submission. The presenta-tion is given only to the qualifying committeemembers. The student is advanced to candidacyafter successfully completing this examination. After completing the dissertation research, a written draft copy of the completed dissertationmust be submitted to the dissertation commit-tee for review, evaluation, and determination ofwhether the draft thesis is ready for oraldefense. Once a draft has been approved fordefense, an oral defense of the dissertation isscheduled and is open to the entire academiccommunity. This defense consists of a presen-tation, followed by a question-and-answer peri-od conducted by the dissertation committeeand the audience. After successfully de fendingthe dissertation, the candidate must submitfinal copies of the dissertation that comply withthe format requirements set forth by theGraduate Division. Copies are given to thedepartment and the dissertation advisor, inaddition to those required by the GraduateDivision. Consult departmental guidelines for appoint- ments to qualifying and dissertation committees. Refer to the department's graduate program guidelines for further details.

The major con-sists of three curricular tracks, in one of whichstudents may concentrate: 1. Film and Visual Media2. Film, Literature, and Culture3. Ethnography, Documentary, andVisual Culture The Media and Cultural Studies major com- bines the breadth of an interdisciplinary majorwith a precise focus on visual media. Its inter-disciplinary structure brings together approach-es to visual media that would usually be sepa-rated by discipline. Students have a uniqueopportunity to acquire critical skills in the read-ing and analysis of media texts together withthose involved in various modes of media pro-duction. This applied experience includes train-ing in creative, documentary, and ethnographicvideo; photography; multimedia production;322 / Programs and Courses and screenwriting. Familiarity with media, either for its academic or industrial applica-tions, enhances one's understanding of anyfield in the humanities or social sciences today.

Music Major A Music major not only gains a knowledge andawareness of music as a worldwide culturalphenomenon but develops critical acumenthrough a manifold approach to sound in itsmany cultural settings. Historical, ethnographicand critical studies are complemented anddeepened by music-writing and auditory skills(developed largely in the context of Westernmusic), and by ensemble performance (avail-able in Indonesian, Philippine, Japanese andLatin American as well as traditional Westernforms) and by individual instrumental or vocalstudy. Music and Culture Major The Music and Culture major offers an ap -proach predominantly scholarly and critical tomusic as culture from the perspective ofresearch, criticism, and interpretation, with anemphasis on historical and ethnographicapproaches. It is oriented primarily towardunderstanding music as a culturally expressiveform. Courses in music and/or dance perform-ance are required but are positioned morebroadly within the major as a means to ex ploreinterrelationships be tween music and otherforms of performance.

Graduate Program The Department of Music offers the M.A. andPh.D. degrees in Music with a specialization in three areas: composition, ethnomusicology, and musicology. Students are encouraged to viewmusic in the broad context of culture: communi-cation between the intradisciplinary areas is builtinto the program, and courses outside thedepartment are either encouraged or required inorder to develop an interdisciplinary outlook. AdmissionStudents may apply for a terminal M.A. degree. Students intending to pursue a Ph.D. as their final degree objective shouldapply directly to the Ph.D. program. Studentswith a B.A. should follow the requirements forthe M.A. for the first six quarters. Students are admitted into the graduate pro- gram in the fall quarter only. Though applicantsmust provide GRE General Test scores, scoresfor the music subject area are not required. Allprospective students must submit an exampleof their writing. Composers must also submitmusical scores and recordings. Musicology and composition students must have an M.A. or undergraduate degree inmusic, including piano proficiency and musi-cianship (ear training). Ethnomusicology students must have a back- ground in music or anthropology. Evidence ofsuperior intellectual ability in another field com-bined with some demonstrable expertise in anymusical tradition is also viewed favorably. Entering graduate students in the composition and musicology programs must take an adviso-ry examination. Admission to full graduate sta-tus is contingent upon the removal of any defi-ciencies in undergraduate preparation asshown by this advisory examination. Master's Degree The M.A. Degree The Department of Music offers the M.A. degree in Music under Plan I(Thesis). Requirements. In addition to the coursework indicated below, all students must meet the fol- lowing requirements. 1. Comprehensive examination. All students must pass a written and oral comprehensive examination testing knowledge over a broadspectrum of their field of study. The ethnomusi-cology exam covers three broad areas: geocul-tural area studies, the history of ethnomusicolo-gy, and critical issues in ethnography. Thecomposition and musicology exams cover threebroad areas: music theory, music history andcritical issues in theory and/or musicology. Forcomposition students a fourth section address-es their own creative work. The comprehensive examination can be passed at the M.A. or at the Ph.D. level.Passing the exam at the PhD level is a require-ment for students intending to pursue a PhD.Failure to pass the comprehensive examina-tions after two opportunities constitutesgrounds for dismissal from the program. 2.

Maduro, Ph.D. (Biology) Nematology is the study of roundworms, the most genetically diverse invertebrate phylumthat occurs worldwide in virtually every environ-ment. Only about 3 percent of all species havebeen studied or identified, and these includesignificant parasites of humans, animals, andplants. A primary mission of the Department ofNem atology is to develop environmentallysound approaches to manage nematodes thatworldwide cause nearly $100 billion annualdamage to crops. Other objectives are to usenematodes that benefit agriculture and theenvironment as agents of nutrient cycling andsoil fertility and for biological control of someinsect pests. Additional objectives focus onnematodes as fundamental models for ad -dressing basic biological questions in genetics,development, and molecular biology. The dep -artment offers graduate and postgraduateopportunities in biocontrol, ecology, genetics,molecular biology, physiology, and systematics.It offers specific expertise in applied nematodeproblems of subtropical and desert agriculture. A graduate program in Nematology is offered within a broad biological context. Students areenrolled in a more general department or inter-departmental program that provides a core ofgraduate courses. The general departmentsmay include Biology, Botany and PlantSciences, Entomology, Plant Pathology andMicrobiology, and Environmental Sciences aswell as a wide range of interdepartmental pro-grams. Disser tation research opportunities,major research professor, curriculum advisor,and specific courses are provided by theDepart ment of Nematology to complementrequirements of the more general departmentor program.

Ph.D. Graduate Program The multidisciplinary interdepartmental graduate program in Neuroscience offers instruction andresearch training leading to the Ph.D. degree inNeuroscience. The M.S. degree (Plan I, Thesis) isavailable in special circumstances when the workleading to the Ph.D. degree cannot be completed. The goal of this program is to prepare students for careers in research, teaching and scientificadministration. The program is aimed at provid-ing high-quality graduate training for studentswho come from a variety of undergraduate back-grounds but share a commitment and an intenseinterest in nervous system research. Students areexpected to learn the fundamentals of neuro-science, starting with a required core sequence,become knowledgeable concerning a range ofresearch methods as taught in neuroscience lab-oratories and demonstrate capability in originalresearch. Graduate student training reflects theNeuroscience Graduate Program / 341 research competence and specialties of the faculty. That is, the specific research trainingreceived by a graduate student is the responsibil-ity of the major professor/mentor in whose labo-ratory the student carries out the research proj-ects leading to the degree. Students benefit froman interdisciplinary training approach, tailored bythe major advisor but enriched by the readilyavailable expertise and laboratory facilities of pro-gram faculty with backgrounds ranging fromchemistry to psychology. Current UCR Neuroscience faculty have major appointments in several different departmentsbut have a considerable degree of commoninterest in research problems and techniques.Furthermore, the three chief levels of analysis atwhich nervous systems are currently studied(molecular/cellular, systems, and behavioral) aremore or less evenly represented by the interestsand expertise of the faculty. Some faculty, asmay be expected, carry out research programsthat combine two or more of these levels of an -alysis. These levels of analysis, which character-ize the faculty's research, indicate the breadthof integrated neuroscience at but do notrepresent \"fields of emphasis\" in which stu-dents are to be trained. Areas that faculty investigate includethe follow- ing: Glial-neuron interactions Physiological actions of of ion channels by neurotrans- mitters and hormones Synaptic transmission and neural plasticity in mammalian nervous systems Signal transduction in excitable cells Molecular mechanisms of exo cytosis Molecular biology of ion channel structure and function Receptor-channel interactions Function of ligand-gated ion channels in neurons Influence of specific receptor proteins on function Synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms in neuro endocrine systems Plasticity in adult central nervous system Regulation of genes specifying neuronal connections in developing and mature nerv-ous systems Molecular mechanisms that trigger dendritic spine formation Areas involving behaviors and diseas es includethe following: Neural control of eating behaviors Neuroendocrine regulation of innate behav- iors Neural basis of language and reading Neural networks controlling locomotion in the spinal cord and brainstem Neural control of flight Neurolinguistics Cerebral hemisphere asymmetries and hemis pheric interaction Computational models high-dimensional of neuronal death in Alz heim - er's disease, stroke, and other disorders AdmissionApplicants must meet the general admissions requirements of the Riverside Div -ision of the Academic Senate and the UCRGraduate Coun cil as set forth in the GraduateStudies section of this catalog, including com-pletion of an undergraduate degree (B.S. orB.A.). They should have an adequate back-ground in biological and physical sciences, ideally including courses in the following orequivalent areas: General Biology, Genetics,General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Phys ics,Calcu lus, and Statistics. Additionally, at least 20quarter-units of courses distributed among the following areas are required, al though appli- cants may be admitted with limited coursework deficiencies and required to make updeficiencies as specified by with laboratory. Doctoral Core requirements include: 1. NRSC 200A/PSYC 200A, NRSC200B/PSYC200B, NRSC200C/PSYC200C PHYS139L,PSYC211 3. Two courses or one from following: The course option most appropriate to thestudent's career goals is determined by thestudent in consultation with his/her guidancecommittee. 4. During each quarter in academic residence every student enrolls and participates in theColloquium in Neuroscience (CMDB257 orNRSC 287/PSYC 287), and, until passingthe oral qualifying examination, every studenttakes at least two seminars, Special Topics inNeuroscience (NRSC289, 2units), duringeach year of academic residence. One semi-nar per year is required after the qualifyingexamination is passed. 5. After completing the course requirements and no later than the ninth quarter in resi-dence, the student is given a two-part qualify-ing examination, one written and one oral. 6. Regardless of whether financial support comes from fellowships or research assist-antships, etc., students must be teachingassistants for at least two quarters inNeuroscience or related-area courses, suchas those taught by their mentors. 7. Within three months of advancement to can- didacy, the student must submit a writtendissertation proposal to the dissertation com-mittee for comments and approval. Beforethe dissertation is given final approval, thestudent must present a public lecture on thedissertation research to faculty and studentsin the program. Following the public lecture,the student meets with the dissertation com-mittee for an oral defense in accordancewith the regulations of the Graduate Division.

See the Biolog ical Sciences or Botanyand Plant Sciences section of this catalog. Graduate Program The Department of Plant Pathology andMicrobiology offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degreesin Plant Pathology. AdmissionIn addition to meeting the require- ments for admission to the Graduate Division, students typically have a baccalaureate majorin a biological science or training equivalent tothat given in the Plant Science curriculum ofthe College of Natural and Agricultural Sci ences.Majors in the physical sciences are welcomed,but students must be prepared to augment theirundergraduate preparation with courses in thebiological sciences. All domestic applicants mustprovide GRE General Test scores (verbal, quanti-tative, analytical). All candidates for the M.S. or the Ph.D. degree should have good basic preparation in chem-istry and biology. It is common for students tohave completed courses in biochemistry, or - ganic chemistry, cell and molecular biology,elementary college mathematics, generalphysics, general botany, microbiology, statistics,genetics, plant physiology, mycology, and plantpathology. If these courses have been complet-ed as an undergraduate, graduate study isfacilitated. If students have not completedthese courses prior to admission, they may berequired to take them early in their graduatecareer. Master's Degree The Department of Plant Pathology andMicrobiology offers the M.S. degree in PlantPathology. General university requirements are given in the Graduate Studies section of this catalog.The master's degree in Plant Pathology isoffered under Plans I or II. Plan I (Thesis) requires 36 units of upper-divi- sion and graduate courses, of which at least 24must be in the 200 series courses in Plant Pathology or Nematology. A maximum of 12units may be in graduate research for the thesis. Plan II (Comprehensive Examina tion) requires 36 units of upper-division and graduate courses, of which at least 18 must be in the200-series courses in Plant Pathology orNematology, excluding graduate research for athesis or dissertation, and a comprehensivefinal examination in the major subject. The departmental graduate advisory commit- tee, in consultation with the student's majorprofessor or curriculum advisor, is responsiblefor prescribing the course of study, which nor-mally includes minimum PLPA 200,PLPA203, PLPA 204, 206,and participation in PLPA 250 for each termthe student is registered. Doctoral Degree The Department of Plant Pathology andMicrobiology offers the Ph.D. degree in PlantPathology. In accord with the student's preparation and specific interests, the departmental graduateadvisory committee, in consultation with thestudent's major professor or curriculum advisor,prescribes areas where study is required. Inaddition to selected subjects in plant path ology,related fields in which some degree of compe-tence may be expected is drawn normally frombiochemistry, biology, chemistry, cell andmolecular biology, entomology, genetics, math-ematics, micro biology, nematology, plant physi-ology, soils, and statistics. The departmental graduate advisory commit- tee, in consultation with the student's majorprofessor or curriculum advisor, is responsiblefor prescribing the course of study.

Political Science Major The study of political science provides under-graduates with career op portunities in law, gov-ernment service, education, journalism, andbusiness. Because career goals may vary, thedep artment offers two distinct majors. For stu-dents planning careers in such areas as law,journalism, or teaching, the traditional major inPolitical Science is appropriate. For studentsconsidering careers in government service,especially for such positions as program andbudget analyst, urban planner, and executiveor administrative assistant, the appropriatemajor is the Political Science/Public Service major. Further information on the study of law or the legal profession may be obtained from thedepartmental prelaw counselor. Political Science/Admin istra tive Studies Major The Political Science/Administrative Studies major combines the disciplinary interests ofpolitical science with a particular focus onadministrative behavior, tools of decision making,and politics of public policy. The Admin istrativeStudies component provides an interdisciplinaryapproach to training in administrative analyticalskills and, more importantly, to the study of thepolicies, politics, and theories of public adminis-tration. The Business Admin istration coursesprovide a variety of perspectives on these objec-tives. In addition, they should be of particularvalue to those planning to either enter directlyinto public administration (federal, state, or locallevels) or attend a professional school of admin-istration. Political Science/International Affairs Major The Political Science/International Affairs major offers a challenging opportunity to observe andparticipate in the dynamics of global interac-tion. As versatile as it is valuable, a degree ininternational affairs prepares the student forwork in many diverse careers in the privatesector, government, and academia. From diplo-matic missions to the United Nations to intensedebate with a private \"think tank,\" careers ininternational affairs should appeal to studentsseeking to understand and influence the worldin which we live. Political Science/Law and Society Major The Political Science/Law and Society majorcombines the breadth of a political sciencemajor with a particular focus on the theme oflaw and law-like relationships. The major pro- vides a multidisciplinary approach to the studyof legal and law-like institutions and relation-ships and focuses on relationships that haveformed the core of political science: the emer-gence and development of law, the relationshipbetween law and values, and the growth of thepower of the state, among others. The coursesprovide a variety of perspectives on this theme,and the range of courses should be of particu-lar benefit to those who plan to attend lawschool. Political Science/Public Service Major The Political Science/Public Service majorintroduces students to knowledge and skillsassociated with managerial career positions ingovernment, without sacrifice of either a broadknowledge of politics or a liberal arts education.

Professional Paper and Oral Defense The winter and spring quarters are devoted in part to the preparation of the Professional Paper (POSC285), which is required of all students, andDirected Research (POSC 297) to prepare adissertation prospectus under the direction ofthe principal advisor. The purpose of the Pro -fes sional Paper is the writing of a manuscriptthat demonstrates the capacity of the studentto identify, implement, and report on a man-ageable research topic. Students also completeat least one additional course in both the winterand spring quarters. These courses are deter-mined by the faculty and major advisor in con-sultation with the student and should be appli-cable either to completion of work in the minorfield or to the dissertation project. In the springquarter, students are advanced to candidacyupon successful completion of the oral defenseof their dissertation prospectus. Years 4 and 5 comprise the third stage of the program. Students are normally expected tocomplete their degree within this period.Additional time is provided if circumstanceswarrant it. Whether circumstances justify addi-tional time is to be determined by the GraduateCommittee, in cooperation with the thesis advi-sor. Students who do not complete their degree requirements during this two-year period areclosely reviewed on a biannual basis. Thesereviews are provided by the graduate advisor,after consultation with the dissertation advisor.Until completion of the Ph.D. requirements,each review includes targeted amounts ofrequired progress, to be completed prior to thenext review. Students who fail to complete theirscheduled work are reviewed by the GraduateProgram Committee for a recommendation oftermination from the Political Science graduateprogram. Normative Time to Degree 15 quarters. General regulations applying to the dissertation and qualifying examinations are found in theGraduate Studies section of this catalog and inother Graduate Division and department publi-cations.

Graduate Program The Department of Psychology offers the M.A.and Ph.D. degrees in Psychology; however,appli cations are not accepted from studentswishing to work towards the master's degreeonly. Graduate training in Psychology is offered in four major areas: Cognitive, Social/Personal ity,Developmental, and Systems Neuroscience. AdmissionStudents are normally expected to have completed the equivalent of an under- graduate major in Psychology at the UC, withbackground preparation in basic science andmathematics. Applicants for graduate statusmust provide scores for the GRE General Test(verbal and quantitative) prior to admission. The Ph.D. degree is a research degree. Students must demonstrate the ability to com-plete rigorous empirical research and must beactive in research throughout their graduatecareer. The course requirements in the Ph.D.program are directed toward establishing afoundation for critical evaluation of research lit-erature and designing conceptually importantempirical research. Doctoral Degree Course Work The courses normally required during the first two years include the following: 1. PSYC 211, PSYC 212, PSYC 213 (Systems Neuroscience students take two of the three, as directed by the student's advisor.) 2. The Four additional courses or seminars outside the student's area of specialization toacquire breadth. The breadth requirement isflexible in order to provide a choice of cours-es suitable for students in the different spe-cialization areas within the depart ment.Courses can be in the Department of Psych -ology or in another department. They mustbe regular 3- or 4-unit courses or seminars,and at least one of the four cour ses must bea departmental core course (listed in 2,above) outside the student's area of special-ization. Psychology courses in the student'sarea of specialization offered by other dep -artments will typically not be approved. For a course to satisfy the breadth require- ment, approval prior to enrollment must beob tained from all the faculty in the student'sarea of specialization or from a three-mem - ber advisory committee in the student'sarea. Exceptions to the \"prior ap proval\" ruleare granted to students who have completedgraduate-level course work prior to enteringthe UCR program. Stu dents may requestthat specific courses be accepted towardsatisfaction of the breadth requirement. Thisrequest is re viewed by the student's areafaculty, who use procedures and standardstypically applied to the preapproval ofbreadth courses. 4. PSYC 301: Required of all graduate students prior to or concurrent with the first teachingassistant appointment unless waived by peti-tion due to previous experience The Psychology Department requires that eachstudent earn a \"B\" average in the PSYC211,PSYC 212, and PSYC 213 sequence and in thestudent's area core courses, with no gradelower than a \"B-\".In addition, students must be enrolled in theappropriate area of Proseminar every 284Social/Personality: PSYC 285 Progress in the program is formally evaluated in June of each year and informally on a con-tinuing basis by noting participation in classand in research. All students in the graduate program are held to these requirements whether or not they havetaken graduate work at, or hold an M.A. from, another institution. The only exception may be for previously-taken graduate-level course workwhich is thought to be equivalent to one ormore of PSYC 211, PSYC 212, or PSYC 213. Ifa grade of \"B\" or better was received, and withthe approval of the advisor, the student may betested by a departmental instructor of thecourse(s) in question. On the basis of theresults of the test, the instructor decides if thecourse can be waived. Master's Degree Although there is not a sepa- rate terminal master's program, students may apply for the master's degree at the beg inningof the quarter in which they expect to completethe statistical sequence, the ap prop riate areacore, two of the four breadth courses,PSYC301 (see 1, 2, 3, and 4 above), and aminimum of 36 units in graduate status (ofwhich at least 18 must be in graduate coursework) and pass an oral comprehensive exami-nation administered by the Psychology Depart -ment. Teaching Experience Each student must gain experience in a teaching capacity for the equiv- alent of at least three full quarters. Teachingassistants assist a faculty member in an under-graduate course by preparing and gradingexaminations, reading papers, lecturing, andconducting discussion and laboratory sections. Written and Oral Qualifying Examina tions The qualifying examination should be taken during the third year of full-time graduate study. Itconsists of a written component and an oralexamination, and focuses on the subject matterin the student's chosen area of concentration. A qualifying committee should be nominated early in the third year, and all core and breadthrequirements must be completed no later thanthe quarter in which the qualifying examinationis taken. On the basis of this examination (and comple- tion of the core and breadth requirements), thestudent may pass and be advanced to candi-dacy for the Ph.D.; fail, and be permitted oneretake; be awarded the M.A. (if not previouslyawarded) but not be advanced to candidacy forthe Ph.D.; or not be awarded the M.A. and notbe advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. Upon successful completion of 1, 2, 3, and 4, passing the qualifying examination, and nomi-372 / Programs and Courses nation of the dissertation committee, the Graduate Div ision sends the student an appli-cation for ad vancement to candidacy. Dissertation and Final Oral Examina tion Students must complete a dissertation on a subject chosen by the candidate, bearing on the principal area ofconcentration and showing the student's ability in independent investigation. The dissertationcommittee guides the student in preparing thedissertation and examines the student duringthe defense of the dissertation. Each of the four major areas may have additional requirements. Occasionally, a change in coursesused to satisfy specific requirements may be justifiable.

Normative Time to Degree 15 quarters Minor in Quantitative Psychology In addition to pursuing a doctoral degree in one of the core areas of psychology, graduatestudents may qualify, under the direction of thecommittee in charge of the quantitative minor,for a minor in Quantitative Psychology by completing the following: 1. PSYC 211, PSYC 212, and PSYC 213, with a grade of \"A-\" or better in each course, or passing an examination covering the threecourses 2. Three advanced quantitative courses: PSYC259 (with different subtitles) or othercourses specifically approved by the com-mittee in charge 3. Three quarters of PSYC 270 4. Successful completion of an oral qualifying examination based upon a paper written by the student on a quantitative topic. A three-person faculty qualifying committee,approved by the chair of the committee incharge, must grant prior approval of the topicof the paper and conduct the oral examination.The candidate and the committee determinethe format of the oral exam; a presentation inPSYC 270 based on the paper satisfies the oralexamination requirement.

By its very nature,policy analysis is multidisciplinary. For instance,policies to address health problems in societymust draw on dev el op ments in philosophy, eco-nomics, political science, medicine, and ethics(among other disciplines).

Graduate Program The Department of Religious Studies offers theM.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Religious Studies. The graduate program in Religious Studies is for students interested in the critical academicstudy of religions. The Ph.D. program preparesstudents to enter into academia as researchersand university instructors in a specific field ofexpertise. AdmissionAll applicants must submit GRE General Test scores and transcripts from all previous institutions, along with three letters ofacademic reference and a Statement of Goalsand Qualifications. Applicants whose first lan-guage is not English must also take the TOEFL exam. Master's Degree The Department of Religious Studies offers the M.A. in Religious Studies. The M.A. program allows students to explore the academic study of religions broadly and isfor students who wish to expand their study ofreligions in an academic environment but maynot yet wish to pursue a career in academia. AdmissionAlthough an undergraduate major in religious studies is not required for admission into the graduate program, applicants shoulddemonstrate significant interest in and back-ground in the academic study of religions andthe appropriate scholarly approaches to reli-gious studies. Applicants to the master's pro-gram must demonstrate scholarly acuity, aswell as interest in the critical questions of thediscipline of religious studies. Given the broad-er scope of the master's program, applicants tothis degree program do not need to specify aparticular field of study they wish to pursue inthe program. Course work Candidates must complete a mini-380 / Programs and Courses mum of 36 units for the degree; 18 of the 36 units must be 200-level courses. Twelve unitscomprise the three core courses required of allgraduate students (RLST 200A, RLST 200B,RLST 200C), preferably completed in the firstyear of study. The remaining units should befrom among the religious studies graduate offer-ings; additional course work in related areas(e.g., history, anthropology, philosophy, compara-tive literature) are encouraged as time and work-load permit. Some entering students may alsobe encouraged to take graduate-level surveycourses in Asian or Western or Native Amer icanreligious traditions. Comprehensive Examinations In the final quarter of their program, master's students complete a series of comprehensive written examinationsthat are designed by the department andadministered by a master's examination com-mittee. These examinations test the student'sknowledge of specific fields of study as well asthe areas of critical inquiry that serve as themethodological focus of the program. Foreign Language Requirement Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in either French or German, the languages in whichmuch modern secondary scholarship in thediscipline has been written. Students may peti-tion to substitute either another modern lan-guage of secondary scholarship or a languageor primary research if it is deemed more imme-diately relevant to their studies. This require-ment can be fulfilled through a departmentalexamination, by passing a designated languagecourse (FREN 009A, FREN 009B, GER 002R),or by alternative certification (such as a diplo-ma from a foreign language institute). Normative Time to Degree 6 quarters. Doctoral Degree The Department of Religious Studies offers the Ph.D. in Religious Studies. The Ph.D. program prepares students to enter into academia as researchers and universityinstructors in a specific field of expertise. AdmissionAlthough an undergraduate major in religious studies is not required for admission into the graduate program, applicants shoulddemonstrate significant interest in and back-ground in the academic study of religions andthe appropriate scholarly approaches to reli-gious studies. In addition, applicants are held toa high standard of undergraduate prep arationfor their graduate work: both basic andadvanced courses in religious studies (in meth-ods and in their chosen field of study), begin-ning work in foreign languages (particularly ifthis will be an integral component of their par-ticular course of study), and a demonstratedability to work across methods, traditions, anddisciplines. A master's degree is not required foradmission to the doctoral program. Course work Candidates must complete the series of core courses (RLST 200A, RLST 200B, RLST 200C), preferably in their first yearof course work. In addition, students mustcomplete at least 24 units in a major area ofgeographic study (either Asian Religions orReligions in the West). At least 12 additionalunits should be taken in a minor area of geo-graphic study (some other aspect of AsianReligions or Religions in the West). Written and Oral Qualifying Examinations Students must complete a round of qualifyingwritten examinations, followed by an oraldefense of those examinations, in the quarterfollowing their completion of course work.(Students may defer their examinations for onequarter in consultation with the graduate advi-sor and faculty). Students complete the three written examinations over a two- to three-week period in the following areas: Major field studies Comparative studiesCritical studies The Major Field Studies examination evaluates the student's mastery of the chosen field ofstudy (some specific tradition within Asian reli-gions or within Religions in the West), with par-ticular attention to subdivisions of these fieldsof study on which the student has decided tofocus (e.g., Buddhist monasticism or Christianethics). The Com parative Studies examination draws on the minor field of study the student hasfocused on in course work; the student mustdemonstrate the ability to elucidate aspects ofthe academic study of religions through thejuxtaposition of traditions (e.g., Judaism andIslam). The Critical Studies examination will have two components: a method section, focusing onsome methodological approach to the study ofreligion (e.g., ethnography or literary studies)and a theory section, focusing on some con-ceptual approach to religion (e.g., Weber orDurkheim). The three examinations give students the opportunity to demonstrate an overall masteryof subjects and approaches and prepare themfor the more focused, rigorous research workthey will pursue in their dissertations. After completing the written examinations, stu- dents undergo an oral examination by commit-tee. The content of the oral examinations isbased on the written examination questionsand answers. Both the written and oral examinations are composed, administered, and evaluated by aqualifying committee, nominated by the gradu-ate advisor in consultation with the student andis appointed by the graduate dean. Upon the successful completion of the written and oral qualifying examinations, the student isrecommended to the graduate dean foradvancement to candidacy. Foreign Language Requirement Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in eitherFrench or German, the languages in which much modern secondary scholarship in thediscipline has been written. Students may peti-tion to substitute either another modern lan-guage of secondary scholarship or a languageof primary research if it is deemed more imme-diately relevant to their studies. This require-ment can be fulfilled through a departmentalexamination, by passing a designated languagecourse (FREN 009A, FREN 009B, GER 002R),or by alternative certification (such as a diplo-ma from a foreign language institute), In addition, students must demonstrate profi- ciency in any language or languages deemedcritical for examination of primary texts in their declared field of study (e.g., Japanese, Latin, Arabic, Tagalog, Indonesian). It is strongly suggested that doctoral students begin study-ing relevant languages for research beforebeginning their course work at UCR. Adequatelanguage training is becoming increasingly vitalin the scholarly and professional training ofacademics in the fields of religious studies.Many research languages are offered at UCR; ifnecessary, the faculty will work with students tohelp place them in needed language courses atother institutions. Dissertation and Final Oral Examination Students prepare a dissertation presented as prescribed by the Graduate Division under the direction ofthe candidate's dissertation committee. Aftercompletion of the dissertation, the candidate isexamined by the dissertation committee. Thisexamination normally takes the form of a publicpresentation by the candidate followed by ques-tions from the committee. Normative Time to Degree 18 quarters. Lower-Division Courses RLST 002.

Graduate Program The Department of Sociology offers the M.A.and Ph.D. degrees in Sociology. The graduateprogram in Sociology is designed to preparestudents for teaching and research careers inthe discipline of sociology. The graduate pro-gram is designed as a full-time course of studyfor students seeking the Ph.D. degree. TheM.A. degree in Sociology is awarded as part ofa student's required progress toward admit-tance into the Ph.D. program in Sociol ogy. TheDep artment of Sociology does not award anM.A. degree to a student who already receivedan M.A. degree in Sociology from another insti-tution. Doctoral Degree AdmissionAdmission into the graduate pro- gram is based on the following criteria: 1. Prior academic performance, especially in undergraduate or graduate Sociology classes 2. Performance on the GRE3. Letters of reference from persons familiar with an applicant's potential for achieving academic excellence 4. The extent to which an applicant's areas of expressed interest coincide with teachingand research emphases in the department Applicants to the graduate program in Sociol -ogy are encouraged to submit a copy of a pro-fessional or term paper with their applicationfor consideration in the admissions process. Ingeneral, students are admitted for the fall quar-ter of each academic year. Appli cants to thegraduate program for mid-year admissions arenot recommended because the sequence ofcore courses is designed to begin with the fallquarter. The deadline for an application foradmission for the fall quarter is May 1 andJanuary 5 for various university fellowship pro-grams. Applicants who lack adequate under-graduate preparation in sociology must makeup such deficiencies before work can be cred-ited toward the graduate program. A detailedstatement of degree requirements and proce-dures for the graduate degree is available atsociology.ucr.edu/academic/graduate.html.General university requirements of the Grad -uate Div ision are at www.graduate.ucr.edu and in the Grad uate Studies section of this catalog. The graduate program is designed to allow stu- dents to proceed through three distinct stagesin their pursuit of the Ph.D. degree: the basicSociology / 389 core program, the period of specialization, and writing the dissertation. Basic Core Program All students must complete the basic core program, regardless of whether they hold a baccalaureate or master's degree atthe time of admission. A student is expected tocomplete the basic core program in not lessthan three and not more than six academicquarters. The chair of the graduate affairs com-mittee advises students about the core program. Course Requirements 1. In the core program, the minimum require - ment is 40 units of academic work with nograde less than a \"B\". Work in the basiccore courses must be distributed as follows: a)Core sequence SOC232 NoteUnder normal circumstances, the core sequences in theory, method ol ogy, and sta-tistics, and the proseminar are to be com-pleted within the first year. e)Research colloquium: SOC293 (required each quarter until student is advanced tocandidacy) f) Research practicum: SOC 250 g)A minimum of one course from each of two specialization areas NoteStudents who have had extensive gradu- ate training in a core course area at another graduate school may petition the graduateaffairs committee to be examined by a specialfaculty committee for possible exemption fromthat core requirement. Examination Paper and Oral Exam in a tion Each student must complete a paper that serves as the comprehensive examination for completionof the master's degree. This paper reflects thestudent's areas of theoretical and substantiveinterest since entrance into the program, and itis written in a form, content, and style appropri-ate for publication or presentation to a sociolog-ical audience. A three-person faculty commit-tee oversees the evaluation of the paper and anoral examination of the student. The papermust be completed by the fall quarter of thestudent's third year in the program. On thebasis of a favorable recommendation from thethree-person faculty committee, the facultyvotes to recommend the awarding of the M.A.degree in Sociology. If the M.A. is awarded or ifthe student already has an M.A. in Sociology,the faculty then votes on whether the studentshould continue in the Ph.D. program. If a stu-dent is allowed to continue in the Ph.D. pro-gram, the faculty then votes on whether toaccept the two areas of specialization in whichthe student requests to be examined. Period of Specialization After admission to the period of specialization, students are expected toconsult with faculty who constitute the member-ship of each standing specialization committee.Under the faculty's guidance, a student isexpected to work out a program of graduateseminars, directed reading courses, andresearch experiences that prepare the studentfor examination in the chosen two areas of spe-cialization. The primary areas of specializationoffered in the department are as follows: 1. Criminology and Sociolegal Studies2. Family and Social Psychology3. Gender Studies 4. Organizations and Institutions 5. Political Economy and Global Social Change6. Race and Class Inequality7. Sociological TheoryA student's program must include at least one academic quarter of supervised research experience through enrollment in SOC 297and/or by working as a research assistant. Also required is the equivalent of at least one academic quarter of classroom teaching experience at the college level. A student mustcomplete three courses in each of the two specialization areas with a grade of \"B\" or better in each course. Exam ina tion Sequence 1. Standing committees composed of faculty in each area administer the written qualifyingexaminations in the student's two areas ofspecialization. A student must complete writ-ten examinations in each of the two areas ofspecialization before the end of the fourthyear of graduate study. 2. Upon completion of 1) the two written area examinations, 2) the selection of a disserta-tion committee approved by the graduateadvisor, and 3) a dissertation proposal, thestudent must complete and pass an oralexamination covering the areas of specializa-tion and the dissertation proposal.

Wong, Ph.D. (Music) Graduate Program The Master's Program in Southeast AsianStudies is an interdepartmental program cen-tered on the study of the arts and cultures ofSoutheast Asia and its diasporas. To under-stand Southeast Asia as a region, studentsneed to make sense of and engage with itsdiverse expressive forms of culture (includingvisual arts, literature, and performance) whichare crucial in building and maintaining individ-ual as well as group identity both within andacross national or ethnic boundaries. This program is designed for students with a strong interest in Southeast Asia, includingthose already admitted or enrolled in anothergraduate program. Students can be concur-rently enrolled in both the Southeast AsianStudies M.A. program and another graduatedegree program. AdmissionAll applicants must fulfill the stan- dard admission requirements as established by the Graduate Division. Additionally, applicantsmust submit a Statement of Purpose to indi-cate a serious interest in Southeast AsianStudies (or a specific country or area in thisregion) as well as a writing sample (such as apast term paper or course essay) to demon-strate basic skills of scholarship. Foreign Language Students must acquire (or increase) a distinct level of proficiency in at least one language relevant to Southeast AsianStudies prior to beginning research for the thesis and no later than the fifth quarter in the program. The required proficiency can bedemonstrated by way of an exam or by com-pleting one year of course work with a \"B\" orbetter. International students from Southeast Asia may use their native language to fulfill this require-ment. Course Work All students are required to pass the Proseminar in Southeast Asian Studies (SEAS 200) with a \"B\" or better. Additionally,students must pass (with a \"B\" or better) fourof the following six seminar courses: SEAS 201 Southeast Asian performance SEAS 202 Southeast Asian religions SEAS 203 Southeast Asian cultures SEAS 204 History of Southeast Asia SEAS 205 Literatures of Southeast Asia SEAS 206 Media in Southeast Asia In addition, students can select four other graduate seminars or approved upper divisionundergraduate courses in accordance withtheir main field of interest and after approval bythe Graduate Advisor and the student's Thesis Committee. A total of 48 units of coursework, including thesis, are required for the degree inSoutheast Asian Studies. Students concurrently enrolled in another grad- uate program may, when appropriate, includeunits earned in that program toward the 48units of the M.A. in Southeast Asian Studies.However, there must be at least 36 unitsuniquely applied to the Southeast Asian Studiesdegree. Plan I (Thesis) Students enrolled in the Southeast Asian Studies Graduate Program (for the terminal M.A.) must submit an essay (the-sis) of 30-40 pages reflecting original research,written under the supervision of a member ofthe program who also functions as the chair oftheir Thesis Committee. At the beginning of thesecond year students should write a researchproposal outlining their research project.Approximately ten pages in length this proposalshould describe the aims of the research andprovide a broader theoretical framework. Afterthis is approved students begin to conductindividual research in the field or in the library.Students must enroll in a minimum of 8 unitsof thesis study under the supervision of aSoutheast Asian Studies faculty. Before filingthe thesis with the Graduate Division studentsmust pass a formal oral examination. Plan II (Comprehensive Exam)Students concurrently enrolled in another degree program requiring an M.A. thesis may(with the approval of the Southeast AsianStudies faculty) be awarded the M.A. degree bypassing a comprehensive examination. University RequirementsAll master's students must be enrolled for at least three quarters to fulfill the University resi-dency requirement and must hold at least a3.00 GPA in all upper division and graduatelevel course work related to the degree. A mini-mum of 48 units must be completed of which36 must be graduate level (200 level) orapproved upper division undergraduate (100level) and apply only to the M.A. in SoutheastAsian Studies.

Major The Department of Statistics is concerned with teaching, research, and statistical consulting.The courses offered present a comprehensivespectrum of statistical and probability theory, inso far as such theory is necessary for theunderstanding and analysis of observationaldata. The applications of the theory delineatedin the courses may be made in any field ofexperience. Laboratory classes in which exam-ples related to the student's actual field of inter-est are worked out, play an essential part. Thedepartment offers both B.A. and B.S. degreesin Statistics as well as a B.S. in Statis tics withoptions in Statistical Computing and Quan -tive Management; the M.S. degree in Statistics;and the Ph.D. degree in Applied Statistics. The courses STAT 040, STAT048, STAT100A, STAT100B, STAT 104/BUS 104, STAT 110, STAT 130, STAT 140, STAT 146, and STAT155are intended for students of other departmentswho wish a knowledge of statistical techniques.Some of them may be taken as electives bystatistics majors. The objective of these coursesis to acquaint the student with the elements ofstatistics with only the necessary amount ofmathematical training. STAT 147 and STAT 157 are computer-oriented courses intended for students who would liketo learn about computer programming in themost important languages and who would liketo learn about statistical computing. In addition to teaching, the Department of Statistics is responsible to the dean of theCollege of Natural and Agricultural Sciencesand director of the Agricultural ExperimentStation for collaboration with research workersin the biological and agricultural fields. A con-sultative service in the design, analysis, andinterpretation of experimental data relating tothe agricultural sciences is provided. Computing Laboratories The Department of Statistics has a strongapplied orientation that involves the use of sta-tistical computing while solving real world prob-lems that arise in many disciplines. The depart-ment has two interactive multimedia computerlaboratories with Pentium-class clients and aSUN Microsystems Netra server, and also has aUNIX-based laboratory that contains multipleSUN Microsystems Blade and Ultra 24 work-stations. Each of the labs provides usersaccess to a wide variety of statistical softwarepackages and are networked to both theInternet and the campus WiFi network. TheCRAY Supercomputer at the San DiegoSupercomputer Center (SDSC) is also availableto faculty and graduate students, as are the 30PC workstations in a computing laboratory thatis maintained by the Statistical ConsultingCollaboratory. Statistical Consulting Center The Statistical Consulting Collaboratory providesa broad range of analytical and statistical sup-port services, including design of experiments,statistical inference, hypothesis testing, anddata modeling for the campus community, andpromotes cooperative research between statisti-cians and other investigators in all fields of theapplication of statistics. The Collaboratory isStatistics / 399 staffed by a faculty director, two Ph.D. statisti- cians Requirements See Undergraduate Studies section.

See Minors under the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences in the Colleges and Programs section of this catalog for additional information on minors. Graduate Programs The Department of Statistics offers the M.S.degree in Stat istics and the Ph.D. degree inApplied Statistics. AdmissionDomestic and international appli- cants must supply scores from the GRE gener- al exam. In addition, TOEFL scores must besupplied by all applicants whose first languageis not English. The department considers appli-cations for teaching assistantships at the sametime as those for fellowships. Normally, applica-tions for fellowships are awarded by Feb ruaryor March for students admitted for the followingFall quar ter. Students in the Ph.D. program who have satis- fied all requirements for the master's degreemay apply for this degree while completingrequirements for the Ph.D. program. Master's Program The Department of Statistics offers the M.S.degree in Statistics. AdmissionStudents entering the program must either have completed a bachelor's degree in Statis tics (or of probability and statistics.These courses would not be counted as creditto wards the master's degree. Students must also meet the other require- ments for admission as specified by the Grad -uate Division. The program is Plan II (Com pre -hen sive Examina tion) described in the Grad -uate Studies section of this catalog. No foreignlanguage is required. Plan II (Comprehensive Examination) Graduate students in Statistics must take (or have taken) appropriate courses in Mathema tics to givethem the proper background for graduate workin Statistics. Important areas include Calculus(at least MATH 008B or MATH009A,MATH009B, MATH009C, and MATH 010A)and Linear Algebra (at least MATH 131).Students are strongly encouraged to take atleast one of MATH209C (Real Analysis). The specific courses selected natu-rally depend on the research area selected bythe student. The program consists of a minimum of 36 approved units. These must include 1 unit ofSTAT 288; 12 units of STAT 293 are countedtoward this total. In addition, at least 20 unitsmust be of at least one computer language and the use of statistical computer packages isrequired, and students lacking this backgroundshould take STAT 157. Early in the program the student submits a pro- gram proposal, which requires the ap proval ofthe M.S. advisor. The advisor also supervisesthe student's progress and course of study. After completion of the required courses, the student takes a written comprehensive exami-nation. This is generally offered twice annually,in the fall and spring quarters. Some studentsproceed from the M.S. degree to the Ph.D. pro-gram in Applied Statistics. Admi ssion to thePh.D. program normally requires preparationequivalent to the M.S. degree. Students in the Ph.D. program who have satis- fied all requirements for the master's degreemay apply for this degree while completingrequirements for the Ph.D. program. Doctoral Degree The Department of Statistics offers the Ph.D.degree in Applied Statistics. The program emphasizes both the theory of statistics and its application to special fields ofinterest. In ad dition to courses in statistics, astudent would take courses in a substantivefield from which a thesis problem requiring astatistical ap proach should arise. The substan-tive field may be chosen from areas such asbiology, economics, political science, psychologyor ad ministration. Specialties might include, forex ample, population genetics, biological control,hydrology, epidemiology, geology, discriminationin learning, or scales and measurements. AdmissionStudents usually have completed a mas ter's degree in Statistics, Com pu ter Science, Mathematics, or some other quantita-tively based discipline. In some instance, stu-dents with master's degrees in other fields willbe admitted to the program, but in such cases,remedial course work in Statistics, Com puterScience, or Mathematics will probably berequired. Students also have to meet the general requirements listed in the GraduateStudies section of this catalog. Course Work Courses to be taken are in Sta tis - tics and the substantive field appropriate to the student's interest. Students without the coursesprescribed by the M.S. in Statistics or theirequivalent must take them as soon as possible.Students must complete course work in statis-tics greater in depth than that re quired for theM.S. Students must have know ledge of at leastone computer language and the use of statisti-cal com puter packages; students lacking thisbackground should take STAT157. They mustselect four or more additional quarter courses inStatistics at the 200 level, not to be graded\"Satisfac tory/No Cred it.\" These additional cours-es should be selected in consultation with thegraduate advisor and/or the student's major pro-fessor in order to strengthen a student's back-ground in statistics and to prepare the student for thesis work and a career in research and teaching. To be ap proved, A program mustinclude STAT210A, STAT210B, STAT210Cand three STAT 216A, STAT220A. In preparing for the written qualifyingexaminations, a student can register for up to 6units of STAT291 (Individ ual Studies inCoordinated Areas) only during quarters that thestudent actually participates in qualifying exami-nations. In addition, students must complete aminimum of 12 units (or equivalent) in a substan-tive field with a minimum GPA of 3.00. Therequirement may be waived if the student alreadyhas the background in the substantive area. Foreign Language Requirement None Qualifying Examination Before advancement to candidacy, students must demonstrate profi- ciency on a qualifying examination which isnormally taken after two years of course workand seminars. Dissertation The dissertation is pertinent to a problem area specified by the candidate's sub- stantive field and is submitted in accordancewith the requirements of the Graduate Division,Riverside. Teaching Requirement All students in the pro- gram, for at least three quarters, assist with laboratory (practice) sections of undergraduateStatistics courses or individual tutorial (consul- tative) work with undergraduate students.

Eric Barr, M.F.A. M.F.A.Marc L. Longlois, M.F.A. Major The Department of Theatre offers a B.A. in Theatre. The major focuses on three broadareas of theatre \u2014 its literature, history, andcriticism; performance, design, direction, andtechnology; and the elements of production.Students have the opportunity to write, per-form, direct, and design. Four stages are avail-able for rehearsals and performances: the 500-seat proscenium University Theatre, the new150-seat Studio Theatre in the Arts buildingwith state-of-the-moment equipment for facili-ties, the 120-seat Rehearsal Lab, and the 50-seat Barn Theatre. Students are able to practice acting in faculty- directed shows, student productions, and classpresentations. Special projects and studies areoffered for advanced students to produce anoriginal work or to study in more depth acting,Theatre / 403 directing, scenic design, or playwriting. As part of the Theatre Department's ongoing goal to provide a comprehensive and world-class pro-gram in the performing arts, a new Writing Track has been created for students who are primarilyinterested in pursuing the goal of writing for theperforming arts. In addition to taking classes inplaywriting and screenwriting, students will beable to take advantage of the department's activeproduction environment, which is a necessarycomponent of any playwriting or screenwritingeducation. As Theatre majors in a writing track,student playwrights and screenwriters will beable to take classes in writing for the performingarts, acting, directing, and other productionclasses as requirements rather than having to fitthem in as often-unavailable electives. Student assistantships, work-study, Gluck Fel low - ships, and scholarships such as the Chan cellor'sPerformance Award are available to students.

The UHP lower- division cur-riculum provides special seminars, projects,and other courses designed to introduce hon-ors students to the rewards of scholarship andresearch. First-year courses encourage innova-tive approaches to introductory courses andprovide an avenue for faculty to present cours-es that concentrate on their research interests.UHP seminars expose students to methods ofconceptualizing issues and framing questionsthat characterize disciplines. These seminarshelp prepare students for the independentresearch that upper-division honors demands.In the junior and senior years, each student inthe UHP selects a topic for an honors projector thesis and pursues this topic under thesupervision of an individual faculty member.The thesis or project is submitted by the end ofthe senior year. In both the upper division andlower division, the UHP challenges honors stu-dents to take an active role in shaping theireducation. The program offers a variety of extracurricular and service learning activities. The UHP offersstaff support for honors students, including sup-port for fellowship applications, internships,application to graduate schools, and summerenrichment programs. A reading room, seminarroom, and lounge and work space with comput-er facilities are available to honors students. Lower-Division Courses Admission to lower-division honors is based onan application, high school grades, and apti-tude and achievement test scores. Studentstake honors courses and participate in work-shops, personal growth, and community serv-ice activities. Sophomore Applied Learning Component The goal of the UHP is to challenge the manygifted students who enroll at UCR and at thesame time to fully integrate them into the life ofthe campus. We have designed outstandingprogramming for first-year students through ourLower-Division Component, and we have excel-lent student-faculty research opportunities forjuniors and seniors participating in Upper-Division Honors. But sophomores sometimesget caught in the transition. The UHPSophomore Applied Learning Com pon ent wascreated for students to make more productiveuse of that transitional year. Inter ested studentsmust apply to the program and meet the mini-mum GPA and units earned by the end of thefreshman year at UCR. For details, visit hon- ors.ucr.edu. Upper-Division Honors The upper-division UHP provides the studentwith the framework to produce a thesis or proj-ect, a substantial, independent product ofscholarship, research, or creative activity. Thisstructure is adaptable to almost any major andallows each student the flexibility to work with afaculty advisor to shape a research program tomeet the ambitions of the project. Continuing UCR students with an excellent academic record may apply or be nominated toparticipate in upper-division honors whether ornot they completed lower-division honors.Students who transfer to UCR as juniors withexcellent academic records may also apply orbe nominated to the upper- division UHP. During the junior year, students narrow their research focus, select a faculty supervisor, andprepare to undertake the honors project. TheUHP provides support in all phases of thisplanning. The honors project is usually under-taken in the first two quarters of the senior yearand is completed well before graduation. The completed thesis is submitted to the faculty advisor and to a second faculty readerfor approval. The approved thesis, a cumulativeGPA of 3.4 in the major, and an upper-divisionGPA of at least 3.50 qualify the student forgraduation with upper-division honors. Thehonors designation appears on the official tran-script.
