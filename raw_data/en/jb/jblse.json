Traditional Chinese Medicine is a contemporary system of holistic mind/body/spirit wellness rooted in evidence-based science with more than 5000 years of history. While TCM is very effective in treating acute conditions, TCM excels at uncovering patterns of disease and treating root causes of illness. Complex and chronic illness often manifests from underlying disharmony that Western Medicine too frequently misses or does not effectively address. TCM can provide understanding, realistic hope, and life-changing treatment for patients who have exhausted the services available through the Western medical system and/or feel unheard or neglected by Western medicine. While the modalities listed here are presented individually for the sake of understanding, services are offered as part of a comprehensive diagnostic assessment and individualized treatment plan. All treatment plans are tailored to address your current needs, conditions, and comfort. The goal is optimal and enduring wellness. Modalities Acupuncture Acupuncture is the insertion of very thin needles at strategic points on the body to influence qi/energy, blood, and fluid movement in the physical and etheric body. Within the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture can effect subtle yet profound change, well beyond the pain relief of \"dry needling\" that one might receive from other qualified practitioners such as chiropractors, naturopaths, and physiotherapists. Jenece's TCM acupuncture training includes over 2200 educational hours, including over 750 hours of supervised clinical training and internship. Acupressure for relaxation Full body & facial relaxation with Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupressure utilizes moving, comfortable pressure on strategic areas and points of the body. Acupressure can be indicated for patients that are hesitant about needles or for whom acupuncture is contraindicated. Deep relaxation results from harmonizing qi and blood flow throughout the body. Tui-na Tui-na is Chinese Medical Massage. It is often used in combination with other modalities such as acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, cupping, and gua-sha. Gua-sha Gua-sha is the use of specialized stone tools to stimulate micro-circulation of the soft tissue to increase qi & blood flow, address inflammation, and to expel pathogens. Cupping Cupping is the therapeutic use of glass or silicone vacuum-suction cups to move stagnation in the body. It can be very effective in treating tight muscles by lifting the fascia to create more space for muscles to relax. Like gua-sha, cupping can be used very effectively to manage qi and blood flow, address inflammation, and to expel pathogens. Moxibustion Moxibustion is a method of heating specific acupoints on the body by burning a small bundle of specially dried mugwort herb close to or on the skin. This technique can be used alone or in combination with acupuncture and other TCM modalities. Moxibustion can help bring warmth and movement deep into tissues. Traditional Chinese Herbal Therapies Using nature's pharmacy, Chinese herbal formulas can be very effective in treating specific conditions and patterns of disharmony. Nutritional and Lifestyle Coaching Traditional Chinese Medicine takes a very balanced approach to lifestyle modifications. Small modifications in nutrition and lifestyle can have enormous impact to health in the long term.
