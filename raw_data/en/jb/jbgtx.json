Our [immune systems](https://solancha.com/3-powerful-immune-boosting-ayurvedic-drinks-recipes/) are designed to fight off sicknesses and viruses. But unfortunately, the immune system can get worn down by many factors such as stress, anxiety, toxins, lack of exercise, smoking, and unhealthy eating. This prevents our bodies from effectively fighting off the virus. If you happen to be a Reiki practitioner, you have a powerful tool to boost your [immune system](https://solancha.com/how-to-boost-your-immune-system-with-ayurveda/)! In this article, I will share with you how Reiki healing can help your immune system become stronger. Read on! Reiki Healing [Reiki](https://solancha.com/what-is-reiki-and-why-should-you-consider-adding-it-to-your-routine/) is a form of energy healing. It is based on the hands-on healing technique through which universal energy is being transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. Reiki healing sessions help to enhance the body's ability to heal itself, restore energy balance, and boost the immune system, which allows the body to resist various diseases or recover faster. Therefore Reiki healing sessions are something you don't want to skip during the pandemic time! If you are a Reiki practitioner make sure to include the immune-boosting technique described below in your daily Reiki sessions. And if you are not a Reiki practitioner, then book a Reiki session from an experienced [Reiki healer](https://solancha.com/think-twice-becoming-reiki-master/) and ask for immune-boosting and thymus healing session! Thymus And Immune System The thymus gland is an essential organ for the development of the [immune system](https://solancha.com/vegan-golden-milk-latte-powerful-immune-boosting-drink/), but very few people have any idea about its existence. It is the thymus gland that maintains our immune system - the body's defense system against viruses. Metaphorically speaking, the thymus can be described as a \"school\" of accelerated learning of immune system cells (lymphocytes), which are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. Once in the thymus, newborn \"soldiers\" of the immune system are transformed into T-lymphocytes that are able to fight viruses, infections, and autoimmune diseases. T-lymphocytes \"attack\" foreign substances that have entered the body, control the production of antibodies against pathogenic agents, and influence other protective reactions of the body. The thymus gland is located in the middle of the chest, in the upper part of the chest. To detect the location of the thymus gland, you need to put two fingers together below the clavicle notch. In order to boost your immune system, you need to make your thymus gland stronger. You see, the weakened thymus makes your body vulnerable to viruses whereas the strengthened thymus increases your immune system and stabilizes your internal vitality. Therefore when you need to boost your immune system via Reiki healing you need to focus on the thymus gland, and this is how you do it! Reiki Healing Technique For Immunity Boosting Enough theory! Now let's get to the healing part! 1. Start with inviting Reiki energy for activating and strengthening the thymus gland and boosting the immune system. 2. Place your right hand over the area of your thymus, and the left hand over your solar plexus. Let the energy flow and heal you. Stay in this position for at least 10-15 minutes. 3. Now leave your left hand on your solar plexus and lightly tap on your thymus in a circular motion in a clockwise direction with three fingers (index, middle and ring fingers) of your right hand. Make 10-20 tapping circles. This action activates the thymus and strengthens your immune system. 4. Now place your both hands on your thymus for at least 5 minutes. And then finish the session. Express your gratitude. Note: It is not recommended to tap the thymus area if you or you have a fever! If you are Reiki level II practitioner, you can use the [Reiki symbol](https://solancha.com/reiki-symbols-meanings-purpose-and-practice/) 1 - CKR - for performing this technique. In this case, you are performing the same actions with the only difference - you draw the CKR symbol on your thymus when performing step 2. What Else Can Help Us To Keep the Immune System Strong? Though practicing Reiki healing brings lots of amazing benefits, it is also important to remember to stay hydrated with pure water and eat fresh fruits and vegetables during the pandemic times. Don't forget to include vitamin/mineral food supplements into your diet. Zinc is a mineral that is essential for an immune system function. Including zinc in your diet can help protect you against respiratory tract infections and reduce their duration. Echinacea helps to improve immune health and may have antiviral effects. Vitamin D is essential to the health and functioning of your immune system. Healthy levels of this vitamin may help lower your risk of respiratory infections. Vitamin C helps keep the immune system healthy by clearing out old cells and replacing them with new ones. It also helps to reduce the duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections and to recover faster. Elderberry extract has antibacterial and antiviral properties. It helps to enhance immune system response and may help shorten the duration and severity of colds, as well as reduce symptoms related to viral infections The Bottom Line As you can see, it is a very simple technique! This technique can be incorporated into your daily Reiki practice, for example, during or after a Reiki healing session. If you regularly activate your thymus every morning and repeat this technique several times during the day, then after a short period of time you can feel that your body gets much healthier and the immune system gets much stronger. Though this practice may seem simple and easy to perform, it has a wonderfully positive effect on your overall health and brings additional benefits to your Reiki "}
