Key words: Database, traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal therapy, drug addiction, detoxification 1. Introduction Drug abusers have a wide variety of medical and social problems including drug overdose, AIDS, violence and other behaviour-related disorders such as family dysfunction, unemployment and legal problems (Goldstein & Herrera, 1995; Ward et al., 1999; Wyshak and Modest, 1996). Searchingeffective and safe therapies for drug addiction is one of the most important research targets in this field. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in the treatment of drug addiction for more than 160 years, and has accumulated valuable experience in the detoxification and rehabilitation ofpatients (Xin et al., 1999; Shong, 2001). Thus, TCM was recommended as a potential approach to the treatment for drug addiction in the 2000-2002 Plan on Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Services of Hong Kong promulgated by the Narcotics Division of the Hong Kong Government. In the past 15 years, an increasing number of research papers in this field had been published, but they were scattered in various publications and media in different forms. This obscured the search for related study findings by computer databases and other ways. In addition, there was a language barrier to the foreigners who would like to read the papers as the majority (>90%) of them werepublished in Chinese journals without complete English translation. The establishment of a database on TCM treatment for drug addiction will provide essential support for all professionals including scientific researchers, medical professionals, social workers and policy planners. The aims of thisproject were (1) to establish a computerised, bilingual (Chinese-English) database on TCM treatment for drug addiction, (2) to analyse the literature features published in this field, and (3) to identify the commonly used Chinese herbs as well as toxic herbs for drug addiction.3882. Method 2.1 Database establishment There were three steps in the procedure for establishing the database, i.e. literature collection, literature translation, data management and computerisation. Fig.1 showed a flow chart on thedatabase establishment. 2.1.1 Literature collection The related papers were collected through electronic databases including the Database of ChineseScience Journals of Chinese Journals of TCM ( ), the Database of Chinese Herbs ( ), the Database of Products of Chinese Medicine ( ), the Database of Chinese New Medications ( ), Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, World Cat, Article First, etc. A search strategy was designed by integrating the following key words: Chinese medicine, Chinese herbs, herbal medicine, herbaltherapy, acupuncture, drug addiction, abuse, abstinence, detoxification, withdrawal symptoms, opioid, heroin, morphine, etc. All databases were searched from their dates of commencement to June 2003. In addition, hand searching for conference abstracts as well as Chinese and Englishjournals from June of 2003 to the latest available copies in the Chinese Medicine Library at the Hong Kong Baptist University and Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine was undertaken. 2.1.2 Literature translation Besides bilingually translating the titles, author (patentee) names, institutions, sources, abstractsand keywords of the published papers in Chinese and English, the database also uniquely included the translations of the hundreds of herbal names (Chinese names, Chinese pinyin, Latino names orLatino botanical names) in the published papers. 2.1.3 Data management and computerisation Bilingual abstracts (Chinese and English) of collected papers were input into computers, and theMicrosoft Access programme and Delphi language were selected as data management systems of the database. All names of herbs and herbal formulae reported by original researches were listed inPart 5: Advances in drug abuse research 389the item of \"Key words\" following abstracts of the papers, thus searching herbs could be done conveniently and instantly by this database. 2.2 Data analysis 2.2.1 Literature analysis The content and feature of published literatures recruited in the database were analysed including: (1) the accounts of published literatures in different categories (literature reviews, clinical researches, laboratory researches, patent files of herbal medicines, theory studies and news), and (2) the annualaccounts of published literatures from 1989 to 2002. 2.2.2 Herbal analysis The various kinds of Chinese herbs reported in literatures were analysed, by which the most frequentlyused herbs and herbal functional categories as well as toxic herbs were identified respectively from the original research articles and patent files. A herbal name in the same formula reported in different literatures were counted once, and herbs in formulae not fully listed in published papers were notcounted. 3. Results 3.1 CDR of database A bilingual database (CDR) on TCM treatment for drug addiction was established, which contained 340 published professional literatures including 85 patent files. Based on an extensive search andcollection, it should be the most comprehensive and updated database in the field so far. 3.1.1 Installation of database (1) The minimum system requirements for computers: 1 Microsoft Windows 95 or above, 2 1024 x768 dpi screen resolution, and 3 30Mb free hard disk space. (2) Installation of CDR: By following the installation command that automatically popped up on the desktop of a computer, a file named CMDA could be handily and instantly installed from CDR to the390computer. Then, the computer could run the CDR. 3.1.2 Function and operation Standard functions of the database (CDR) included bilingual searching, reading, saving, printing and so on, and it also stored some herbal pictures. The detailed steps of application of the database were illustrated in the following figures (Fig. 2-6). 3.2 Literature analysis The result of literature collection showed that more than 90% of the papers originating from MainlandChina were published in Chinese. USA, European countries and Asian countries such as Japan and Thailand had also performed some researches related to this topic. 340 published professionalliteratures including 85 patent files could be classified into six groups, and the amount and percentage of literatures in different categories were shown in Table 1. In addition, the literature analysis indicated an increase of publications over the past decade in this field; in particular, the number of Chinesepapers on clinical and laboratory researches had a significant increase (Fig. 7). 3.3 Herbal analysis 3.3.1 Commonly used herbal function categories The results indicated that more than 200 Chinese herbs were reported in 150 original research literatures and 85 patent files. These herbs had a very broad functional spectrum, and might be classified into 23 functional categories according to the classification system of Chinese herbal medicine. The top five function categories were tonifying herbs ( ), herbs for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis ( ), herbs for clearing away heat ( ), herbs for tranquilising the mind ( ) and herbs for exterior syndrome ( ). 3.3.2 Commonly used herbs In 150 original research literatures and 85 patent literatures, the top ten kinds of the most frequentlyused toxic herbs According to the Handbook on Toxicological Aspect of Chinese Medicine, in which 31 herbs were listed as toxic herbs, 13 of them were found in the 63 original research literatures and patent files collected by this database. top three toxic herbs which were frequently used and reported Discussion Based on an extensive search and collection, a most comprehensive and updated bilingual database (CDR) on TCM treatment for drug addiction has been established, which contains 340 professional literatures including 85 patent files. The results of literature categorisation and classification showeda significant increase of publications on clinical and laboratory researches in the recent years. This reflected that the clinical application and experimental research of TCM in drug detoxification and rehabilitation gained popularity, and the quality of research data was also improved gradually. For systematic search of related literatures in this project, we had screened various Chinese databases by our well-designed searching strategy. A total of 141 and of 99 non-overlapping relatedliteratures were found in the Database of Chinese Science Journals ( ) and CBMdisc ( ) respectively. These results indicated that large scale integrated databases could only provide part of related literatures, of which the data proportion was below50% of our total collections. Some scholars (Zhan, 2002) pointed out that multi-discipline databases could only provide approximately 2/5 of literatures in a specific domain; and \"grey literatures\" such as conference theses, degree theses, patent files and also drug development research reportswere far more difficult to be accessed through general databases. Therefore, our computerised,392bilingual (Chinese-English) database on TCM treatment for drug addiction is non-replaceable in professional application value so far. In order to maximise the utility of this database, we suggest updating it every three years. Almost all published data from Mainland China as well as other countries claimed that TCM including Chinese herbal therapy (CHT), acupuncture therapy and Qi-gong therapy might be potential ways for treatment of drug addiction. CHT was the most commonly used therapy for drug detoxification in the published literatures collected by our database. Based on data analysis in this study, the fivefunction categories of Chinese herbs and the ten Chinese herbs were identified as the most commonly used herbal medicine for drug detoxification. It will be valuable to perform further pharmacological experiments and clinical trials on the efficacy of these herbs for obtaining direct evidence. According to TCM theories, the clinical manifestations of drug addicts mostly belong to the \"deficiency syndrome ( )\". Even though they may have \"excessive symptoms ( )\", it is most probably \"asthenia in pathogenesis but sthenia in manifestations ( )\". Our analysis indicated that tonifying herb was the top one of the five frequently used herbs in functional categorisation; andamong the ten most herbs. These findings matched the understanding and the therapeutical principles of TCM theories. Contemporary pharmacological researches proved that many tonifying herbs exerted significant regulatory effects on the neuroendocrine system and immune system (Hou, 2002). This can be a pharmacologicalfoundation for exploring efficacy of herbal treatment for drug addiction. It is well known that the withdrawal syndrome during acute detoxification can be controlled rapidly by different therapies, but to overcome the protracted abstinence syndrome that is closely related to the relapse rate in patients has been one of the unsolved problems. Some Chinese papers havereported a beneficial effect of herbal therapy on longer-term protracted abstinence syndrome during rehabilitation period (Zhang & Zhou, 1995; Mo et al., 2002). The efficacy and safety of CHT on treatment of protracted abstinence syndrome deserve further confirmation by long-term clinicaltrials.Part 5: Advances in drug abuse research 393The analysis of herbal safety in treatment of drug addiction indicated that over half of the herbal formulae reported in original research papers contained toxic herbs, and there were 13 in 31 kinds of the top toxic herbs that were listed in the guideline on the toxicity of Chinese herbs (ClinicalToxicology Task Force for Chinese Medicine, Hospital Authority, Hong Kong, 2002) used in the original research papers. These toxic herbs may have therapeutic effects for drug addiction; however, they should be applied cautiously as the safety of many herbal formulae including patent preparationsis still unclear. Clinical observations suggested that the common adverse effects recorded in some trials were dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, fatigue, faint, sweating and palpitation that might happen less frequently than the therapies using Western medications. However, some trials found that herbalpreparations had significant adverse effects, to which great attention should be paid. For example, in the trials of Fukangpian, more than 17.76% of participants suffered from delirium during treatment (Guo et al., 1995). This suggests that a standard assessment on the safety of herbal preparations isabsolutely necessary in further pre-clinical and clinical researches. Patent files were an important resource for our herbal analysis in this project, but it was difficult to verify the veracity of the patent herbal formulae collected in the study. It is because a herbal formula is easy to be modified by changing its herbal composition or ratio; actual protection for patentherbal formulae is very limited currently. In consideration of this reason, it is understandable for some patentees to list herbal composition of prescriptions partly in their patent, which may cause bias in our analysis; however our preliminary analysis at least has summarised some valuablemessages from patent files on the herbal prescriptions and special herbs to treat drug addition. Besides CHT, other TCM therapies such as acupuncture and Qi-gong may also be potential ways for drug addicts to detoxify (Chu, 1996a; Chu, 1996b; Chu, 1996c; Mo, 1999). Acupuncture therapy including body acupuncture and ear acupuncture has some prominent merits as an effective, safe,handy and economical way for clinical treatment. Clinical trials indicated a capacity of acupuncture to treat heroin dependence, and experiment studies proved that acupuncture could improve biosynthesis, expression and release of endogenous opiate peptides in the body, which may be amain mechanism for acupuncture to treat the opioid withdrawal syndrome. A review of 21 papers (about 2 500 cases) reported that the short-term effective rate of acupuncture therapy was 46% and long-term (more than one year) effective rate was 10% (Chu, 1996a; Chu, 1996b; Chu, 1996c).394A systematic analysis of optimal acupoints and stimulating parameters is still insufficient in this aspect. 5. Conclusion In summary, the published literatures on TCM treatment for drug addiction were captured andanalysed for the first time by using a new database that might help policy makers, clinical doctors and researchers obtain the accumulated knowledge and latest information in the field. Suchinformation may be of profound importance in formulating an evidence-based policy on TCM for treatment of drug addiction. Further clinical and laboratory studies that focus on the herbs identified by a preliminary analysis of this project may directly offer more valuable evidence of TCM treatmentfor drug addiction.
