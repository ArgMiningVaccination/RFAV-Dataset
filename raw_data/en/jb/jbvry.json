Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 6 About Butler University A nationally recognized independent university known for its exceptional student learning experiences, Butler University comprises a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and five professional colleges: College of Education, Lacy School of Business, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Jordan College of the Arts, and College of Communication. Butler is committed to its mission to provide the highest quality liberal and professional education and integrate the liberal arts with professional education, creating and fostering a stimulating intellectual community built upon interactive dialogue and inquiry among students, faculty, and staff. In the 2018 \"Best Colleges\" edition of U.S. News and World Report, Butler University was ranked as the Most Innovative School among Midwest Regional Universities for the third consecutive year. Butler was also listed on the national shortlist of excellence for First-Year Experience, Internships, Undergraduate Research/Creative Projects, and Study Abroad. Such recognition reflects Butler's dedication to providing students with a broad, liberal arts foundation with nationally recognized programs, coupled with countless experiential learning opportunities in Indianapolis and beyond. Through this comprehensive approach, Butler students are prepared to step directly into a career or graduate school with confidence, which is evident in Butler's 2017 graduate success rate of 97 percent. Student Learning In furtherance of its teaching and learning goals, Butler has established learning outcomes for all students. The outcomes are assessed in students' course work and elsewhere throughout their undergraduate years, yielding continued refinements and improvement in teaching. By graduation, Butler's dynamic academic and cocurricular offerings will prepare our students to demonstrate the following: Liberal arts knowledge and transferable skills developed through multifaceted learning experiences Disciplinary and professional knowledge and skills in at least one academic field of study Competencies that facilitate their personal development and wellness cultivated through experiences inside and outside the classroom A capacity to help shape our local and global communities through civic understanding and an appreciation of diverse perspectives Students are afforded ample opportunities to achieve these learning outcomes through a combination of courses\u2014both in the major and in the Core Curriculum\u2014and through cocurricular experiences. A History of Inclusiveness, Diversity, and Equality From the beginning, Butler has been ahead of its time among institutions of higher education for its commitment to racial and gender equality. The University was chartered as North Western Christian University by abolitionist Disciples of Christ members, who wanted a university away from the \"pernicious influences of slavery.\" Upon establishment in 1855, the University immediately began setting educational precedents: Butler admitted students representing all minorities, and it has continued to do so throughout its history. Butler's first documented African-American graduate was Gertrude Amelia Mahorney, who graduated in 1887 and subsequently taught in the Indianapolis Public Schools. Women were admitted on an equal basis with men\u2014a first for Indiana\u2014and Butler was only the second university in the nation to do so. The first woman to graduate from the full four-year program, in 1862, was Demia Butler, daughter of founder Ovid Butler. Butler was also the first university in the state to allow its students, with parental consent, to choose subjects suited to their needs under a new \"elective\" system. In 1870, Butler became the first university in the nation to establish an endowed chair specifically for a female professor (Catharine Merrill, English literature), and only the second university to appoint a woman to the faculty. Professor Merrill also was the first to use the lecture method for any subject other than science. The country's first chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho, a sorority for African-American women, was founded on the Butler campus in 1922. When Butler University opened its doors in 1855, 20 students were enrolled, taught by two faculty members. Today, Butler is an independent university with a total full-time enrollment of more than 4,800 students (more than 4,300 undergraduates and 500 graduate students) and 363 faculty members. True to the vision of its founders, the University emphasizes the warmth and sense of community characteristic of a small liberal arts institution while offering the educational and cultural advantages of an urban center. The University maintains a favorable student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1. Because of its size, Butler can offer its students opportunities to work closely with the faculty. Classes are small, and students are encouraged to seek out faculty in their offices, studios, or laboratories. Undergraduate research and independent study are encouraged. Although Butler professors are teaching faculty, they understand that first-rate teaching must be complemented with scholarly activity that extends the boundaries of knowledge. Butler students currently represent 48 states and 34 countries, reflecting diverse cultures, interests, aspirations, personalities, and experiences. Students can join more than 160 student organizations, 12 Greek organizations, and 18 varsity athletic teams. More than 94 percent of Butler students are involved in campus activities; over 40 percent volunteer regularly. As it has since its founding, Butler continues to both value tradition and embrace innovation. The Campus Butler's 295-acre campus, within a historic northside Indianapolis neighborhood, comprises nearly 30 buildings, playing fields, and a nature preserve. Located five miles from the heart of the city, the campus offers easy access to downtown. Its urban location allows Butler to offer students a wide range of internship opportunities that are excellent preparation for careers and graduate schools. In addition, full-time faculty in several disciplines, such as accounting, journalism, and instrumental music, are supplemented with adjunct instructors, drawing on the resources of professionals in the surrounding community. Campus facilities include: Jordan Hall, built in 1927 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In addition to housing several departments of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the building incorporates computer labs, an electronic language laboratory, administrative and faculty offices, alumni and parent programs, student accounts, registration, and classrooms.

Indianapolis schools, corporations, and cultural organizations benefit from the University's cooperation, and student interns serve in a wide variety of Central Indiana businesses, governmental offices, nonprofit agencies, schools, hospitals, and pharmacies. Butler seeks to continue to strengthen its partnership with a vital, growing city and region. Indianapolis is the 15th-largest city in the United States, with a metropolitan-area population of more than 1.9 million. In recent years, the city has emerged as a leader in science, medicine, research, technology, and sports. Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company is located in the city, as are top-ranked regional hospitals. Many performing arts companies call Indianapolis home. Museum offerings include the world's largest children's museum, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Conner Prairie, and the nearby Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Widely known for the annual 500-mile race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the city has two major league professional sports teams, and it also has hosted hundreds of national and international amateur sporting events. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 8 Undergraduate and Graduate Academic Programs The Core Curriculum Butler University is home to six colleges, all of which believe that the University's first responsibility is the liberal education of its students. At the heart of Butler's undergraduate education is the University's Core Curriculum, a set of academic requirements embodying our definition of what it means to be a liberally educated person. Introduced in 1945, the Core Curriculum is one of Butler's oldest academic entities. Like all good ideas, the Core has not remained static but has expanded to meet the needs of a changing society. Today's Core Curriculum, implemented in fall 2010, emphasizes the development of key skills that transfer directly into careers after graduation. Employers are seeking flexible, creative, and critical thinkers who can demonstrate competencies in strong written and oral communication, information fluency, intercultural awareness, and analytical and ethical reasoning skills. Through direct experience working in the Indianapolis community, study-abroad opportunities, and rich cocultural experiences in the Core Curriculum, Butler students also engage central issues of our increasingly globalized world, including diversity, personal and social responsibility, and social justice. In these varied ways, the Core Curriculum provides Butler students with transformative learning experiences that prepare graduates to make a meaningful impact on the world. The Core Curriculum is required for all baccalaureate and associate degrees. All Butler undergraduates, no matter their major field of study, complete the Core Curriculum. Core Curriculum courses are not open to graduate students. Students are expected to consult with their academic advisor prior to registration each semester to plan their experiences in the Core Curriculum. For more information, visit www.butler.edu/core.

Students are nominated for departmental honors by the head of the department of their academic major. Three levels of departmental honors are awarded: \"in (major) with honors\" is awarded to a nominee with a GPA of at least 3.60 in the academic major. \"in (major) with high honors\" is awarded to a nominee with a GPA of at least 3.70 in the academic major and who either completes an honors thesis approved by the department and the appropriate College Honors Board or passes a comprehensive examination in the nominee's major subject. \"in (major) with highest honors\" is awarded to a nominee with a GPA of at least 3.80 in the academic major and who both completes an honors thesis approved by the department and the appropriate College Honors Board and passes a comprehensive examination in the nominee's major subject. All comprehensive exams must comply with five minimum standards. They must: 1. Be developed and administered by the departments or programs (i.e., GRE and other external standardized tests are not appropriate); 2. Be relevant to the student's course work in the department; 3. Include a written component; 4. Include a component that is common to all students and that tests their understanding of core knowledge in the discipline; and 5. Include questions that require synthesis of ideas and comprehensive reflection about a substantial portion of the student's departmental course work. University Honors Program The Butler University Honors Program exists to meet the expectations of academically outstanding students in all colleges and majors who wish to develop their talents and potential to the fullest. It is designed\u2014through a combination of honors courses, cultural events, independent study, and creative activity\u2014to foster a diverse and challenging intellectual environment for honors students and to enhance the academic community by adding a distinctive note of innovative thinking and interdisciplinary dialogue. Students who have been accepted to Butler University with an application date prior to November 1 will be invited to apply to the University Honors Program if they meet any of the following criteria: a 1,380 or higher combined SAT score, 30 or higher composite ACT score, or they are in the top 5 percent of their graduating high school class (with a minimum class size of 100). Admission decisions to the program for incoming students will also be based on an application essay. Students with at least 16 graded credits at Butler University and a cumulative GPA of at least 3.60 also are invited to petition to enter the program by writing a letter detailing their interest as well as securing a letter of recommendation from a Butler professor. The University Honors Program requires satisfactory completion of the following: Honors Courses\u2014Four honors courses are required, including at least one HN200 and at least one HN300, in addition to either HN397 or HN398. A student must earn a minimum grade of B for an honors course to count toward completion of University Honors Program requirements. Honors First Year Seminar (HN110 and HN111) is taken in the first year. Students who do not take HN110 and HN111 in their first year must replace this experience with an additional HN200 or HN300 course. Departmental Honors Course\u2014If a department requires a departmental honors course for thesis preparation, students must take this designated course within their department or college for credit. The designated departmental honors course does not count toward the four required honors courses. Students should consult their academic advisor to see what their individual department requires for thesis preparation. Honors Thesis Proposal Course\u2014This course is typically taken during spring semester of the penultimate academic year. The product of the course (HN397 for 1 credit or HN398 for 2 credits) will be a thesis proposal, which will be submitted for review on the Friday before Spring Break. Honors Thesis\u2014All University Honors Program students are required to complete an honors thesis. The thesis is a major research or creative project, usually (but not necessarily) in the field of the student's major and advised by a full-time faculty member. The project begins following the approval of the thesis proposal, and the completed thesis is due during the semester the student intends to graduate. Each student must also deliver an oral presentation of her or his thesis before an audience at an appropriate forum. Other Requirements Honors Community Events: Students are required to attend eight honors community events during their first three years. These community events will be announced to all honors students and may include honors course speakers, honors course presentations, presentations/performances of undergraduate thesis work, community events sponsored by the Student Honors Council, and/or special events sponsored by the University Honors Program. Sophomore Review: All students will be reviewed in the second semester of their second year (i.e., in the fourth semester at Butler). To remain active in the program, students must demonstrate satisfactory progress by having completed a minimum of 64 credit hours at Butler with a GPA of at least 3.4, and completed at least one honors course with a demonstrated timeline for completing the remaining courses by the expected graduation date. All students have the right of petition to waive or substitute certain criteria.

Students may study abroad during their sophomore and junior years, and possibly their senior year, if their academic dean approves their petition to intrude upon their final 30 hours at Butler. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 18 Butler Semester in Spain Program Butler offers a faculty-led program at the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares each fall term. Butler students are able to take an entire semester's load of 12 credits that can be applied toward the Spanish major and minor, or can count as electives. All participating students take one course with the Butler faculty director, while the rest of the courses are taught by professors at the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares in courses designed for nonnative speakers of Spanish. Students with superior Spanish language skills can petition to enroll in university courses for native Spanish speakers. The program includes guided excursions to other regions of Spain. All students live with carefully selected Spanish families, thus enriching their opportunities for cultural immersion. Students must have completed two 300-level Spanish courses to be eligible for the program. Global Adventures in the Liberal Arts (GALA) Programs Each spring semester, Butler offers a faculty-led study program in a particular world region. Previous destinations have been Europe, Latin America, South Africa, and East Asia. Up to 20 students travel to several countries in the region while taking four or five undergraduate courses taught by Butler faculty members. The courses are designed to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements that are usually undertaken in the sophomore year. Some cross-listing is possible to provide flexibility for students who already may have completed some of the Core requirements included in the program. Faculty-Led Summer Courses Students can take summer classes while traveling abroad with a faculty member and a group of Butler students. All the colleges at Butler organize three- to four-week summer courses in overseas locations. Students consistently report that these experiences offer a valuable opportunity to learn about the course content while visiting the actual locations they are studying. International Exchange Programs Reciprocal exchanges provide opportunities for Butler students to attend carefully selected partner universities abroad while students from those universities attend Butler, on a one-for-one basis. Butler has developed some of these exchange opportunities; others are available through the International Student Exchange Program. The University's faculty and study-abroad advisor will work closely with individual students to select the program that best fits each student's academic and personal development needs. Butler has established reciprocal student exchange relationships with premier universities in other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Wales. A wide range of courses is available at the partner universities in areas such as business, education, languages and cultural studies, and many other disciplines in the arts and sciences. Students also have access to the comprehensive services available to all students attending the university, as well as the continued support provided by the Center for Global Education. Butler is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), headquartered in Washington, DC. ISEP is a worldwide network for international education, consisting of 340 institutions from more than 50 countries, through which students may exchange on a one-for-one reciprocal basis. Each student Butler sends to an ISEP member institution receives tuition, room and board, and other benefits as defined by the hosting institution. Because ISEP is a totally integrated program, some programs may require an advanced knowledge of the local language to participate; students studying at an institution where the language of instruction is not English must prove sufficient language proficiency to participate. Study-Abroad Programs A very wide range of program types and geographic destinations is available through the one-directional study-abroad programs on the List of Approved Programs. Butler University has been fortunate to have a cooperative agreement with the Institute for Study Abroad (IFSA), founded on Butler's campus in 1988. IFSA-Butler is one of the main study-abroad program providers for Butler students. The organization annually sends about 3,000 students from 400 U.S. universities to more than 90 universities in Argentina, Australia, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czech Republic, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom.. IFSA is a separate service organization that helps students through the application process, assists with travel plans, arranges overseas housing, and advises on a variety of related issues. In addition to its Indianapolis office, IFSA maintains fully staffed offices in each country where it has programs. The overseas offices conduct student orientations, sponsor excursions, and provide various student services. All grades earned through an IFSA-Butler program are posted to an official Butler University transcript. Students also may select their overseas study opportunity from programs offered by more than 20 other colleges, universities, and well-respected study-abroad organizations. All provide a wide range of student services and give careful attention to safety and security issues. Approved programs represent a spectrum of geographic regions and areas of study. Educational opportunities may be classroom-based or experiential, including internships, service learning, research, and student teaching. Tuition and Financial Aid Applicability for Study Abroad In most cases, federal and state aid will apply to study-abroad costs if the student is currently receiving aid. Students who study abroad will pay Butler University tuition during their semester(s) abroad. Those who participate in the Butler Semester in Spain Program and the Global Adventures in the Liberal Arts Program as well as in reciprocal exchange programs\u2014through Butler's bilateral exchanges or ISEP\u2014may apply 100 percent of their Butler institutional financial aid to their tuition for their semester(s) abroad. Those who participate in other approved study-abroad programs may apply 50 percent of their Butler institutional financial aid toward their tuition for their first study-abroad semester, and 25 percent for their second semester abroad. Center for Global Education (CGE) The Center for Global Education provides leadership, coordination, and administrative support for the comprehensive internationalization of the University. The CGE manages all study-abroad activity, provides advising, organizes pre-departure and reentry sessions, and maintains Butler's List of Approved Programs for Overseas Study. These programs offer a wide variety of options to Butler students interested in studying abroad during the academic year. All programs on the list meet Butler's high standards for academic excellence. Students are expected to select their overseas study program from the List of Approved Programs for semester- and academic year-long programs. The programs fall into two broad categories: reciprocal exchanges and study-abroad programs. The CGE also offers its own programs. For more information, contact CGE in Jordan Hall, or visit www.butler.edu/global-education.

Included are the University Honors Program, undergraduate research, prestigious scholarship/fellowship advising, pre-health advising, pre-law advising, and administration of the University's chapter of the honor society Phi Kappa Phi. Additional information about CHASE-sponsored programs is available at www.butler.edu/chase or by contacting the Center at chase@butler.edu or 317-940-9581. Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity The Programs for Undergraduate Research Committee and CHASE assist students in all disciplines to develop and complete research and creative endeavors in a variety of ways: The Butler Summer Institute (BSI) provides an opportunity for students to work one-on-one with a faculty mentor during the summer on a research or creative project. Students accepted to the program receive $2,500 and free housing for the duration of the program. In addition to conducting research and presenting their findings, students participate in seminars and other activities. Through the BSI, students can experience a close working relationship with a faculty member which, in turn, offers an opportunity to expand their scholastic and professional horizons. The Butler University Undergraduate Research Conference, held every spring, attracts more than 900 participants from colleges and universities around the Midwest and beyond. Oral and poster presentations are given in a wide variety of disciplines, and competitive awards are given to the top four paper authors. Student Thesis Grants defray some of the costs of conducting research necessary for completion of honors theses. Travel to Present Grants are available to defray the travel costs associated with presenting the results of research or creative endeavors at peer-reviewed international or national conferences. Prestigious Scholarships and Fellowships The CHASE office assists students in discovering and applying for national and international prestigious scholarships and fellowships, such as Fulbright, Goldwater, Marshall, Rhodes, and Truman scholarships. We guide students through the process of identifying awards suited to students' strengths and accomplishments, understanding the award application process, developing competitive applications, and completing the nomination process, and we also offer coaching via mock interviews. In recent years, Butler has enjoyed a distinguished record of success in these competitions.

For more information about specific scholarship programs and internal deadlines, visit www.butler.edu/chase or contact CHASE at chase@butler.edu. medicine, pre-optometry, pre-physical therapy) Pre-health students may choose any major, but most students elect to major in either the biological sciences or chemistry. For admission, most professional schools require a minimum of one year of biology, one year each of general and organic chemistry, and one year of physics; however, the expectations of professional schools vary, and students should consult with their Butler advisor and the pre-health advisor concerning the requirements of the particular professional schools in which they are interested. Pre-health course work varies according to the student's goal, but every student has the choice of completing a number of elective courses. These are offered both to enhance pre-professional training and to broaden and deepen the student's education. Students also may participate in research programs, shadowing experiences, and campus and community service opportunities. Many pre-health students also are in Butler's Honors Program. A science major (biology, chemistry, etc.) in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires a minimum of 30 hours of course work in that department as well as foreign language requirements. Regardless of the major area of study, courses in biology, chemistry, and physics are required to adequately prepare students for success in their professional field. Two pre-health faculty advisors schedule networking events throughout the year, mentor the Pre-Health Society (a recognized chapter of the American Medical Students Association), and work one-on-one with students to tailor an academic program to meet individual needs and career goals. Students' individualized academic schedules will allow them to meet all professional school entrance requirements and prepare them for the nationally administered entrance examinations for health professional schools. Students interested in pre-health advising should contact CHASE early in their academic careers. Pre-Law Butler pre-law students may choose any major. The Law School Admission Council advises that \"Law schools want students who can think critically and write well, and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped the human experience. These attributes can be acquired in any number of college courses, whether in the arts and humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences.\" In addition, courses introducing legal principles may be helpful to students in assessing whether to continue to pursue law. Finally, courses in logic, mathematics, and analytical reasoning may enhance preparation for the Law School Admission Test. Students also may participate in engaged-learning experiences such as our mock mediation team, networking events, and internship opportunities in Indianapolis or during the Washington, DC or New York City Learning Semester. Students interested in pre-law advising should contact CHASE early in their academic careers. University Honors Program The CHASE office is the administrative home of the University Honors Program.

An honorary degree is presented to an individual who may serve as the Commencement speaker. For close to 60 years, the University has recognized students of outstanding character, scholarship, engaged citizenship, leadership, and commitment to fostering diversity through the Outstanding Student Recognition\u2014Top 100 program. Juniors and seniors are nominated and selected through an application process for Top 100 consideration. Once selected as a Top 100 student, candidates are given the opportunity to submit letters of recommendation for consideration to be a Top 15 Most Outstanding Student. Committees of faculty, staff, and alumni govern the selection process. Recognition by this program is considered to be a high student honor; students can receive the honor twice during their academic career. The Commencement and student recognition coordinator is located in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, Atherton Union, Room 200.

Application Deadlines Fall Semester: August 16 Spring Semester: January 1 Summer Session: May 9 Summer Guest Student Students who are attending other collegiate institutions and wish to enroll at Butler as a summer guest student must submit to the Office of Registration and Records an application that can be found at www.butler.edu/registrar. Non-Degree to Degree-Seeking Status Students who have been attending Butler University in a non-degree capacity may apply for degree-seeking status by submitting an application for admission and following the guidelines listed in this Bulletin. Check with the Office of Admission or the Office of Registration and Records for the appropriate application dates. Graduate Studies Graduate Degree-Seeking Admission The following information generally is applicable to all graduate programs. For exceptions and special requirements, refer to the specific admission requirements by college. Admission is based upon undergraduate grades and other information, as may be required for a specific program. Some programs may require standardized test scores (e.g., GMAT, MAT, GRE, etc.) to be considered for graduate admission. These test scores are valid for five years. Prospective students may visit the departmental website of their respective programs to obtain more information regarding standardized test requirements and waivers. Students whose first language is not English must demonstrate English proficiency by taking either the TOEFL or IELTS exams. This requirement may be waived, however, if the student has already received a baccalaureate or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited university in the United States or other country in which English is the official language. Butler seniors desiring to take graduate courses may make special arrangements with the dean of the college in which the graduate degree is to be earned. Credit for such courses will not be recorded on a graduate record until the bachelor's degree is awarded and the student has been admitted to a graduate program. Note: Students must be degree-seeking MBA or MPAcc admits to be eligible to enroll in Lacy School of Business graduate-level courses. Students intending to work toward an advanced degree must satisfy the prerequisites for the program. If prerequisites are to be completed, the student may, under some circumstances, be admitted with a stipulation that the courses be completed satisfactorily. If not admitted, a student may, depending on the college, enroll as a non-degree student while completing the prerequisites. Graduate Non-Degree-Seeking Admission A person holding a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university who wishes to enroll in graduate courses at Butler University for purposes other than obtaining an advanced degree (e.g., for teacher licensure, to transfer to another institution, or for self-enrichment) may file a non-degree application. The application may be obtained and submitted online at www.butler.edu/apply. An official transcript with an attached baccalaureate degree posted must be mailed or electronically sent directly from the issuing institution to the Office of Admission to gradadmission@butler.edu. Applications and supporting materials must be received one week prior to the first day of the term. If a non-degree student chooses to enter a graduate degree program, the student must complete a graduate degree-seeking application and follow the application procedures for that graduate program. Check with the Office of Admission for exact dates. A maximum of 12 graduate credit hours completed as a non-degree student may be applied toward the selected degree program. Prospective students should check with individual colleges with regard to policies governing converting from non-degree to degree-seeking status. Applying for Graduate Admission Applications may be obtained on Butler's website. All candidates for admission to graduate programs must submit the following: Application for Graduate Admission. Official transcript from each college or university previously attended, which must be mailed or sent electronically directly from the issuing institution. International students must hold a degree from a school recognized by the government or education ministry within the country. International students also must provide official financial documentation, as required by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and the U.S. Department of State. Students whose first language is not English must meet a minimum level of proficiency in the English language and submit proof of this proficiency to the Office of Admission, unless they have already received a baccalaureate or equivalent degree from a regionally accredited university in the United States or other country in which English is the official language. Minimum English proficiency can be met by the following: TOEFL indicating a minimum score of 213 (computer-based test), 79 (internet-based test), or 550 (paper-based test); students not applying for the Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Science may choose to meet English proficiency by completing the IELTS with a score of 6.0. All application materials become the property of Butler University. Transcripts received from other institutions will not be returned to the student or released to another institution or third party. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 36 Renewed Enrollment\u2014Graduate Students See Other Admission Options/Renewed Enrollment section above for general information. In addition, students enrolled in a graduate program at Butler University 10 or more years previously, as well as students seeking enrollment into a new degree program or degree level, must submit a new degree-seeking application (see Applying for Graduate Admission) and meet current admission requirements. Only course work taken subsequent to the new admission will be counted toward degree requirements. All academic records, however, will be maintained so that the transcripts will reflect all of the studies and cumulative GPA undertaken at Butler University. Graduate Transfer Credit All work toward a graduate degree should be completed at Butler. However, under special circumstances and within certain limits, graduate work taken at a regionally accredited institution may be transferred and applied toward the degree. Note: Lacy School of Business graduate transfer credits must be from an AACSB-accredited institution. In order for credit to be transferred, a prospective student must receive a grade of A or B. All course work must be approved by the student's Butler University academic advisor. Subject to these restrictions, up to 9 semester hours may be transferred in 30-hour programs and up to 12 hours may be transferred in 36-hour and longer programs. The student should file a transfer credit form with the Office of Registration and Records for acceptance of transfer credits. Time Limitations Beginning at the time when their first graduate degree-applicable course is taken, students in 30-hour programs have five years to complete the degree requirements, and students in longer programs have seven years to complete the degree requirements. Degree Requirements Thesis/Project: Some graduate programs may require a thesis or scholarly project. Generally, 3 credit hours are allotted for a thesis/project, although 6-hour projects may be authorized. Regulations governing the preparation and submission of the thesis are available from the college in which the work is being done. If a comprehensive examination also is required, half of the exam is allotted for the thesis defense. Students may contact their respective graduate program to see if their specific program requires a thesis. GPA: Students must achieve a grade average of B or above in all graduate courses attempted. Courses in which a student earns a C-, D, or F will not be counted toward degree requirements. While grades below a C are not counted toward the completion of degree requirements, they are counted in determining the student's GPA. In no case may a student take more than 12 credit hours in excess of the degree requirements to satisfy the foregoing GPA requirement. Any graduate student\u2014whether degree-seeking or non-degree-seeking\u2014who fails to make satisfactory progress in the course work may be declared academically ineligible for additional enrollment. Student Status Full-time: An individual must take a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 credits of graduate-eligible courses per semester to be considered a full-time student. A petition can be filed for consideration of fewer credits for the final semester before graduation. International students with F1 visa status can be admitted for full-time status only. A maximum of four years is allowed to complete all the degree requirements. Part-time: Prospective students should contact their respective program to determine the feasibility of part-time enrollment for timely completion of the degree. Applicants must comply with all admission requirements. Professionals admitted in the program must take a minimum of 3 credit hours per semester and complete all degree requirements within a maximum of seven years, with the didactic course work being completed within five years of entry in the program. Research toward a thesis for the MS in pharmacy and health sciences program must be independent of research projects ongoing at the student's place of employment and be publishable under an affiliation with Butler University. Research must be conducted during the course of the program. Part-time students will not be eligible for any financial assistance from Butler University. The research advisor for the MS in pharmacy and health sciences program must be a full-time faculty member in the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Financial Assistance A limited number of stipends in the form of graduate assistantships will be provided to qualified full-time graduate students conducting research in College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences laboratories. Graduate assistants will be required to work up to 20 hours per week on campus on projects assigned by the director of the graduate program, subject to valid immigration status. A full-time student must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and show satisfactory progress in his or her research project to qualify for financial assistance. Stipends will be competitively awarded every year, with previous recipients given preference. Graduate assistantships will be limited to a two-year period for each recipient. Each student is required to pay regular tuition and maintain approved health insurance during the course of study. There is no assurance of financial assistance for any admitted applicant. The freedom to leave the program, for any reason and at any time, will be available to all students; however, untimely withdrawal from the program causes financial and emotional distress to the University community. Therefore, to protect the University's investment, it is the policy that any student accepting the stipend as graduate assistant is expected to complete the MS program. Any such student leaving the program prior to completion and without compelling reason will be required to pay back the full amount of the stipend that has been awarded by the University. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 37 Tuition and Fees Tuition, fees, and other charges paid by the student cover approximately 80 percent of the educational costs at Butler University. The University provides the remaining funds through income from its endowment and gifts from foundations, business and industry, alumni, and friends. Tuition and fee levels are set by the Butler University Board of Trustees and are subject to change by action of the Board. The college year consists of two semesters and a one-session summer school. The academic year includes the fall and spring semesters. The unit of instruction is the semester hour, which normally signifies one recitation a week throughout a semester or an equivalent.

Acceptance of Financial Responsibility Butler University policy requires all students to complete the Acceptance of Financial Responsibility statement, accessible via my.butler.edu (located under the Finance section in the Student Center). Acceptance is required prior to enrollment each semester. The Acceptance of Financial Responsibility statement outlines the student's responsibility for paying all expenses incurred, including any applicable penalties. Payment Terms Students who register through the early registration process for fall 2018 will receive an electronic billing statement (E-Bill), July 11, 2018, for tuition, fees, room, and board. (E-Bill notification is sent via a student's Butler email address.) Payment is due in full August 2, 2018, if the student is not enrolled in the Monthly Payment Plan for fall 2018. Students not enrolled in the Monthly Payment Plan who have not paid in full by the first day of classes will be assessed a monthly finance charge of 1.5 percent (18 percent APR). Course registration may also be cancelled. Students who register after their regular registration time frame will be required to pay all charges in full to receive grade or transcript information. If enrollment is added after the term or semester has ended, the student must pay for the course(s) before grade and/or transcript information will be released from the University. Monthly Payment Plan Option Butler University offers a payment plan that allows students and families to divide the semester charges (e.g., tuition, fees, room, board, etc.) into manageable monthly payments. There is a nominal participation fee of $25 (four payments). Further information regarding the 2018-2019 payment plan is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. A late fee of 1 percent of the past-due amount will be charged to your account if payment is not received by the due date on the E-Bill, or if the amount received is less than the payment indicated on your E-Bill. Payment plan participation may be jeopardized and discontinued after two missed payments or payments submitted that are less than the amount billed. If the payment plan is discontinued, the balance will accrue interest and will be due in full immediately. Students with past-due balances may also have classes cancelled. Individuals with past-due balances or poor payment histories with the University may be denied participation in the plan. E-Pay and E-Bill The Office of Student Accounts utilizes electronic billing (E-Bill) and electronic payment (E-Pay), for which information is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Payment is accepted electronically by check (no fee) or credit card. Credit card payments include a 2.75 percent nonrefundable convenience fee. MasterCard, Discover, American Express, and Visa are accepted. Note: The Office of Student Accounts also accepts paper checks, cash, money orders, and 529 savings plan distribution for payment. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 39 Prepaid Tuition The University provides a tuition prepayment plan, which guarantees a fixed tuition rate for all prepaid semesters. The prepaid tuition rates are based on the first term in which the student participates in the prepaid program. This program applies only to students enrolled on a full-time basis in an undergraduate degree program or the PharmD program. The prepayment plan does not apply to graduate programs and does not apply to summer tuition charges. Contact the Office of Student Accounts for contract and cost information. Federal Student Permissions Federal regulations require that Butler University apply federal (Title IV) financial aid funds first to \"allowable charges,\" which are tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board charges contracted with Butler University. To apply any remaining federal funds to miscellaneous charges (e.g., bookstore charges, parking fee, health services charges, traffic fines, interest charges), the University is required to obtain student authorization. If authorization is not received before financial aid funds post to the student account, the federal Title IV funds will not be applied to miscellaneous charges. This may result in an outstanding balance on the student account, resulting in late fees and services restricted until the outstanding balance is paid in full. Students may grant permission for federal Title IV funds to pay miscellaneous charges at my.butler.edu. Navigation instructions are available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Once federal student permission is granted, it continues to be valid for future years. The permission can be revoked only if the student submits a written request directly to the Office of Student Accounts. Tuition Refund Schedule The official schedule is available at www.butler.edu/student-accounts. Students should refer to the refund schedule prior to making any schedule changes. Also, it is critical for students receiving financial assistance from any aid program (University, federal, and/or state) to contact the Office of Financial Aid before changing enrollment. Contact the office of Student Accounts to obtain information about the Summer Tuition Refund Schedule. Withdrawals Students who fail to attend class and/or pay tuition charges are not considered withdrawn from the course(s). Withdrawals must be made through the advisor or dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. All past-due balances must be paid before a student will be permitted to enroll for a new semester/term. Butler University Return of Funds Procedures Federal regulations require that, as a part of an institution's Return of Funds Policy, an office or offices must be designated as the point of contact for students to begin the withdrawal process. The designated office(s) must document the date the student withdraws or otherwise provides official notification to the institution of the intent to withdraw. At Butler, the student's college dean's office is the designated office at which a student must withdraw. For medical withdrawals, the student should contact the Office of Student Affairs. The date of withdrawal will be utilized by the Office of Financial Aid in determining the amount of financial assistance that may be retained by the student, based upon the percentage of the enrollment period (semester) that the student completed to that point in time. In the case of a student who does not withdraw or otherwise notify Butler University of the intent to withdraw, the date used will be the midpoint of the payment period for which assistance was disbursed, unless the attendance records document an earlier or later date. Credit Balance Accounts The Office of Student Accounts requires students to complete a refund request form to receive a refund check for a credit balance on the account. However, if the credit on the account is due to federal (Title IV) financial aid funds, the Office of Student Accounts will issue a check automatically. If the credit balance is due to a federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), the refund check will be issued in the name of the parent borrower and mailed to the address on file for the PLUS borrower. If the student is anticipating a credit balance, it is recommended that a refund request form be completed regardless of funding sources. Refund checks are issued weekly while classes are in session. Forms must be submitted by end of day on Tuesday to receive a check on Friday. Refund checks are not issued when classes are not in session. Unpaid Items Charges A student who is past due in any debt to the University is not permitted to register in any school or college of the University and is not entitled to an official transcript, grade report, or diploma from the Office of Registration and Records until the indebtedness has been paid in full. Any check presented to the University that fails to clear the bank shall be subject to a nonrefundable $25 handling charge. If the check is for payment of a debt, it also will be considered as nonpayment. Any E-Check transaction that is rejected by either banking institution will be charged a nonrefundable returned E-Check fee of $25. Students may be assessed reasonable collections fees, attorney fees, and court costs without relief of evaluation and appraisement law to collect outstanding balances. When a student is in possession of University property or owes a particular department for charges not applied to the student account, the department may call for a hold to be placed on a student's record. The hold prevents the release of University records and future enrollment. This hold is removed upon confirmation from the requesting department. Delinquent Bill Accounts Students who have not met their financial obligations to Butler University will be refused grades, transcripts, and readmission. Delinquent accounts will be charged interest on the unpaid balance. Accounts that remain delinquent will be assigned to a collection agency. All costs of collection will be the responsibility of the student. Interest charges and collection fees will be charged to the student account. Outside Billing The University will bill a third party for tuition, room and board, and miscellaneous fees, provided that: 1) a voucher and/or written authorization is received by the Office of Student Accounts prior to the beginning of each semester; and 2) payment will be made on or before the first day of the semester. The University will not bill any employer or third party who pays upon completion of the course(s). Any balance remaining unpaid on the first day of the semester will be assessed a monthly finance charge of 1.5 percent (18 percent APR). If the third party will not pay the finance charge, the student will be responsible for Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 40 payment. Students will continue to receive a billing statement directly from Butler University until the account balance is paid in full. It is the responsibility of the student to contact the third-party payer to determine why a delay in payment has occurred. Business Services Check cashing: Up to $100 per day for enrolled students with a valid Butler I.D. during cashiering hours for the Office of Student Accounts. The University reserves the right to deny check-cashing privileges for students on financial hold or students with a history of returned checks with the University. The release of grades and/or transcripts will be prevented for any unpaid returned checks. Anyone with an unpaid returned check may lose check-cashing privileges. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 41 Financial Aid Butler University offers a variety of financial aid programs based on academic excellence, performance ability, and the family's ability to contribute. Financial aid may be offered in the form of scholarships, grants, student loans, and on-campus employment. Funding for these programs is provided by federal, state, and Butler University resources. Students who are seeking financial aid are encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1 each year and complete their financial aid file by May 1. Any application materials or documents submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by the student or on his or her behalf become the property of the University and a permanent record of the Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for compliance with federal, state, and University regulations and guidelines. Financial aid counselors are available at 317-940-8200, 877-940-8200 (toll-free), or finaid@butler.edu. Financial aid information is available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Butler University Gift Programs Butler University awards gift assistance through programs like the Academic Scholarship, Jordan College of the Arts Award, Athletic Grant in Aid, and Butler Grant. These awards are available for tuition only to full-time undergraduate students pursuing their first bachelor's degree, unless otherwise stated. Additional programs and details are available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Federal and State Grants Students who complete the FAFSA may be eligible for federal and state grants. Program details and application requirements are available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Loans Student loan programs are available for students who complete the FAFSA. Loans must be repaid and managed carefully. Additional information regarding loan programs is available at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Financial Aid and Study Abroad at Butler University Butler University is supportive of students who wish to study abroad. Butler University aid for tuition may be used in the full amount for overseas study in an approved exchange program. An approved non-exchange program is limited to 50 percent of the tuition award amounts for the first semester of overseas study and 25 percent of the tuition award amounts for the second semester of overseas study. Butler aid for tuition is eligible for only two semesters of overseas study. The full amount of federal and state awards (i.e., Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans) may be used for the study-abroad semester, depending upon the cost of the program. Butler aid for room and board cannot be used while abroad. Other Financial Aid and Loan Policies Leave of Absence Policy To reserve merit awards if you leave the University for personal reasons, you must request a leave of absence from the Office of Financial Aid. The written request must be submitted prior to the 10th day of the semester for which the leave is requested. If the Office of Financial Aid approves the leave of absence, the merit awards may be reserved for a maximum of two semesters. Personal reasons may include those that are medical, financial, or experiential; however, attendance at another university or college does not qualify. Outside Scholarships According to federal regulations, scholarships received from donors outside of Butler University are considered to be a resource available to meet your financial aid eligibility. As a financial aid recipient, a student must report all outside scholarships from sources other than the federal, state, and University programs. The policy for treatment of outside scholarships is at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require that all financial aid recipients make satisfactory academic progress toward a certificate or degree. The standards apply to all terms, regardless of whether or not the student received financial aid. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards can be found at www.butler.edu/financial-aid. In addition, students must meet the retention standards of the University as outlined in the Butler University Student Handbook. Special Circumstances If a significant loss of income is projected, resulting in circumstances that restrict your parents' ability to contribute to your education, write a letter explaining the circumstances, and the Office of Financial Aid will review your situation. Special circumstances are defined as situations that the family has minimal control over: death, disability, loss of income due to layoff, and unemployment. Voluntary circumstances are not eligible for consideration. Such voluntary items would include consumer debt, voluntary leave of employment, and loss of income due to change in job or school attendance. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 42 Withdrawal Before withdrawing from all classes, a student should visit the Office of Financial Aid. The University's refund policy is administered through the Office of Student Accounts. However, federal law dictates that the refund of financial aid is calculated based on days of attendance (earned aid), which can result in a balance owed to the University or to financial aid programs. Student Consumer Information The Student Consumer Information regulations of the U.S. Department of Education require universities to provide students with access to certain information to which they are entitled as consumers. This information is available at www.butler.edu/consumer-information. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 43 Academic Regulations and Definitions All undergraduate students are urged to review the Student Handbook, at www.butler.edu/student-handbook, which details the academic rules and regulations of the University. While academic advisors are available to help students plan their academic career, the Butler student is responsible for: Knowing and meeting degree requirements Consulting with an advisor prior to each registration period Enrolling in appropriate courses to ensure timely progress toward a degree Discussing issues related to academic performance The availability of an advisor does not relieve the student of the responsibility for knowing and following the published programs and policies. Each student should become an expert on the program being pursued, and on the regulations and procedures of the University. A student must maintain high standards of conduct to continue in and to be graduated from the University. Unit of Instruction The school year at Butler consists of two semesters approximately 15 weeks in length and a 14-week summer term. Each course carries an approved number of semester hour credits. A semester hour is generally equivalent to one lecture per week, or two or three hours of laboratory work per week. Most degree programs require an average of 16 semester hours each semester for eight semesters. Neither more nor less credit than the amount stated in the Registration and Records student information system is permitted in any course. Grading System Each student is expected to attend all class meetings in which he or she is enrolled. Being absent from class therefore may affect the final grade assigned for the course. Butler is on a 4.0 grading system. When a student completes a course, one of the following grades with the corresponding grade points will be assigned: A 4.00 grade points A- 3.67 grade points B+ 3.33 grade points B 3.00 grade points B- 2.67 grade points C+ 2.33 grade points C 2.00 grade points C- 1.67 grade points D+ 1.33 grade points D 1.00 grade points D- 0.67 grade points F 0.00 grade points The following grades are not computed in the grade point average (GPA): W\u2014Official withdrawal. Permitted through the 10th week of a fall or spring semester. Withdrawal deadlines for the summer term can be found at www.butler.edu/summer/registration. P\u2014Passing grade. Semester hours are counted as hours passed but are not used in computing the GPA. PV\u2014Pass with validation. Grade given in student-teaching classes to students who may be certified to teach. AUD\u2014Audited course. NC\u2014Enrollment in a course on a non-credit basis. A student may change from credit to non-credit in a course through the 10th week of a fall or spring semester. The instructor's signature is required. An instructor may change the non-credit grade to withdrawal if the student does not attend class. NR\u2014Grade not reported. I\u2014Incomplete grade. This grade may be assigned by an instructor when exceptional circumstances prevent a student's finishing all work required in a course. The \"I\" must be removed by the close of the semester after it was assigned. If the \"I\" is not removed within the stated time, or the student chooses to graduate without completing the class, the \"I\" will be changed to \"X.\" X\u2014Unredeemed incomplete grade. This indicates no credit earned, no hours attempted, and no grade points. T\u2014Transfer credit. Z\u2014Undergraduate course taken by a graduate student; no credit or grade points earned. Academic Standing A student's GPA is figured by dividing the total number of hours attempted into the total number of grade points earned. When a student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0, he or she is placed on academic probation. Excessive probation or continued probation without improvement can lead to the student being declared academically ineligible. Repeat Policy A student, with the approval of his or her advisor, may repeat a course one time that is not otherwise repeatable for credit. Upon completion of the subsequent attempt, only the second attempt will count in his or her GPA. When repeating a course, a student may not withdraw from the course or change the course credit registration to non-credit unless the student withdraws from the University. This policy shall apply only to courses taken at Butler. The same policy applies to graduate students. Independent Study Policy Not more than 6 hours of credit in independent study may be counted toward an undergraduate degree, except for students majoring in science, who may take a maximum of 9 hours of independent study. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 44 Dean's List Any degree-seeking undergraduate student earning at least 12 academic hours of graded credit in a given semester may be placed on the Dean's List of the college of enrollment if the semester GPA is in the top 20 percent of all eligible students in that college. Courses taken under the pass/fail option do not count toward 12 academic hours of graded credit. The Dean's List is calculated three weeks after the end of the semester. Classification of Students To attain a class standing, a student should have twice the number of grade points as hours attempted and have earned the following number of hours. Classifications are applicable to all colleges of the University. First-Year Student 0-28 hours Sophomore 29-58 hours Junior 59-90 hours Senior 91+ hours 5th Year Pharmacy 133-170 hours 6th Year Pharmacy 171+ hours Registration Each fall and spring semester, enrollment begins with a two-week rollout of individually assigned enrollment appointments through my.butler.edu. Registration remains open until the fifth day of class each semester. Students must meet with their advisor before registering. Registration in any course for credit or in any course under the pass/fail option, or any change involving the addition of a course, is not permitted after the published deadlines. If a student wishes to make a change in his or her registration, permission must be secured from a student's academic advisor and/or from the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. Permission also is required if a student intends a complete withdrawal from the University. A student may register for an independent study course with permission of the relevant department chair or dean.

Pass/Fail Option The University permits students to elect up to four courses from their total undergraduate degree for pass/fail credit. Courses offered only as pass/fail credit are not included in this total. Courses required for graduation by the University Core Curriculum, individual colleges or departments, or in the student's academic major or minor may not be taken as pass/fail. Students who have elected the pass/fail option earn credit and a \"pass\" grade for work equivalent to a D- or above. Courses taken for pass/fail do not count in the GPA if passed; if failed, they are counted as F. Upper-division courses (those numbered 300 and above) taken pass/fail shall count for upper-division credit if passed. A change from pass/fail to grade credit or from grade credit to pass/fail shall not be permitted after the last day noted in the academic calendar. Pass/fail is not available to graduate students as an option, but some courses in the Jordan College of the Arts are designated as pass/fail. Special Non-Credit During the fall and spring semesters, full-time undergraduate or graduate degree-seeking students may, with the approval of the department chair or dean whose subject matter is involved and if resources are available, register for a maximum of two courses per semester on a non-credit basis without additional tuition, with the exception of independent study and applied music (individual instruction) classes. Students should register for special non-credit courses at the end of the registration period. Student Social Security Numbers New students will receive a random student identifier when they are admitted that will be used as the student's I.D. The Social Security number is a secondary identifier for all students. In accordance with federal and state law, students have the right to refuse disclosure of the Social Security number. Final Year of Academic Residence Normally, a student is expected to take his or her final 30 hours of academic work at Butler University; however, the dean of the college concerned may, for reasons deemed valid, allow intrusions up to 30 semester hours if the student has completed at least 64 semester hours at Butler with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. Graduation The student must submit an application for graduation through my.butler by the specific dates as published in the academic calendar. In the year in which the degree is awarded, candidates are expected to attend the Commencement exercises in academic costume. If a student finds it necessary to have the degree conferred in absentia, he or she must notify the Office of Registration and Records at least two weeks before the Commencement exercises. If the petition is approved, the diploma may be picked up several days after the Commencement exercises or the student may contact Registration and Records to make arrangements to have the diploma mailed. No diploma will be released before the date of graduation. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 45 Graduation with Major in Two Colleges Majors may be obtained in two colleges of the University through the secondary major program.

Poor, PhD, Associate Dean for Student Affairs College Website www.butler.edu/las The power, importance, and centrality of the liberal arts are affirmed daily in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS). The College offers 33 majors and 33 minors across 12 departments and four programs in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Students in the College are encouraged and expected to explore different ways of understanding the world, to experience cultures diverse from their own, to practice critical thinking, to appreciate the value of and joy associated with learning, and to recognize the power their education provides them for personal gain and social change. A liberal arts degree from Butler positions students to do almost anything with their lives beyond Butler and to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of those with whom they interact. We work on a daily basis to strengthen ties between students and faculty members. Students and their faculty mentors work closely together both in and out of the classroom. They conduct collaborative research projects, make joint presentations at professional meetings, and publish the results of their work in the literature of their disciplines. They talk about ideas, the future, and the world. And they very frequently remain in touch long after graduation. We also believe that learning takes place in many settings in addition to the classroom. Students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences participate in internships in Indianapolis and around the world, and they regularly study abroad and in various field locations. Core Values of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences The liberal arts' basic and historic purpose is at once to teach us to think for ourselves, to act wisely and well in the world, and to undertake occupations useful to ourselves and others. Liberal arts education seeks ultimately to open us to the human condition in its pains and joys, thereby to nurture our personal integrity, and to foster in us compassion and respect for those whose lives we share in our own communities and around the world. Liberal arts education rests on a paradox: thinking soundly for oneself means first listening carefully to the thoughts of others. The liberal arts urge us to cultivate ourselves through the consciousness of others; careful attention to their ideas and actions help us refine our own. Liberal arts education is pluralistic. It is composed of many voices, each appropriate to time and place, some discordant, none absolute. It seeks to develop in us wit to judge which skills are appropriate at which times. Liberal arts education is restless. It takes nothing for granted. Its characteristic activity is not uncritical assent but critical judgment. It scrutinizes sacred truths of every sort. The liberal arts develop not only critical but also creative skills, not only rational analysis but also creative expression. They seek to develop and realize the fullness of the human personality. Their exercise aims as well at preparing students to educate themselves long after they have left formal school. Liberal arts education is meant to train its students for public responsibility, not just private good. A liberal arts education is as much about the journey as the destination. It takes as much delight in the minute-by-minute quirks of learning as in the fulfillment of distant goals. It balances the will to know with empathy and wonderment. The Latin word \"ars\" means at once skill, knowledge, and practice. A liberal arts education begins with the skills of language and thought. It teaches us to read well; to listen well; to write clear, concise prose; to speak privately in conversation, publicly in discussion, and formally in speeches; to judge one's audience and regard one's own words through the eyes and ears of others; to learn proper ways of integrating and citing the words and thoughts of others into one's own work; to do these things reasonably well in languages and worldviews other than our own. It teaches us to set out a case or hypothesis or argument; to evaluate the rigor of others' arguments; to find and judge information in libraries, on the internet, and in other repositories. It teaches us modes of ascertaining truth and falsehood; resourcefulness appropriate to moral and aesthetic judgment; methods of logical, experimental, scientific, mathematical, and statistical reasoning. These skills allow us to tackle and solve increasingly difficult and challenging problems, appreciate sources of bias and means of overcoming them, and entertain arguments from dissonant points of view. They develop in us a sense of subtlety, depth, and complexity. A liberal arts education sees the cultivation of these skills not only as an end in itself but also as a preparation for the pursuit of knowledge and the other purposes of human life. The Chinese I Ching (Book of Changes) well captures a fundamental quality of liberal arts education when it intimates that knowledge and practice cannot be mastered until they have been regarded from different perspectives. As students of the liberal arts, we cultivate as fully as possible the legacy of human thought, imagination, creativity, and research; observe nature; confront and evaluate important theories that shape our understanding of the world and how to care for it; figure out how societies, our own and those of others, work and can be improved; weigh the costs and benefits of modern human life to the individual and the planet; seek to grasp and reduce the sources of human hatred and conflict; aim to understand and strengthen what inspires human cooperation; explore the workings of the human mind and body; unknot claims of teachers, politicians, advertisers, scientists, preachers, columnists, and your roommate; ponder history from the earliest epochs to the unfolding present; investigate the mechanisms of the cosmos, from the atom to the stars; delve into the past experiences of our own and other societies, as well as the current news; make ourselves at home in other cultures; make those from other cultures at home among ourselves; see the interplay between our beliefs about the natural world and our beliefs about religion, politics, and culture; search out purpose, ponder the meaning of life, scrutinize the human heart, and weigh conscience; discover the sweep of living systems, from microbes to biomes; learn to account for ourselves in a moral world that is neither black nor white; engage in a careful search for truth; know the ways of money and the nature of work; wrestle with ideas about God; fathom the relations between technology and human life; raise children\u2014our own and those of others; consider the well-being of future generations; appreciate the beauty and uses of mathematics; forge agreements with loved ones, friends, and enemies; and engage ourselves in the principles, purposes, and practice of public life. As students of the liberal arts, we do these things as part of a community with venerable roots\u2014a community still evolving in space and time, a community of thought, imagination, value, labor, and action.

Biological Sciences Administration Travis J. Ryan, PhD, Department Chair Professors Travis J. Ryan, PhD; Carmen M. Salsbury, PhD Associate Professors Shelley Etnier, PhD; Jennifer R. Kowalski, PhD; Katherine M. Stoehr, PhD; J. Villani, PhD Assistant Professors Sean T. Berthrong, PhD; Emily L. Gillespie, PhD; Stobart, PhD Instructors Julia Angstmann, PhD, Director, Center for Urban Ecology; McKenzie Beverage, Gerecke, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/biology Why Study Biology? Biology is the study of living things, including plants, animals, and microbes. A major in biology will provide you with a broad education in the biological sciences, exposing you to many different facets of this diverse science. Biological sciences is a liberal arts major, and therefore it is largely about teaching students how to learn and think about the world. Students will develop an understanding of the scientific method, a process that develops analysis and reasoning skills. Students will learn to think logically, for example, by designing and following an experiment through to its conclusion and analyzing the results. Many students do not realize the amount of creative thinking and problem-solving skills that also go into biology; these will be developed as well. Biology majors also have the opportunity to hone their communication skills, both oral and written, as they present the results of their experiments. While many of these skills are emphasized in the classroom, independent research projects with faculty members and external internships afford many students the opportunity to apply these skills to real questions and problems. A biology degree is versatile. While many students major in biology as a precursor to medical or dental school, there are a number of other fields that students may pursue as well. Students may go on to work as lab technicians at hospitals, or at the state crime lab; others may go on to teach at the primary, secondary, or college level. Many choose to pursue environmental careers, such as working in forestry or parks, or even as an environmental lobbyist. Many biology majors choose to go on to graduate school, where they pursue research in genetics, ecology, cell biology, medical research, or any other of the wide variety of fields in biology. Many other career opportunities are available in biomedical research, agriculture, and environmental management, among other fields. Why Study Biology at Butler? The Department of Biological Sciences offers a curriculum emphasizing broad training in biology as the key to success in graduate school, professional school, teacher education, and technical careers. The major is built upon a strong foundation of core courses in the liberal arts, general biology courses, and biology electives to meet student interests. Students studying science should be exposed early and often to the methods of discovery, inquiry, and problem solving used by scientists to explain the natural world. Our faculty members are familiar with these methods as we apply them in our individual research programs, and we strive to develop such capabilities in our students. Therefore, we give our students opportunities to actively use the tools of scientific investigation in the lab and the field through a variety of courses at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels of biological organization. Personalized attention is an important aspect of studying biology at Butler. Our biology class sizes are small relative to those at many institutions; even most of our introductory classes typically have fewer than 30 students, and many upper-level courses have fewer than 20 students. Classes are thus interactive Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 51 learning environments that foster not only hands-on scientific inquiry skills but also communication and critical-thinking skills that serve students well no matter what professional path they may choose after graduation. The low student-to-faculty ratio also provides opportunities for students to gain more intensive experiences through independent study with a faculty mentor. During the academic year, students are welcome to register for research credits. Another popular option, the Butler Summer Institute, is a nine-week program in which participants undertake independent projects they design with a faculty mentor. Student research is frequently showcased during the annual Butler Undergraduate Research Conference, which attracts college students throughout the Midwest each spring to present their research results to their peers. Students may also apply for funds to travel to other regional or national meetings via the Holcomb Undergraduate Grants program. Finally, students often coauthor papers with faculty members for publication in professional journals or presentation at conferences. For example, recent joint student-faculty articles have been published in Biochemical Genetics, Evolution, Journal of Experimental Biology, Journal of Herpetology, Urban Ecosystems, and Animal Behavior. Students studying biology at Butler also have opportunities for off-campus study, internships, and career exploration through special affiliated programs. For example, the Center for Urban Ecology educates and engages Butler students and citizens in the local community about the discipline of urban ecology and aims to create \"citizen scientists\" dedicated to continued stewardship of the natural world. Students can attend workshops, take classes, devise independent research projects, or participate in internship opportunities in ecology and environmental topics. Another option, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama, is dedicated to understanding tropical biodiversity. The Butler-STRI partnership includes opportunities for students to serve as paid interns in Panama for existing research projects conducted by STRI scientists and for students to engage in new research initiatives with Butler faculty in Panama. Further, the partnership includes two field-based courses taught on site in Panama by Butler biology faculty. Students may also want to apply for biology internships, which are available throughout Indianapolis, the state of Indiana, and surrounding states. Some students choose a major in biology as a gateway toward a career in health-related fields. Butler students who have qualified themselves with outstanding academic performance in the major have had great success in entering professional schools in medicine, dentistry, optometry, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine. Students receive individual advising by faculty on the selection of courses that will both satisfy the minimum entrance requirements and prepare them well for the professional school of their choice. In addition, the pre-professional school advising area within the Center for High Achievement and Scholarly Engagement plans cocurricular activities, maintains a reference library of useful publications, and coordinates the application process. Biology Student Learning Outcomes We expect that students will be able to show mastery of various types of learning during their progression through different types of courses in the major. By the time they complete the biology major, students should be able to: Demonstrate content knowledge and proficiency in using and explaining techniques essential to the study of fundamental areas of biology: genetics, cellular and molecular biology, and ecology and evolutionary biology Use and apply scientific literature properly to ask and answer questions in the biological sciences Design experiments and collect, analyze, and interpret data using graphical and statistical analyses, in order to evaluate hypotheses Communicate scientific ideas, concepts, and findings through writing and speaking Apply scientific findings to relevant societal issues Degree Programs Major in Biology (BS, BA) Minor in Biology Requirements for the Major A total of 37 credit hours in biology are required. All first-year students must complete BI111 (Contemporary Issues in Biology) and the three fundamentals courses, which consist of BI210 (Genetics\u2014Fundamentals), BI220 (Cellular and Molecular Biology\u2014Fundamentals), and BI230 (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\u2014Fundamentals). BI230 is a prerequisite for all BI courses numbered 300 and higher. All students must also complete BI299\u2014Biology Seminar in the spring semester of their second year in the major. To acquire the remaining credit hours for the major, students must take biology electives at the 300 level or above; at least four of these electives must be lab courses. One of the electives must be an organism-based course chosen from the following: BI301, BI302, BI311, or BI438 (indicated with an asterisk below). All senior biology majors must complete BI480 (Biology Capstone). In addition, all biology majors must take general chemistry (CH105-106 or CH107). Note: BI325, Principles of Pathogenic Microbiology, cannot be counted toward the 37-hour minimum required for the biology major. Students are allowed to use a maximum of 3 hours of independent study credit, internship credit, research, or honors thesis credit toward the 37-hour minimum required for the biology major. Students must earn a grade of C- or better in all prerequisite courses as well as in all required courses for the major.

Chemistry is often referred to as the \"central science.\" It plays a role in the discovery of better medicines, in the development of safer chemicals for household use, and in the development of the next generation of electronic gadgets. An essential aspect of chemistry is the necessity of doing these things in a sustainable manner. The study of chemistry or biochemistry will do more than just impart technical knowledge, ideas, and techniques useful in a laboratory setting. It will allow for experiences that will develop problem-solving abilities and critical-thinking skills. Class and conference presentations, poster sessions, and lab reports will help develop proficiency in communicating in a variety of settings. The skills gained can be applied not just to careers in chemistry, but also to careers in healthcare, law, business, and education, and to the pursuit of advanced degrees in a variety of fields. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 56 Why Study Chemistry or Biochemistry at Butler? The faculty and staff are dedicated to providing a supportive yet challenging environment for students interested in studying chemistry or biochemistry at the undergraduate level. The curriculum is designed to prepare students for the evolving nature of the chemical sciences. Students are encouraged to pursue undergraduate research with faculty whose expertise spans a wide range of chemistry subdisciplines. Throughout the curriculum, departmental poster sessions, weekly seminars, and project-driven laboratories encourage interaction between students and faculty during and outside class. Chemistry and Biochemistry Student Learning Outcomes Understand key concepts related to the physical and chemical properties of matter Communicate within and outside the chemical discipline Develop problem-solving skills through experimentation and analysis Appreciate the relationships among integrity, science, and society Demonstrate knowledge of and use of appropriate safety protocols in laboratory settings Degree Programs Major in Chemistry (BS, BA) Major in Biochemistry (BS, BA) Minor in Chemistry All primary chemistry and biochemistry majors should aspire to complete the American Chemical Society accredited major. As the most prestigious and most comprehensive option, it will provide flexible career options after graduation. In addition to the ACS-accredited major, there are three additional options. For those interested in pursuing careers in biochemistry, the biochemistry major provides a strong background in chemistry and biochemistry as well as the opportunity to explore advanced courses in biology. For students who are interested in chemistry as a path to a professional program and who will earn another major or a minor, the Honors major is an option that provides a strong foundation in chemistry and teaches skills that will apply toward many careers. It does not provide as much in-depth work in chemistry as the ACS-accredited degree. If you are pursuing chemistry as a secondary major, the chemistry major is also an option. You cannot major in both chemistry and biochemistry.

Economics provides you with problem-solving and data-gathering skills to make informed decisions in a variety of settings, e.g., government, law, finance, business, and journalism; and for a variety of job responsibilities\u2014from college intern to a newly hired bank credit analyst at one end of the spectrum, to U.S. senator, Supreme Court justice, or CEO of a successful business on the other. Besides being a strong major in its own right, economics is a nice complement for students who have interests in philosophy, political science, sociology, history, mathematics, psychology, foreign languages, engineering, and English. Indeed, the Nobel Prize in Economics is often awarded to economists who also have a keen interest in one of the above areas. Why Study Economics at Butler? You can study economics as a major in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and also as a major in the Lacy School of Business. The student in Liberal Arts and Sciences may have a given career path in mind but often does not. He or she knows that economics offers an array of opportunities and takes economics to learn critical-thinking skills and about the dynamic economic environment in which we live. The career choice will follow. The same applies to a student who majors in the Lacy School of Business, but the career choice in that case is more targeted to the business sector. The economics courses taken in either college are the same; the courses outside of economics, though, are different between the two colleges. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 66 Economics Student Learning Outcomes Students will learn and discuss issues such as how the Federal Reserve creates money and influences interest rates domestically and around the world, why the euro changes in value against the dollar, and the reason behind Zimbabwe's inflation. You'll learn about the \"Wealth of Nations\" from rich countries (e.g., the United States) to poor ones (e.g., Bangladesh), about growing countries (e.g., China) and countries transitioning to capitalism (e.g., Russia). You'll learn about the invisible hand of the market and the different roles of government in a mixed economy. The tools in addressing these questions include supply and demand, international trade and exchange rate determination, monetary and fiscal policy, market structure, and statistical relationships.

The course is crossdisciplinary and will get into issues of science, social science, ethics, and economics. Historically, environmental and social impacts have been considered, if at all, as costs to be ignored, minimized, or externalized as much as possible. This new body of thought argues that environmental quality and social performance should be integrated into institutional strategy. This course will introduce students to economic and ethical analysis to help them have appropriate bases for making judgments. The course will then explore the challenge of minimizing environmental and social impacts.

Kirsch, PhD, Program Director; Jessica R. McCormick, MST, Academic Program Coordinator and Advisor Program Website www.butler.edu/engineering The Engineering Dual Degree Program (EDDP) is a partnership between the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler University and the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis. Through this five-year undergraduate program, students can earn two degrees: a degree in engineering from Purdue University along with a degree from Butler University in one or more of the following disciplines: the natural sciences (astronomy/astrophysics, biology, chemistry, environmental studies, or physics); computer science; economics; mathematics; or science, technology, and society. Application for the EDDP is through Butler University, as well as student enrollment and residence for the duration of the program. Why Study Engineering at Butler? Two universities. Two degrees. One program. The EDDP provides a student with the opportunity for a diverse, creative, professional, technical, and liberal educational experience occurring through two quality, neighboring universities. Students have access to engineering degrees that are ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) accredited and Butler University majors that rest upon a strong tradition of professional and liberal education. Our curriculum is integrated throughout the entire program. Most engineering courses are taught at Butler for the first three years of the program, with courses taken at both campuses (a five-mile commute) during the last two years. Students receive individualized academic support and regularly graduate with their two degrees in five years. Career services are available to EDDP students through Butler University, the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis, and Purdue University at West Lafayette. One internship is required, which is typically completed during the summer; however, many students complete more than one or complement their internship with a research experience. Students have diverse educational experiences that lead to a wide range of career opportunities with a highly successful placement rate for graduates. EDDP students select a major from both institutions.

Our students learn to discuss and write critically about the many ways literature and language have influenced the values and lived experiences of societies over centuries, among genders and classes, races and ethnicities, and across geographical boundaries. When English majors head out into the world, we expect that they will carry with them a passion for reading and writing, and a commitment to use language clearly, purposefully, and with sophistication and elegance. Why Study English at Butler? The English Department at Butler University balances the study of traditional fields of English and American literature with a commitment to interdisciplinary work, involving contemporary fields such as gender and sexuality, film studies, comparative literature, cultural studies, rhetoric of science, and creative writing. Our full-time faculty includes formalists and theorists, cultural historians and rhetoricians, and novelists and poets. Our course offerings reflect diversity: students can choose a traditional literature major, or a major with a concentration in creative writing; literary theory, culture, and criticism; or public and professional writing. In each case, students will find small classes, dedicated teachers, and an active and engaged group of fellow students. Butler's English Department is home to one of the country's most important Visiting Writers Series, which encourages a sense of literary and creative community that goes beyond the classroom. Recent visitors to the series have included Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Russo, Yusef Kumonyaaka, Elmore Leonard, Jorie Graham, and Junot Diaz. The popular Visiting Writers Series course offers students the chance to meet and talk to many of these writers. The department's secondary programs also extend the opportunities for our majors, including summer study abroad programs in England, Ireland, and Scotland, a city-wide creative writing camp, a large peer-tutoring program where students help students across the University with their writing, an award-winning Writing in the Schools service-learning initiative, and an internship program where students gain experience in classrooms, pressrooms, and in small and large businesses. English Student Learning Outcomes Our students graduate as incisive readers, cogent thinkers, and powerful writers, well prepared for any profession requiring a rigorous understanding and mastery of language. Because of their exposure to a vast array of human experiences in literature, English majors are more likely to be able to listen to the voices of opposition and disagreement; to accept the persistence in the world of ambiguity and complexity without resorting to facile simplification, clich\u00e9, or stereotypes; to consider evidence rather than rush to judgment; and to react to human dilemmas and suffering with compassion. English majors also carry with them a lasting ability to take informed pleasure in all forms of literature and creative production. We believe that the education our majors gain as readers and writers is invaluable whether they work in education, the legal field, the arts, electronic communication, publishing, business, the nonprofit sector, government, or other careers.

In required courses, students analyze gender and sexuality from a variety of academic fields, and they explore the theoretical and historical basis of such study. Upper-division electives are chosen from at least three disciplines, allowing students to pursue their inquiries in more depth without narrowing their focus to a single field. Internships provide students with the option to apply theoretical knowledge to work and/or community-based learning opportunities. Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies is an excellent complement to all majors at Butler University, regardless of whether the student plans to attend graduate school or seek employment immediately after graduation. For students interested in graduate school, Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies provides a strong foundation in women's and gender studies, as well as for advanced work in any academic discipline that lends itself to gender critique. For students interested in entering the workforce, Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies students are well equipped to work in a diverse and multicultural world, an attribute today's employers are seeking in a variety of professions and occupations, including public administration, social services, business, the arts, law, medicine, social work, anthropology, journalism, media, and criminology.

Butler is singular among American universities in knitting these three disciplines into a working organism. Prospective majors in both history and anthropology take a first-year course together, introducing them to each other and to the disciplines in their departments, thus offering all the advantages of self-standing disciplines and interdisciplinary approaches. Members of the department offer expertise in wide-ranging areas of the world: the United States, Latin America, East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Within these areas we offer courses on the fundamental conditions that shape human life past and present: citizenship, politics, peace and war, gender, race, class, sexuality, language, economics, religion, and thought. The department offers a small student-faculty ratio, individual attention, and abundant opportunities for undergraduate research. Most of our students also study away from Butler, either abroad or in Washington, DC, offering them a taste of this increasingly global world we inhabit. Why Study Anthropology? Anthropology explores the human condition, appreciating humans and human practices holistically. We focus on cultural anthropology and research methods critical to understanding the complexities of the modern world. Our graduates enter a wide range of careers\u2014including field archaeology, social work, law, public health, and library sciences\u2014as well as top-level graduate programs. By producing original work through course research assignments, and possibly self-designed honors thesis projects, students learn how to think critically and write effectively. They leave our program equipped to carefully investigate issues and creatively solve problems on their own\u2014essential skills for any future career direction. Why Study History? History explores the human condition throughout the world from earliest time to the present moment. Through course work and individualized projects, students will learn how to contextualize and investigate past events and understand their relevance for the present as well as the future. With a minimum of prescribed courses, our curriculum allows you to follow your curiosity and feel free to discover through a myriad of course offerings the unfolding of past events and the processes of history making that are such a central component of the human condition. By producing original work through course research assignments, and possibly self-designed honors thesis projects, students learn how to think critically and write effectively. They leave our program equipped to carefully investigate issues and creatively solve problems on their own\u2014essential skills for any future career direction. Why Study Geography? Cultural geography brings together history, culture, and spatial patterning, and reinforces the message of both history and anthropology in a common department. Geography at Butler starts by studying Indianapolis, then moves outward to Indiana, the United States, and the world. These courses are generally valuable, but particularly so for students preparing to teach social studies in secondary school. Anthropology and History at Butler Small class size and student-faculty ratio, guaranteeing one-on-one attention, mentoring, and guidance to all majors and minors. Unique partnership between history and anthropology, providing cutting-edge training in theory and methodology that binds the two disciplines. Access and connections to premier area museums, regional historic sites, archival collections, archaeological field sites, and community cultural groups. Extensive internship, employment, and study-abroad opportunities. Guest lectures, site visits, and numerous other means to meet professionals in the field. Opportunities to do independent research projects, participate in the Butler Summer Institute and other funded research possibilities, produce honors theses, and attend regional and national conferences. Anthropology Student Learning Outcomes The anthropology program seeks to teach students to think for themselves, appreciate human and cultural differences, and master the basic tools necessary for understanding those differences. They learn to employ the ethnographic method, understand issues from a diversity of viewpoints, and ready themselves for responsible citizenship. More specifically, we seek to teach students the characteristic methods of anthropology and the basic range of anthropological theories, to analyze evidence and develop arguments, incorporate the views of other people into their projects, understand issues in all their complexity rather than oversimplify them, and share their ideas and research effectively. History Student Learning Outcomes The history program seeks to teach students to think for themselves independently and critically, master the history of one part of the world, apply the past to understand the present, appreciate those who are different from themselves, appreciate academic and civil discourse, and ready themselves for responsible citizenship. More specifically, we seek to teach students the characteristic methods of history and the basic range of historical theories, to analyze evidence and develop arguments, conduct historical research, incorporate the views of other people into their projects, look at problems from a variety of perspectives, and share their ideas and research in proper form.

The history of Latin America abounds with examples of illustrious and controversial women, yet the general perception of Latin America is of lands populated by machos. The history of the area\u2014as elsewhere\u2014usually concentrates on the actions of men without examining why and forgets the feats of women as well as the importance of gender and sexuality, which has remained a \"hidden history.\" In this course we will uncover that hidden history by examining changing ideas of both femininity and masculinity in Latin America from the start of colonialism until recent times. (U)(3) Occasionally TI234-HST, Reel America\u2014Film and the American Experience, 1890-1965: Famed film director Sydney Pollack said of film, \"It's the 20th century's real art form.\" This has been particularly true in the United States, where film has been an important means of transmitting definitions about American values and identity.

(G)(3) Individualized Major Program Administration Stuart Glennan, PhD, Chairperson, LAS Individualized Majors Program Committee Program Website www.butler.edu/individualized-majors Individualized majors meet the needs of students whose primary academic interests cut across traditional academic disciplines. This program allows students who have shown interest in crossdisciplinary work to design their own majors. The purpose of the individualized major program (IMP) is to provide an option to study a crossdisciplinary topic in depth, not to constitute a general-studies option or to replace a double major. The IMP may appeal to nontraditional and returning students as well as to students who have completed an associate degree and wish to complete a bachelor's degree with a different focus than their associate degree. Recent IMP students have graduated in Chinese language and culture, ancient Egyptian language and culture (Egyptology), music business, and medical illustration. Requirements The IMP consists of at least 36 hours of course work, which must form a coherent whole. This may include work taken at other colleges, including work taken through the Consortium for Urban Education interchange in Indianapolis. All normal Core Curriculum and LAS College requirements must be met. In LAS, the same course cannot be counted toward two different majors. The proposed program should include an experience beyond the normal classroom-based course, such as an internship, a semester of study abroad, an honors or departmental thesis, a senior seminar in a relevant department, or a service-learning project in the junior or senior year. Because each IMP is unique, there is no fixed list or sequence of courses for the major. Admission A student should submit to the IMP committee through its chairperson a proposal for an IMP anytime between the beginning of the sophomore year and the end of the fall semester of the junior year. In general, this application will include a general statement that describes the nature of the proposed IMP, how this IMP relates to the student's goals, and why these goals can better be pursued as an IMP rather than within a traditional major or double major. The proposal also should demonstrate the coherence and integrity of the proposed IMP, show that course resources are available to support the IMP (including courses to be taken outside of Butler), and provide evidence that the student has the motivation and initiative to carry out the IMP. The student should also recruit an advisor for the IMP and provide a detailed list of courses, which will constitute the major (subject to revision each year due to changes in available courses relevant to the IMP). The IMP committee will evaluate the proposal and decide whether to approve it. More information and the proposal application can be found at the program website.

Krohn, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/math-actuarial The department offers both majors and minors in the disciplines of mathematics and actuarial science, and a major in statistics. In addition to the departmental requirements listed below, a student must complete the Core Curriculum requirement, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences language requirement, and other general requirements listed in this Bulletin. A bachelor of science degree is also available in natural science and mathematics or in natural science and actuarial science for majors who complete a total of at least 60 credits combined from the two chosen areas. Why Study Mathematics? The mathematics major is well suited to and designed for students who are interested in gaining employment in government or industry jobs that require problem-solving skills, attending graduate or professional school, or teaching in secondary schools. Why Study Mathematics at Butler? The department faculty provides a personal education in a close-knit community. Students and faculty members know one another in supportive, professional relationships, and faculty members care about their students and their success and know every student by name. All of the department's classes are small\u2014fewer than 30 students in each one, including introductory-level courses. Every course is taught by faculty members with advanced degrees and with a wide range of specialties in the different mathematical subfields, and there are no graduate students teaching departmental classes. In these ways, the department offers a consistently student-oriented education. The department's curriculum is top-rated in quality. It adheres to the Mathematics Association of America's Committee for Undergraduate Program in Mathematics guidelines\u2014one of the few collegiate mathematics departments in the United States to commit enough teaching resources to do so. The Butler mathematics major is a wonderful choice for a strong investment in any student's future. Department professors are available to students. Each one maintains office hours\u2014no appointment necessary. The department's office doors are open every single workday. Faculty members support each other, and students may talk with any faculty member to get help needed. The department's Mathematics Tutoring Lab hires mathematics and mathematics education majors to provide support to students enrolled in lower-level and core mathematics classes\u2014at no charge. Mathematics faculty members are always open to sponsoring student/professor collaborative research for the department's majors, such as in the Butler Summer Institute. Dual degrees are available in engineering through a partnership with the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology at Indianapolis (IUPUI). In that program, a student earns degrees in two majors\u2014for example, mathematics (from Butler) and engineering (from Purdue). (See Engineering Dual Degree Program\u2014EDDP.) Degree Programs Actuarial Science (BA, BS) Mathematics (BA, BS) Statistics (BA, BS) Minor in Actuarial Science Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 94 Minor in Mathematics Mathematics Student Learning Outcomes Our graduates are problem solvers with a broad knowledge of mathematical subfields. They are extraordinarily strong at thinking about and proving abstract mathematical statements, and they communicate mathematical solutions and concepts clearly and effectively. Butler mathematics majors carry with them an ability to understand mathematical arguments and assess their validity. They can identify the fundamental concepts in the main areas of mathematics, including set theory, logic, calculus, discrete mathematics, linear and modern algebra, and real and complex analysis. They can construct mathematical proofs using standard techniques such as induction, contradiction, and contraposition, and they can solve mathematical problems by applying abstract theory and/or mathematical models as appropriate. Our graduates communicate well to various audiences\u2014to individuals who might be trained in mathematics and to those who are not. This ability includes the use of mathematical word-processing systems to write mathematics. In these many ways, our majors understand various interconnections among the branches of mathematics, the discipline's breadth and depth, and its beauty. Requirements for the Major MA106, MA107, MA208, Calculus and Analytic Geometry I, II, III MA108, First-Year Problem Solving (or MA308, Problem Seminar) MA200, Basics of Advanced Mathematics MA205, MA215, Linear MA312, Algebra: Groups MA326, Analysis: Theory MA330, Complex Analysis Choice of either MA313, Algebra: or MA327, numbered between MA310 and MA399, or MA473 Requirements for the Minor MA106, MA107, Calculus and Analytic Geometry I, II MA200, Basics of Advanced Mathematics MA205, Discrete Mathematics Choice of either MA305, Graph Theory, or MA208, Calculus and Analytic Geometry III MA215, Linear Algebra One additional upper-division elective to be chosen from MA301, MA305, courses numbered between MA310 and MA399, or MA473 Why Study Actuarial Science? An actuary is a mathematician responsible for estimating risks, primarily in the insurance and financial security industries. The Butler program prepares each student in the major for a successful career as an actuary, as well as for the professional examinations of the Society of Actuaries and Casualty Actuary Society. Why Study Actuarial Science at Butler? Butler is one of only a few institutions in Indiana to offer an undergraduate degree in actuarial science. The department additionally offers a combined actuarial science/management curricular option, in which students can earn both an actuarial science undergraduate degree and an MBA degree. The department has a very active student club in actuarial science. It also works with a departmental board of advisors for actuarial science, whose members are alumni who work with the department faculty and student majors. For example, they often offer advice for the program and support departmental efforts to help students find internships and jobs. Each year, upper-level actuarial science major courses give students a chance to see, from a faculty member who can provide an industry point of view, how classroom ideas and issues arise naturally in the workplace. The actuarial science curriculum prepares students to take as many as three or four actuarial science examinations while still a student at Butler, giving them a jump-start on their career. Actuarial Science Student Learning Outcomes Our graduates enter the job market with a strong working knowledge of the basic concepts and theories of actuarial science. They are qualified to sit for the Society of Actuaries. These actuarial science majors can solve insurance and financial problems related to risk assessment, and they know how to perform related calculations in applications of standard actuarial methods. Finally, they are able to communicate sophisticated quantitative analysis clearly and correctly to various audiences in both written and spoken presentations. In this way, our actuarial science majors are well prepared to take leadership roles in businesses that require risk-management services.

The actuarial science/management program gives its enrolled students capability in this blend of skills and training. Our graduates are able to command excellent entry-level positions and are strong candidates for fast advancement to upper-level management positions. The actuarial science/management program includes an undergraduate major in actuarial science with a strong component of business theory, followed by a 33-hour MBA program. Enrolled students may choose their graduate courses to gain a concentration in either organizational leadership or finance.

Why Study Statistics? A statistician can analyze data in a way that provides powerful conclusions, based on inductive reasoning, about truths in the world around us. The Butler program prepares each major for a successful career as a statistician, which is one of the corporate world's most heavily recruited professionals. Our majors learn how to determine which statistical procedure to apply to a given study in the real world, the mathematics behind why these procedures work, and how to work with the most modern software to crunch large data sets and apply tools in predictive analytics. Why Study Statistics at Butler? Students in our program gain an understanding of statistics and its applications through classroom instruction and hands-on participation in research projects and/or internships, all of which are built into the curriculum and major requirements. In the classroom, students see a powerful outline of the way in which probability (the mathematical tool for a statistician) governs any statistical analysis, learn how to think rationally about random variables in the world around us, and see how to crunch data in their many different forms, no matter what the underlying experimental structure. Finally, each statistics student gains experience by looking at real-world data sets of various types, sizes, and complexities. This experience develops each student's abilities and use of computational tools to know how to work in corporate settings and as an expert researcher. Participation in student-faculty collaborative research is strongly emphasized and can have applications in any discipline that focuses on analyzing random variables and data. Butler's geographic position in Indianapolis puts it in the heart of the Indiana Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 96 corporate world, allowing our students to forge connections with the large number of local companies offering internships or seeking solutions to statistical questions. Statistics Student Learning Outcomes Statistics students graduate with a demonstrated mastery of the fundamental and broad content areas of probability, statistical theory, statistical methods, and applications to the real world. They are able to use critical thinking to advance scientific inquiry. They are also able to communicate statistical knowledge well to others, design real-world tests and collection of data, and continue learning new facts about statistics throughout their lifetimes.

Anyone looking critically at numerical information who does not want to be misled by incorrect or inappropriate calculations or anyone dealing with issues in their environment, state/nation, or career would benefit from studying the methodology of statistics. These problems include finding ways to improve our environment and living standards or studies conducted in an effort to fight diseases. This course is an introduction to applied statistics in the natural, social, and managerial sciences through the use of current environmental and global issues. Topics include sampling, data analysis, experimental design, and the use of computer-based statistical software.

(U)(1) Spring MA499, Honors Thesis: (U)(3) Fall and spring Modern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures Administration Alex JR Quintanilla, PhD, Department Chair Professors Terri Carney, PhD; Larry W. Riggs, PhD; Sylvie Vanbaelen, PhD; Linda PhD Eloise www.butler.edu/mllc Why Study Modern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures? The study of languages, literatures, and cultures gives students access to a broader global community, invites them to deepen their engagement with other linguistic and cultural traditions, and teaches them to be sensitive and critical readers of cultural texts. Becoming proficient or fluent in another language also enhances self-reflection, increases self-knowledge, and heightens awareness of one's own community and place in the world. Furthermore, a modern languages degree increases opportunities for employment because Butler students provide companies, nonprofits, and governmental entities with communicative and cultural analytical advantages in an increasingly shrinking world. Why Study Modern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at Butler? Small classes are led by internationally recognized and published faculty members hailing from such countries as Austria, Argentina, Belgium, China, Colombia, El Salvador, France, Italy, Senegal, Spain, and the United States. Our faculty members' wide variety of linguistic and cultural expertise enriches the curriculum and keeps students connected to the global communities they represent. Also, modern languages students consistently complete in-depth research with faculty and present at conferences both at Butler and around the country. Students who study with us find they are well-supported by the resources we have available in our Modern Language Center (Jordan Hall, Room 391), where they receive free tutoring, watch foreign language films, and work on group projects using our state-of-the-art media and computer stations. Modern languages students choose from a wide variety of well-established study-abroad options, including a three-week, faculty-led summer program Rica; a semester-long, faculty-led program in Spain; faculty-supervised summer trips to and internships in China; and more than 100 other programs offered by Butler's Center for Global Education, IFSA-Butler (Institute for Study Abroad), the International Student Exchange Program, and The Alliance for Global Education. Students can receive language credit for courses abroad with approval from the department chair. Students can take advantage of the Indianapolis community by completing a service learning course and/or approved independent study that connects them with local language communities\u2014in which they use their language skills to communicate with native speakers\u2014as well as by completing internships with governmental entities, educational institutions, nonprofits, and businesses. Modern languages studies can lead to Core Curriculum course fulfillments and exemptions: Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 100 If a student completes at least 9 approved hours abroad, he or she is exempted from one of the two required Global and Historical Studies courses. If a student completes at least three eligible modern languages courses, he or she is exempted from the Texts and Ideas course requirement. Students can fulfill the Speaking across the Curriculum and Writing across the Curriculum requirements by completing approved courses during eligible semesters. Students can fulfill the Indianapolis Community Requirement by completing an eligible course or approved independent study. Given the interdisciplinarity of our programs, students often find creative and productive ways to combine our majors and minors\u2014and combine them with other degrees\u2014preparing them well for service, employment, and graduate studies beyond Butler. Modern Languages Student Learning Outcomes Students will be able to do the following, in the target language: Orally communicate clearly in the target language on a variety of topics Articulate a cogent interpretation of a text regardless of cultures and centuries in the target languageClearly communicate in written form on a variety of topics in the target language Demonstrate intercultural awareness and competence: the ability to understand, relate to, and empathize with people from other cultures in the target languages Degree Programs Majors in Chinese French, German, Multilingual, and Spanish (BA) Minors in Chinese, French, German, and Spanish Requirements for the Majors A Chinese major consists of a minimum of 33 hours, with at least 24 being in Chinese language courses and at least 9 in approved electives. A French or German major consists of a minimum of 33 hours in the language, with at least 24 being at the 300 level or above. Both require the completion of one designated 300-level skills course and at least two 400-level courses. A Spanish major consists of a minimum of 33 hours in the language, with at least 24 being at the 300 level or above. For those students entering Butler fall 2018 onward, at least 18 credits must be completed from SP325-499. The major requires the completion of one 300-level skills course, a minimum of two culture/literature courses, and a minimum of one linguistics course. At least two courses\u2014whether culture/literature and/or linguistics\u2014must be completed at the 400 level. The Multilingual major consists of a minimum of 51 hours, with advanced study in at least one language and beginning/intermediate-level studies in at least two additional languages. (This works out to the equivalent of an individual modern languages major, plus at least six more eligible courses across a minimum of two additional languages. At least two courses must be completed in each secondary language. High school dual enrollment courses do not count toward fulfilling the secondary language requirements.) Requirements for the Minors A minor in Chinese, French, German, or Spanish consists of a minimum of 21 hours in the language, with at least 12 being at the 300 or 400 levels. The Spanish minor also requires the completion of at least one culture/literature or linguistics course (SP325-499). Placement and Earned Credits At Butler we recognize the language accomplishments of incoming students. Whether you took regular high school courses, \"dual enrollment courses,\" or AP/IB/CLEP exams, we'll help place you in the appropriate level at Butler and assign the correct number of credits for your previous work. For more detailed information on determining placement and earned credits, please visit the departmental website. Modern Language Center The student Modern Language Center (MLC) (Jordan Hall, Room 391) is a multilingual space focused on second language and culture acquisition. The MLC includes a comprehensive foreign feature and instructional film collection, a large group viewing area, film viewing stations for individuals, computers, a Smart Board, and gaming systems with games in a variety of languages. In addition to state-of-the-art facilities, the MLC hosts a number of activities designed to promote language and culture learning, including tutor tables, movie nights, and karaoke club. Events, workshops, and lectures focusing on language, culture, and social issues also take place in the Center. The MLC staff is trained in academic technology and research methodology to support all facets of language learning and teaching at Butler. Courses Taught in English Chinese, French, German, multilingual, and Spanish majors can count one FL (\"foreign language\") course toward a major. Courses taught in English do not satisfy the foreign language requirement for CCOM, international business, or LAS degrees (whether primary or secondary).

Lineweaver, PhD, Program Director Program Website www.butler.edu/las/neuroscience Neuroscience, an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the nervous system and its impact on behavior, cognition, and emotion, is a relatively new and rapidly expanding scientific field. Neuroscientific research describes the normal functioning of the nervous system, examines how the nervous system develops across the life span, and investigates the consequences of and potential interventions for neurological dysfunction due to abnormal development, disease, or injury. However, the implications of neuroscience stretch well beyond this scope and provide both a cornerstone and important tools for understanding all human behavior. The neuroscience minor at Butler University introduces students to an interdisciplinary viewpoint regarding the science as well as the philosophy of the mind. Students from any major may elect to complete a neuroscience minor by taking courses in the fields of biological science, psychology, and philosophy. Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of 20-21 hours, including: Biology: BI460, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology without lab (NS460) or with lab (BI460) Psychology: 6 hours PS235, Biological Bases of Behavior PS412, Advanced Applied Neuroscience Philosophy: 3 hours PL346, Philosophy of Mind Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 108 Neuroscience Course NS460, Cell and Molecular Neurobiology: This course covers cellular/molecular nervous system biology (e.g., nervous system structure/development, neuronal signaling/survival/regeneration, synapse formation/function).

McGrath, PhD; Tiberiu Popa, Department Website www.butler.edu/philosophy-religion-classics Why Study Classics? The culture, history, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome have long captivated the imagination of people throughout history and across the globe, from the Renaissance to the founding fathers of America, to modern writers from the Caribbean. We continue to live in a world of classical roots, whether it be the Athenian roots of democracy or the Roman origins of our republic, the Greek love for the beauty of athletics, or an enthusiasm for theatre that moved from Greece to Rome to Shakespeare and beyond. The Greeks and the Romans helped articulate the liberal arts that are at the heart of a Butler education. As we engage with the thinking and the art of the ancients, we aim to develop an understanding, enjoyment, and critical appreciation of some abiding principles of our world. We enter into dialogue with minds of the past in order to understand ourselves better now. Studying the Greeks and Romans, we become part of our larger family over time. We enrich our minds and our imaginations, and we sharpen our skills for work and life today. Why Study Classics at Butler? Intimate and vibrant learning community: Students in the Classics Program at Butler have the opportunity to work closely with a small but dedicated faculty. Smaller classes give students a greater opportunity to engage directly with faculty and with each other. As part of a smaller major, students develop a stronger sense of being part of a community of thinkers engaging in a subject they are passionate about. Building on past knowledge: Our program recognizes the quality of work many students have done before arriving on our campus. Students placing into the second or third year of Latin and completing at least 6 hours of study in Latin are eligible for 3-9 advanced placement credit hours, which may count toward the major or the minor. Real engagement with the ancient world: Students are encouraged to immerse themselves in the environments that inspired the ancient Greeks and Romans. Our program offers the opportunity to study the culture and literature of the Romans while traveling to important sites in Rome and Italy, or to participate in an archaeological field school in Greece. Our program is also supportive of students who wish to study abroad in programs in Greece and Italy specifically focused around classics. Practical experience: Our students are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities to work with faculty on research of their own, whether in the form of a Butler Summer Institute project or a senior thesis. Students who have done quality research have presented their work at undergraduate conferences and regional classics conferences. Making your education your own: Thanks to generous support from the Georgia Watkins Fund, our program provides funds to help students participate in archaeological digs, select summer study programs, or conferences in classics. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. Embracing the liberal arts: Since the field of classics embraces a wide variety of approaches to the study of the ancient Greeks and Romans, our program encourages students who wish to relate their interest in classics with work in other disciplines. Our students often take courses in English, history, philosophy, religion, political science, and modern languages. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 111 Classics Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in classics are expected to gain factual knowledge about key figures, historical events, and concepts from Greek and Roman antiquity. They will interpret and analyze significant works from antiquity, and at the same time gain a better understanding of cultural diversity by comparing current values and practices to those of the Greeks and Romans. They will become proficient in reading Latin or Ancient Greek texts and discover how knowledge of Latin or Ancient Greek helps in the understanding of modern languages.

Core Courses Offered by Classics PCA262-CLA, Greek Art and Myth: Art illuminates myth; myth makes sense of art. Students will acquire a sense of the major periods of Western art; will consider artistic questions large (is art subjective? is there a proper subject matter of art?) and small (what is contrapposto?); will study in some depth about 60 artistic images, mostly Greek; and will become acquainted with a set of Greek myths. The course will include a museum visit, a skit, and a creative art project. (U)(3) Fall and spring PWB170-CLA, Walking the Ruins: Unlike the sprawling cities of the Midwest, ancient cities developed organically around people getting from point A to point B by foot. Whether in a bustling metropolis like Rome or Athens or a small working-class community like Herculaneum, one sees how traveling by foot shaped the development of neighborhoods. Navigating the meandering streets of Pompeii by foot sheds light on the experience of those who sought refuge from the famed eruption of Mount Vesuvius. This course seeks to help students reconnect with a basic mode of transportation with vast lifelong health and well-being benefits. (U)(1) Summer TI200-CLA, Roman Perspectives: This course will examine civic engagement in the Roman world, both as a pagan and Christian capital for the West. We will undertake this investigation by looking at a variety of original sources translated into English. As we examine the texts of these authors, we will also have the opportunity to think about how the ideas of the ancient Romans have influenced cultures from Britain, France, and Spain in the West to the shores of North Africa to the civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean. (U)(3) Fall TI201-CLA, Ancient Greek Perspectives: An examination of areas of ancient Greek culture. Sources include texts of poetry, history, drama, law, medicine, and philosophy, as well as works of art. Themes will vary depending on the professor.

(U)(3) Spring CLA323, Women in Antiquity: This course introduces students to primary source material (literary, documentary, and material) that sheds light on the lives of women in ancient Greece and Rome, methods of analyzing this data, and various debates in this field of study. We may also discuss issues of gender and sexuality, minorities, and non-elites. (U/G)(3) Occasionally CLA324, Law and Orator: A Study of Ancient Law through Legal Speeches: By examining actual court speeches from ancient Athens and Rome, including famous trials such as that of Socrates, the infamous courtesan Neaira, and the trial of the corrupt governor Verres, students will explore how the study of law enables us to think about the values, assumptions, and even prejudices of societies. The course will ask students to think about how society deals with a variety of legal statuses, including citizen vs. non-citizen, age, and gender. Students will also engage with the question of the role of rhetoric in the legal process. In this course, students will engage in a variety of speaking exercises designed to understand better the mind-set of ancient people in their engagement with their respective legal systems.

As a philosopher, you learn to distinguish between sound reasoning and empty rhetoric. Philosophy majors learn how to communicate clearly both in speech and in writing. Philosophy helps you to think carefully about ethical decisions. Collectively, these are skills that will help you in future graduate and professional education. They will also help you to live your life well, and what could be a more practical skill than that? Philosophy majors regularly outscore other majors on standardized tests such as the LSAT and MCAT, because they do equally well on both the verbal and analytic/quantitative sections. Philosophy is the only liberal arts major that specifically teaches both verbal and logic skills. In addition, the most basic assumptions in law, the sciences, and other disciplines are studied not in those disciplines but in the philosophy of law, philosophy of science, etc. Why Study Philosophy at Butler? Our philosophy classes are fairly small, which further encourages students to participate in class discussion and allows the faculty to devote considerable attention to each of our students. The enrollment limit in our introductory classes is generally 25, and the number of students enrolled in our upper-level classes is between 10 and 20. Professors teach all courses; there are no teaching assistants at Butler. Many students engage in independent study and write honors theses under the supervision of professors. Additional learning opportunities include the Philosophy Club, which meets regularly for discussion, film viewing, speakers, and social activities. The reasoning skills of our majors are valued by graduate and professional schools as well as by employers. For example, a growing number of our majors have been accepted into reputable medical schools and prestigious law schools. Philosophy Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in philosophy at Butler University will learn about a wide range of philosophical ideas and outlooks, and will become acquainted with some of the most influential thinkers in Western philosophy. Besides exploring fundamental questions pertaining to knowledge and reality, students will be able to discern and respond to philosophical issues that arise in areas as diverse as religion, science, politics, the arts, and the law. While critical thinking is encouraged and emphasized throughout the liberal arts, it is especially at home in philosophy; our majors are able to read and write clearly, to critically evaluate evidence and arguments, and to determine the quality of their sources of information. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 114 Philosophical training helps deepen our students' reflection on issues in the here and now. Our professors encourage engagement in the community, including internships or research projects in which students' work can inform and be informed by their philosophical study. More generally, philosophy majors' ability to examine and question their own and others' values and convictions puts them in a position to make wise choices that will affect the quality and course of their lives and those of the people with whom they interact.

For some, the academic study of religion is a way of exploring their own commitment to a particular religious tradition. For others, it is a way of trying to learn about and understand the perspectives, values, and traditions of others. Whatever the student's motivation, the religion major offers the opportunity to engage in a critical and sympathetic study of various religious traditions; to study religious literatures, practices, and beliefs; and to investigate general questions regarding the nature of religion and the scholarly study thereof. A major in religion is a liberal arts major, and as such, exposes students to a wide spectrum of subjects and skills to produce broadly educated, sophisticated, and flexible leaders. What can one do with a religion major? Just about anything. Recent graduates of the program have gone on to study religion, law, public policy, medicine, and creative writing at the graduate level. Others have entered the nonprofit sector or religious ministries. Still others have found employment in a range of professions, like teaching, acting, and politics. Why Study Religion at Butler? Vocational discernment: Butler's religion program offers a close mentoring process designed\u2014through careful advising, experiential learning, and internship opportunities, and in collaboration with Butler's Center for Faith and Vocation\u2014to connect theory and practice and help students discern their vocational direction, integrating who they are (in terms of the values they hold most dear) and what they want to do. A big \"backyard\": Within a few minutes of the campus are numerous churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and meditation centers representing all of the world's largest religious traditions. Butler's urban location therefore allows students to explore both traditional and emerging American religious phenomena and the ways in which these are increasingly intertwined with and inseparable from global religious trends. Butler religion majors also often study abroad, sometimes with support from departmental awards. Close contact with top-notch faculty: Butler's religion program offers small classes and boasts an unparalleled faculty-to-student ratio. Students therefore get to work closely (whether in class, through independent studies, or as research assistants) with professors who are active and widely recognized scholars. Empathetic approach: Whereas religion programs in religiously affiliated colleges and universities sometimes teach religion from a specific doctrinal perspective, Butler's religion major is designed to expose students more broadly to the world's major religious traditions. This approach challenges students to hone their skills of critical thinking, develops the ability to appreciate multiple religious perspectives, and provides an excellent preparation for many professions, including for those who intend to enter seminary or graduate work in religious ministry. An education both sound and savvy: The religion program at Butler University grounds its students in the classically broad tradition of the liberal arts, while at the same time providing them with the skills that are most crucial in the digital age. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 117 Religion Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in religion are expected to gain a basic core of factual knowledge about the world's major religious traditions, acquire skills in critical thinking and textual analysis, develop the ability to identify and deploy credible sources of information (digital, print, or otherwise), cultivate understanding of and empathy for people of other faiths (in Indianapolis and beyond), and nurture a collaborative and civil disposition, that is, to work critically, openly, and with humility in the context of academic discussion and dispute.

Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium; Jennifer L. Poor, PhD Professor Emeritus Marshall Dixon, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/physics-astronomy Why Study Physics and Astronomy? Physicists (including astronomers and astrophysicists) seek to understand the fundamental workings of the physical world from the tiniest particles known to the entire universe. Majors develop mathematical, computer, and problem-solving skills to solve problems in areas such as classical mechanics, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, relativity, optics, and quantum mechanics. The skills mastered by physics majors are an excellent foundation for many professions in science, engineering, medicine, business, and law. Graduates find opportunities for employment in education, industry, and research. A bachelor's degree in physics is also excellent preparation for pursuit of an advanced degree not only in physics but also in other fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, and law. Why Study Physics and Astronomy at Butler? Majors participate in research experiences at about twice the national rate. Our students have 100 percent placement for those who seek undergraduate research/internship positions. Our student-faculty ratio is small: 9:1. Faculty members have expertise in atomic physics, geophysics, astrophysics, nuclear physics, computational physics, and condensed matter, allowing students a number of choices for on-campus research. The department directs the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium, which is home to a robotic 1-meter-class telescope. Butler University is a member of the SARA (Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy) consortium, which operates two remotely operated telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. These three telescopes are available for our faculty and students for remote observing research as well as on-site visitation. Students have the opportunity to work in our Laboratory for Laser and Quantum Physics, which houses a YAG laser-pumped tunable dye laser, to study interactions between light and matter. The University's supercomputer, \"Big Dawg,\" with 384 computing cores, is used for departmental research. Students can earn a degree in engineering (mechanical, electrical, computer, biomedical, energy, or motorsports) concurrently through our Engineering Dual Degree Program (see Engineering Dual Degree Program). Physics and Astronomy Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in physics and astronomy at Butler will gain a working knowledge of the basic concepts and theories of physics, which they will demonstrate by applying them to novel situations. They will learn to make inferences and deductions about physical systems using critical thinking, problem-solving techniques, mathematical and computer modeling, and laboratory experiments. They will gain the skills to conduct lab or modeling experiments, to analyze measurements, and to evaluate uncertainty, and they will learn to communicate their findings both through speaking and through writing.

Brabant, PhD; Siobhan Ooi, PhD; Robin Turner, PhD Shufeldt, PhD Professors Emeriti Craig Auchter, PhD; Dave Mason, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/political-science Why Study Political Science? The faculty members of the Political Science Department at Butler University see our discipline as connected to the liberal arts, which are about studying and understanding ourselves, other peoples, and different ways of being and knowing, as well as about developing tolerance and empathy, and learning to use evidence and think critically. As political scientists, we seek to understand the causes of wars, social injustices, economic disparities, and uneven technological growth, for the purpose of alleviating suffering. Because a liberal arts education encourages an activist disposition, we look for ways to address problems such as world poverty, inadequate healthcare, educational disparities between neighboring communities, and environmental degradation, and seek nonviolent solutions to human rights violations worldwide. The department deliberately challenges systems, institutions, and leaders that dehumanize, marginalize, and oppress any persons and other living beings. We seek to engage in intellectual practices that provide sustainable solutions for the betterment of all. Why Study Political Science at Butler? The department is committed to teaching students how to effect positive social change. In practicing citizenship skills that include empathetic listening, moral reasoning, personal responsibility, and a greater awareness of one's responsibility to the human polity, our students develop as active and engaged citizens at the local, national, and international levels. We offer courses that include service learning and community-based research, encourage students to accept responsibility for their learning, and recognize that knowledge may be obtained from a variety of different people and situations. Political Science Student Learning Outcomes Analyze and differentiate various political movements, structures, and institutions in the United States and other countries Differentiate and make connections between theory and practice, between global and local events, and between political science and other disciplines Demonstrate an awareness of different cultures and their effect on domestic and international affairs Demonstrate leadership and collaborative skills through active engagement in service learning and internships Apply research and communication techniques effectively Value the fundamental importance of one's membership in the human polity, emphasizing citizenship and political community Degree Programs Major in Political Science (BA) Minor in Political Science Requirements for the Major The major requires 33 hours of political science courses, of which at least 20 hours must be in courses numbered above 299.

Core Courses Offered by Political Science SW240-PO, Gender and Generations: War and Peace: This course is organized around the following inquiry: When gender and generation are used as categories of analysis, what do we learn about the politics of violence and peace? We are taking the lenses of gender and age and training them on different aspects of global politics, society, and culture. What forms of violence do we see? (U)(3) Annually, term varies Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 125 SW242-PO, Introduction to U.S. Politics: This course is an introduction to the study of the United States government. Fundamentally, this class is about how we evaluate the quality of American democracy. To do so, we first will focus on the normative debates and values that helped shape the foundations of our democracy. We then will explore how and to what extent mediating and political institutions reflect the attitudes and behavior of individual Americans. By the end of the course, students will have a deeper understanding of, and the ability to better navigate, the American political system. (U)(3) Fall, spring, and summer SW245-PO, Politics from the Margins: How do politics really work? Who gets what, where, when, how, and why? This course approaches these questions from the margins, exploring the political expressions and experiences of minoritized people and considering social research on difference, representation, and governance to deepen students' understanding of politics within and beyond the state. (U)(3) Annually, term varies TI255-PO, The Politics of Alice Walker: This course will introduce students to the great works of Alice Walker, who is accomplished in many literary areas \u2014poetry, short stories, novels, and political/cultural essays. Infused in all of her works is her personal and evolving political worldview, with which so many diverse people identify, and yet her voice is distinctly African-American female. We will read an array of her texts and develop an understanding of what drives her political identity.

(U)(3) Occasionally PO350, African Politics: Africa is a diverse and complex continent comprising more than 50 countries with distinct histories and political economies. Although Americans are constantly bombarded with images and reports on wars, disease, conflict, and corruption in Africa, these representations are incomplete and somewhat misleading. Rather than attempting to provide a comprehensive portrait of politics across the continent, this course will expose you to important concepts and theories in African politics, to the political histories and dynamics of several sub-Saharan African states, and to African scholars and writers' perspectives on the region. Prerequisite: PO151 or junior standing. (U)(3) Annually, term varies PO351, African Gender and Sexuality Politics: This course will examine the varied ways in which gender and sexuality have been constructed and politicized across the African continent. We will collectively engage with a variety of texts\u2014essays, films, books, and scholarly journal articles \u2014that address African understandings and expressions of gender and sexuality, the role of gender and sexuality in African politics, and Africans' individual and collective mobilizations toward liberation and against gender- and sexuality-based oppression. Although the course will focus on African gender/sexuality politics, we also will consider the relationship between African and Western gender/sexuality discourses and movements. Prerequisites: Sophomore status, GHS206 or PO350. (U)(3) Occasionally PO352, Comparative Political Economy: Development has long been a central concern of political economists. Most people would agree that Ouagadougou is much less developed than New York City, and Burkina Faso is less developed than the United States of America. But what about the difference between Kerala and Beijing or between India and China? How does the United States compare to Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom? And why are some places less developed than others? While economists often rely on economic growth rates and GDP/capita to measure development, these measures tell us little about citizens' access to opportunities, their quality of life, or their political rights (or lack thereof). If development is the \"process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy,\" as Amartya Sen argues, these indicators are radically incomplete. Focusing on the deeply contested concept of development, this seminar examines the politics of economic growth and well-being. We will delve into the classical and contemporary literature on the political economy of development and look closely at the development questions, trajectories, and challenges facing people across the globe. Prerequisite: PO151 or junior status. (U)(3) Occasionally PO354, Environmental Justice: How can we create a world in which all people have access to clean, safe, and welcoming places to live, work, learn, play, and pray, and ecosystems are conserved? Why have some communities been disproportionately burdened with unsafe water, polluted air, and toxic trash while others take access to clean air, water, green spaces, and other amenities for granted? What explains these unjust outcomes? What can be done? These questions are at the heart of this course. This course will develop your capacity to analyze environmental problems, policies, and decision-making processes by introducing you to environmental justice (EJ) as a set of analytic frameworks and overlapping social movements. EJ frameworks attend to the interconnections among environments, polities, societies, and economies to identify causes of and remedies for injustice. EJ movements have placed distributional issues squarely on the environmental policy agenda and presented a broader vision. Advocates have not only asserted that solutions that reduce aggregate pollution while imposing undue burdens on marginalized groups are unacceptable but also have sought to develop strategies to create greater environmental justice. While this course accepts the assertion that all people have the right to a clean and healthy environment and the right to the natural resources necessary for health and livelihood, EJ frameworks and movements will be subject to critique. Prerequisite: Sophomore status. (U)(3) Occasionally PO355, United States Foreign Policy: Evolution of U.S. foreign policy since World War II and the processes and institutions involved in shaping and implementing that policy. (U/G) Occasionally PO356, Israel-Palestine Conflict: The course focuses on the historical origins, key narratives, political dynamics, and most contentious issues involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict. How did this conflict begin? Why has it proved so intractable? What prospects are there for peace? To answer these questions, the course examines the social, political, economic, cultural, psychological, and military aspects of the conflict. The core issues are analyzed from a variety of different perspectives, including the positions of important political, military, and religious actors, women, youth, civil society organizations, peace movements, and external actors. Prerequisite: One PO course or permission of the instructor. (U)(3) Occasionally PO357, The Politics of Youth and Conflict: The course examines the relationship between young people and the ideas, behaviors, processes, structures, and cultures that promote violent conflicts and/or peaceful social change in our world. Prerequisite: One PO course or permission of the instructor. (U)(3) Occasionally PO358, Foreign Policy Making in Washington: This course focuses on foreign policy making as practiced in Washington, DC; it examines how politicians, lobbyists, citizens, and diplomats interact in and around Washington's corridors of power to determine international policy outcomes. Firsthand insights gained through dialogue with those who make and implement policy and close scrutiny of key international issues provide students with a \"laboratory\" for understanding the politics of foreign policy making in the U.S. capital, how these policies are shaped, and why they succeed or fail to achieve their stated objectives. (U)(3) Occasionally PO360, Political Regimes Latin America: Comparative study of the politics of development in Latin America, with particular attention given to the interdependence of economic, social, cultural, and external influences upon political regimes as well as the efficacy and legitimacy of the regimes themselves. Prerequisite: PO101, PO151, or permission of the instructor. (U/G)(3) Occasionally Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 127 PO362, Popular Participation in Latin America: This course focuses on the efforts of peasants, urban workers, neighborhoods, church groups, and students to organize and mobilize in politically efficacious ways. The themes of social class, gender, ethnicity, and the informal sector are interwoven in an analysis of the successes and failures of these attempts at popular participation in the political process. Prerequisite: PO101, PO151, or permission of the instructor. (U/G)(3) Occasionally PO364, United States-Latin American Relations: Historical orientation to the evolving context, institutions, and central concerns of United States-Latin American relations, with particular focus on divergent perspectives of definitions of interests and responsibilities, as well as a search for viable solutions to common problems in the Western Hemisphere.

Padgett, PhD Associate Professors R. Brian Giesler, PhD; Amanda C. Gingerich Hall, PhD Assistant Professors Jennifer N. Berry, PhD; Brian M. Day, PhD Department Website www.butler.edu/psychology Why Study Psychology? The goal of an undergraduate psychology program is to introduce students to knowledge of the principles of emotion, behavior, and cognition as established by scientific methods. Students majoring in psychology study the core content areas of psychology and scientific methodology in preparation for graduate study and later professional pursuits in psychology or related fields. Why Study Psychology at Butler? Students in our program develop an understanding of psychological science through instruction in the classroom and hands-on participation in research projects. The classroom portion of the curriculum is structured so that students first receive a general overview of the topics and methods in psychology, followed by a more thorough exploration of specific content areas. We emphasize a broad and stable base of content: every psychology major studies the same basic core of subject matter and methods in psychology. Further, each psychology student has the opportunity to add depth to that knowledge by studying particular content areas more specific to his or her interests. Participation in student-faculty collaborative research is the hallmark of our program. We encourage students to become involved in research projects with one or more professors during their undergraduate years. Research involvement is structured so that students evolve from apprentices to collaborators by taking progressively greater responsibility for the design and execution of psychological research projects. Some students complete an honors thesis, a year-long research project. They routinely make presentations at the Butler Undergraduate Research Conference and at national professional meetings such as the annual convention of the Association for Psychological Science. Approximately 80 percent of our graduates have collaborated on at least one research project. Students benefit from participating in student-faculty collaborative research in several ways. They have the opportunity to apply the concepts, theories, and ideas learned in the classroom. They also learn how to think like psychologists and how to conduct scientific research. No amount of reading about psychology or listening to instructors can replace the experience of conducting research in behavioral science. Because a career as a professional psychologist requires a graduate degree, the knowledge and skills students acquire through course work and research experience in our program prepare them for graduate study. About two-thirds of our students attend graduate school either immediately after completing our program or after working for one to five years in a field related to psychology. Most of these students enter graduate programs in psychology, social work, or counseling. Some attend medical or law school. The remaining students begin careers in a wide range of fields, most of which are healthcare- or service-related (pharmaceutical companies, nonprofit organizations, healthcare services, management, computer services, human resources, sales, education, and advertising, to name a few).

The program is dedicated to providing students with an interdisciplinary perspective regarding the complex relationships among science and technology and our health, our families and communities, and our environment. Students are challenged to explore the sociocultural, economic, and political dimensions of practices of scientific research and technological development, to learn how our understanding of these practices and their products are shaped by language and communication, and to contemplate the philosophical questions raised by this enlarged perspective on the natural world, our place in it, and our obligations toward it. The science, technology, and society major prepares students for a number of career paths in health, education, law, public policy, communications, and other fields. The environmental studies major prepares students for careers related to the exploration, management, preservation, and conservation of the natural environment. Both majors integrate the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science), humanities (history, philosophy, and English), and social sciences (anthropology, political science, sociology, and psychology). Service learning and hands-on community service are strongly emphasized to afford students the opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world problems and connect with community partners and potential employers. Science, Technology, and Environmental Studies Student Learning Outcomes Students majoring in science, technology, and society will: Analyze and investigate the interactions among science and technology and social forces (e.g., economics, culture, religion, and politics) Analyze and explain how science and technology influence and are influenced by language, communication, and practices of public translation and transmission Describe and assess the philosophical, scientific, and moral standards that should guide the conduct of scientific research and technological development Research, write, and speak from an interdisciplinary perspective about issues concerning science and technology as they relate to society Students majoring in environmental studies will: Analyze and investigate the scientific basis of environmental issues facing both human societies and the rest of the living world in modern times Analyze and investigate challenges to solving environmental issues that stem from practical considerations tied to the political, economic, social, and ethical perspectives on the environment Research and communicate (in writing, orally, and symbolically) information from an interdisciplinary perspective pertaining to the environment Degree Programs Major in Science, Technology, and Society (BA, BS) Major in Environmental Studies (BA, BS) Minor in Science, Technology, and Society Minor in Environmental Studies Requirements for the Science, Technology, and Society Major Core courses (12 hours): ST200, Introduction to Science Studies ST205, Science and Society Speakers Seminar (1-credit course that must be completed three times) Two of the following: ST310, Social Studies of Science and Technology ST320, Philosophy of Science ST330, Language, Rhetoric, and Science Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 132 Eighteen hours of elective courses from various departments.

Menendez, PhD, Department Chair Professors Kenneth D. Colburn Jr., PhD; Jay Howard, PhD; Antonio V. Menendez, PhD; Katherine B. Novak, PhD; Marvin B. Scott, PhD Associate Professor Krista M. C. Cline, PhD Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 135 Department Website www.butler.edu/sociology-criminology Why Study Sociology and Criminology? Sociology and criminology majors are taught the basics of human interaction and relationships and acquire an understanding of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of social behavior. As all human behavior is primarily social, sociology promotes an awareness and understanding of a wide range of social and cultural issues, from the study of crime and deviance, to the study of social inequality and social welfare, to the study of racial, gender, and sexual diversity, to the study of globalization and multiculturalism. With an understanding of society and how the social context and social forces shape behaviors and an emphasis on strong critical-thinking and research skills, majors in sociology and criminology are well prepared for a wide range of opportunities after graduation. Why Study Sociology and Criminology at Butler? The Department of Sociology and Criminology aspires to be a cornerstone program in the social sciences, emphasizing writing and critical thinking, analytical skills, experiential learning, and an in-depth understanding of the changing world, including multicultural and global issues. The department provides comprehensive, sociology-based course work in sociology, sociology with a specialization in social work and social policy, and criminology. Our program is distinguished by: A curriculum that emphasizes the connection between theory and practice. Students have numerous opportunities to apply what they have learned in the classroom to real-world settings and to everyday life. Majors that culminate in a capstone experience. Students undertake and complete an independent empirical research project in their senior year that demonstrates their mastery of sociology or criminology. Students present their research findings at the Butler Undergraduate Research Conference or a professional meeting. An emphasis on multicultural and global issues. Our curriculum introduces students to other cultures and societies and prepares them for participation in an increasingly diverse and multicultural world. Student participation in internships and service-learning courses. Internships in criminal justice, human services, business, and community contexts provide students with practical experience and career opportunities. Service-learning courses promote learning through the active participation of students in the local community. Student engagement in the research process. Students have many opportunities to engage in the research process and to collaborate with faculty on research projects. A curriculum that prepares students for the job market and for advanced study. Graduates of the department work in a wide range of employment fields, including human services, social policy agencies, the criminal justice system, healthcare, and business. Majors also pursue advanced professional degrees in law and social work, as well as degrees in sociology, criminology, and other related fields. Numerous student opportunities beyond the classroom. The department sponsors a chapter of Alpha Kappa Delta, an international honor society for sociology. The Student Sociology and Criminology Association is a student-led organization that engages in volunteer opportunities, hosts movie nights to provide organized discussion on current event topics, and hosts career and graduate school panels. A diverse faculty of dedicated teachers and researchers. Faculty work closely with students and encourage student learning through hands-on experiences in and out of the classroom. Sociology and Criminology Student Learning Outcomes The core values of the Sociology and Criminology Department are placed squarely within a liberal arts tradition that strives to foster critical reflection, social awareness and responsibility, sociocultural diversity, and a global perspective. The department's central mission is to: Foster a knowledge of social and cultural issues, theories, and research methods Cultivate students' abilities to succinctly and clearly express this knowledge in oral and written form Provide opportunities for students to utilize these acquired skills in an applied context Develop an awareness of global and multicultural issues. Students will develop a perspective that emphasizes critical inquiry and reasoning to address challenging social problems. Ultimately, our program and curriculum cultivate values that will shape students into lifelong, active, responsible, and informed members of the greater community.

The College of Education has two major purposes: Preparing teachers, counselors, and administrators for positions in elementary education and middle/secondary education Providing services to schools and allied professionals, educational organizations, agencies, and the general community through surveys, consultative services, research, cooperative studies, and clinical services The College offers curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education or the Bachelor of Science Degree in Middle/Secondary Education. The programs in teacher education include field and clinical experiences throughout the curriculum, with the capstone experience being integrated laboratory and student teaching. Butler University teacher education programs are accredited by the Indiana Office of Educator Effectiveness and Licensing (OEEL) and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and they are now affiliated with the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), the new accrediting body for educator preparation. Graduation Requirements All undergraduate students who plan to teach in an elementary, middle, or high school must complete the bachelor's degree. Candidates must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 126 semester hours of college course work. They also must meet all requirements listed under respective program areas. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 143 At least 40 of the 126 semester hours needed for graduation must be in upper-division courses\u2014courses numbered 300 or above. Student teaching is required for initial licensure programs. Educational Placement The College of Education has moved to entirely self-managed credentials. Self-managed files are appropriately responsive and practical in the era of portfolios and electronic applications and communications. Current job listings can be found through Butler's Internship and Career Services website, at www.butler.edu/ics, or on individual school district websites. Teacher Education Undergraduate Transition Points The College of Education has set four transition points for delineation and progress through the licensure/degree program. Annual updates will be made available at www.butler.edu/coe. COE Core I and COE Core II To complete COE Core I and COE Core II, students must meet the following criteria: A cumulative GPA of 2.8. A cumulative GPA of 2.8 as well as completion of state testing requirements is required of anyone transferring from another college within the University to the COE. A grade of C or higher in FYS101 and FYS102. A student receiving a grade of C- or below in either class must either repeat the class and receive a grade of C or above or obtain a grade of C or above in a comparable or higher-level class.

With the advisor's permission, the student may instead substitute an equivalent course and attain a grade of C or above. Satisfactory progress in completing requirements for a specific major. A decision based on the criteria above by a College committee (with appropriate program representation) determines the student's eligibility to continue in the program. COE Core III: Program-Specific To enter COE Core III, the student must have successfully completed COE Cores I and II and must be admitted to teacher education based on the aforementioned criteria. Apply to COE Core IV: Student Teaching Candidates for student teaching must have completed COE Cores I, II, and III and been admitted to teacher education. During the first semester of the junior year, candidates for student teaching must obtain a student teaching application available at www.butler.edu/coe. Completed applications (except for fall semester grades) are to be submitted to the advisor by the published due date; fall semester grades are then added to this application. Failure to meet the deadline may jeopardize student teaching placement. Candidates must have a cumulative GPA of 2.8. At least 15 semester hours must be taken at Butler University to qualify for admission to teacher education and student teaching. A decision is made by the program area for admittance to COE Core IV and is based on disposition assessment rubrics and grades. Students who do not meet these criteria may appeal in writing to the Administrative Team of the College of Education and may be asked to appear in person. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 144 COE Core IV: Student Teaching and Internship State licensure tests, CPR/Heimlich certification, and evidence of suicide prevention training are required for initial licensure. Recommendation for licensure is made by program area based on disposition assessment rubrics and grades. Elementary Education In addition to receiving a comprehensive liberal arts background, students in the Elementary Education Program are prepared for teaching and instructional leadership in elementary schools. With extensive site-based instruction, students learn alongside their professors, through guided practice and reflection that increases in scope over time, culminating in a full year of student teaching. Students will be in the classroom, working with children and program faculty, for seven of their eight semesters. The Elementary Education Program and its faculty emphasize learning through doing, collaborative inquiry, a nurturing environment, and the development of a professional identity. By completing the program and all required standardized tests, students will meet state licensing requirements for grades K-6. Minors and/or licensing are also available in Reading Teacher\u2014Elementary, Special Education\u2014Mild Interventions, Diverse Learners, English as a New Language, Early Childhood, Recreation and Sports Studies, and Sport Coaching. Specific curriculum requirements are available at www.butler.edu/coe. This program addresses these University Student Learning Outcomes: Students will articulate and apply required content knowledge within their area(s) of study (cognitive). Students will communicate clearly and effectively (psychomotor). Students will share their talents with Butler and the greater community at large (affective). Middle/Secondary Education The Middle/Secondary Education Program is committed to preparing teachers and other professionals to work toward achieving our College's core values and shared vision for education. We believe all our programs must prepare our candidates for schools and communities as they should be, not simply perpetuating them as they currently exist. The program is a comprehensive teacher education program that combines in-depth preparation in the academic content areas of English, mathematics, science (biology, chemistry, physics), social studies, special education plus a focus area, physical education, health education, or foreign language (French, German, Spanish) with the professional teacher education skills necessary for success in educational contexts for undergraduates seeking licensure in grades 5-12 in these areas. Indiana teacher licensure for physical education, health education, and music education is P-12. Minors and/or licensing are also available in English as a New Language, Special Education\u2014Mild Interventions, Reading Teacher\u2014Secondary, Recreation and Sports Studies, and Sport Coaching.

Lacy School of Business receive a rich, well-rounded academic experience that is grounded in the liberal arts and includes a rigorous curriculum in the business disciplines. Students have access to top internship opportunities, immersive study-abroad experiences at our partner schools around the globe, and the opportunity to participate in research with faculty through the honors program. LSB students often continue their studies at top graduate and law schools. Students begin their journey with the First-Year Business Experience, in which they engage in guided self-exploration, hone their teamwork skills, and develop a business plan. This leads into an innovative sophomore experience in which students develop and run a live business for real money. Students and faculty work alongside professional consultants in the Butler Business Consulting Group, a consulting firm that is run within the School. Students also participate in a four-year career development program that involves two internships and career mentors. Interaction with real business continues throughout the curriculum\u2014from the first year through the senior year. The School also offers two graduate degrees. The Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a part-time program that connects theory with business practice. Students kick off their graduate course work by participating in a one-day business problem-solving immersion experience with a local company in the Gateway Experience. This course gives students an initial exposure to the experiential, hands-on learning process in the MBA program. At the end of the program, students participate in the integrated Capstone Experience, which serves as the bookend to the Gateway Experience. This course pulls together everything that students have learned throughout the MBA program into a practical, applied, semester-long consulting project. In addition to these two learning experiences, students encounter real business in a number of other ways on their path to graduation, including participating in a leadership development program, traveling with a faculty member on an international study trip, or serving as a board fellow. The Master of Professional Accounting (MPAcc) program prepares students for successful careers in the accounting profession, both public and corporate, as well as successful completion of the CPA exam. The one-year curriculum includes a set of fundamental accounting classes and allows students to choose additional courses from two concentration areas: tax and financial reporting. In addition, students may incorporate a number of electives, including a Becker FastPass CPA review course and an international study trip. The Master of Science in Risk & Insurance (MSRI) program is an online, part-time program that includes two in-residence experiences. It prepares students for advancement to the highest levels of firms in the insurance industry, or to senior level corporate risk management positions in large firms of all kinds. In addition to master level courses with robust coverage of insurance practice and theory, the program also includes more general management courses that assume that graduates will likely spend most of their time managing broad areas of the business and the work of others. As such, specific knowledge is provided and supplemented with significant emphasis on application of that theory and knowledge. Vision and Mission The Butler University Lacy School of Business will become a recognized national center of excellence in business education. The LSB mission is to prepare students for success in life and leadership in business through experiential learning guided by a research-oriented faculty with relevant business experience.

Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 185 Master of Physician Assistant Studies www.butler.edu/physician-assistant The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences offers a Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) degree for those completing the requirements of the physician assistant (PA) program. PAs are well-recognized and highly sought-after members of the healthcare team. Working interdependently with physicians, PAs practice medicine and value team-based care in virtually all medical specialties and settings. In all 50 states, PAs have the authority to prescribe medications. PAs practice in all specialty fields; 28 percent of all PAs provide primary care services, especially in family and general internal medicine. Their job descriptions are diverse, and they serve in both clinical and nonclinical roles. While these nonclinical positions do not involve patient care, they depend on a strong clinical knowledge base. The MPAS curriculum is 24 consecutive months designed to provide an understanding of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes used as a physician assistant. The first 12 months of the MPAS program are devoted to didactic studies in the basic medical, clinical, and behavioral sciences, and the remaining 12 months are largely focused on the clinical experiences in primary care and medical and surgical specialties. The didactic curriculum is integrated to introduce the student to medical sciences as they relate to specific organ systems and clinical problems. Learning strategies include the traditional lecture format and basic science laboratory, hybrid, small-group tutorials, and patient case discussions. Regular patient contact is an important part of the first-year curriculum. Students begin to see patients during the first semester of their didactic year. Standardized patient evaluations, through simulation and actors, are also a part of the didactic curriculum. As part of the clinical curriculum, students participate in rotations and didactic course work. Students are required to take core rotations in emergency medicine, family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, mental health, pediatrics, and women's health. Students also choose an elective rotation. In the clinical year, students also participate in Core Topics, Issues of Professional Practice, and the Summative Practicum. Programmatic Goals Select highly qualified applicants through the admission process who will successfully complete our PA program Provide a quality educational experience that provides students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for entry-level practice as PAs Provide an educational experience that prepares our graduates to provide primary care in a wide variety of clinical settings Help our students develop a sensitivity that will allow them to effectively work with patients who are different than they are Maintain our status as the longest accredited PA program in the state of Indiana Promote professionalism, service, and leadership of students and faculty Eligibility and Admission The pathways to gain entry to the PA program are the selective internal admission pathway (current Butler University students and/or alumni) and the standard admission pathway. (Accreditation Standards A3.15, A3.16) Special Considerations The following admission and enrollment practices are followed. (Accreditation Standard A3.15a) The Butler University physician assistant program is committed to accepting a diverse group of qualified individuals from a variety of backgrounds and experiences. The program selects students who reflect varied social, economic, ethnic, educational, and healthcare experience backgrounds. The program seeks students who excel in leadership, service, scholarship, communication, intellectual capacity, and interpersonal skills. Butler University and its graduates are at an advantage in the admission process through the selective internal admission pathway. Up to 60 percent of each class (45 of 75 students) will be made up of students who have previously earned Butler degrees at the time they begin the PA program. The Butler University PA program recognizes the special heritage to our profession provided by the United States Armed Services. One seat in the program will be reserved for either a veteran or an active military member (active duty, reserve, and National Guard). The military candidate must meet all minimum academic evaluation criteria and complete the nonacademic evaluation. Students should identify themselves as being interested in this seat at the time of Central Application Service for Physician Assistants submission. This is a competitive process. The Butler University PA program does not require healthcare experience for consideration of admission. However, it is recommended to help with the discernment process. No credit will be awarded to students for work experience performed prior to the start of the PA program. (Accreditation Standard A3.15b) International students are important to the fabric of the Butler student community; however, no special consideration is granted for an international student. If a student is looking to study in the United States under an F-1 or J-1 visa, we hope they will consider Butler University. International students must have a TOEFL score and evaluation of any international transcripts. Please note that this takes additional time. Deadlines will not be extended for these purposes. A TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based test) or 79 (internet-based test) meets Butler University's English language proficiency requirements. Butler's TOEFL school code is 1073. World Education Services or Educational Credential Evaluators must evaluate all international transcripts. Please contact PAadmission@butler.edu for guidance and/or questions regarding TOEFL or credential and/or transcript evaluation. Contact PAadmission@butler.edu for any additional questions. Variances may be approved at the discretion of the PA Program Admission Committee. Selective Internal Admission Pathway The Selective Internal Admission Pathway is designed for Butler University alumni and current students of any major who would like to pursue a Master of Physician Assistant Studies degree. Application for this pathway will begin in April 2018 for matriculation into the program in May 2019. This is a competitive process, as the program generally targets up to 60% of each class (45 of 75 students) to be admitted through this pathway. Admission to the PA program through this pathway requires application through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA). The centralized application service website can be found at caspa.liaisoncas.com/.

If a C- or less is earned in a repeated course, an applicant is no longer eligible for this application pathway. Take all courses for a letter grade. A grade of \"pass\" or \"complete\" is acceptable for non-prerequisite courses if letter grades are not offered for the course. Not withdraw from a course. Not audit a prerequisite course prior to taking the course for a grade. Take and submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores. General Test scores must be submitted no later than August 1 (Butler University's GRE Code: 0477) the year prior to matriculation. No other test scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE. The scores must be sent directly from Educational Testing Services to CASPA. Submit three evaluations (letters of recommendation) to CASPA. Remain free of conduct code violations (per COPHS and Butler University policies). Students not eligible to apply via the Selective Internal Admission Pathway may apply to the program via the Standard Admission Pathway. Standard Admission Pathway This is a competitive process, as the program generally accepts 40% of each class (30 of 75 students) to be admitted through this pathway. Admission to the Butler University PA Program through the Standard Admission Pathway requires application through the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA). This centralized application service website can be found at caspa.liaisoncas.com. Application Requirements Complete CASPA application and submit application fee. All applications must be marked as complete in CASPA by August 1 to be reviewed. Submit transcripts from all colleges/universities (including Butler University) and other postsecondary institutions attended. Have no more than three outstanding prerequisite courses remaining at the time of application. Only one chemistry- or biology-related prerequisite may be outstanding at the time of application. See Course Prerequisite List. Earn a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution before the start of the PA program. College seniors are encouraged to apply, provided they will receive a baccalaureate degree prior to the May start date of the PA program. Earn a 3.2 or higher GPA at the time of application and matriculation into the program on all undergraduate course work (including course work completed at any regionally accredited institutions). Earn no grade of C- or less on prerequisite courses. All attempts of repeated course work will be included in the GPA calculation. Take and submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores. General Test scores must be submitted no later than August 1 (Butler University's GRE Code: 0477) the year prior to matriculation. No other test scores are accepted in lieu of the GRE. The scores must be sent directly from Educational Testing Services to CASPA. Submit three evaluations (letters of recommendation) to CASPA. Admission Process Both the Selective Internal and Standard Admission Pathways are divided into two parts: 1) application review and on-campus interview. Both pathways are highly competitive. Note: The PA program has the right to change admission and interview processes as it deems appropriate. Academic Evaluation All applications for admission meeting prerequisites, application requirements, and the required undergraduate cumulative GPA minimum of 3.2 will be reviewed. All questions in the application must be answered fully. Further review of an application may include the Biology, Chemistry, and Physics GPA as calculated by CASPA. The PA Admission Committee will review the application to determine excellence in leadership, service, or scholarship (research and/or publications) and effective written communication skills. It is the program's desire to establish a cohort of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Candidates are encouraged to apply as early as possible to avoid the crush of applications that occurs near the August 1 deadline. The GRE score must be provided to CASPA at the time of application. Candidates are welcome to take the GRE multiple times. If the GRE is taken on more than one occasion, the highest earned quantitative and verbal subscores will be used in the admission review process. A competitive average GPA and GRE for those students matriculating each year is dependent on the cohort. The five-year averages are GPA: 3.8, Composite GRE: 311, Quantitative GRE: 156, Verbal GRE: 155, Written GRE: 4.2. The following are the most recent averages by cohort: Cohort Average GPA Average Composite GRE Score Average Quantitative GRE Score Average Verbal GRE Score Average Written GRE Score 2017 3.7 314 157 156 4.2 2016 3.8 313 156 156 4.2 2015 3.8 308 154 154 4.2 2014 3.8 307 154 153 4.2 2013 3.9 315 158 157 4.2 Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 187 On-Campus Interview COPHS faculty, staff, alumni, active preceptors, and/or community-based PAs evaluate candidates during the on-campus interview. Candidates invited to interview on campus will have multiple interactions. Candidates will complete a series of stations that are generally task oriented or interview based. The stations are designed to assess candidates for characteristics necessary to be successful within this program and/or discernment to the PA profession. Candidates are ranked based on their cumulative scores from station evaluators. Offers of Admission The decision to admit students into the PA program will be made by the PA Program Admission Committee. (Accreditation Standard A2.05b) After the nonacademic evaluation process, selected candidates will be extended a conditional offer of admission into the Butler University PA program, generally via email. The candidate will have one week from the date of conditional offer of admission to accept and submit a nonrefundable $1,000 deposit to secure a seat within the program. Student Accounts will apply the deposit to the candidate's tuition. The candidate must meet all University and PA program prerequisites and requirements to enter into the program. Application Timeline The following timeline should provide guidance to those interested in applying to the PA program. The program has the right to change timelines as it deems appropriate. Please contact PAadmission@butler.edu for additional admission questions. Late April CASPA application available August 1 All materials must be received and marked complete by CASPA* May-September Application review of candidates October/November On-campus interview of selected candidates November/December Conditional offers of admission to selected applicants * The Butler University PA program encourages all applicants to complete the Transcript Entry portion of the CASPA application so as not to delay application completion processes. Direct-Admit Pathway (Applications No Longer Accepted) The direct-admit pathway will be upheld for students who entered Butler University as first-year students in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The pathway is not applicable to prospective students for fall 2017 and beyond. The direct-admit pathway is designed for incoming University first-year students who wish to become a physician assistant. Students will complete a Bachelor of Science Degree in Health Sciences (BSHS). Students selected in the direct-admit pathway who successfully complete all requirements will be offered advancement into the PA program. These students will not be required to submit the CASPA application or GRE scores, nor will they need to complete the standard admission process (academic evaluations or nonacademic evaluations). Application Requirements Students within the direct-admit pathway are required to fulfill all criteria listed below to maintain eligibility for direct admission into the PA program. (Accreditation Standard A3.15a) A student who fails to meet any of the following requirements will lose direct-admit status but will be able to apply to the PA program using either the selective internal (if applicable) or standard admission processes. To be eligible to apply, candidates must: Maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.4 at Butler University by January 15 of year of matriculation and at the time of matriculation into the MPAS program. Earn no grade of C- or lower on first attempt of all courses. All attempts of repeated course work will be included in the GPA calculation. If a C- or lower is earned in a repeated course, an applicant is no longer eligible for this application pathway. If a course is offered for a letter grade, it must be taken as such and a grade must be received. A grade of \"pass\" or \"complete\" is acceptable for non-prerequisite courses if letter grades are not offered for the course. Not withdraw from a course. Not audit a prerequisite course prior to taking the course for a grade. Earn a Bachelor of Science Degree in Health Sciences no later than the spring semester of the fifth academic year from matriculation into the BSHS program. Students will matriculate into the MPAS program in May at the beginning of the summer semester. Maintain full-time enrollment during fall and spring semesters. Remain free of conduct code violations (per COPHS and Butler University policies). Submit Intent to Enroll Confirmation Form and $1,000 nonrefundable deposit by January 15 of the year of matriculation into the MPAS program. Students accepted into the BSHS-PA direct-admit pathway are scheduled to matriculate into the Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) program in May after four complete years of undergraduate study. A specific position is held for each of these students. Failure to submit the Intent to Enroll Confirmation Form and $1,000 deposit will be interpreted as withdrawal from the program. Graduating with a BSHS Degree in Less than Four Years If a student will receive the bachelor's degree in less than four years, he/she can request permission from the PA Program Admission Committee to enter the MPAS program early. This request must be submitted to PAadmission@butler.edu by November 1 of the fall semester a year and a half prior to the desired matriculation date. The PA Program Admission Committee will review submissions, including the requestor's academic standing, to determine if permission will be granted. This is a competitive process, as a limited number of positions may be available for this early admission. Students will be notified by January 15 of the year prior to the desired matriculation date if they have been granted permission to enter the MPAS program early. Graduating with a BSHS Degree in More than Four years Students who need additional time to complete the BSHS degree must notify the PA Program Admission Committee by November 1 of the fall term prior to their original matriculation date. A student must complete his/her degree by the end of the spring term of the fifth academic year and maintain full-time enrollment. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 188 When notifying the admission committee, the student must also submit a detailed schedule of planned courses for review. This notification must be submitted to PAadmission@butler.edu. Withdrawing from the Direct-Admit Pathway Some students may discern a different career than that of a PA or choose to attend a different program. Students who wish to remove themselves from the PA direct-admit pathway are asked to notify the program as soon as this decision is made. Notification should be sent to PAadmission@butler.edu. Automatic Withdrawal from the Direct-Admit Pathway Candidates not meeting direct-admit pathway requirements will be automatically removed. Prerequisites Students must complete the following course prerequisites with no grade of C- or lower to be considered for admission to the PA program. (Accreditation Standards A3.15b, d) Earned Advanced Placement exam scores of 4 or 5 or International Baccalaureate exam scores of 5 to 7 may substitute for prerequisite courses. Appropriately earned AP or IB scores may replace no more than two prerequisite courses. Applicants should submit copies of exam scores with applications to PAadmission@butler.edu. Chemistry o Inorganic (general) with lab (two courses) o Organic with lab (one course) o Additional chemistry course at or above the 300 level (one course) Biology o Any biology-related course at or above the 200 level (5 courses). Examples might include but are not limited to anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, genetics, microbiology, immunology, physics, bioengineering, biomedical science, exercise science, neuroscience, zoology, and nutrition. Statistics/Biostatistics o Any course (one course) Social Sciences o Any combination of psychology or sociology courses (two courses) For information about prerequisite fulfillment, course equivalencies, and unofficial transcript reviews, send inquiries to PAadmission@butler.edu. Degree Requirements Students are required to complete 108 semester hours to be awarded the MPAS degree. The proper sequence of courses must be maintained. The student is responsible for making certain that he or she has completed all required courses in the curriculum. The curriculum is offered in two sections (didactic and clinical) that are individually indivisible and to be taken in an uninterrupted sequence over two years. Therefore, it is expected that students first matriculated into the MPAS didactic year will maintain simultaneous enrollment in all courses offered as a component of each year's curriculum. Students may not progress to the course work in the next year of the program until they have successfully completed all courses within the current year. PA students must earn a grade of B- or better in all courses. PA students may be dismissed from the College following failure of any two MPAS-designated courses, in addition to not adhering to the policies listed in the COPHS or PA Student Handbook. A PA student, after presenting a written request to the dean of the College (with a copy to the PA program director), may be granted an official leave of absence for personal, medical, or academic reasons for a period not to exceed one calendar year. If the leave of absence is approved, the dean provides written notification including applicable beginning and ending dates to the student, the University Registrar, and the director of the Office of Financial Aid. The student must notify the program director in writing of his or her wish to return to the program or to extend the personal leave at least 60 calendar days prior to the start of the next appropriate reentry point. The student desiring an extension beyond one calendar year may be required to apply for readmission to the program. When a leave of absence is taken, the program director may require the student to repeat some or all of the courses completed prior to the leave of absence. In all leaves of absence, the student is required to complete the full curriculum to be eligible to earn the BS and/or MPAS degree. Any student who is absent from clinical rotations for three months or more must perform and pass an observed history and physical examination (on a real or simulated patient) before being allowed to return to clinical rotations. The student will have two opportunities, evenly spaced over a two-month period of time, to pass this assessment. If unsuccessful, the student will be dismissed from the College. For purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a school-approved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. All questions regarding financial aid or student loans should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid. Curriculum The program reserves the right to change the curriculum at the discretion of the faculty. A student must successfully complete all courses in each didactic semester before being allowed to advance to the next semester. Only students admitted to and currently enrolled in the PA program may register for courses offered as part of the curriculum numbered with MPAS designators. Such students also must maintain their eligibility to continue in the PA program.

Clinical Year The clinical phase of the program is largely composed of four- or eight-week core rotations. Core rotations include behavioral medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, general surgery, and women's health. Pediatrics, also a core rotation, is three weeks in length. At the conclusion of each core rotation, students will be required to take an examination. There is not an associated exam with the elective rotation. There is one four-week limited-elective rotation. All questions regarding rotations for PA students should be directed to the Office of Experiential Education. Advising and Registration Students must participate in early advising for clinical rotations. Further, students must be officially registered for all clinical rotations/experiences for the professional liability insurance policy carried by the University to cover students in the clinical portion of the curriculum. Students participating on rotations/experiences without registering will be referred to the Academic and Professional Affairs Committee for appropriate action (e.g., warning, probation, suspension, dismissal). End-of-Rotation Examinations The Butler University PA program faculty utilizes the Physician Assistant Education Association written End of Rotation (EOR) Examinations and endorses the objectives utilized to develop these exams as imperative to enter into practice as a physician assistant. Students will take an examination at the end of each supervised clinical practice experience. To be permitted to sit for the required EOR exam, each student must: Successfully complete the required rotation as scheduled Complete patient encounter logs using E-Value by noon on the day preceding the EOR meeting Complete the E-Value student evaluation of the preceptor by noon on the day preceding the EOR Receive approval from the director of experiential education and/or program director Failure to meet the above requirements may result in a report to the Academic and Professional Affairs Committee for appropriate action (e.g., warning, probation, suspension, dismissal). Clinical Year Course Work All rotations must be completed. Individual student rotation schedules will be determined by the director of experiential education and are subject to change at any time. Rotations are assigned within a designated radius of Butler University. Students are responsible for providing their own transportation to these sites. Topic lists are provided to direct student learning and should be used in combination with the objectives of the end-of-rotation examinations. Fifty-three credit hours over a variety of clinical rotation experiences are required in the final year of the program. Total Program Curriculum: ......................................... 108 credit hours Licensure and Experience Requirements Physician assistants who graduate from an accredited program must pass the Physician Assistant National Certifying Exam (PANCE), administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants, and receive licensure from the state where they wish to practice. Doctor of Pharmacy www.butler.edu/cophs/pharmd-program The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree program prepares students to become pharmacy practitioners who possess the knowledge and skills required to function as authorities on the use of medicines, and who can apply pharmaceutical and biomedical science to the practical problems of drug therapy. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 190 Pharmacists are capable of contributing to the interdisciplinary delivery of primary healthcare and can function as drug therapy specialists. Students also are prepared for specialty professional studies and for graduate study in the pharmaceutical sciences. Admission Applicants to the pre-professional or professional program who are nonnative English speakers are required to submit the results of the Test of Spoken English (TSE-A) or Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum requires that students complete two pre-professional years and four professional years of study. Acceptance into the professional phase of the program allows students to begin the first professional year (P1) course work. Students entering the fall semester of P1 must satisfactorily complete all math/science and other pre-professional course work required as prerequisites for enrollment in P1 professional courses. Acceptance into the professional pharmacy program by either the automatic advancement option or as an internal or external transfer student is contingent upon enrollment capacity limitations of the program. All applicants must apply through PharmCas. The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences reserves the option to modify its pharmacy program admission and advancement procedures at any time. Automatic Advancement for Pre-Pharmacy Students Entering as First-Year Students Students enrolling as first-year students at Butler University and declaring pre-pharmacy as their initial major are eligible to be automatically admitted to the P1 year of the pharmacy program upon completion of their third semester of Butler enrollment if they meet the following criteria: Cumulative GPA at Butler University of 3.0 or higher. GPA greater than 3.0 in nine selected, critical than C- in any of the pre-pharmacy courses noted above. A student may repeat a course to satisfy a subsequent course prerequisite. (Note: Withdrawals during the first student year will have no effect on the GPA calculation, but courses must be completed. A withdrawal during the fall semester, sophomore year from one of the nine classes used in the automatic advancement formula will result in loss of automatic advancement.) Successful completion of an in-person standardized interview, including evaluation of verbal communication and interpersonal skills, ethical and professional characteristics, intellectual curiosity, leadership and emotional maturity, respect and empathy for others, and creativity. Successful completion of a standardized writing prompt. Application through PharmCas Eligibility for automatic advancement into the P1 year of the pharmacy program ceases after the student's review for professional phase admission at the end of his or her third semester at Butler University. A student seeking pharmacy program admission by the automatic advancement option may not count more than three courses transferred from another university or awarded through advanced placement (AP) or the International Baccalaureate (IB) program toward the calculation of his or her automatic advancement GPA. A student failing to automatically advance to the professional pharmacy program will be considered for admission to the program on a competitive, space-available basis. Students who do not automatically advance will be placed into the regular advancement pool. This process considers the student's cumulative GPA for all course work completed at all universities, completion of the standardized writing prompt, and an attribute assessment through an interview. Transfer Students and Internal Applicants Not Classified as Pre-Pharmacy Students who enter Butler University with 12 or more credit hours completed after high school graduation are classified as transfer students. Students entering Butler as transfer students and declaring pre-pharmacy as their intended major are not eligible for admission to the P1 year of the pharmacy program via the automatic advancement option. Pre-professional transfer students, as well as Butler University students not classified as pre-pharmacy upon entry into the University as first-year students (including changes of majors), may apply for admission into the P1 class on a competitive, space-available basis. Application through PharmCas is required. This process considers the student's cumulative GPA for all course work completed at all universities, completion of a standardized writing prompt, and an attribute assessment through an interview. Requirements Students are required to complete the program of study with a minimum of 210 credit hours. Successful completion of the professional curriculum requires that the student not exceed 5 hours of course work with earned grades lower than C (2.0) in PX and RX courses numbered 300 or higher. Additionally, the student's professional GPA must be 2.0 or higher. The professional curriculum consists of those courses designated PX and RX. The proper sequence of courses must be maintained and the prerequisites for each course satisfied. The student is responsible for making certain that he or she has completed all required courses in the curriculum. All didactic course work, all earned IPPE hours (Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience), and University Core Curriculum requirements must be completed before beginning the advanced experiential rotations (APPE) in the P4 year of the curriculum. Only students admitted to and currently enrolled in the professional pharmacy program of the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences may register for courses offered as part of the curriculum numbered with RX designators. Such students must maintain their eligibility to continue in the pharmacy program.

Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 197 Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences www.butler.edu/cophs/ms-pharmaceutical- sciences The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences offers the Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences degree in five areas of emphasis: pharmaceutics, pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacy administration, and clinical sciences. The mission of the program is to educate students for pursuing research careers in the pharmaceutical/biomedical industry or in academia, and/or in obtaining advanced degrees. Admission Applicants are required to possess a basic degree in chemical, biological, or pharmaceutical sciences, or other appropriate degrees. Following admission, any applicant identified to be deficient by the Research and Graduate Review Committee with a bachelor's-level background in chemical or biological sciences will be required to take courses in the respective areas in addition to the MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences requirements. Requirements Bachelor's degree in appropriate discipline with a minimum 3.0 GPA or equivalent (official transcript required). Aptitude tests (official scores must be received from Educational Testing Services). Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) (not required of anyone with a U.S. bachelor's degree). A TOEFL score of 213 (computer-based test), or 79 (internet-based test) meets Butler University's English language proficiency requirements. Butler's TOEFL school code is 1073. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score. The minimum GRE cutoff score for admission for each year will be determined by the Research and Graduate Review Committee. Brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Personal statement indicating a specific area of research interest and career goals. Three letters of recommendation evaluating the applicant's ability to complete the program successfully. International students must meet the financial independence criteria established by the University. Each applicant is evaluated based on a comprehensive review of undergraduate transcripts, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, previous research experience, and GRE score. International applicants will be interviewed over the telephone, and domestic candidates may be invited for a campus interview. Quality publications or other scholarly experience, although not required, serve to strengthen the application. For international students, admission is valid subject to obtaining appropriate visa credentials. Meeting minimum admission requirements does not ensure admission. The admission process follows two steps: preliminary inquiry and formal application with required nonrefundable fees. The response to the preliminary inquiry will be issued by either the Butler University Office of Admission or the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences; however, the formal application can only be made to the Office of Admission. After initial screening, the Office of Admission will forward the eligible applications to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences for the decision. The director of the COPHS graduate program, in discussion with the interested research faculty, will send the recommendations to the Office of Admission. Student Status Full-time: A full-time student must take a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 12 credits of graduate-eligible courses per semester. If a graduate student is registered only for research and thesis courses (RX701-RX706) that apply toward the completion of the research projects, the student is considered to be enrolled full-time, although the number of credits enrolled may be below the normal full-time course load. A Reduced Course Load authorization form must be submitted by F-1 graduate students under any circumstance when such students are taking fewer than 9 credits. A maximum of four years is allowed to complete all the degree requirements. Part-time: Working professionals may pursue the MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences on a part-time basis. The conditions are: Applicants must comply with all admission requirements. Professionals admitted into the program must take a minimum of 3 credits per semester and complete all degree requirements within a maximum of seven years, with the didactic course work being completed within five years of entry into the program. Research toward the MS thesis must be independent of research projects ongoing at the student's place of employment and must be publishable under an affiliation with Butler University. Research must be conducted during the course of the program. Part-time students will not be eligible for any financial assistance from Butler University. The research advisor must be a full-time COPHS faculty member. Financial Assistance The College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences does not normally provide scholarships or tuition waivers for MS students. Depending on the availability of external funding, a limited number of partial-tuition stipends in the form of graduate assistantships will be provided to qualified, full-time graduate students conducting research in COPHS laboratories. Graduate assistants will be required to work up to 20 hours per week on campus on projects assigned by the director of the graduate program, subject to valid immigration status. A full-time student must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and show satisfactory progress in his or her research project to qualify for financial assistance. Tuition stipends will be competitively awarded every year, with previously awarded students given preference. Graduate assistantships will be limited to a two-year period for each recipient. Each student is required to pay regular tuition or discounted tuition and maintain approved health insurance during the course of study. There is no assurance of financial assistance for any admitted applicant. The freedom to leave the program, for any reason and at any time, will be available to all students; however, untimely withdrawal from the program causes financial and emotional distress to the University community. Therefore, to protect the University's investment, it is the policy that any student accepting the tuition stipend as a graduate assistant is expected to complete the MS program. Any such student leaving the program prior to completion and without compelling reasons will be required to pay back the full amount of the stipend that has been awarded by the University, with the only exception being compelling medical reasons. Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 198 Curriculum The master's program is an intensive curriculum of didactic courses and thesis research. Successful completion of the MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences degree will require at least 30 semester credit hours with not fewer than 6 hours of research credit. The findings of the research must be compiled into a thesis and defended with an oral presentation and an oral examination by the thesis committee. Course work is as follows: Required Core Courses for Emphasis Areas of Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, and Medicinal Chemistry (total 12 credits) RX780, Current Topics in Pharm Science* ........................................ 1 (2 semesters) Seminars in Pharm ........................................................... 1 (2 semesters) RX782, Ethics in Research RX783, Introduction to Pharm Research .......................................... 2 2 RX785, Biopharmaceutical Analysis ................................................... 3 RX790, Pharmaceutical Sciences thesis defense .............................. 0 * Each student will be enrolled in 1 credit hour of Current Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences or Seminar in Pharmaceutical Sciences per semester, for a minimum of 4 total credits in the program. Each student is required to present at least two seminars as part of his or her master's program, one of which may be the thesis defense. Students must enroll in RX781 during the semester in which their seminar presentation will take place, and RX780 during the remaining semesters. Regardless of the course in which the student is enrolled, all graduate students are required to attend all graduate seminars presented in COPHS. Elective Courses (minimum 6 credits) RX630, Advanced Toxicology .............................................................. 3 RX632, Drug Abuse\u2014Pharmacol, Chem, and Aspects ........................................................ 3 RX788, Molecular Biology/Pharmacology ........................................ 3 Additional elective courses will be included as per the recommendation of the Research and Graduate Review Committee. Deficiencies in curricular background may be addressed by requiring appropriate undergraduate courses as determined by the thesis committee and/or director of the graduate program. Additional course work and/or research credits to fulfill the requirements of the MS degree will be determined by the thesis committee. Academic Progress The Research and Graduate Review Committee will evaluate the academic progress of MS students. Master's students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 for satisfactory continuation of study. Students with a cumulative GPA below 3.0 will be placed on probation. Any appeal for non-research course grade disputes and/or disciplinary action should be submitted to the Research and Graduate Review Committee. A decision can be appealed to the COPHS Academic and Professional Affairs Committee. A decision of the thesis committee on the thesis and the thesis defense will be considered final. A grade of incomplete will be assigned for Research and Thesis (RX701-RX706) at the end of the respective semester until the thesis defense is complete, as it is difficult to justify the research outcomes based on the student's performance for a particular semester. Research Proposal A research proposal summarizing the goals, objectives, and timeline of the research project must be submitted within one year of admission. The proposal must be approved by the thesis committee and the director of the graduate program. Classified or Proprietary Study Each MS student is required to submit a thesis and present an open seminar on his or her research findings. In addition, the student is required to disseminate the research findings at national meetings and submit manuscript(s) for publication. Therefore, in order to protect the student's interest, it is not advisable to involve him or her in any classified or proprietary research. MS Thesis Each student is required to submit a thesis prepared on the research findings. The thesis should be compiled following the format provided. Publication The research project should aim at publication of the findings in peer-reviewed research journals and submission of the work as preliminary data for extramural funding by the research advisor. Thesis Defense The student will present an open seminar and appear for an oral examination by the thesis committee. The committee will recommend the graduation of the student to the faculty and to the dean of COPHS subject to satisfactory completion of the didactic courses and other requirements. A student failing in the open seminar or the oral examination may appear for a second opportunity to complete the specific part of the thesis defense. Student Ownership of Intellectual Property For students who help create a copyrightable work or patentable invention with one or more University employees (faculty and/or staff ), the following guidelines from the University's Intellectual Property Manual may help determine when the University has certain rights in a work or invention the student Butler University Bulletin 2018-2019 _______________________________________ _______________________________________ Page 199 has been involved in producing while at Butler. If the work or invention was created or conceived with the \"substantial use\" of University resources, then the work or invention may be subject to University ownership and control, with the student and/or faculty member having certain rights as described in the University Intellectual Property Policy. For example, rights in a patentable invention arising from a student's participation in a faculty research project that makes \"substantial use\" of University resources will be owned by the University, with any income from the patents being shared between the University, faculty, and student as set forth in the University Intellectual Property Policy. The policy thereby establishes the means and incentive for commercialization of the invention. The rights vest with the University. However, the ownership of copyrightable works that are not produced at the direction of the University, even those created with \"substantial use\" of University resources, will generally continue to be owned by the creators of the work with some rights being reserved for the University. While the above is a general overview with some examples, do not hesitate to ask a faculty member for guidance, or refer to the Butler University Intellectual Property Manual, at www.butler.edu/birs, for specific guidelines. Additionally, the Butler Institute for Research and Scholarship is a valuable resource to help with questions related to these matters, and it can help ensure that any intellectual property is properly protected and given the best opportunity to be commercialized.

Set within a broad-based curriculum in the liberal arts, the program capitalizes on individual creative strengths while emphasizing digital, traditional, and sustainable processes. Integration. Every course in the program integrates art and design, utilizing a hybrid approach that combines critical thinking with processes pertinent for both arts and designers as well as methods of creation that are both traditional and digital. Creativity. Creativity is nurtured through emphasis in idea generation. Focused on responding to themes and processes rather than fulfilling assignments, students learn to trust their intuition and gain confidence as authors of their own work. Flexibility. The program is designed to be flexible in response to rapidly expanding career opportunities. Innovative course work allows students to strategize with both traditional and nontraditional materials and customize projects to their specific interests. Sustainability. The program promotes the ecological practice of reuse and repurposing of sustainable materials. Students are provided practical experiences and marketable skills to sustain a lifetime of creativity. Collaboration. Collaboration is a critical skill for future artists and designers. Collaborative environments prepare students to work professionally as part of a team\u2014sharing, exchanging, and accepting divergent viewpoints. Required internships with nonprofit and corporate organizations expand students' range of collaborative abilities and provide career-building opportunities. Leadership. The art program offers the professional dexterity to promote leadership by setting high standards of achievement in initiative, innovation, and communication. Students are expected to develop, articulate, and realize a personal vision. In the classroom and beyond, students strive for excellence in artistic creation and professional practice.

Butler University is a fully accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre. Butler theatre students develop their own voices through rigorous study and collaborative practice. We prepare students to push the boundaries of theatre and integrate their theatre training into purposeful lives. With the practical conditions for theatre artists constantly evolving, the Butler University Department of Theatre offers students the experience, skills, and initiative to navigate a rapidly changing environment and pursue their aspirations with determination and purpose. Butler Theatre's distinctive, collaborative work extends beyond the curriculum, offering a depth and breadth of research, practice, and experience. The curriculum is designed to educate the whole person and to prepare future theatre artists to enter and transform the field or apply knowledge, communication, and problem-solving skills regardless of their eventual profession. Within the frame of Butler University's liberal arts education, our practice-based, international tradition surpasses a conventional academic approach, bringing students into dialogue with extraordinary artists and institutions worldwide. Complementing a faculty of international professionals, the department maintains relationships with significant guest artists, the Indiana Repertory Theatre, the Phoenix Theatre, and the Indianapolis Shakespeare Company. We continue a unique partnership with the Moscow Art Theatre School, as well as study programs at destinations around the world. The Christel DeHaan Visiting International Theatre Artist Program is a unique and exciting program that connects Butler students with prominent theatre artists from around the world. Our goal is to contribute to a community of citizen artists who are broadly and rigorously prepared to work effectively and innovatively across artistic approaches, venues, and technologies, and by extension to engage in the continuing conversation about what it means to be human.

Pulliam School of Journalism www.butler.edu/journalism Why Study Journalism? Journalism is all around us. It appears on our televisions, computers, mobile devices, and on the printed page. It is both a discipline that is indispensable to the world's democratic societies and an approach to communication that has been universally adopted by news organizations and the media industry as well as government bodies, law firms, trade associations, corporations, nonprofit groups, and digital entrepreneurs. In fact, almost every profession uses the knowledge, skills, and mind-set of journalism to tell its stories and present information.

As highly innovative and creative professionals, journalists today use a wide range of digital tools and investigative approaches to produce meaningful, multidimensional content and stories that inform, teach, attract, entertain, and engage audiences. Individuals who produce journalism are adept at finding, questioning, analyzing, interpreting, and explaining complex information and data.

Strategic communication emphasizes the creation and distribution of socially responsible, research-supported, and theoretically sound targeted communication messages for both internal and external audiences. Strategic communication majors, therefore, learn the theories and skills required for successful written, visual, and oral communication. In addition, majors gain valuable skills related to research, planning, strategic thinking, and problem solving that will serve them well in professional careers or graduate school. Why Study Strategic Communication at Butler? While many programs offer courses in advertising and public relations, few have successfully merged their curriculum to reflect the increased blurring of lines between these two disciplines. Butler's Strategic Communication Department, however, recognizes that it is necessary for our majors to understand the synergistic nature of advertising and public relations to succeed in the diverse fields that comprise strategic communication. But success in strategic communication relies on more than this, of course. Our courses are rigorous, highly interactive, and experiential. Students are not only introduced to concepts, processes, and theories, but also are challenged to apply their knowledge to solve real-world strategic communication challenges through problem-based learning and service-learning opportunities, and national-level public relations and advertising competitions. We like to say that our students \"practice the profession\" from day one. Class sizes are also small, typically around 18 students, and led by passionate and dedicated professors. Strategic communication students also learn outside of the classroom as active participants in the various extracurricular opportunities the program offers. Through participation in the Public Relations Student Society of America Butler University chapter, ADrenaline advertising club, and an internship program, our students have outstanding experiential learning opportunities with a diverse array of businesses, advertising, and public relations agencies, as well as government and nonprofit organizations in Indianapolis and throughout the country. In this way, students gain the real-world knowledge necessary for a successful career. Strategic Communication Student Learning Outcomes In keeping with the liberal arts tradition, students majoring in strategic communication will gain a broad-based education that emphasizes an understanding of the larger cultural context in which strategic communication occurs. On a practical level, students will also gain the theoretical foundation and industry-relevant skills to create and produce effective oral, written, and visual communication messages for distribution via a diversity of media, including print, broadcast, and digital platforms. To achieve these ends, students learn to research, analyze, select, and organize relevant data and information; they learn and apply relevant analytical or theoretical frameworks to professional practices and situations; they critique and evaluate the effectiveness of communication messages; they work collaboratively to achieve desired goals; and they integrate communication technology effectively into all of these efforts. Further, as the strategic communication major emphasizes the production of socially responsible messages, students learn to appreciate and respect the professional, ethical, and legal standards that govern our field.
