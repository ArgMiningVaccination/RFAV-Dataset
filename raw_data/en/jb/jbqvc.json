Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 3 of 45 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Magee Rehabilitation Hospital, a tax -exempt hospital in Philadelphia, developed and conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in accordance with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For the purposes of the CHNA, the Hospital focuse d on the population it serves - adults with disabilities. Survey questions pertained to physical and mental health , as well as access to and utilization of health and social services. Respondents reside throughout the greater Philadelphia region, includin g Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Most of the respondents have incurred life -changing injuries and illnesses including, but not limited to, spinal cord injury, stroke, acquired brain injury , amputation, multi -trauma and other catastrophic injuries and illnesses. Individuals with Disabilities An individual can develop a disabling impairment or chronic condition at any point in life. Living with a disability often requires unique health and s ocial supports. Understanding population level needs for individuals with disabilities can be challenging as they are often under -represented in population -based surveys and other outreach efforts. About 90 percent of the 301 survey respondents are curren t or former patients at Magee, so responses are biased toward those receiving care at Magee and may not represent the larger community of adults with disabilities. Key findings Need for additional caregiver support for daily activities 67% of responden ts require personal assistance for major life activities, but 21% of those respondents reported that they were unable to get the help they needed for activities of daily living and driving to doctor appointments 67% of those requiring assistance reported t hat family members or friends generally provided the care they needed and were unpaid for these services Health status 32% rate their health as fair or poor compared to 19.2% of adults in Southeastern PA (2018 PHMC Household Health survey) 40% report chronic pain 50% had fallen within the past year 16% reported some level of food insecurity All but 4 respondents indicated that they had some form of health insurance (51% had Medicare, 23% had Medicaid, and 40% had access to private health insurance) Access to health screening and preventive health services 3% reported that they are not able to get the medications they need (44% due to cost, 22% due to transportation issues) This compares favorably with the results from the 2018 PMHC HHS Adult survey wh ere 13% reported an inability to get medications .

Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 5 of 45 Community Health Needs Assessment Process To conduct the Community Health Needs Assessment , Magee Rehabilitation Hospital convened a working group that included administrative staff and specially selected interns , under the advisement of upper management. The CHNA survey contained 79 questions and was launched in December 2018 and closed in Febr uary 201 9. The survey was distributed to current outpatients and former Magee Rehabilitation Hospital inpatients via the Hospital's Lifetime Follow -Up Clinic and various Outpatient programs. The survey was also distributed by various other organizations that serve adults with disabilities, such as the Mayor 's Commission on People with Disabilities. The survey was available either on paper or online , via Survey Monkey , and 301 individuals completed the survey. Of those who re sponded, 228 individuals, (89.41%), reported being current or former inpatients and/or outpatients at Magee, so it should be noted this sample is biased toward those receiving services at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital. Because Magee Rehabilitation provides extensive lifetime follow -up to the persons served, the responses of Magee's patients may not be representative of the larger community of adults with disabilities. The CHNA survey was divided into seven main sections , including: Disability Accessing Health and Social Services Income and Employment Housing and Transportation Technology and Assistive Devices Community Participation Individual Information Themes and Major Community Health Needs - Accessible and affordable housing - Reliable and timely transportation , especially for physician appointments, but also for daily needs and desires - Employment opportunities - Opportunities for exercise - Access to health screening and preventive health services - Need for additional caregiver support for daily activi ties Recommendations: - Provide assistance in identifying and accessing the waiting lists for accessible housing - Provide information regarding available transportation services and facilitate the process for accessing these services. Continue to advocate f or additional services . - Refer interested patients to employment services. Continue to advocate for an overhaul of the disability system, so that people with disabilities are able to work without losing the attendant care services that they need. - Continue t o grow wellness programs and increase community education , so that persons with disabilities are aware of what is available to them. Raise awareness of other wellness venues in the community that are accessible to persons with disabilities. - Continue to ad vocate and educate about the need for more accessible healthcare offices and access to preventive care and health screening for persons with disabilities.

Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 9 of 45 SURVEY DISTRIBUTION AND COLLECTION To collect the data on the topic areas identified in the preliminary research, the Hospital constructed a survey that addressed the following topics: disability; health and social services; income and employment; housing and transportation; technology and assistive devices; community participation; and individual information. The survey , which contained 79 questions (Figure 2 A), was launched on December 4 , 2018 and closed on February 14, 201 9. Significant changes were made to the 2016 questions . The survey was distributed and collected in three ways: 1) Online : The survey was developed in the online tool , SurveyMonkey, and shared in waves via email to individuals and organizations serving people living with disabilities. a. The first wave of electronic sur veys was emailed in early December to Magee's peer mentor s, volunteers , wheelchair sports teams , and support groups. Reminder messages and links were sent regularly. b. Magee staff were also sent the link to the survey and asked to share with people living with disabilit ies and/or organizations serving individual s with disabilities on December 18, 2018 . c. The second wave of electronic surveys was emailed on January 14, 2019 to the Mayor's Commission o n People with Disabilities and member organizations serving individuals with disabilities. d. The online survey was also shared on Magee's website, Twitter and Facebook pages regularly . 2) Hard -Copy : Paper versions of the surve y were available at Magee 's main hospital, as well as Magee outpatient centers. Versions of this survey were shared with organizations that requested hard -copies. 3) Administered : In the event that the person was unable to take the survey without assistance, Magee volunteers administered surveys in private spaces at the Hospital and its outpatient centers. Online survey results were collected via SurveyMonkey, which provided detailed statistics on responses. Open -ended questions and \"Other\" responses were reviewed by working group staff and categorized appropriately . Hard -copy and administered surveys w ere reviewed and entered into SurveyMonkey by trained Magee volunteers and marked as non -electronic entry . All paper surveys will be kept on file. ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY At the close of the survey, results for each question were tabulated and measured in pe rcentages . The Hospital compared the results from the survey with statistics from the Public Health Management Corporation's (PHMC) Community Health Database, the Department of Health for Philadelphia County's database , and 201 7 estimated Census data. From there, the Hospital identifie d those areas where statistically significant differences (5%) could be seen between the general population of the geographic community served and the special population served. These areas where significant differences between Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey?

Continue to advocate for an overhaul of the disability system, so that people with disabilities are able to work without losing the attendant care services that they need. - Continue to grow wel lness programs and increase community education , so that persons with disabilities are aware of what is available to them. Raise awareness of other wellness venues in the community that are accessible to persons with disabilities. - Continue to advocate and educate about the need for more accessible healthcare offices and access to preventive care and health screening for persons with disabilities. Housing While a majority of survey respondents w ere satisfied with their current housing, there is a known lack of accessible housing within Philadelphia. More than 26% of respondents could not enter or leave their home independently, and 28% indicated that sidewalks, ramps, and curb cutouts were either missing or in disrepair. Among the 16% of survey participa nts whose housing did not meet their needs, the most common request was a ramp for their home or apartment. Lack of an accessible bathroom was frequently noted .. The Philadelphia Housing Authority offers public housing options for the residents of Phila delphia with financial need, including units with various features to meet the needs of individuals with mobility, hearing, or vision impairments. Unfortunately, the wait lists are often very long, and it may take several years for a person to have the opp ortunity to obtain accessible housing. PHA notes that a full-time accessibility coordinator is on staff to ensure that individuals with disabilities receive a preferred spot on the housing waiting lists and receive reasonable accommodations to meet their needs, including wheelchair lifts, enlarged entrances, visual smoke detector systems, or space for a live -in aide if required. Other housing authorities in the area, including the Delaware County Housing Authority, Montgomery County Housing Authority and C hester County Housing Authority, offer similar accommodations for those living with disabilities.

Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 16 of 45 The Philadelphia Office of Housing and Community Development (OHCD) established the Housing and Disability Technical Assistance Program, TAP, in December of 1999. TAP provides the most up -to-date information on accessible housing, fair housing laws and regulations, financial and technical resources, model projects and other issues related to housing for people with disabilities in the City of Philadelphia. TAP includes a Home Finder and the Philly Primer, which provides information on home buying. There are also several private and non-profit organizations in the community that provide these services. The Inglis Organiz ation provides 380 accessible and affordable apartments. They provide affordable independent living opportunities to Philadelphians with disabilities in units that exceed ADA guidelines. Inglis House properties also include options for nursing and rehabili tative care and day services for those in need. Liberty Resources, Inc. is a non -profit consumer driven organization that advocates and promotes Independent Living for persons with disabilities. Similarly, the Center fo r Independent Living of South Central Pennsylvania provides supportive services to persons with disabilities who wish to increase or maintain their level of independence in the community and at home and offer housing advocacy. In addition to helping peop le secure accessible housing, there are also community resources available that advocate on behalf of renters. The Legal Clinic for the Disabled (LCD) provides legal support for tenants in housing issues. LCD is hou sed in the offices of Magee Rehabilitation Hospital, and provides free high - quality legal services to low -income people with physical disabilities and to the deaf and hard of hearing in Philadelphia, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties. Movi ng forward, Magee will continue to inform patients of the resources that are available within the community and will continue to advocate for the construction of more accessible housing. Reliable and Consistent Transportation for People Living with Disab ilities A majority of those surveyed use their own car or have family members or friends for transportation. While many respondents are satisfied with their current means of transportation, others expressed frustration with public transportation . Specific frustrations revolved around being late to appointments, the inability to go where they needed to go, and inability t o travel at the time they wished . These are common complaints heard daily in Magee's outpatient centers. Additionally, when asked what typ e of adaptive equipment they needed but did not have, many respondents indicated they needed larger vehicles to hold their wheelchairs. Magee currently provides shuttle service between the hospital and the Riverfront Outpatient Center . Additionally, Magee case managers provide patients with information related to transportation resources and assist them in accessing those resources. As appropriate, therapists work with patients to practice using public transportation. Beyond these activities, Magee will continue to advocate for improved transportation options for the community of persons with disabilities . Currently, several organizations seek to meet th e transportation need s for the community of persons with disabilities. SEPTA , the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, serves Philadelphia and surrounding counties. SEPTA offers a Disability Hotline and Accessible Services . All SEPTA buses are accessible for individuals living with disabilities, and there are currently more than 100 accessible train stations. Other publicly operated transportation services that offer accessible services include New Jersey Transit and Delaware Transit Corporation. SEPTA, Ne w Jersey Transit and DART also offer Paratransit Services. These services are for people with disabilities who are unable to use regular accessible fixed -Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 17 of 45 route services for some or all of their transportation needs. With Paratransit, individuals can travel within the region where service is offered. Regional public transportation services, such as Rabbit Transit and Pottstown Urban Transit , offer specific programs for people living with disabilities, including accessible fixed routes, Persons with Disabilities shared ride programs and others. The Philadelphia Corporation for Aging offers Attendant Transportation Servi ce, which provides door -through -door and upper floor assistance to impaired older adults, and the Medical Assistance Transportation Program provides transportation to any health care service covered by Medical Assistance, such as doctor's visits, pharmacy for prescriptions, therapy, etc. Additionally, there are many privately operated accessible transportation services available. Regional privately operated accessible transportation services include TransNet , ROVER Community Transportation , Bucks County Transport , and Delaware County Community Transit . Each of these s ervices provides transportation for people living with disabilities. Uber offers a program called WAV , where users in select cities, (Chicago, District of Columbia, New York City, and Philadelphia), get r ides on their own schedule in a wheelchair assessable vehicle. Employment Of the population surveyed, less than 2 5% indicated wages and earnings as their primary source of income, compared with more than 71% of the population of Philadelphia County.2 This difference is staggering. While many of the people surveyed cited disability as the primary reason they were not working, a large group expressed the desire to work. One of the major barriers is that persons with disabilities often lose their state waiv er-supported services if they earn more than a minimal income. Thus, if they accept employment, they may lose the help they need to get out of bed and perform self -care and activities of daily living, and they become unable to work. This is a problem that needs a comprehensive solution at the state and federal level. Magee will continue to advocate for such solutions. There are a variety of organizations throughout the geographic area that provide employment services . These include: The Office of Vocational Rehabilitation , which offers services and compensation for Pennsylvania residents with disabilities. The Ticket to Work program helps to reduce the barriers to employment for people with disabilities by emphasizing work incentives an d more choices of services leading to work or better wages. Programs Employing People is an organization that offers education, jobs and support for people with mild and moderate disabilities. PEP also offers produ ction work center options for local individuals . This pays for assembly line work with multiple business contracts and matches people with employers in the community. The Sierra Group offers an array of recru iting, consulting and training services designed to reverse the high unemployment rate of people living with disabilities. In addition to helping individuals with disabilities secure jobs, there are also organizations that provide training. InspiriTec of fers vocational training programs to enable people living with disabilities to gain skills and jobs in the information technology field. Programs include computer assembly and repair/networking, applications development and programming, and web design and development. Magee often refers patients and their families to these resources. Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 18 of 45 Wellness Services Through the survey and review of public data, Magee identified a strong need for programs that address wellness for the geographic community and the special population served. The survey found that 4 2% of respondents do not regularly participate in exercise two or more days per week, and 29% never participate . This is significantly more than adults in Philadelphia County. According t o the PHMC's Community Health Data Base Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Survey, only 19% of adults in Philadelphia indicate they never exercise or exercise less than once a week.1 Of the survey respondents that did not participate in regular exercise, some of the most common reasons were lack of knowledge about the types of exercises they should do and that their local gyms were not accessible. To address this health need, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital created the Magee Health and Wellness Center at the Hospital's Riverfront Outpatient Center in South Philadelphia. The Wellness Center offers flexible hours, a variety of levels of membership and specialized equipment that can be used by people with disabilities. Treadmills, free weights, elliptical, arm bike and NuStep (a cross between a recumbent bike and an elliptical machine), accompany more specialized equipment, such as the RTI bike with its e lectrical stimulation, and Motomed, a multi -fitness trainer and a Total Gym, so individuals with a broad array of disabilities can participate in physical activity. Membership is open to the community for a nominal fee and s cholarships are provided as need ed. In order to address the common concern that people living with disabilities were unsure of the exercises appropriate for them, all Wellness Center users meet with the director of the Center before they become members to talk about their health and fi tness goals. The director then develops a personalized fitness plan and shows them how to use all the equipment. Physical and occupational therapists are available if any questions arise during workouts. The Wellness Center also offers yoga classes. Of th e total survey respondents, 87% indicated they have not participated in adaptive sports in the past three years . When asked how they would like to be involved in their community or what they would like to do that their disability has prevented, sports and athletics was a common desire. To address this need, Magee offers a Wheelchair Sports Program that includes basketball, rugby, tennis, and hand -cycling for individuals with di sabilities. While most Magee athletes participate as a recreational outlet, several do compete in regional, national, and even international sporting events. Magee employs a wheelchair sports coordinator to lead the program, and about 50 individuals active ly participat e. Any adult with a disability can participate in the program free of charge. A variety of Magee's support groups and clubs, including the Stroke Club, peer mentors and others, as referenced in the education section, support the Hospital's geographic and special communities in a wellness capacity. These are documented and explained in the Education section of this report (s ee page 23). There are also community organizations that offer adaptive sports programs for people living with disabili ties, many of which act as Magee partners. Philadelphia Department of Recreation offers a year - round program in a 6.4 -acre indoor and outdoor complex called the Carousel House , which includes a playground, fi tness track, gymnasium, exercise room with wheelchair accessible weight equipment, and 1 (2015 ). Public Health Management Corporation Co mmunity Health Data Base's (2014 ) Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey. Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 19 of 45 swimming pool with an adjustable floor. Activities include swimming, dance, athletics, summer day camp, martial arts, weight lifting, nature walks, track meets and othe r athletic tournaments. The Philadelphia Center for Adapted Sports is a non -profit organization providing sport and recreation programs for people with disabilities. Magee refers individuals to this organization. Similarly, YMCAs in the Greater Philadelphi a area offer adapted aquatics at all locations, and some locations offer additional adaptive sports options for children with physical or emotional limitations including martial arts, soccer, basketball or gymnastics. There are several specialized adaptiv e sports program s within the community. The Eastern Amputee Golf Association is a non -profit organization designed to assist in the rehabilitation of amputees and provide for their general welfare, both physical and psychological, through the medium of golf and its associated activities . The American Dance Wheels is an artistic organization that trains individuals with disabilities, their able -bodied partners , and b allroom dance teachers and occupational and physical therapists the art of wheelchair ballroom and Latin dancing . All Riders Up is a non-profit charitable organization that provides area residents with special ne eds a way to exercise, improve balance and coordination, strengthen core muscles, and develop self -confidence by learning to ride horses. To advance wellness in the community of people with spinal cord injury, Magee created the SCI Medical Home in 2015. Emerging trends in healthcare delivery have increasingly looked to the patient -centered medical home to prevent medical complications, reduce hospital re -admissions, improve patient health, and reduce the total cost of care. The SCI Medical Home is not a physical place, but rather, a bundle of services and a support system for persons with new spinal cord injuries and their care providers, as they make the transition from inpatient rehabilitation to home and community. Medical Home participants have the su pport of a dedicated healthcare team that provides comprehensive care and services, with the goal of maximizing health and wellness and reducing emergency room visits, readmissions, and other medical complications. Participants in the SCI Medical Home rec eive close supervision from physiatrists, case managers, pharmacists, and certified rehabilitation nurses. Other specialized services, such as wound management, nutrition, and urology are available as needed. Patients have access to a Medical Home hotline for 24/7 medical guidance. In addition to addressing medical needs, staff help participants address social determinants of health, such as food insecurity, housing and homelessness, unemployment, financial issues, and other barriers to wellness, including environmental barriers to care, such as transportation and a lack of accessibility. Since its inception, the SCI Medical Home has reduced re -hospitalizations and ED visits by more than 10%. In 2017, Magee completed a $4 .5 million construction project with a focus on therapy and patient wellness: The Creative Therapy Center and Healing Gardens . A diverse team worked with landscape designers and other specialists to create rooftop gardens and therapeutic spaces that physically transformed the hospital's sixt h floor rooftop, as well as transforming the way care was delivered. The design also added an Art Therapy Studio , Art Galler ies, a Meditation Garden & Spirituality Center, Patient Resource Center and a Three Seasons Therapy Area. Magee is the only acute rehabilitation hospital in the area to offer music therapy .. This program uses music within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. After assessing the strengths and needs of each client, the mu sic therapist provides the indicated treatment including creating, singing, moving to, and/or listening to music. Through musical involvement in the therapeutic context, clients' abilities are strengthened and transferred to other areas Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 20 of 45 of their lives. Mus ic therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves in words. Additionally, Magee provides patients with a horticultural therapy program and access to a rooftop greenhous e. Horticultural Therapy has benefits including increasing strength, range of motion, balance, and sensory stimulation and improving cognitive sequencing skills. Moving physical and occupational therapy sessions out of the gym and into the outdoors create s a dramatically different environment for Magee patients. They are able to leave the typical hospital environment , many for the first time in weeks, to learn the skills that will help them live a meaningful, active, and dignified life with their disability. The Assistive Technology Center (ATC) at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital is a unique hospital -based program provided by occupational and physical therapists to help people with disabilities manage barriers that impede mobility or communication function. A ssistive technology can range from low -tech switches to high -tech communication and wheelchair systems. This specialized equipment enables people to function independently in areas where they would otherwise have difficulty, need assistance or be unable to participate. Staff at the center maximize patient independence by focusing on strengths and using equipment and technology to overcome impairments and improve overall quality of life. Once the most effective equipment is identified, therapists assist the patient and their families to obtain the needed equipment. Inpatients may trial specialized equipment in their rooms , and outpatients may trial the equipment in our Assistive Technology Center. Access to Health Screening and Preventive Health Services A lack of a ccess to timely preventive health services and screening remains problematic for persons with disabilities. Most physician offices lack the necessary equipment to safely transfer persons with severe disabilities onto and off of exam tables. Stan dard mammography equipment may not be adapted for persons with limited range of motion in their arms. Even when equipment is present, office staff may not know how to use it. Accessible dental and gynecological services are very limited and may be nonexi stent in more rural areas. Though Magee assists patients to locate accessible primary care and specialty services through its Lifetime Follow-Up System of Care and SCI medical Home, obtaining that care can be very difficult because of the reason s stated a bove. To address this gap we suggest that practices refer to the document \"A blueprint for Improving Access to Primary Care for Adults with Physical Disabilities \" which can be found at: https://nyshealthfoundation.org/resource/blueprint -for-improving -access -to-primary -care -adults - physical -disabilities/ This document addresses critical elements and provides \"foundational, short -term, more easily achievable steps...\" to begin \"providing disability -competent primary care to adults with physical disabilities\" as well as advanced and longer -range steps to further bu ild disability competence. The five critical elements are : the physical plant and equipment, administration: Policies, procedures, staffing disability sensitivity and awareness training clinical expertise a disability -competent model of care Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 21 of 45 VI. Additi onal Actions in Support of People Living with Disabilities Substance Abuse Support for People Living with Disabilities Of the population surveyed, 4% indicated they believed drugs or alcohol issues affected their daily lives . Magee Rehabilitation currently addresses this need with the Addictions Mentor Program. This program , which is currently limited to inpatients, is designed to offer those who struggle with addiction issues the opportunity to talk with a specially selected and trained person who has experience as an addiction advocate. The mentors offer their support ; accompany patients to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings held at the hospital, share information and resources, and serve as a connection to the community for pat ients during their transition after an inpatient stay at Magee. Beyond the Addictions Mentor Program, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital does not intend to meet this need in the community because there are myriad organizations better sui ted for substance abuse support within the Hospital's geographic community. Magee continues to refer patients to these community organizations when appropriate. In addition to public and private support groups throughout the area, the City of Philadelphia's Office of Addiction Services (OAS) plans, funds and monitors substance abuse prevention, intervention, treatment and recovery support services in Philadelphia. The OAS manages and comp iles an up -to-date list of addictions services and programs offered throughout the area, as well as special populations served. These institutions provide specialized care to meet this particular health need of the Hospital's communities served. Access to Medications While a majority of respondents indicated they were always able to get the med ication they ne eded, 3% indicated there have been times when they were unable to do so, primarily due to cost. According to the larger 2018 PHMC survey , 16% of respondents reported that they could not afford to fill a needed prescri ption in the past year .2 Thus, it is unlikely that our biased survey sample reflects the experience of the larger population of persons with disabilities in this region. Rather, it likely reflects a population that is relatively well connected to services through its affiliation with Magee. To support medication adherence after discharge from Magee, Magee offers a service to inpatients that delivers medications to each patient's bedside prior to discharge. Prior to discharge, the interdisciplinary team develops a home medicatio n list and assures that all medications will be available and affordable to the patient after discharge. All medications, including prescription and over -the-counter medications are evaluated. The medical team considers alternative, less expensive therapi es whenever possible , and other financial means of support are explored. Patient and caregiver counseling , provided by the interdisciplinary team , stress es the importance of medication adherence and look s to identify barriers that may keep patients from ta king their medications. Medication education, schedules , pillboxes and other assistive devices are made available. In addition to the services, Magee provides to its patients, there are a variety of organizations throughout the geographic area that currently provide services to the community at large . The Partnership for 2 (2018). Public Health Management Corporation Co mmunity Health Data Base's (2018 ) Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey. Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 22 of 45 Prescription Assistance helps patients find assistance programs (private and public) for their needs, free of charge. In New Jersey, there are two pharmaceutical assistance programs for seniors . Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) and Senior Gold are state -funded prescription programs that help eligible New Jersey residents with the cost of prescribed medications. National resources that are also available include t he American's Drug Card , which is a discount prescription card that is accepted at many pharmacies. Magee staff refers patients and their families to these resources. Education and Support for Those with Disabilities and Their Loved Ones Through its Lifetime follow -up clinic, Magee continues to provide education and support to individuals with new disabilities and their loved ones. Magee Rehabilitation Hospital offers a variety of peer mentoring programs and support groups aimed at educating adults living with disabilities and their families. These programs are open to all members of the community and are not limited to patients or former patients. The Peer Mentor Program at Magee is designed to offer someone who is newly injured the opportunity to talk with a specially selected and trained person with a spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury or amputation who has returned to a full and meaningful life. The pro gram not only provides a support system and resource network, but also promotes independent living t o the level that is attainable. Anyone in the community, regardless of whether or not they have been a patient at the Hospital , is able to become a Peer Men tor. Additionally, the Peer Mentor program recently began offering sessions via Skype, to help circumvent any transportation challenges that might otherwise keep someone from meeting with a peer. The Family Peer Mentor groups are set up similarly to the i njury -based Peer Mentor groups. Mentors are family members of people who have sustained a spinal cord injury, stroke or brain injury. They are volunteers who are specially trained to guide and provide information and experiences to families and loved ones of newly injured individuals. Mentoring can be done in the form of participating in the family group, which is held twice, monthly at Magee or contacting a new family by telephone or face to face if possible. In addition to the Peer Mentor Programs, Mage e also offers several support groups open to the community that are designed to provide education to those living with disabilities on how to live a full life with their new functional limitations. The Spinal Cord Injury Support Group provides education, r ecreation and support opportunities to individuals with spinal cord injuries. Traditionally, meetings are held at Magee on the second Thursday of every month , and regular social outings are scheduled. The Amputee Support Group consists of social meetings and events in additions to guest speakers on a variety of topics. Meetings are held the second Tuesday of each month at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital . The Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) Young Adult Group gives young adults access to leisure and recreational act ivities in a supportive environment. These social outings happen every other month and are planned by the group members. There are also community support groups for people who have had a stroke or brain injury. The Stroke Club is a social group for peopl e who have had strokes, but also provides a regular education component. The club meets every month to socialize, share experiences and provide support to one another. For those who have had strokes or brain injur ies and are non -verbal, the Aphasia Communi ty Support Group provides an opportunity to practice speech and language skills in a safe and supportive environment; provides education about aphasia; and encourages socialization among the members. Additionally, there Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 23 of 45 are also specialty education groups Magee offers to members of the community. The Spinal Cord Injury and Sexuality Educational Support Group meets every other Tuesday at Magee Rehabilitation Hospital . Lastly, Magee offers \" Day in the Life Videos \" for individuals with spinal cord injuries. There are four educational videos featuring actual accounts of daily community skills from a person with a spinal cord injury who uses a wheelchair in a home or city environment. The videos will give individuals a foundation of skills to use when they return home and offer adaptations and techniques that have helped others to be successful in their home and community environments. Each video includes a demonstration by someone using a wheelchair in dif ferent environments. The topics addressed in these videos include cooking and kitchen mobility, home mobility, community mobility and general health and fitness. These videos are available on Magee's website and YouTube channel as well as through DVD distr ibution. Each of these education programs aimed at individuals living with disabilities in Magee's geographic community is open to the public. They address a health need otherwise unmet in the area. To build community awareness of these programs and to ex pand their reach, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital added a special Ask a Peer section to the hospital blog at blog.mageerehab.org , which discusses issues in the disability and geographic community. For those unable to attend support group meetings or unsure a bout meeting with a peer mentor, this format allow s them to ask their questions in an anonymous venue and have them answered by a trained peer mentor. In this way, the hospital hopes to increase awareness of this service to the community and expand the way s people can participate. In addition to these programs, Magee has created an online educational resource of caregivers, family members and friends of people living with disabilities. The Caregiver Support section of Magee Rehabilitation Hospital website is designed to assist caregivers of persons with traumatic brain injury. This resource provides educational modules to read or view to increase caregiving knowledge. The current modules available include brain physiology, community resources and coping. While there are few, there are also community resources addressing these educational needs. The Center for Independent Living of South Central Pennsylvania provides suppor tive services to persons with disabilities who wish to increase or maintain their level of independence in the community or at home. ILLNESS AND INJURY PREVENTION Through the survey, as well as results from public data, the Hospital identified illness and injury prevention as a health need for the geographic community. Of those surveyed, only 5% have had their disability since birth, and a majority of the remaining respondents indicated their disability was caused by something preventable. The Philadelphia Department of Public Health's Vital Statistics Report of 2015 found assaults and homicides are the leading causes of death of people age 15 to 24.3 As such, ther e is a particular need to address violence as a cause of disability in youth in the geographic community. To address this health need, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital offers the Think First program . This award -winning program for teens and young adults is offered to schools and organizations in the Delaware Valley, and stresses prevention and \"thinking first\" in order to prevent permanent brain and spinal cord injuries. The program is presented in assembly forum to groups of young people, ranging from 1 5 to 300. The program is led by Keith Newerla 3 (2018). Gujar, Vibha; Siegel, Claud ia and Washington, Raynard. Vital Statistics Report Philadelphia: 2015. Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 24 of 45 and features speakers telling firsthand stories of how \"thinking first\" could have prevented their life - changing injury . Since 2015, t he program has been offered to more than 100 schools and community groups , and offered free of charge. The program a nnually reaches more than 5,000 individuals ages 13 to 19. Another potentially preventable, disability -causing illness prevalent in the community is stroke. The Philadelphia County Department of Health's Philadelphia County Health Profile 201 5 found that stroke is the fourth leading cause of adult death in the Delaware Valley, trailing behind only heart disease and cancer. To address this health need, Magee Rehabilitation Hospital is very active within the Delaware Valley Stroke Council and hosts preventat ive blood pressure screenings open to the community. Other Magee offerings designed to address the community health need of injury and illness prevention include Magee's Brain Injury Prevention Program and Concussion Clinic . The Brain Injury Prevention Program provides brain injury education to survivors of brain injury, their families, and those who are at risk for suffering brain injury. Magee participate s annually in Brain Safety Fairs run by the Brain Injury Association of Pennsylvania . More than 300 individuals receive bicycle helmets and brain injury prevention information, and more than a dozen Magee staff members volunteer. Magee's Concussion Clinic provides concussion prevention and treatment education for high school and college students, nurses and staff as well as for sports teams, trainers and coaches as requested. The Magee Osteoporosis Clinic offers free consumer education on osteoporosis to interested audiences, which include local Senior Centers and professional groups. Additionally, the program offers free screenings using heel densitometer to these same groups, as well as Magee employees. Free screenings are also available and open to the community monthly at our Riverfront outpatient facility. Another education resource available at Magee is the Legal Clinic for the Disabled. This non -profit organization is housed within and partially funded by Magee Rehabilitation Hos pital, as Magee provides office space free of charge, as well as related overhead expenses such as supplies, computer support, etc. Its mission is to provide civil law legal services at no charge for financially eligible, disabled clients. Individuals with disabilities are referred to lawyers who have volunteered their services to LCD. Cases include wrongful evictions, co nsumer fraud, employment discrimination , and compliance failures related to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Other services include estate planning and benefit consulting. Magee support s and promotes the services provided by the Legal Clinic fo r the Disabled as an educational resource for the community. The Lifetime Fol low-Up System of Care at Magee plays an important role in provision of a full continuum of service and education throughout a person's lifetime. This System of Care provides pati ents and families with continued access to a rehabilitation physician and a team of expert rehabilitation professionals. This team provides a variety of services to help patients maintain or regain their level of physical function and good health. Case man agement is offered to coordinate each patient's lifetime care needs. All Magee inpatients, upon discharge, as well as any person who was never a patient of Magee before, can utilize this system to continue services to supplement primary care in the commun ity. The Follow -Up System at Magee offers medical, nursing, functional, psychological, nutritional, social, and vocational support and services. Specialty services available as part of the Lifetime Follow -Up System include medical clinics such as urology a nd wound care services, specialized equipment and assistive technology clinics, case management services, nutritional supplement program, bowel and bladder management, spasticity management (baclofen pump or Botox ), podiatry , and rehab physician services. The Follow -Up Clinic Magee Rehabilitation Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 2019 Questions about the survey? Contact Survey@mageerehab.org or 215 -587-3140 v1.1 Page 25 of 45 collaborates with a person's primary care physician and home care agencies to offer a comprehensive, rehab ilitation specialized and coordinated care plan. In 2015, Magee received a $300,000 grant from the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation to create the SCI Medical Home and take its existing lifetime follow -up clinical care system to the next level. Beyond the programs at Magee, there is also a community resourc e addressing this need. The Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) is a nonprofit public health institute that works to improve the health of the community through partnerships with government, foundations, b usinesses and community - based organizations. PHMC offer s services for special needs populations, health promotions, injury prevention and environmental health. (201 7). 2013 -2017 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates.

We are conducting this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in order to evaluate the health needs of our community and in accordance with The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in Mar ch 2010. This act requires all non - profit U.S. hospitals to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) every three years and to report on the findings. Magee will use the information from this community -wide survey to identify key issues for people with disabilities. This survey should be completed by the individual with the disability.
