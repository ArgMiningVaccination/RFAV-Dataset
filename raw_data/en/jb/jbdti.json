The College fosters the growth of the osteopathic profession by training physicians through programs of study guided by osteopathic medical tradition, concept and practice. PCOM is committed to the advancement of knowledge and intellectual growth t hro ugh teaching and research, and to the well-being of the community through leadership and service. EDUCATIONAL GOALS The College's educational goals focus on presenting high-quality, comprehensive programs of study that embrace the following expectations of student learning: - Students will demonstrate a central core of biomedical or behavioral science knowledge in their field of study, including the ory, foundations, clinical skills and applied clinical/practical application as appropriate to the specific academic program. - Students will demonstrate communication skills through clinical assessments, group discussion and/or written or oral presentation in their respective fields. - Students will demonstrate an understanding of scientific inquiry by designing, conducting, presenting or interpreti ng re search in their field of study and appropriate to their academic program. - Students will identify, retrieve, understand, analyze, synthesize and apply information collected from various sources and in varied formats, including those sources requiring skills in the use of information technology. - Students will develop recognition of their legal and ethical obligations as professionals and will b e a ble to apply an understanding of public policy and the social, cultural and economic factors that impact their field of study. GEORGIA BRANCH CAMPUS FOCUS The primary focus of Georgia Campus - PCOM is to recruit and educate students from Georgia and the surrounding states. The Georgia Campus seeks to retain graduate osteopathic physicians, pharmacists, biomedical scientists and other health care professionals i n the southeast, to serve the health needs of the region and advance the professions of osteopathic medicine and pharmacy. INSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY STATEMENT As active citizens in a multicultural world, the PCOM community cultivates anenvironment of inquiry, inquisitiveness and respect, promotes discovery and celebration of our differences and fosters appreciation of the rich social fabric t hat b inds us together. THE COLLEGE When osteopathic schools were forming throughout the country in the 1890's, two students at the Northern Institute of Osteopathy in Minneapolis, Mason W. Pressly and Oscar John Snyder, targeted Philadelphia as a future home for an osteopathic medical college. Although the City of Brotherly Love had a rich history of medicine, it had but one 56\"osteopathist\" by the time Pressly and Snyder graduated in 1898 and 1899, respectively. PCOM's founders were outspoken, pioneering physicians who explored and taught the use of manipulative therapy in the prevention of disease long before the use of penicillin and modern drugs. The two young osteopathic physicians followed through with their vision, incorporating the Philadelphia College and Infirmary o f Osteopathy on January 24, 1899. The first PCIO degree was awarded to a transfer student; the first PCIO class, composed of two students, graduated in February 1900 from the fledgling College then located at 21 South 12th Street. The College prospered and moved through a number of sites in its first century, including 1715 North Broad Street, 832 Pine Street, 19th and Spring Garden, 48th and Spruce, a nd finally, City Avenue. During this growth period, the medical curriculum intensified, osteopathic research was initiated, and clinic and hospital services grew rapidly as the medical school's student body and faculty expanded dramatically. After nearly a century of training physicians, PCOM opened its first graduate degree program, the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences, in 1993. The first fi ve g raduates in June 1995 marked the beginning of yet another period of growth for the College - the development of a graduate school. Today, more than 800 graduate students are enrolledin PCOM's masters and doctoral degree programs. PCOM's graduate students pursue studies at the master's level in biomedical sciences, mental health counseling, school psychology, organizational development, forensic me dicine a nd physician assistant studies. Doctoral-level study is offered in clinical psychology and school psychology with certificate programs for professionals seeking respecialization in clinical psychology or certification as school psychologists. In August 2005, the first entering osteopathic medical class began its studies at GeorgiaCampus - Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (GA-PCOM), t he College's branch campus located in Suwanee, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. GA-PCOM's mission is to help fill the need for more physicians and other health professionals in Georgia and thesurrounding states, areas that have been affected by population increases and subsequent shortages. The Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences program was established at the Georgia Campus in the 2006-2007 acade mic y ears, the PCOM School of Pharmacy opened at the Georgia Campus in Fall 2010 and the Physician Assistant program opened at the Georgia Campus In Summer 2016. The osteopathic medical programs train students who will become skilled, caring and successful physicians guided by the strengths of osteopathic principles refined during a century of medical practice, teaching and research. More than 60,000 o steopathic p hysicians practicing today are an integral part of America's health care delivery system. Today, all treatment modalities are available to osteopathic physicians, who may prescribe drugs, perform surgery and specialize in any area of medicine. DOs, whose primary care training prepares them to be highly skilled diagnosticians, are represented throughout the United States and in all branches of m ilitary service. Nearly 70 percent of main campus students are Pennsylvanians, and 75 percent of Georgia Campus students are from the southeastern states. More than 200 colleges and 21 states are represented in the student body. Supported by the best modern technology, PCOM emphasizes a practitioner-scholar approach and community orientation in all of its degree programs to prepare students for the n ew challenges facing the behavioral and the medical sciences in the 21st century.7DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AWARDED DOCTORAL DEGREES Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) - Philadelphia and Georgia CampusesDoctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) - Georgia Campus Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) - School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science and Doctor of Psychology - School Psychology (MS) (PSYD) Five Year Combined Program - Philadelphia Campus RESPEC IALIZAT ION Respecialization in School Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Respecialization in Clinical Psychology - Philadelphia Campus EDUCATIONAL SPECIALIST DEGREE Educational Specialist in School Psychology (EdS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science and Educational Specialist (MS) (EDS)Three Year Combined Program- Philadelphia Campus MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREES Master of Science in Aging and Long Term Care (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MS) - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses Master of Science in Counseling and Clinical Health Psychology (MS)- Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science in Counseling and Psychology Studies (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Forensic Medicine (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science - Physician Assistant Studies (MS) - Philadelphia Campus Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science in Organizational Development and Leadership (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science i n P ublic Health Management and Administration (MS) - Philadelphia CampusMaster of Science in School Psychology (MS) - Philadelphia CampusClinical Master of Science (MSc) - Philadelphia Campus POSTDOCTORAL CERTIFICATES Post-Doctoral Certificate in Clinical Health Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Post-Doctoral Certificate in Clinical Neuropsychology - Philadelphia Campus CERTIFICATES Certificate of Gradu ate S tudies (CGS) and Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies (CAGS) Aging and Long Term Care Administration - Philadelphia Campus Applied Behavior Analysis - Online Program Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Philadelphia Campus Organizational Development and Leadership - Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses 8Professional Psychology - Philadelphia Campus Public Health Management and Administration - Philadelphia Campus POSTDOCTORAL MEDICAL EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAMS Internship Program Traditional RotatingGeneral SurgeryInternal MedicineNeurosurgeryOphthalmologyOrthopedic SurgeryOtolaryngology Residency and CareVascular Education Continuing Medical Education 910Matriculation and Degree Conferral Matriculation and attendance at the College are privileges granted to the student inconsideration of performance of specified assignments and the maintenance of establishedstandards of personal and professional conduct.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) places certain limitations on the disclosure of personally identifiable student information maintained by PCOM with respect to stude nts; l imits access to academic records; and gives students certain rights with respect to educational records, including the right to access, the right to obtain copies, the right to seek correction of such records through informal and formal internal procedures, and the right to place a statement in such educational records explaining any information that they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. Dire ctory Information PCOM considers certain information to be \"directory information\" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and, therefore, subject to disclosure without prior consent of the student. Unless written objection is received by the Registrar, the College will treat the following as directory information to be released at the discretion of the Registrar's Office: student name, addre ss, telephone number, e-mail address, date and place of birth, dates of attendance, major field of study, Dean's list, degrees and awards received and names of undergraduate and/or graduate schools attended, internships and residencies.Right to Withhold Disclosure Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolledstudents may withhold disclosure of directory information. The Registrar's Office must receive written notification from a student indicating the information to be withheld. Should a student decide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for su ch i nformation from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. PCOM will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information indicatedby a student. However, the College cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release them should requests be received. PCOM assumes t hat failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure. Right to Consent to the Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information All personally identifiable information related to a particular student other than directory information is considered confidential information and may not be released without the written consent of the student. However, FER PA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions: 1. Other schools to which a student is transferring2. Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes 3. Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student4. Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school 5. Accrediting organization s 6 . To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, PCOM's Registrar will make reasonable attempt to notify the student 7. Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies8. State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific state law. 9. School officials with legitimate educational interest (including but not limited to administr ative, s upervisory, academic, research or support staff) 10. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBOME) - a school official is determined to have a legitimate educational interest if the information requested is required for that official to: - Perform appropriate tasks that are specified in his/her position/description or contract/agreement - Perform a task related to the student's education - Perform a task related to the discipline of a student - Provide a service or benefit relating to the student or student's family such as health care, counseling, job placement or financial aid The school official is not authorized to share this information with a third party without the student's written permission. Such information, when it has fulfilled its original purpose, should be returned to the or iginating o ffice. All other access to a student's record is granted in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Right to Inspection and Review of Records When the student matriculates, the Office of Admissions will forward the following 41materials to the Registrar's Office. Information retained in the file is as follows: - Current application - AACOMAS profile (DO students) - CASPA profile (PA students) - PharmCAS profile (PharmD students) - Transcripts - Standardized test scores (e.g., MCAT, GRE, MAT) - Letters of acceptance and prepayment - Completed Technical Standards form - Previous applications and decision-related correspond ence - Criminal background check All other materials in the applicant file are purged in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. A current or previously enrolled student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records maintained by the school. This right does not extend to applicants, those denied admission, or those admitted who do not enroll . A ten day written notice must be submitted to the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may beinspected. Other data accrued during the student's tenure at the College including, but not limited to, transcripts, NBOME Board scores, academic status letters (e.g., probation, warning,dismissal), course re lated forms (e.g., withdrawal), name change, and change of status documentation will be placed in the student's file. Transcripts or grade reports from other institutions, criminal background check, copies of scores from national tests (MCAT, NBOME Board scores, Praxis, etc.) and/or any other third party material will not be released by PCOM. Students must contact the institution that issued these do cuments t o obtain copies.

S tatistics on Placement in Graduate Medical Education and COMLEX-USA Level 3 Graduate residency/internship match rates and COMLEX-USA Level 3 performance statistics for PCOM students are reported on the pcom.edu website under \"program statistics\" at http://www.pcom.edu/prog_stats/prograstats.html Statement on Student Academic FreedomAcademic freedom is essential to the integri ty o f intellectual inquiry and scholarly criticism, to the dissemination of knowledge and to the search for truth and wisdom. 42PCOM affirms the vital role of diverse perspectives in helping students to develop their own knowledge and their ability to evaluate knowledge claims critically. The administration, faculty, staff and students share responsibility for fostering a climate that is favorable to the free exchange of ideas and the examination of conflicting ideas and interpretations when expressed professionally. Students have t he right to a safe classroom environment in which they can explore controversial ideas in an atmosphere characterizedby openness, tolerance and civility, and where they will be graded only on the intellectualmerits of their work. Complaints Regarding Non-Compliance with Accreditation Standards PCOM is committed to meeting and exceeding the standards for accreditation for the College and all degr ee p rograms, including the standards for colleges of osteopathic medicine as described by the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, the standards for schools of pharmacy as described bythe Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, the standards of the American Psychological Association and the National Association of School Psychologists for psychology p rograms and the accreditation standards of the Accreditation Review Commission for Education for the Physician Assistant. Copies of the respective standards are available upon request from the Office of the Provost. The Academic Program Handbook of each program contains contact information and/or the procedure of each accrediting body for filing of complaints regarding complia nce w ith accreditation standards, where applicable.Contact information for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education may be found under Accreditation in this catalog. Statement on Substance Abuse The College recognizes the importance of assisting students in their development of a lifestyle free from the use of illegal substances and the abuse of alcohol. The College disciplinary policy pr ovides a ctions including permanent dismissal of students who engage in alcohol abuse, and the use, sale or distribution of illegal substances. The provostrequires psychological assessment or toxicological (urine) testing of any student suspected of substance abuse. Details of the legal sanctions under applicable federal, state and local alcohol and drug laws, and the Pennsylvania and Georgia vehicle codes a nd Pharmacy Acts are provided in the PCOM General Student Handbook. Professional Codes of Ethics The codes of ethics of various professional associations have been adopted, as appropriate, as guidelines for PCOM professional degree and graduate students. The American Osteopathic Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American Psychological Association, the National Associa tion o f School Psychologists, the American Pharmaceutical Association, and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy haveformulated their codes of ethics to guide members in their professional lives, and the standards are designed to address the health professional's ethical and professional responsibilities to patients, society, others involved in health care and self. In addition, some academ ic p rograms have developed their own codes of ethics and student conduct. The codes of ethics are reproduced in the student handbooks and/or orientation materials of the respective academic programs at both Philadelphia and Georgia campuses. 43ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES PCOM has three academic terms that consist of 13 weeks in each term, followed by a summer session. All courses are defined on the basis of credit hours for which one credithour is equal to 14 hours of classroom or classroom equivalent instruction, exclusive of final examinations. Grading Policy Course coordinators determine the means by which the final grade will be computed, which may include exam sco re s, written assignments, laboratory exercises, practical examinations, class participation and other means of evaluation. Courses are graded in accordance with the following system: Doctor of Osteopathic MedicineDoctor of Osteopathic Medicine program grading structure is on a numeric scale from 0- 100 for the first two years with 70 being a passing grade. There are a few courses in the first and secon d y ear that are Pass/Fail courses. In the clinical years the grading structure is Honors Pass, High Pass and Pass. Doctor of Pharmacy Program Doctor of Pharmacy program grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Doctor of Pharmacy grading structure is as follows: Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.0 90 - 100 B 3.0 80 - less than 90 C 2.0 70 - less than 80 D 1.0 65 - less than 70 F 0.0 less than 65 P Pass (does not affect the GPA) The Pass-Fail grading policy is only applicable to those courses that are graded on the pass or fail basis. It does not apply to those courses that are graded on the letter grading scale. For letter grade determination, the final percentage earned in the class will be ro unded t o the nearest whole number. Cumulative GPA will be based upon the grades earned during the first, second and third professional years only. Graduate and PsyD Programs Graduate and PsyD programs grade point average is based on a 4.0 scale. Graduate and doctoral programs grading structure is as follows: 44Grade Quality Points Percentage A 4.00 95 - 100 Superior level of competency A- 3.67 90 - 94 B+ 3.33 85 - 89 B 3.00 80 - 84; Satisfactory level of competency B- 2.67 77 - 79 C+ 2.33 74 - 76; Marginal level of competency C 2.00 70 - 73; Marginal level of competency F 0.00 0 - 69; Failure to demonstrate a marginal level of competency; F does not count towards the total number required for the program. IP Incomplete pending is a grade granted only i n Psychology Research courses when the instructor and program director deem additional time needed to complete the course. IP must be completed within the next term in the time period designated by the instructor and program director. HP Superior level of competency in practicum seminar P Satisfactory or marginal level of competency in practicum seminar S Satisfactory level of progress in dissertation s eminar or biomedical research U Unsatisfactory level of progress in dissertation seminar or biomedical research Grades Common to All Programs: I Incomplete: An incomplete grade must be requested by the student in writing, in advance of the end of the course. If the instructor approves the request, a written agreement is made regarding the work required and the due date. The new grade must b e sent to the Registrar within six weeks of the last class. Failure to complete the assignment within six weeks will result in the Incomplete being changed to a grade of F The only exception is in Psychology where it is required that Independent Study courses and Assessment I or II must be completed by the end of late registration in order to be eligible for enrollment in the next term's course seque nce. W Wi thdrawal before midpoint of the term of a course; once the midpoint of a term has been reached, a student is not eligible to withdraw unless there are extenuating circumstances and the student is granted permission WP Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while passingWF Withdrawal after the midpoint of a course while failing or unauthorized withdrawal AU Audited (no course credit) Grade Po int Av erage The grade point average is calculated by dividing the total credits attempted (excluding grades of HP, S, P, WP, WF, I, AU, W) into the sum of the products of points and credits for all courses taken. Only courses taken at PCOM are included in this calculation. 45Grade Reports Grades are available to all students at the end of each term via the Banner Web services in Nucleus. PCOM does not distribute paper mailers. Dropping of CoursesThe deadline to drop a course is the last day of the first week of the term. Students whodrop a course by this deadline will receive a 100% tuition refund. Students enrolled in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, the Doctor of Pha rmacy a nd the Physician Assistant programs are not permitted to drop one course, but are required todrop all coursework in that term. Because of the sequential nature of these programs, students requesting to be dropped from one term may be required to take a leave of absence until the following year. In these programs, consultation and approval from the program dean or program director is required. Withdrawal F rom Courses After Drop-Add Period Withdrawals occur after the first week of the term. While students in other graduate programs may be permitted to withdraw from a course, it should be done with the consultation of their program director or dean. Withdrawals may change the sequence of courses to be taken.Students approved to take a withdrawal from a course up to the midpoint of a course will earn a grade notation of Withdraw. After the midpoint of the course, students will not be eligible to withdraw from a course unless there are extenuating circumstances and they are given permission from their program director or dean. The latter option will be reserved for extreme circumstances only. Course withdrawals approved after the midpoint of the course will carry a grade notation of WP if with drawing w hen passing, or a grade notation of WF if withdrawing when failing. Students may not continue in the program with more than one WF grade notation. Withdrawal grades or credits are not calculated in the grade point average. Auditing CoursesA course audit does not provide the student with any course credit nor can it be used toward degree requirements. A course audit is noted on the transcript w ith a grade of AU and does not calculate into the GPA. When auditing a course the student is required to actively participate in labs, group assignments and to take examinations. For a student to audit a course, permission must be received from the dean or the program director at the beginning of the term and submitted to the Registrar's Office. Audited coursework will not be eligible for federal fin ancial a id. Veteran InformationContact with the Veterans Administration and negotiation of problems related to veterans benefits are handled in the Registrar's Office. Application for benefits at PCOM is generally initiated by filing a \"Change of Place of Training\" form upon leaving the prior institution, or upon separation from the Armed Forces. International Students InformationInternational students ' p aperwork is processed through the Registrar's Office. PCOM has 46been approved to process F-1 visas. Prior to the start of their first term, international students must submit tuition for the duration of the program. These funds will be placed in a PCOM escrow account. International students must be enrolled full time each term and continue to make academic progress. Transfer Credit Doctor of Osteopathic MedicineThe Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program does not routinely accept transfer students; however, transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and depending on placement available in the class. Consideration will be given only to astudent who is in good standing at an AOA-accredited college of osteopathic medicine. If accepted, a transfer student w ill be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to be eligible to receive the DO degree. Doctor of PharmacyPCOM School of Pharmacy does not routinely accept transfer students; however, a transfer application may be considered under extenuating circumstances and dependi ng o n places available in the class. Consideration will be given only to a student who is in good standing at an ACPE-accredited college or school of pharmacy who is eligible for re-admission to the previously attended college or school. The initial request for transfer must originate from the dean of the college or school of pharmacy from which the student wishes to transfer and must be directed to t he d ean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus. Application materials must be submitted and a formal interview with the Admissions Committee will be required. If accepted, a transfer student will be given credit for courses successfully passed at the previous college that meet PCOM's curriculum requirements. A minimum of two years must be completed at PCOM for a student to beeligible to recei ve t he PharmD degree. Graduate ProgramsGraduate programs may permit transfer credits provided the student meets PCOM's curriculum requirements and upon approval of the academic department. A graduatestudent will be given permission to transfer to PCOM no more than six graduate-levelcredits for coursework successfully completed at a previous college. Doctoral Programs Doctoral-level students are not pe rmitted t o transfer any prior coursework to PCOM. Attendance PolicyStudents are strongly recommended to attend all classes to maximize their educational experience by participating in and following their discussions first- hand. Individual course directors may set attendance standards for their course, including the designationof mandatory lectures, and may implement in-class quizzes or record attend ance. T hus, attendance may be a factor in determining the final grade in a course, at the discretion ofthe course director. One-hundred percent attendance is required in clinical clerkships, remedial assignments, laboratory sessions, small-group sessions, clinical correlations and standardized patient exercises, and all introductory and advanced pharmacy practical experiences. 47Serious excuses for missed attendance must be documented and reported to the Chief Student Affairs officer in Philadelphia or the Director of the Center for Student Affairs in Georgia for first and second year DO students or to clinical education for third and fourth year DO students, who in turn will advise the course or clerkship director for his or her consideration. Students in other degree progra ms s hould report and document their absence to the head of their program. Final determination to accept an excuse remains with the course or clerkship director. Extended absences for illness, family emergencies, etc., must always be documented by the Chief Student Affairs officer in Philadelphia and the Director of the Center for Student Affairs in Georgia, Clinical education, or the office of the spe cific a cademic program. Academic Progress EvaluationStudent scholastic achievement is reviewed on an ongoing basis by each program's Student Progress Evaluation Committee (SPEC). The SPEC Committees make recommendations on student academic standing to the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee (SAPPC). Categories of Academic StandingThe categories of academic standing are as follows: Good S tanding: Status of a student who has met course requirements in a satisfactory manner and has demonstrated professional behavior. Warning: A departmental written warning may be issued to any student who has incurred a course, clerkship or preceptorship failure(s) subject to a validation or remediation. Issuance of a letter of academic warning does not necessarily result in loss of good academic st anding b ut is intended to alert the student that academic deficiencies have been recorded and must be remediated to meet promotion requirements.Probation: Status of a student who has demonstrated a marginal level of performance to the degree that any additional course deficiencies will make the student liable for dismissal according to College policy. Dismissal: Action, after review of the academic d eficiency o r deficiencies of a student by the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee, whereby a student may be dismissed from the academic program of the College. 48PROGRESSION POLICIES BY PROGRAM Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine In the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine program the extent of a student's academic deficiency considers the accumulation of academic standing units. Assignment of academic standing units to courses or clerkships not successfully completed is based on course credits or number of clerkship weeks using the following formula: Courses worth less than 1 credit hour to 3 credit hours = .25 Academic Units C ourses worth more than 3 credit hours to 8 credit hours = .50 Academic Units Courses worth more than 8 credit hours = 1.00 Academic Units Clerkships 2 weeks in length = .50 Academic Units Clerkships 4 weeks in length = 1.00 Academic Units Students' performance is reviewed at the end of each term. Students with unsatisfactory academic achievement will be counseled regarding their performance. A s tudent with a failure in one academic standing unit will be recommended by theStudent Academic Progress and Policy Committee to the Dean for promotion from one class to the next when the student has removed the deficiency. Students who have accumulated one or more academic standing units of course failures may not be eligible for validation examination and may not be eligible for advancement to the n ext year of study. Students with one or more academic standing units of course failures may be dismissed from the academic program of the College or required to repeat a year of study, at the discretion of the Student Academic Progress and Policy Committee. If a student is afforded the opportunity to repeat the year of study, they will do so on probation and will not be allowed to appeal should anoth er f ailure occur. A review of a student's complete academic performance may be considered in determination of dismissal. Students who fail a clerkship and have had prior academic failures in their didactic years may be liable for dismissal. Students who have not had prior failures in their didactic years and receive more than one failure in a clerkship may be liable for dismissal. When considering a st udent f or dismissal from the DO program all performances can be reviewed. Doctor of Pharmacy In the Doctor of Pharmacy program, a student must receive a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to graduate. The minimum grade required to pass pharmacy coursework is a D. The School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and StandardsCommittee reviews all student academic progression. When a student violates the progression guidelines, the Academic Performance and Standards Committee evaluates t he case and submits a recommendation letter to the Student Policy and Progress Committee. This Committee reviews the case and reports its decision to the School of Pharmacy Dean, who generates the appropriate decision letter. The committee determines the extent of academic deficiency by considering specific academic guidelines. Numerous parameters exist that help to maintain proper alignment 49of academic expectations while describing consequences of failure to achieve these requirements. The progression guidelines also define academic probation, dismissal criteria and steps that must be undertaken to graduate from the pharmacy program. A student in the Doctor of Pharmacy program who has failed a course must remediate the class during the following summer. The grade earned through remediati on w ill be averaged with the original F for calculation of the final GPA. Only one course may be remediated. Students may not progress to the next academic year until remediated coursework is successfully completed. For purposes of this policy, an F in a pass-failcourse is treated as an F with regard to overall academic progression and thus must be repeated. Dismissal The Academic Performance and Stand ard s Committee may recommend dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy following review of any student that comes before the committee and will automatically recommend student dismissal from the School of Pharmacy under any one of the following conditions: - Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License- Receiving three grades less than C for all courses taken at PCO M S chool of Pharmacy - A grade of D, F, NP or WF is considered to be a grade less than C - Failure to successfully remediate a course on the first attempt - Failure to attain a cumulative GPA greater than or equal to 2.0 at the end of a repeated professional year A student dismissed from the PCOM School of Pharmacy may appeal this decision according to the policies set forth in the PCOM General Stude nt H andbook under the section Appealing an Academic Dismissal Decision. Academic Probation Probation is an action taken in the interest of the student. A student who is placed on probation should carefully evaluate his/her chance of success in earning a degree in Pharmacy from PCOM School of Pharmacy if his/her current strategy continues. At a minimum, a student should arrange to substantially increase t he amount of time and effort devoted to academic preparedness. Students are immediately placed on academicprobation under any one of the following conditions: - Term or cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of any term - Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF - Upon recommendation by the Academic Progression and Standards Committee The probationary period is the academic term immediately followi ng, u nless the Academic Performance and Standards Committee specifies a longer probationary period. Removal from probation only occurs if the student has, at the end of the probationary period, attained a term and cumulative GPA greater than 2.0, received a grade of P inall P/NP courses during the probation period, and successfully remediated all courses with a grade of F or NP and met any other conditions i mposed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. All students on probation are required to make an appointment with the Associate Dean for Academics and Assessment during the first week of each probationary term to develop 50a plan to help improve their academic performance. Students on probation are not permitted to serve as an officer of any student organization affiliated with PCOM or PCOM School of Pharmacy or attend any non-mandatory PCOM School of Pharmacy-sponsored activity. Academic Probation When the Semester or Cumulative GPA Is Less than 2.0 If a student is placed on academic probation as a result of his or her semester o r cumulative GPA dropping below 2.0, then the probationary period is the following semester. At the end of the probationary period, the student must have a semester and cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. Failure to do so will result in the student being reviewed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consideration of the followingoptions, including but not li mited t o (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program or (2) repeat of the current professional year. The minimum GPA required to graduate from PCOM is 2.0; therefore, if the cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 at the end of the third professional year the student will not be allowed to progress into the fourth professional year. The student will be reviewed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performa nce a nd Standards Committee for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program or (2) repeat of the third professional year. If the Committee allows a repeat of the third academic year and the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0, the student will be dismissed from the program. Academic Probation with a Course Grade of F or WF A student w ho receives a single course grade of F or WF with a cumulative GPA less than 2.0 is placed on probation until the course is successfully remediated. Failure tosuccessfully remediate the course results in dismissal from the program. Failed Experiential Rotations must be repeated at a date and time as determined at the discretion of the Director of Experiential Education. If a student receives two co urse g rades of F or WF within any professional year, then the student is referred to the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consideration of thefollowing options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal from the program, (2) repeat of the professional year or (3) remediation. If a student is allowed by the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance a nd S tandards Committee to repeat the professional year (as determined by the curriculum) then the probationary period is his or her repeat year. The student is removed from probation after successful completion of the probationary year. Any student on probation for two or more of the previously stated reasons will automatically be referred to the School of Pharmacy Academic Performance and Standards Co mmittee f or review for consideration of the following options, including but not limited to (1) recommendation for dismissal or (2) repeat of the professional year. Successful removal from academic probation is achieved when the semester and cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0 at the end of the probationary semester. The student also is removed from academic probation during a repeated year when his/her s emester and cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0. 51Review by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee A student is reviewed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee under any of the following circumstances: - Failure to maintain a current, valid State of Georgia Pharmacy Intern License - Placed on academic probation - Remain on academic probation for two or more consecutive terms- Receive a course grade of D while on probation- Receive a course grade of F, NP or WF - Receive two course grades of D- Cumulative GPA less than 2.0 at the end of the third professional year The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will afford the student anopportunity to speak to the committee during its deliberations. The committee forwards its recommendation, along with a rationale for its decision, to the PCOM Academic Policy and Prom otion C ommittee for review. The PCOM Academic Policy and Promotion Committee then forwards the recommendation to the Dean of the PCOM School of Pharmacy, who may impose sanctions including academic probation, repeat of a singlecourse, courses or an entire professional year or dismissal from the PCOM School of Pharmacy. Doctor of Psychology In the doctoral programs, a grade of F (failure) or WF (withdrawal while failing), or 3 grades of C or U (unsatisfactory) will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. Doctoral students must achieve a B average (3.0) or higher to take comprehensive exams and to graduate from the program. PsyD students may earn nomore than two grades below a B- or more than one F in any course, required o r elective. In addition, students must record a B- or better in all required courses. There are several courses that require the student to achieve a grade of B. The student may be required to retake the course. This information regarding which course(s) require(s) a grade of B is annotated under the course description in the Program and Course Description section of the catalog. Each degree program a lso has specific requirements regarding comprehensive e xaminations, licensure exam passage, practicum, internship and thesis and dissertation completion. These policies are explained in detail in the student handbook for the respective program. Graduate Programs (Master of Science) In the graduate programs, a grade of F (failure), U (unsatisfactory) or WF (withdrawal while failing) in any graduate course will make the student liable for dismissal from the program. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 is required for continuation to unconditional degree candidacy status, and conferral of the master of science degree. Academic Appeal A student who is dismissed for academ ic d eficiency may appeal the decision. Such a request or appeal must be made to the Office of Academic Affairs within fifteen businessdays after the student has been notified of the decision to dismiss. Students may not bringbefore the Academic Appeal Committee requests other than an appeal of a permanent dismissal action. Any student appealing a dismissal will be entitled to a hearing before the 52Academic Appeal Committee. The scope of the review shall not include a review of the components of a specific grade or grades. At the hearing, the student may present evidence on his or her behalf, and/or choose to be represented by an advisor or an attorney. The student must also provide a list of anywitnesses he or she plans to call on his or her behalf and/or the use of an attorney or other advisor a t least ten days prior to the hearing. The student shall be given written notification of the final decision. A student will be permitted only one appeal. Continuation in Lieu of Appeal There may be certain circumstances that a student who was eligible for dismissal is afforded the privilege of repeating the academic year without requiring a formal Appeal. In such cases, the student will lose their ri ght t o appeal should they be unsuccessful in their coursework that year and be dismissed, Change of Enrollment Status Leave of Absence A leave of absence is defined as a pre-approved leave from the institution that suspends a student's course of academic and/or clinical study or off-site training for a definite period of time, not to exceed 12 months. When considering a leave of absence a student should c onsult with the Chief Student Affairs Officer at the Philadelphia Campus or the Director of the Center for Student Affairs at the Georgia Campus, and where applicable the student's Program Director to consider how a leave would affect his or her overall progress in the academic program of the College. Additional consultation with the Financial Aid Office is suggested for thosestudents with financial a id to determine any financial ramifications. A leave of absence may be granted for one of the following reasons: (1) a medical or family emergency; (2) a financial emergency; (3) pursuit of an academic endeavor other than the regular classroom work or training assignment, either on campus or at another recognized teaching facility; (4) active military service. To receive consideration for a leave of absence, a student must submit to the appropriate Dean or Vice President of Graduate Programs a written request explaining the time requested and the basis for the leave of absence. Upon final consultation with the appropriate Dean or Vice President of Graduate Programs regarding the circumstances, a decision will be rendered. All applications for leave of absence are considered on their individual mer its a nd approved only for extraordinary reasons. Final approval of leaves of absences is given by the Dean in the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and Pharmacy programs and the Vice President of Graduate Programs for all graduate programs. When an approved leave or formal withdrawal is granted before the midpoint of a course, the course(s) in progress at that time will be recorded on the transcript with the g rade W; if an approved leave is granted after the midpoint of a course, the grade recorded on thetranscript will reflect the grade status at that part of the term (WP if passing; WF if failing). 53Students who permanently withdraw from the academic program of the College without following the withdrawal procedure will receive the grade F for courses in progress. In the case of courses repeated in their entirety, the new grade earned will be recorded in theterm the repeated course is completed. This new grade will be calculated in the grade point average replacing the failure; however, this wil l n ot remove the previous W, WP or F for that course from the transcript. There are circumstances wherein the leave of absence is initiated by PCOM. These are financial leave of absence and academic leave of absence. A financial leave of absence is initiated by the Bursar's Office when a student does not meet his/her financial obligations to PCOM in a term. The Bursar's Office will advise theRegistrar's O ffice to remove the student from subsequent term enrollments. The student is notified by the Registrar's Office when this action has occurred. The student will not bepermitted to return until his/her financial obligations are met. If a financial leave is implemented, the student still must adhere to completion of his/her program in the timeframe designated. An academic leave of absence is initiated b y the Registrar's Office in one of two ways: 1. Student has been advised of dismissal and is granted the privilege of returning the following year. 2. In certain graduate programs there may be situations wherein a student is unable to register due to the fact that there are no courses offered in that term for which to register, but the student is still actively pursuing the degree. In this rare sit uation, t he Registrar can approve a one term only leave. Implications of a Leave of Absence A student on leave of absence is not considered enrolled during the term of the leave and does not qualify for loan deferment, special monetary loans, grants or other special considerations that presuppose the status of a regular student. Therefore, students are advised to consult with the Financial Aid Office re gard ing their loan payback and other financial matters throughout their decision process. Health insurance may be continued if premiums are paid on time. Special arrangements must be made with Financial Operations for regular payment of premiums, which isgenerally monthly during a leave. Return from Leave Before the conclusion of the leave of absence, the student must notify the Provost and the Registrar i n writing of his or her intent to register and resume his or her degree program. If a leave of absence is due to personal illness, the student's attending physician or other health care provider as specified by the Provost must supply a letter attesting to the student's ability to continue in the academic or clinical program, or other training activity. The student's course of study will then be r esumed a t the point in the curriculum deemed most appropriate by the Provost. Prior to the return, all financial obligations must be satisfied with the Bursar as stipulated in the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog before petitioning for re-admission. Notwithstanding time off for leave(s), all requirements for graduation from PCOM must be completed within seven years from the first date of matric ulation i n the medical and 54doctoral programs, or within three years for the master's programs. A student on a leave of absence who fails to return within the time period specified in the approved leave of absence will be dropped as a student from the College. Any student who is dropped must reapply for admission. Transferring from PCOM If a student in the DO program or in any other degree program desires to transfer to anyother institution, t he initial contact should be made with the program director or the Dean in order to obtain a letter of good standing, if required. Transcripts may be requested from the Registrar and will be released only if the financial account is in good order.

Determining Financial Need With the exception of Federal Stafford unsubsidized loans and Federal Graduate PLUS loans, federal financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need. When the student'sFree Appli cation f or Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is processed, a formula is applied to the information that the student provided to calculate the student's Expected FamilyContribution (EFC). EFC is the amount that the federal government has determined that the student can contribute towards the cost of his/her education. The formula isestablished by law and is used to measure the student's financial strength based o n his/her income and assets. The student's EFC is used in the following equation to determine the student's financial need:Financial Need = Cost of Attendance - Expected Family Contribution Cost of Attendance A student's Cost of Attendance, or financial aid budget, is the sum of the following: - Tuition - Comprehensive School Fee - Class dues (not applicable to all programs) - Books and supplies - I nstruments and equipment (not applicable to all programs) - Medical exam costs (not applicable to all programs) - Health insurance - Room/rent - Utilities - Food/groceries - Transportation - Personal - Loan fees THE APPLICATION PROCESS FAFSA To apply for financial assistance at PCOM for each academic year, students must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov.

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid The United States Department of Education requires every postsecondary institution receiving Title IV federal f unds t o have an academic progress policy that is used to determine eligibility for and continued receipt of federal funds. Although this policy must apply to all students whether or not they are receiving financial aid, the receipt of financial aid is a privilege that creates both rights and obligations for the student. The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy has three components: 65661. The student must maintain a certain grade point average or a comparative qualitative measurement against a norm. 2. The student must complete a certain percentage of all coursework attempted. 3. The student has a maximum timeframe to complete the program. Title IV federal funds affected by this policy at PCOM include Federal Work Study program, Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans a nd Federal Direct Stafford Loans. Although not required, all institutional funds are also governed by the SAP policy. A review of SAP will be conducted at the end of every Spring term regardless of when a student enrolls. Failure to meet any component of SAP at the end of the Spring term will result in the loss of eligibility for federal and PCOM financial aid for the next academic year. The Fina ncial A id Office will notify the student if the student has failed to meet the SAP standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid and has lost eligibility for financial aid. If financial aid has already been awarded for the subsequent academicyear, the offer of aid will be rescinded. A student may appeal the loss of eligibility of financial aid and seek to be placed onFinancial Aid Aca demic P rogress Probation for one term. This appeal must be based upon on either the death of a relative, a serious personal illness/injury or other extenuating circumstance. The student must be able to demonstrate that the illness/injury orextenuating circumstance had a direct impact on the student's academic performance. To do this, the student must work with the appropriate Academic Program advisor a nd/or Student Progress Evaluation Committee to develop an appropriate Academic Action Plan. If the student is granted Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, the student will regain eligibility for financial aid for one term. At the end of the term, the student's academic record will be reviewed. If the student is now meeting the terms of the Standards of Academic Progress, the student will regain e ligibility for financial aid for subsequent terms. If the student has still not met the terms of the Standards of Academic Progress buthas fulfilled the terms of the Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student's Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation will be renewed for an additional term and the student will be awarded aid for that term. If the student has not fulfilled the term s o f the Financial Aid Academic Progress Probation, then the student will lose eligibility for financial aid. Students who are dismissed or withdrawn from the school are not deemed to be making SAP and are not eligible to receive financial aid. The policy on SAP will be disseminated to all newly matriculated students. All students will be notified yearly of the SAP policy, which will be published yearly i n the Financial Aid Handbook. Doctoral students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Graduate studentsmust achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Graduate Certificate students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Pharmacy students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. Doctor of Osteopathic students must: - Achieve a passing grade on all coursework, validations, exams and clinical c lerkships. - Pass COMLEX I by the end of year 3. - Pass COMLEX II (both parts) by the end of year 4.67Students must complete the appropriate percentage of all courses attempted to maintain a good academic standing. The completion percentage is calculated by dividing total hours earned by total hours attempted. If a student changes degree programs, then the SAP status will be based on the academic record of the new program. It is also important to understand how specific grades and/or course types count t oward the completion ratio. The following grades count as attempted but not completed courses:- Incomplete - No Grade Reported - Withdraw - Failure - Unsatisfactory All students at PCOM are required to maintain a 67% completion of coursework. Transfer credits will count towards a student's attempted and completed credit hours.Students in the Doctor of Osteopathic and Psychology programs have seven years to complete the program from initial matriculation. Pharmacy students have six years from initial matriculation, and graduate students have five years from initial matriculation to complete the program. Any term in which a student is enrolled counts towards the maximum timeframe regardless of whether or not the student receives federal financial aid. R efund Policy When a student's loan or scholar ship f unding is received by the PCOM Bursar's Office, any balance due to PCOM will be deducted from the amount of the funds. Any financial aid funding left over after paying the student's balance will then go to the student as a \"refund check\" via postal mail. All refunds are issued by the PCOM Bursar's Office. Direct Deposit Direct deposits of student refund checks are available by the student's compl eting a n authorization form at the PCOM Bursar's Office. After refund money is processed by thePCOM Bursar's Office, it usually takes 1-5 business days for a student's bank to process the refund money and place it in the student's bank account. Pending Loan Advance (PLA) Requests A student is eligible for a PLA up to 15 days prior to the disbursement of the student'sfinancial aid for the upcoming term o r the start date of his or her first course in a term provided he or she has a term enrollment status of at least half time. The student needs to have completed all requirements to accept the financial aid. All counselors can completethe PLA form with a student, but final approval is required by an Associate Director or Director of Financial Aid. The amount of eligibility will be based on the studen t s ubmitting the Pending Loan Advance Form. The counselor will speak with the student in person or over the phone to inform the student about any possible future deficit of funds for the upcoming quarter and, if necessary, recommend that the student make spending adjustments to eliminate the deficit.68The student will be asked why he or she needs a PLA on the Pending Loan Advance Form. If the stated reason is an expense that could not otherwise be included in the student's cost of attendance or approvable as a budget appeal, the counselor will deny the request. The maximum amount available for a loan advance to a particular student will be limitedto the lesser of the following: - $2,000 for both g raduate a nd professional students. - Amount requested. - Amount approved by counselor after a review of budget and aid for upcoming term.The student is limited to one PLA per academic year. If a student has an emergency situation that is unavoidable, the student can meet with the Director to discuss a possible second PLA for the academic year. If approved, the Director will make it ver y c lear that no additional PLA will be approved for the remaining academic school year. Tuition Refund Policy Refunds are determined based on the proration of tuition and percentage of program completed at withdrawal, up to 50% of the program. If a student withdraws from classes within seven weeks from the start of the term, a pro-rata refund or tuition credit may beauthorized. In the case of full with drawals, t he effective date of withdrawal is the date on which the student filed with the dean a written notification of withdrawal or a request for a leave of absence. For courses not conducted on a weekly schedule, summer sessions, and for clinical clerkships/preceptorships in the medical and physician assistant programs, the refund is prorated according to the percent of the clerkship, preceptorshi p o r course completed as indicated in parentheses below: Withdrawal Date Term Charge % of Credit During first week of class(up to 5% of instructional time) 0% term charge 100% credit During second week of class(more than 5% but no more than 10% of instructional time) 10% term charge 90% credit During third and fourth weeks of class (more than 10% but no more than25% of instructional time) 25% term c harg e 75% credit During fifth through seventh weeks of class(more than 25% but no more than50% of instructional time) 50% term charge 50% credit Withdrawal after seventh week of class(more than 50% of instructional time) 100% term charge 0% credit No fee or portion of a fee is refundable. The refund policy is subject t o c hange at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, but in no instance will such a change becomeretroactive.69All federal financial aid funds are credited or returned in compliance with the Federal Return Policy Schedule. A student's total Cost of Attendance is based on certain enrollment. When a student dropscourses, the PCOM Financial Aid Office will likely reduce the student's total Cost of Attendance. Often this results in no additional allocation of refund money to the student. For additional information c ontact the PCOM Bursar's Office Return of Title IV Funds When Withdrawing From All Courses The PCOM Financial Aid Office is responsible for calculating federal financial aid eligibility for students who discontinue enrollment during the term. Upon notification from the PCOM Registrar's Office that a student has withdrawn from or dropped allclasses, was dismissed, or is approved for a leave of absenc e, t he PCOM Financial Aid Office is required to calculate the percentage of the term completed if the student received or was eligible for Title IV federal student aid (Stafford, PLUS, and Perkins loans). If the withdrawal date indicates that the student left the institution prior to completing at least 60% of the enrollment period, the PCOM Financial Aid Office must recalculate the eligibility for Tit le I V funds based on the following formula required by the federal government: 1. The percentage of payment period is the number of days completed to the withdrawal date. 2. The percentage of earned aid is the percentage of the payment period completed, divided by the total number of days in the payment period or term. Breaks of five or more days are not counted as days that are part of the term. Funds p aid by federal student aid programs are returned to the appropriate program based on the percentage of unearned aid as required by the federal government: The aid to be returned is the result of the total amount of aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of aid earned, multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed for the payment period or term. If a student earned le ss a id than the amount disbursed, the institution is required to return the unearned portion of funds to the federal program(s). As a result, the student may owe a debit balance to the institution. The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible within thirty days of the date of the determination of the student's withdrawal date. Funds are repaid in the following or der i n accordance with federal regulation: 1. Federal Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Loans 2. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans 3. Federal Perkins Loans If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to the student account, the institution would request a post-withdrawal disbursement, which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal.EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND RESOURCES PCOM maintains its main campus in Philadelphia and a branch campus in the Atlanta, Georgia area.

It recognizes that the neuromusculoskeletal system is of major importance to human life. The interrelationship between this and other body-systems is a basic part of osteopathic philosophy. An emphasis on primary care, health maintenance, prevention of disease and atten tion t o the neuromusculoskeletal system is key to osteopathic medical education and practice. Universally accepted today, these attributes were considered unorthodox when Dr. Andrew Taylor Still (1828-1917) objected to the crude medications of his time and sought to enhance the body's inherent healing through manipulation. The osteopathic physician incorporates evaluation and treatment of the musculo skeletal s ystem as a basis for an approach to health and disease, combining it with the diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used by general scientific approaches to the healing arts. Liketheir MD counterparts, DOs must be licensed in the states where they practice, and additional board certification in specialties further underscores their professional credentials. All 50 states and the District of Columbia p rovide for the unlimited practice of medicine and surgery by osteopathic physicians. Licensing boards are usually composed of senior members of the osteopathic profession. In some states, MDs and DOs participate in combined licensing boards. Osteopathic Philosophy The basic premises accepted by this profession provide the osteopathic physician with a unique way of looking at health and diseas e. T hese premises include the following: 1. The human body is a unit in which structure and function are reciprocally interdependent. 2. The body, through a complex system, tends to be self-regulating and self- healing.3. The adequate function of body-systems depends on the unimpeded flow of blood and nerve impulses. 4. The musculoskeletal system is a major body-system and its importance exceeds t hat o f mere framework and support. 5. There are musculoskeletal components to disease that are not only manifestations of the disease, but also important contributing and maintaining factors. The adoption of these basic premises led to the development of the osteopathic total-body concept. The patient is considered ecologically rather than as an isolated unit. Instead of emphasizing the momentary d isease state, the osteopathic approach studies and treats the person's well-being, lifestyle and behavior as a whole. Through the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the profession maintains its independence and its own medical schools while cooperating with other branches of medical science. Primary care is emphasized in the educational programs, and a majority of graduates enter primary care fields. H owever, DOs participate in all specialty and subspecialty areas of current medical practice. Educational Goals A fundamental educational goal of the College is to prepare students for excellence in the 81practice of osteopathic medicine. The course of medical study is a practitioner's program with a strong emphasis on primary care, prevention and osteopathic concepts. Each osteopathic medical student progresses through a uniform and comprehensive curriculum designed to achieve this goal. Elective clinical clerkships expose students to specialty or subspecialty fields during training, and later they ma y s pecialize. At PCOM, students are trained first as family practitioners and thus build solid foundations for their careers. Throughout the curriculum, osteopathic concepts and methods are stressed. Efficiency is also an educational goal, maximizing each student's learning by utilizing the most effective educational methodologies available. Innovations such as computerized tutorials, classroom videos and s imulated patient encounters will sharpen skills as a physician. The curriculum bridges departmental divisions and joins related disciplines,such as basic sciences to surgery and internal medicine, so that students relate different perspectives to a variety of conditions taught in a common time frame. Instruction is attuned to the changing demands in American health care. A majority ofPCOM's grad uates e nter primary care practice, where the large majority of health problems are treated today. The general objectives of the educational program are expressed as \"core competencies,\" the domains of knowledge and skills in which all students must demonstrate competencyto earn the degree, Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine: 1. Osteopathic principles and practice, which are established and incorporated i n t he development of skills. 2. Patient care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of health. 3. Medical knowledge about established and evolving biomedical, clinical and cognate (e.g., epidemiological and social-behavioral) sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care. 4. Practice-based learning and improvement that i nvolves investigation and self- e valuation of patient care, appraisal and assimilation of scientific evidence, and improvements in patient care. 5. Interpersonal and communications skills that result in effective information exchange and teaming with patients, their families and other health professionals. 6. Professionalism, as manifested through a commitment to carrying out professional responsibili ties, a dherence to ethical principles, and sensitivity to a diverse patient population. 7. Systems-based practice, as manifested by actions that demonstrate an awareness of the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide optimal care. 8. Information literacy, as manifested by the capability to access, understand and apply biomedical infor mation, a nd actions that demonstrate the skills necessary to utilize information technology tools to effectively access information from various resources and formats. The Basic Sciences and Preclinical Years PCOM students begin preparation for the world of clinical medicine from their first day as medical students. The curriculum combines basic science and clinical course content with integrated course s s uch as Cellular and Molecular Basis of Medicine, as well as 8283integrated approaches to the pharmacology, pathology, medicine and surgery related to respiratory, genitourinary, cardiovascular, reproductive, endocrine, nervous and gastrointestinal systems. The first two years lay the foundation with intense concentration on the basic sciences, anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology, taught in int egrated c ourse units that emphasize clinical applications. PCOM also recognizes that medical practice is more than science. Coursework in ethics and patient communication helps the student relate well to patients, while content in evidence-based medicine and public health prepares the student for thecomplex world of private practice. The basic sciences are complemented by instruction inclinical subje cts s uch as internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, pediatrics, epidemiology, OB/GYN, family medicine, rehabilitation medicine, geriatrics, radiology,oncology and physical diagnosis. The principles and practice of osteopathic medicine are taught throughout the medical curriculum. All students attend small-group sessions during the first and second year to develop communication and diagnost ic s kills. These special instructional activities include patient observation, case conferences and basicclinical skills workshops. In addition, an active standardized patient and robotic simulation program introduces students to patient care through examinations of patient actors in a simulated practice setting, augmented by clinical exercises on high-tech human patient simulator manikins. The last tw o years emphasize clinical training experiences. Philadelphia Campus students a re assigned to clinical clerkships throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and neighboring states. This unique training network comprises affiliated hospitals, five Healthcare Centers, numerous outpatient units and scores of physicians' offices. These clinical settings become teaching arms of the College; in effect, the Commonwealth is our c ampus. Students at the Georgia Campus are assigned to clinical clerkships throughout Georgia and the Southeast. The program is designed to afford progressive student responsibility for all phases of patient care under the direction of experienced physicians. This includes history taking, physical examinations, daily patient rounds, lectures, conferences and case presentations. Students ro tate through services in medicine, family practice, manipulative medicine, surgery, cardiology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, otorhinolaryngology and office-based preceptorships. On elective clerkships, students may choose to pursue special interests at other medical institutions anywhere across the nation. All students receive additional training in osteopathic manipulative medicine during t he t hird year. One objective of the College is to encourage graduates to practice in communities where health care services are most needed. Therefore, each student entering PCOM must be willing to accept clinical education assignments throughout the region. Each senior student serves at least eight weeks in an underserved community clerkship. An alternative rural elective is offered to a limited numbe r o f students, whereby the student may select an area of alternative health care delivery or a rural area of high medical need. Requirements for Graduation Each candidate for the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) must be age 2l or older, be of good moral character and have passed Parts I and II of the COMLEX (NationalBoard of Osteopathic Medical Examiners), including the Level II Physical Examination component. Each candidate must have completed satisfactorily the program of studyPCOM requires for the degree within seven years from the date of initial matriculation. Attendance at the Commencement ceremonies conferring the degree is required of eachcandidate. Requirements for Practice Each recipient of the DO degre e m ust fulfill the requirements of the state licensing board of the state in which the physician chooses to practice. These requirements are regulated by the laws of each state. Pre-Doctoral Research Opportunities exist for extracurricular research experience for all of PCOM's students. Research laboratories and equipment, as well as electron microscopic, computer andanimal facilities, are available fo r t his purpose. Students have the opportunity to work with faculty members on a variety of biomedical topics. Most research is performed between the first and second academic years. Students may be partially funded for theirresearch efforts, based on eligibility, through College Work-Study or external granting agencies. A compilation of faculty research projects/interests may be obtained from theChief S cience Officer. Dual Degree Programs DO/PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology (Philadelphia Campus) The Joint DO/PhD Program is a collaborative initiative between the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USci). The purpose of the program is to provide a joint degree offering for students who wish to pursue physician-scientist careers, and the program is designed for students wit h s pecialized career plans. The research-intensive program provides three full years of research fellowship training in addition to the four year osteopathic medical program. Thethree year research component culminates in a research project and dissertation defense. A stipend and support for supplies/equipment are awarded in the research years. The DO/PhD Program is designed to train physician-scienti sts w ho will contribute to the fund of knowledge by conducting original, high-quality scientific research with the perspective of a clinical practitioner. The program represents a critical link between bench and bedside by combining medical training with research training and will produce clinical scholar-practitioners who can make ongoing contributions to the osteopathic clinical, scientific and aca demic c ommunity. Students are accepted into the program as part of their original application to osteopathic medical school through a special admissions process; hence acceptance to the DO and PhD components occurs simultaneously, with USci approving the acceptance into the PhD program. Non-acceptance to the joint DO/PhD Program does not preclude a student from being accepted to the DO program only, th ro ugh the normal PCOM admissions process. PCOM awards the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree after successful completion of the DO Program. USci awards the Doctor of Philosophy degree upon successful completion of all requirements for the PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology, including dissertation defense and submission of a final manuscript for publication. For information 84regarding admission: http://www.pcom.edu/Admissions/admissions.html DO/MBA Program (Philadelphia Campus) In conjunction with Saint Joseph's University, a master of business administration degree in health and medical services may be earned by DO program students who concurrently complete a five year course of study for the DO and MBA degrees. Created in 1989 as the nation's first DO/MBA degree, the cur riculum re quires approximately 39-45 hours of MBA coursework during two summer sessions and four semesters of evening classes in the joint program. This program responds to the increasing need for business acumen in medical practice. It also prepares physicians for a wide range of emerging careers in medical administration. Georgia Campus students may enroll in the DO/MBA through online courses . S tudents who are interested in business administration but do not wish to enroll in the full MBA program may complete a 5-course Graduate Business Certificate during the second year of medical school. The Saint Joseph's University MBA is accredited by theAssociation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The mission of the GA-PCOM PharmD program is to educate caring, proactive generalist pharmacists according to a practice model in which the practitionerassumes responsibility for a patient's medication- related needs a nd is held accountable for this commitment. The program also responds to the need for pharmacists in the nation, the state of Georgia and the southeastern region. The program educates pharmacists who prepare and provide drug products and assume responsibility for the rational use of drugsby contributing to the design, implementation, monitoring and modification of therapeutic plans that will achieve d efined goals and improve therapeutic outcomes. Educational GoalsThe GA-PCOM School of Pharmacy prepares generalist, entry-level pharmacists who areable to deliver high-quality pharmaceutical care. To achieve this mission, students must develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable them to competently: (a) provide population-based and patient-specific pharmaceutical care, (b) manage and us e re sources of the health care system and (c) promote health improvement, wellness, and diseaseprevention. While preparing pharmacy practitioners is the primary mission of the Doctorof Pharmacy program, the program also provides an avenue by which students mayexplore a broad range of career opportunities. The program therefore aspires to fosterinterest in the creation of new knowledge to enhance pa tient h ealth outcomes and quality of life and also to prepare students for further education. Curriculum The program is configured in a curricular format in which students complete: 1. the pre-professional phase (three or four years) of general education, biomedical and sciences instruction at undergraduate colleges 2. the last four professional years of pharmaceutical sciences and pharmacy p ractice i nstruction at the GA-PCOM facility, as well as clinical experiences at clinical sites throughout Georgia and the southeast. Each term is a 13 week period, corresponding to the calendar used by PCOM academic programs in both Philadelphia and Georgia. The extension of coursework over the three terms of each academic year provides the opportunity for the across-the-curriculum development of skills . The curriculum is composed of courses in biomedical, p harmaceutical, social/behavioral/administrative, and clinical sciences. A number of elective courses are available to allow students to enhance their knowledge of pharmacy- related topics in specific areas. There are five Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) in which students are given exposure to pharmacy practice in a variety of diff erent specialty areas and begin their hands-on experiences. The final year of the program consists of the Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) in which students are required to complete eight different rotations. These rotations consist of five weeks in aparticular pharmacy practice site.Required rotations are: - General Medicine- Ambulatory Care - Hospital Practice - Community Practice - Community Management Elective rotations will include rotations such as (but not limited to): - Cardiology - Infectious Diseases- Pediatrics - Compounding Pharmacy - Pharmaceutical Industry Management A comprehensive examination will be given at the end of the second and third professional years. T hese e xaminations assess knowledge and skills acquired during the curriculum. Students that do not pass the comprehensive exam will be allowed to take aremediation exam. Failure to pass the remediation examination will prevent a studentfrom progressing to the next professional year and may result in dismissal from the program. This curriculum, including active learning skills development time, is des igned t o develop the knowledge, professional skills, professional attitudes and values that are required for an entry-level pharmacist. Requirements for GraduationEach candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) must be of good moralcharacter and have completed satisfactorily all academic requirements in the program of study. All requirements for the degree must be completed within six yea rs f rom the date of initial matriculation. PharmD graduates must demonstrate that they have acquiredcompetency in six basic areas of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors and attitudes: pharmacy knowledge and practice skills, patient care skills, communication/interpersonal skills, professionalism, understanding and skills in the use of information and empirical evidence, and skills in systems-based p ractice. LicensureIn general, in order for candidates to take the pharmacist licensure examination, state boards of pharmacy will require successful completion of the requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree from an accredited institution and completion of a certain number ofhours as a pharmacy intern. In Georgia, applicants for pharmacist licensure must be at least 18 years of age, have gradu ated f rom an ACPE-accredited school/college of pharmacy and completed 1,500 hours of internship under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. Schools of pharmacy in Georgia allow students to claim credit for 1,000 internship hours obtained during experiential rotations, and the student is required to obtain 500 additional hours on his or her own as a licensed pharmacy intern. An applicant may regis ter w ith the Georgia Board of Pharmacy as a pharmacy intern if he or she is registered in an accredited school/college of pharmacy. All students at the PCOM School of Pharmacy - Georgia Campus are required to obtain their Georgia intern license during the first term, and the School will assist with theapplication process. Any student found to be ineligible to be licensed as a pharmacy intern in the state o f Georgia, at any time during his or her tenure at the PCOM School of 114Pharmacy - Georgia Campus, will be dismissed from the program. PCOM students must maintain their intern license in order to legally participate in the experiential pharmacy rotations.

The purpose of the Alumni Association is to act as a liaison between the College and its more than 13,000 living DO alumni and over 2,500 graduate program alumni who practice throughout the United States, in five foreign countries and in e very branch of the military service. In addition, the Association promotes PCOM to prospective students and provides financial support for excellence in osteopathic and health care education. Contributions to the Alumni Association support the increasingly critical programs and services underwritten by the Association. In addition, the Association makes special giftsto support College priorities, incl uding a gift of $100,000 in 2012, a gift of $100,000 in 2013 to support the renovation of the Clinical Learning and Assessment Centers on boththe Philadelphia and Georgia Campuses, and a $50,000 scholarship gift to honor PCOM President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Schure, PhD, upon his retirement. Throughout the year, the Alumni Association sponsors programs that benefit its members and current s tudents. An active interest is taken in student life.
