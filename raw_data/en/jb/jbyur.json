However, your energy is much more than that. Your energy determines how you interact with and appear to others, and how well you function throughout your day. Your energetic body is your life force: the strength and vitality that sustains your mental and physical activity. This is your 'vital energy'. Energy Balancing is the process of restoring the natural flow of your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual energies back into alignment through the use of specific healing techniques. It's a healing modality where I channel and partner with the help of the highest divine vibrational energies to balance your energy systems. Because we're made up of vibrating atoms, we resonate to vibration - so energy healing remedies resonate with and can restore our frequencies of vibration back to healthier patterns. When you finish an energy balancing session you'll feel much lighter and more balanced, with a feeling of being relaxed and centered, with a more harmonious feeling within, and greater understanding of self. Energy balancing treatment can help you Your Being is Composed of Subtle Energy Systems The human anatomy is composed of subtle energy systems: our chakras, as well as the meridians of our physical body. These energy systems influence our minds, our emotions and the physical body. Your thoughts are largely responsible for your flow of energy: thoughts about how you see yourself, your beliefs, morals, values and your world around you. Also, your food intake and physical habits lead to all forms of toxins that can make their way past your defenses and disturb your body's normal vibrations. In addition to the energetic benefits, energy balancing promotes the integration of right and left-brain activity. We typically use more of our left brain, which is reason and logic. Our right brain is our intuitive and creative side. Integration of both brings a more balanced way of being. The energy balancing works to switch you from over-reliance on your rational and analytical left brain, and developing an awareness of your right brain sensitivities, abilities and natural intuitive insight. This left-to-right, right-to-left process is a centering process that you'll feel for weeks. I combine energy healing modalities for your needs My energy balancing sessions can involve any or all of 3 main modalities: I will get to know you and how to apply these for your circumstances after a [scanning session](#energyprocess) (see below). Energy balancing is typically a 45 minute session. An art therapy drawing session afterward is usually a 1/2 hour additional session if needed. Lotus Massage / Trance Healing A lotus massage is an astral massage. It's a combination of brisk (male) and nurturing (female) massage techniques that relaxes and removes any negative energy blockages that typically collect along the nerve centers of your spinal column. I bring these energies upward to gather and release energetic stress and physical discomforts, such as headaches, tightness in shoulders and stiff necks. On it's own, a lotus massage can improve digestion, circulation, insomnia, and other symptoms caused by poor posture and stress. I incorporate lotus massage as an individual modality, or I use it in combination with a trance healing as a preparatory portion of the healing. A lotus massage session is 35 minutes. With the addition of a trance healing the time is closer to 1 hour total. Color & Sound Healing The knowledge that color and sound are both aspects of vibration dates back to the ancient mysteries of the Logos, where all light begins as white light. When we look at a rainbow, we can see its purest form in its magnificent rays. Each ray of the rainbow identifies with aspects of the creator, and operates within humans for growth of our spiritual, mental and physical well-being. Color and Sound healing are techniques where I use high vibrational oils (auro-soma pomander oils) that resonate to each specific chakra. Then I use vocal sound, visualization of the color and tuning forks to create vibrational alignment of your chakras and entire energy system. A color and sound session is 45 minutes to one hour. We often get best results with no less than 3 sessions, 2 or 3 weeks apart. Light Energization Light Energization is an advanced unique and sacred process that awakens the kundalini energy through the chakras, opening the higher energy centers as well as psychic vision. Light Energization evokes a mystical experience. The practice is for those seeking a spiritual awakening as well as a healing of the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual self. You will experience expanded psychic vision, ignite and expand kundalini energy to facilitate inner peace and harmony, accelerate DNA signaling atoms, cells, and molecules to vibrate at levels to attract more spiritual power, spiritual gifts,and unconditional love. You will also invoke the divine blueprint within to activate and return your energy pattern to its original and holy state of cosmic wholeness and health. Receiving this process monthly is recommended for those who have a passion to commit to their spiritual evolution. A session is 45 minutes My Energy Balancing Process When we work together in an energy balancing, I'll begin with a technique called ['scanning'.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wzw8Z6_bGM5NjVptSDrhOFd3QXxRhIm5TTA3jBDAai8/edit#) This is a process whereby my intuitive and trained sense guides me to what is going on in your energy system. This is similar to a reading of your chakras. I follow this with an invocation of higher spiritual energies: Guides, Spirit Doctors, and Angelic beings to assist in restoring balance where needed. Recommended Sessions for Energy Balancing Results The length of an energy balancing session depends on the combination of techniques that I will use for your individual needs, however a typical energy balancing session is around 45 minutes to 1 hour. I generally recommend my clients attend at least 3 sessions, of color and sound or trance two to three weeks apart for best results. Cost...$75 per session...A bundle of 3... $195 Energization Cost... $90 per session I offer energy balancing lessons and workshops to compliment the individual sessions, and you will get the most benefits attending both.

Energy Balancing is a technique of 'scanning', energetic balancing and invoking of higher spiritual energies to bring you to a sense of peace and centeredness . The process aligns any imbalanced aspects of ourselves: mentally, emotionally , physically and spiritually. You will feel lighter, balanced and a feeling of being centered. The techniques facilitate Integration of right-left brain activity. This involves switching from our left thinking, rational, brain - and developing an awareness of our right brain sensitivities and abilities. To be balanced is to be soft and loving , yet firm in actions and clear intentions. Quantum physics acknowledges that we are all made up of energy, including our thoughts and emotions. Vibrational frequency of energy gives us the illusion of substance and separation... such as ice to water to steam. This movement of energy frequency moves faster as it flows. How many Energy Balancing sessions will I need to start seeing results? The biggest misconception is that healing work is a one time deal. However, a single healing session is one part of the process of wholeness. The journey to healing means following classes outlined for you specifically, as well as workshops on understanding your connection to spirit and your relationship with yourself and others. Healing is a holistic collaboration. Meditation is also a very big part of healing. It helps helps to practice, even 2 times a week or 5- 10 minutes a day on a regular basis. When I perform an individual energy scan and and begin to see where your personal issues lie, we begin the process of uncovering. Inner Sanctuary Training classes can help at this stage, as well as understanding the energy body and how it operates within your daily life. What is male / female integration? We have both Male and female aspects within us. We are all parts of what psychologist Carl Jung referred to as 'the androgynous'. His/her consciousness combines both masculine and feminine elements. We are here in this life becoming whole - not perfect, and yet complete, and this is a path we all journey on. Within our male and female psyche we have aspects of ourselves which are out of balance, even when we think we don't. For instance, you might be a nurturing, expressive female, however you might be be timid and afraid of moving on to something that is much needed in your current situation. This shows us that masculine qualities such as action and doing are needed. This is an imbalance. Perhaps the nurturing, expressive aspect is so strong to avoid the masculine action because it's a wounded aspect of the individual - who thinks (consciously or subconsciously) \"if i create action, i may be uncomfortable with the change\". If a man is comfortable emotionally and is caring and generally wise - however, at the same time is controlling within his relationships - something is out of alignment. Controlling aspects are within each of us. Usually these tendencies are based in fear. There are many examples of imbalances. We all know strong masculine females who are positive and action oriented - yet have a disconnect with people how have empathetic natures. "}
