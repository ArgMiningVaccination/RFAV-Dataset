Let them know it is okay if they feel upset. Share with them how you deal with your own stress so that they can learn how to cope from you. - Make yourself available to listen and to talk. Let children know they can come to you when they have questions. - Avoid language that might blame others and lead to stigma. - Pay attention to what children see or hear on television, radio, or online. Consider reducing the amount of screen time focused on COVID-19. Too much information on one topic can lead to anxiety. - Provide information that is truthful and appropriate for the age and developmental level of the child. Talk to children about how some stories on COVID-19 on the Internet and social media may be based on rumors and inaccurate information. If they are attending school, discuss any new actions that may be taken at school to help protect children and school staff. - Teach children everyday actions to reduce the spread of germs. Remind children to wash their hands frequently and stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing or sick. Also, remind them to cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow, then throw the tissue into the trash.
