Tiredness, fatigue, irritability, moodiness, apathy, insomnia, lower physical and intellectual performance, lack of vitality, bad mood... These are just some of the symptoms caused by energy imbalances. As Amalia Rubio, head of the SHA Wellness Clinic's Energy Health Unit explains, \"every cell, organ and system in the body works at a certain electrical frequency and requires energy to perform its functions, such as the heartbeat, breathing, cellular and metabolic processes and digestion. The human body has an electromagnetic field that we need in order to live and be productive. Therefore, when there are blockages in this vital energy, which is called Qi in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Prana in Ayurveda, physical, mental and emotional health suffers\". It is essential that energy levels are balanced if you want to enjoy an optimal state of wellbeing, perform to the best of your ability in all areas (work, personal, social) and face daily challenges. However, a lack of restorative rest, an unhealthy diet, a sedentary lifestyle or increased alcohol consumption during Christmas celebrations can cause blocks. Amalia shares seven natural ways to rebalance your energy levels. - Diet Diet is fundamental both when it comes to controlling stress and enjoying good energetic health. Prioritise natural, seasonal, local foods and the more organic, the better, because they have more nutrients and less pesticides and chemicals and boost your energy more. Also, if you eat slowly and chew your food well, your body will need less energy to digest it. And drink between 1.5 and 2 litres of quality water a day to flush out any toxins. - Exercise Physical exercise helps to maintain the right flow of energy and is a very healthy way to release accumulated tension. During exercise, the body secretes endorphins and hormones, such as oxytocin, which act as natural painkillers, boosting mood and promoting relaxation and stress management. In addition, exercise triggers a process called piezoelectricity in the bones, which strengthens both bone mass and cardiovascular health. - Digital hygiene Excessive use of electromagnetic technologies consumes, weakens and unbalances our energy levels. Turn off Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or your router when they're not in use, try not to carry your phone too close to your skin (it's better in your backpack or bag than in your trouser pocket) and, whenever possible, put it on airplane mode. - Restorative rest The body regenerates and recharges spent energy during sleep. This is why a good night's sleep is essential to avoid energy blocks. Try to go to bed at the same time every night, eat a light dinner two or three hours before bedtime to give your body enough time to digest, get ready for bed by practising relaxing disciplines such as meditation or yoga, and avoid night-time activities that make it difficult to get to sleep, such as watching TV or checking social media. - Breathing Breathing slowly and deeply focuses us on the present moment and helps to release tension. Different breathing techniques (diaphragmatic, conscious, pranayama) stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls, balances and regulates the relaxation response. - Connecting with nature Walking in the forest surrounded by trees or walking barefoot in nature helps to recharge the body with negative electrons, which promotes alkalinity and reduces acidity. - Emotions Maintaining healthy, loving relationships, connecting with others, learning to use your mind in a creative, meditative and relaxed way and staying positive are a great source of energy. Also, a sense of humour is very important because muscles relax and stress is reduced when you're happy and laughing.
