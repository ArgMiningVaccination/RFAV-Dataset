She directs the Sports Nutrition program at the University and for the Department of Sports Medicine in the Division of Athletics. Dr. Rodriguez served as Chair of University of Connecticut Institutional Review Board for the Use of Human Subjects (IRB) from 2004-2008. Dr. Rodriguez's research program focuses on relationships between exercise, protein intake, energy balance, and protein utilization in athletes, physically active adults, and healthy obese and non-obese children. Her work has been published in the American Journal of Physiology, Metabolism, Journal of Nutrition, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, and the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism. Dr. Rodriguez currently teaches sports nutrition, medical nutrition therapy, and the protein component of the graduate course, Macronutrients. She also participates in the department faculty rotation for graduate seminar in nutrition and the undergraduate writing course. Dr. Rodriguez received her B.S. in Human Nutrition and Foods at Virginia Tech. She earned her MS in nutrition and a PhD in biochemistry at West Virginia University. She spent two years at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN as an NIH Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Endocrinology and Metabolism. Dr. Rodriguez is an active member of the American Society of Nutrition, the American Dietetic Association and its Dietetic Practice Group - Sports, Cardiovascular and Wellness Nutritionists, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the American Physiological Society.
