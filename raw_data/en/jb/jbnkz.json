How do vaccines prevent severe illness from COVID-19? [Vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) train the immune system to recognize and combat the virus before it has a chance to attack the immune system. If a person who has been vaccinated is exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19, the antibodies present in their blood will fight the virus and protect them from developing the disease. Several [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) have been developed for COVID-19. The purpose of all [vaccinations](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) is to generate an immune response that is specific to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Most COVID-19 [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm) use the coronavirus spike protein to trigger an immune response. These spike proteins help the virus connect to cells and move through the sickness. The spike protein is recognized as a foreign pathogen by the immune system, which responds by releasing immune cells and antibodies that linger in the bloodstream and fight the virus. If a person who has been vaccinated is later exposed to the coronavirus, their immune system will fight the virus more effectively. The FDA has declared that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) meets the safety and efficacy standards for authorization in children ages 5-11, and scientists are continuing to conduct studies. According to the CDC, children ages 2-4, unvaccinated children ages 5 and older, and adults should continue to wear masks, wash hands regularly, and maintain a physical distance of 6 [feet](https://www.medicinenet.com/feet_facts_quiz/quiz.htm) from other people in public areas. 4 types of COVID-19 vaccines and how they work 1.Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines RNA is used as a genetic code in COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations. The RNA signals the cells to begin generating harmless spike protein fragments on the cell surface after vaccination. The immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign and conducts an immunological response, which includes the development of antibodies. mRNA vaccines are offered in two doses. Examples include Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. 2. Vaccines against viral vectors In this sort of vaccine, the genetic material from the COVID-19 virus is inserted into another weakened live virus, such as an [adenovirus](https://www.medicinenet.com/killer_cold_virus_adenovirus_infection_ad14/article.htm). After vaccination, the weakened virus, known as a viral vector, enters the cells. It transfers the genetic material of the COVID-19 virus that directs the cells to make harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein. When cells display spike proteins on their surfaces, the immune system recognizes the protein as foreign and responds by producing antibodies and defense white blood cells to combat it. Vector immunizations are given in a single or two-dose series (preferred). Johnson & Johnson, Sputnik V, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vectors are used in COVID-19 vaccinations. 3. Protein subunits vaccine Protein subunit vaccinations use lab-produced spike protein. When the spike protein enters the body, immune cells recognize it as foreign and begin creating T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine is a protein subunit immunization. 4. Inactive vaccine Unlike traditional vaccines, inactivated vaccines contain the entire coronavirus structure after it has been chemically rendered inactive. To inactivate the virus, most vaccinations use a chemical called beta-propiolactone. This vaccination, unlike others, does not produce a substantial immunological response that lasts a long time. Adjuvants could be added to inactivated COVID-19 vaccines to improve the immune response. In the long run, booster shots may be required to provide long-term immunity. Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines are available from Sinovac, Sinopharm, and Bharat Biotech. What are the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 vaccines protect people in the following ways: - Aids in the [prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm)of COVID-19 by slowing or preventing community transmission - Reduces the risk serious illness and hospitalization and prevents death if COVID-19 is contracted - Contributes to herd immunity by making it harder for the disease to spread because the number of people who are protected from COVID-19 grows - Prevents the COVID-19 virus from replicating and allowing it to mutate In healthy children and adults, vaccinations are safe and effective. Before getting vaccinated, people with underlying medical issues should consult a doctor. https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/17965?autologincheck=redirected https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2500139-overview https://reference.medscape.com/drug/bnt-162b2-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-mRNA-pfizer-4000140 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/covid-19-vaccines-to-prevent-sars-cov-2-infection https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=ID%2F130711 [Complete List](https://www.medicinenet.com/increased_risk_of_serious_illness_from_covid-19/index.htm) Top Serious Illness From COVID-19 Related Articles Coronavirus COVID-19 Prevention: Test Your Medical IQWhat's really the best way to prevent the spread of new coronavirus COVID-19?

How Do the COVID-19 Coronavirus Tests Work?Tests used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) may use two methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of COVID-19 disease, a debilitating and potentially deadly viral pneumonia. Genomic or molecular detection confirms the presence of viral DNA. The immunoglobulin or serology tests can tell whether or not you have been exposed to coronavirus, but not whether you are currently infected. Both tests administered in tandem can give you your complete COVID-19 infection status. How Long Is a COVID-19 Patient Contagious?People infected with COVID-19 can still be contagious even when they stop feeling sick, so precautionary measures should continue for at least 2 weeks after symptoms disappear and until the COVID-19 test result is negative. Ideally, patients should be quarantined at home or an institution for 2 weeks after the symptoms completely disappear.

Yes, recovering from COVID-19 makes your immune system stronger. Lung and Respiratory: Signs That You May Have Had COVID-19Could you have already had COVID-19 and not know it? Learn some signs that might indicate just that. What Are the Most Common Long-Term Effects of COVID-19?Most people recover from COVID-19 in two weeks. The most common long-term effects of COVID-19 infection are mood problems, neurological issues, heart disease, liver disease, lung disease, and heart disease. How to Differentiate Between the Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19, Allergies, Cold, and Flu?Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 will experience a mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without the need for intensive or special treatment. Serious illness is more likely in elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer. Tests Available for COVID-19Getting tested for COVID-19 can identify you as a positive or negative patient of the disease. Remember no test is 100% accurate. Different methods of testing have been launched to trace COVID-19 infection. What Drugs May Fight COVID-19? Drug Trials, Treatments, VaccinesWhat drugs could help fight coronavirus COVID-19? Clinical studies are ongoing for antiviral drugs like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine remdesivir, lopinavir and favipiravir, as well as COVID-19 vaccines. Learn why anti-flu respiratory drugs and home remedies may prove useful to treat or prevent serious coronavirus infections. What Is Considered to Be Fever for COVID-19?A body temperature of 100.4 degrees F or higher is generally seen in people with COVID-19, although not everyone who is infected with the virus will develop a fever. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear 2-14 days after exposure to infection. Other COVID-19 symptoms may include cough, runny nose, body aches, headache, sore throat, difficulty breathing, nausea with or without vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste, loss of smell, and abdominal pain. What Is the COVID-19 Antibody Test For?The COVID-19 antibody test, also known as a serology test, is a blood test that looks for antibodies to determine whether you have had a recent or past infection of the virus that causes COVID-19.

COVID-19 (Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV)Infection with COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV) causes respiratory problems in humans. Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly through contact with respiratory sections from an infected person, however, fecal contamination may also spread the virus. Symptoms start off flu-like and progress to coughing, fever, shortness of breath, shaking chills, headache, loss of sense of taste and/or smell, muscle pain, and sore throat. Treatment focuses on supportive care and symptom relief. COVID-19 vaccines are available. "}
