The COVID-19 vaccine is an mRNA vaccine that helps our body develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. mRNA is the instructions for the cell on how to make proteins. In the COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA teaches our body to make a harmless \"spike protein\" that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. After a piece of the protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA and disposes of it. It is important to note that the mRNA strand never enters the cell's nucleus, where our genetic material is stored. Thus, mRNA vaccines never alter someone's genetic makeup. The cell presents the \"spike protein\" on its surface, causing the immune system to begin producing a response by making antibodies, to fight off what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which means the immune system is ready to protect against future infection (CDC). Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe for Me? mRNA vaccines do not contain the live virus and do not carry a risk of causing the disease in the vaccinated person (CDC). mRNA from the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell and does not affect a person's DNA (CDC). COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Many people were recruited to participate in these trials to see how the vaccines offer protection to people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as those with different medical conditions (CDC). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carefully reviews all safety data from clinical trials and authorizes emergency vaccine use only when the expected benefits outweigh potential risks (CDC). What is the dosing schedule for the COVID-19 Vaccine? For most individuals, two shots are needed for the initial series to provide the best protection against strains of COVID-19, or against severe symptoms and hospitalization if you still end up contracting the virus. The second shot is given 3-4 weeks after your first shot. The first shot primes the immune system, helping it recognize the virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response (CDC). However, as of August 2021, the CDC has ruled that those who have compromised immune systems are recommended by the CDC to receive a third COVID-19 vaccine dose 28 days after the completion of their two-dose vaccine series. (This is not a booster shot, and persons receiving this third dose should still receive their booster dose 5 months later). Such individuals include those who are: - Receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood - Organ transplant recipients and those who are taking medications to suppress the immune system - Recipients of a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Individuals with moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Individuals with advanced or untreated HIV infection - Receiving active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy that causes severe immunosuppression, or other medications that may suppress your immune response. Additionally, as of January 2022, children 5 through 11 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who have been diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise, are now authorized to receive a third primary series dose of the vaccine. This will now allow these children to receive the maximum potential benefit from vaccination. Please consult with your doctor to assess whether you or your children qualify as immunocompromised individuals to receive a third dose of the vaccine. Am I eligible to receive the vaccine? All individuals 5 years of age and older that reside in the United States, regardless of immigration or citizenship status, are eligible to receive the vaccine How beneficial are the vaccines, and which ones are recommended? We urge patients to get vaccinated. The vaccines confer immunity to many strains of the virus, and for those that they do not confer complete immunity, they have been found to reduce severity of the disease (and subsequent hospitalization and death) significantly ( [French study of over 22m people finds vaccines cut severe Covid risk by 90% | Coronavirus | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/11/french-study-vaccines-cut-covid-deaths)). There are three major vaccines available in the U.S.: 1) Pfizer-BioNTech 2) Moderna 3) Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine Update as of December 2021: A CDC federal advisory panel has recommended that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines be the preferred choices for patients. This expert panel heard updated information about thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare blood clotting condition that has been linked to the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine, but not to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. This is very rare adverse event for patients who have received the J&J vaccine. If you received the J&J vaccine more than 4 weeks ago, you are not at increased risk for these side effects. However, going forward anyone with a history of TTS should not receive the J&J vaccine. Both the CDC and the FDA have recommended that patients receiving the J&J vaccine, especially women under the age of 50, monitor for symptoms up to 1-2 weeks following the vaccine. These included severe headaches, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling (suggestive of a clot), blurry vision, or easy bruising or small blood spots under the skin beyond the injection site. If any of those symptoms develop, people should seek medical care immediately. Am I eligible for a booster, and when should I receive it? As of January 2022, the CDC has indicated that anyone 12 years of age and up is eligible to receive boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Additionally, the CDC and FDA has indicated that anyone 18 years of age and older should receive a booster, at least five months after receiving their second Pfizer or Moderna vaccine shot. For those who received the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, booster shots are also recommended for those who are 18 and older and who were vaccinated two or more months ago. However, going forward, we recommend unvaccinated patients opt for the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Can I receive a booster from a different vaccine from the initial series? As of October 2021, the FDA has authorized the \"mixing and matching\" of booster doses. Therefore, if you receive one initial series (e.g. Pfizer-BioNTech), you can receive a booster from a different vaccine (e.g. Moderna). The J&J vaccine is also authorized for use in people 18 and older and can be used as a booster shot for adults fully vaccinated with the J&J, Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. However, the initial series of two shots (or three if immunocompromised) has to be done with the same vaccine. What can I do to keep myself safe until I can receive the vaccine? Until you are able to receive the vaccine, the CDC recommends that you continue these safe behavioral practices to keep yourself and your loved ones protected: - Wear a mask over your nose and mouth - Stay at least 6 feet away from others - Avoid crowds - Avoid poorly ventilated spaces - Wash your hands often What should I let my vaccination provider know before I receive the vaccine? - Your allergies, particularly if you have severe allergic reactions to any ingredient of the vaccines (both vaccines DO NOT contain eggs, preservatives, or latex) - If you have a fever - If you have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner - If you are immunocompromised or are taking medication that affects your immune system - If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant - If you are breastfeeding - If you have received another COVID-19 vaccine and when - Any other pertinent medical condition What are the side effects of the vaccine? After receiving the vaccine, you may experience these potential side effects : - Injection site pain - Fatigue - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Injection site swelling - Injection site redness - Nausea - Feeling unwell - Swollen lymph nodes More serious side effects from vaccination can happen, but they are very rare. Please call 911 or go to the nearest hospital if you experience these symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis: - Difficulty breathing - Swelling of your face and throat - Fast heartbeat - Rashes/hives all over the body - Dizziness and weaknesses Do I have to continue wearing a mask even after I receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. There is not enough information at this time to determine whether receiving the COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus to others, even if you won't get sick yourself. To help keep your family, friends, and community safe, it is recommended that you continue to follow these recommendations by the CDC: - Wear a mask over your nose and mouth - Stay at least 6 feet away from others - Avoid crowds - Avoid poorly ventilated spaces - Wash your hands often Have more questions about the COVID-19 Vaccine?
