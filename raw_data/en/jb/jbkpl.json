GENERIC NAME: LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR SOLUTION - ORAL product contains two medications: ] [lopinavir and ritonavir](https://www.medicinenet.com/lopinavir_and_ritonavir/article.htm). This product is used with other [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm) medications to help control [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv_aids_myths_and_facts_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) infection. It helps to decrease the amount of [HIV](https://www.medicinenet.com/hiv-aids_quiz/quiz.htm) in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm)) and improves your quality of life. Both lopinavir and [ritonavir](https://www.medicinenet.com/ritonavir/article.htm) belong to a class of [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) known as [HIV protease inhibitors](https://www.medicinenet.com/protease_inhibitors_pi_drug_class/article.htm). Ritonavir increases of lopinavir. This helps lopinavir work better.Because this solution contains other ingredients ( [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm) and propylene glycol) that may cause side effects, it is not recommended for premature (pre-term) newborns right after birth or full-term newborns younger than 14 days of age, unless your doctor thinks it is right for your baby. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.Lopinavir/ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, do all of the following: (1) continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor, (2) always use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane [condoms](https://www.medicinenet.com/condoms/article.htm)/dental dams) during all sexual activity, and (3) do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes, and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.OTHER This section contains uses of this drug that are not listed in the approved professional labeling for the drug but that may be prescribed by your health care professional. Use this drug for a condition that is listed in this section only if it has been so prescribed by your health care professional.This product may also be used in combination with other HIV medications to reduce the risk of getting HIV infection after contact with the virus. Consult your doctor for more details.

QT prolongation can infrequently result in serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness, [fainting](https://www.medicinenet.com/fainting/symptoms.htm)) that need medical attention right away.The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation.

This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics/\"water pills\") or if you have conditions such as severe [sweating](https://www.medicinenet.com/sweating_perspiration_quiz/quiz.htm), [diarrhea](https://www.medicinenet.com/diarrhea_digestive_problem_food_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), or vomiting.

However, HIV medicines are now usually given to [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm) women with HIV.

Tell your doctor if you have any new [spotting](https://www.medicinenet.com/spotting_vs_period_differences/article.htm) or breakthrough bleeding, because these may be signs that your hormonal birth control is not working well.Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other products that cause drowsiness including other drugs that contain alcohol, [antihistamines](https://www.medicinenet.com/antihistamines-oral/article.htm) (such as [cetirizine](https://www.medicinenet.com/cetirizine/article.htm), [diphenhydramine](https://www.medicinenet.com/diphenhydramine/article.htm)), drugs for relievers (such as [codeine](https://www.medicinenet.com/codeine/article.htm)).Check the labels on all your medicines (such as [allergy](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm) or [cough](https://www.medicinenet.com/cough/symptoms.htm)-and- [cold](https://www.medicinenet.com/common_cold/article.htm) products) because they may contain ingredients that cause drowsiness.
