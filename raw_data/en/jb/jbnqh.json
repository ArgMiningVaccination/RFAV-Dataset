Crowley Natural Health Intuitive & Energy Medicine To enjoy a healthy life, it's essential to regularly clear and rejuvenate your body's energy. As a result, deep relaxation and renewed vitality can be expected. Hilary practices Natural Health Intuition by connecting to the energy field of the body, allowing her to detect imbalances, clear blocks and restore optimal vitality. When energetic balance is achieved, the body can respond quicker and more thoroughly to any healing process. Natural Health Intuition is not a substitute for a medical diagnosis but can assist in identifying the root cause of an issue at the physical, chemical, emotional and spiritual level. It is an appropriate complement to both conventional and integrative care. Hilary discovered the healing arts as the grandchild of three doctors. In her early career, she worked at University of Massachusetts Medical and Dartmouth Medical Center. Since 1995, she has studied with leaders in energy medicine and medical intuition. Hilary teaches on topics of energy medicine and health throughout New England, New York and abroad. Each session includes a brief intake and final written summary. You will be on the table for approximately one hour. Sessions can include hands-on touch or non-touch techniques. This is not a massage and only shoes need to be removed. For your appointment, please wear comfortable clothing. Remember to drink plenty of water before and after your appointment to assist your body's clearing process. For best results after deep relaxation, it is recommended to follow a simple and restful schedule for the remainder of the day. Hilary's practice welcomes children, teens and adults.
