If you arrive from the Lindeman Pavilion via the Skybridge or from the Buck Pavilion, the hospital lobby is located on level 4. If you're having surgery, you'll receive a call from your surgeon's office the day before to assign your arrival time at Virginia Mason Medical Center. On the morning of your surgery, you should report to the either the registration desk on level 5 of the Lindeman Pavilion or the surgery check-in on level 6 of the hospital, with access from outside at 1000 Spring St. After registration, you'll be taken to the operating room area.

Please be prepared to list all medications and herbal supplements you take as well as previous surgeries, resulting complications and problems related to an anesthesia, medications or allergies. Each patient room has a telephone and TV. There is no charge for local calls; however, the hospital doesn't provide free long-distance phone service.
