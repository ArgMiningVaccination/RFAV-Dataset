In clinical studies on the individual ingredients, it was demonstrated that mouth sores can be significantly reduced in the first month. Further studies have found that after three months of supplementation, mouth sores may not appear for up to 1 year following the supplement regimen. Zinc: Works with specific enzymes in your mouth to help soothe mouth sores, and promote tissue healing. Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid: People with recurring mouth sores have been found to be deficient in vitamin B12 and Folic Acid. Lysine: This essential amino acid is believed to help suppress outbreaks and to promote the natural recovery of mouth sores. Lysine also has shown promise in helping to combat cold sores and fever blisters on the lips. Glutamine: Stress is one factor that is believed to play a role in creating mouth sores. Stress is also thought to deplete the body of glutamine. Vitamin C: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects the cells in your mouth, and helps keep your immune system strong. It offers great benefit for keeping teeth, gums, and the mucous lining of your mouth nutritionally healthy. Vitamin C also plays a role in helping your body produce white blood cells that can help fight off mouth sores. Iron is another supplement used in the Monoplex formula. Here is a study done on iron and canker sores: Background: Ferritin is the storage form of iron. Hence, the sensitive test which can be used for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia is an estimation of ferritin in serum. One of the causative factors of oral ulceration is a nutritional deficiency, which includes iron also. Aim: To study the meaningful association between recurrent oral ulcer and ferritin. Materials and Methods: Fifty oral ulcer cases which were diagnosed clinically in the ENT Department of Sree Balaji Medical College and Hospital and Twenty Five controls were included in this study. Serum ferritin was estimated by doing a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay for both cases and controls. Results: 66% of cases had decreased ferritin values and 34% had normal values, which was significant. Conclusion: From this study, it can be concluded that it is mandatory to screen oral ulcer patients for iron deficiency anemia by estimating serum ferritin and it is also advisable for the patients to have iron supplementation on regular basis, along with diet rich in iron in addition to vitamins.
