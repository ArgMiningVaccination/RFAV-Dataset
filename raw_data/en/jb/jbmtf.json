Naturopathic doctors see patients as individuals and treat them as such. They evaluate all body systems and assess the underlying root causes for disease, treating the problem instead of at best suppressing symptoms. Put simply, naturopathic medicine uses understanding of human physiology and science to maintain the body's balance using a variety of treatments that maximize lasting health and minimize side effects. Like all professional branches of medicine, naturopathic medicine requires years of training. Naturopathic physicians are trained to be primary care doctors. They attend specialized, accredited naturopathic medical schools to attain a Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine (ND). It's a demanding four-year post-graduate degree with emphasis on basic science, anatomy, and physiology, as well as on-site patient-care and advanced training in naturopathic treatment modalities. Naturopathic doctors are trained to use standard diagnostic tools such as conventional lab testing, MRI, CT and x-rays, as well as innovative testing for nutrient status, toxic load, hormonal levels and neurotransmitter interactions. NDs work in clinics, multi-disciplinary practices, and integrative hospital clinics throughout the country and across the world. In America, naturopathic physicians sit for two national board exams, which makes them eligible for a state license. NDs prioritize research and growth. Health Moves professionals regularly participate in conferences to further educate and innovate, constantly pursuing naturopathic medicine's shared goal of patient health and vitality.
