[Alcohol Treatment Studies) [Collaborative Care PACE/PACENET Studies](trc_clinical_trials.html#Collaborative Care) Imaging Studies (involving various substances) Pilot Study of a Multi-System Analysis of Opioid Receptor Binding Substance of use: Opioids + healthy adults who are not using drugs Age: 18-50 Study Description: In all three groups, we will use [11C]carfentanil whole-body PET imaging to examine the central nervous system (CNS) and broader systemic opioid binding in an initial scan session. In the two groups not receiving MAT for OUD, we will also examine the effects on [11C]carfentanil binding potential of the blockade of opioid binding by the non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone administered parenterally in a second scan session. This project will inform clinically relevant questions related to OUD and chronic pain. Duration of Involvement: 6-8 weeks Involvement: 4-5 visits total - Screening/intake session (~2.5-3 hours) - Baseline visit (~2.5-3 hours) - Brain MRI scan (~1 hour) - 1 or 2 PET scan visits (~3 hours) Compensation Provided? Yes Using 18F-NOS Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT) in HIV Positive and Negative Subjects with Opioid Use Disorder and Healthy Controls Substance of Use: Opioids Age: 18-60 Study description: The purpose of this research is to measure the extent of inflammation in the brain between different groups of participants using a radioactive drug called [18F]NOS that is injected into the body and used to create images. This study will see how the drug is taken up in the brain using an imaging scan called Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT). This is not a treatment study. [18F]NOS is an experimental radioactive imaging drug used in PET imaging to measure inflammation in various organs in the body, including the brain. We are interested in studying whether there are differences in brain inflammation between people that have a history of opioid drug use and those that do not and in people that are HIV positive or negative. You may have neither, one, or both of these conditions. [18F]NOS has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study. The use of [18F]NOS in this study is allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application approved by the FDA. We are also going to be studying how the information from the PET/CT scan compares to other markers of inflammation in the blood and we will also compare it to other psychological testing measures and information about use of opioids. We will do a brain scan to see if there is a difference between inflammation seen in the brain depending on which group you are in (HIV +/- and history of opioid use or none). Duration of Involvement: 6 weeks Involvement: 4 sessions at the University of Pennsylvania + 1 phone-call: - Consent and Screening Session (~3 hours) - Baseline Session (~2 hours) - MRI scan (~1 hour for scan) - PET session (~3 hours, 1 hour for scan + 2 hours for assessments) - Follow-up phone call Compensation Provided?

The ketone ester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate, is a ketone monoester that has been studied in humans and is FDA approved as a nutritional supplement (FDA GRAS). The study will see how the brain responds, once after drinking the ketone ester and once after drinking a \"placebo\", which will look and taste the same as the ketone ester drink. We will not tell you which drink is which. We will study the brain using MRI, which is a large magnet. We will test how your brain functions at rest and while viewing pictures of alcohol. We are also interested in if the ketone ester makes you want to drink alcohol more or less. This is not a study to help you quit or reduce your drinking. Duration of Involvement: up to 8 weeks Involvement: 4 sessions at the University of Pennsylvania - Consent + Screening Session (4-5 hours) - 1st in-person study visit that includes the drinking of the ketone ester, a brain MRI scan and alcohol drinking after the scan (~7-8 hours) - 2nd in-person visit that includes the drinking of a placebo, a brain MRI, and alcohol drinking after the scan (~7-8 hours) Compensation Provided?

Substance of Use: Opioids Study Description: Both pre-clinical research (animal models) and recent clinical observations suggest that exposure to highly potent opioid agonists, especially fentanyl, may impact the brain's memory circuitry and other neurocognitive functions. A subgroup of individuals with fentanyl-overdose have shown a profound amnestic syndrome that may reflect specific damage to the hippocampus, above and beyond the less specific effects of reduced oxygen to the brain during overdose. Thus, the overall hypothesis of this study is that patients with chronic pain or opioid use disorder (OUD) who have been on long-term, high-dose opioids (especially if they have had an overdose) may evidence hippocampal injury (loss of volume) and associated neurocognitive dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of MRI imaging and neuropsychological testing, involving a single MRI session, and a computerized task session. This NIH/NIDA-supported study is conducted by Dr. Andrew Kofke (Anesthesiology) and Dr. Paul Regier (Psychiatry, Center for Study on Addictions). Age: 18-50 Populations: Medically-eligible males and females (non-pregnant) with chronic use of opioid agonists, either for pain or in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), who are able to undergo an MRI and a single computerized task session. Duration: MRI and computerized tasks can usually be completed on the same day. Compensation: $200 for completion of the MRI, computerized tasks, and questionnaires.

This study aims to combine behavioral, clinical and MRI data to predict treatment outcomes for patients undergoing medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. There is a screening visit that includes a urine drug test, physical exam, questionnaires, and interviews. Eligible participants will undergo an MRI followed monthly in-person visits, as well as optional weekly phone surveys and short daily text surveys. This is not a treatment study. MRI uses magnetic fields to take pictures of the brain. MRI does not use X-rays and is non-invasive. Involvement: - Consent and Screening Session (4 hours) - Baseline visit & MRI scan (1 hour for MRI scan, 3 hours for surveys) - Six monthly follow-up visits (1 hour each) - Recommended weekly phone surveys (30 min each) - Recommended daily text surveys (2 min each) Duration of Involvement: 25 weeks Compensation Provided?

Participants must desire to reduce or stop drinking to participate. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a treatment phase that lasts 8 weeks. During the 8-week study medication period, you will be asked to come to the CSA every other week. You will also complete daily interactive voice response (IVR) system assessments via your telephone. This will take less than 5 minutes/day. Duration of Involvement: 12 weeks Involvement: 6 or more visits to the University of Pennsylvania - Start: Consent + Screening Session (3 hours) - Week 0: Baseline Assessments, randomization + 1st injection (1.5 hours) - Week 2: 1st Bi-weekly visit - assessments, counseling (45 mins) - Week 4: 2nd Bi-weekly visit - assessments, counseling + 2nd injection (45 mins) - Week 6: 3rd Bi-weekly - assessments, counseling (45 mins) - Week 8: End-point visit - assessments, end of treatment (1 hour) - Week 12: Follow-up - assessments, debrief (1 hour) Compensation A Randomized, Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Ibudilast Alcohol Use Disorder Substance of Use: Alcohol Age: 18-70 Study description: The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug Ibudilast compared to placebo (an inactive pill) in reducing the number of drinking days and the amount of alcohol consumed by people who want to stop or reduce their drinking. Use of this drug in the treatment of alcohol use disorder is experimental. Ibudilast is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clinical use in the United States. However, it has been used clinically for 20 years in Asia to treat bronchial asthma and, more recently, for post-stroke dizziness and eye allergies and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated. Recent clinical studies have provided support for the utility of Ibudilast in treating Alcohol Use Disorder.

Yes Study Contact Number: [(215) Cocaine Treatment Studies A Phase 2a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the impact of cariprazine (1.5mg) on cocaine use in OUD-CocUD patients on medication-assisted opioid treatment (MAT). Substance of Use: and Opioids Age: 18-65 years old Study Description: Pre-clinical data indicate that agents reducing overall activity at the brain's dopamine D3 receptors may be helpful in blunting cue-triggered motivation (\"craving\") states. Cariprazine, an atypical anti-psychotic already FDA-approved for thought and mood dysfunctions, has actions at D3 receptors, reduced cocaine-seeking in animals, and also (in pilot work) reduced the brain response to cocaine cues in reward/motivational circuits. This is a phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study designed to test whether low-dose cariprazine (1.5mg/d) can reduce cocaine use, and thus improve regular taking of MAT, in medically-stable OUD patients with co-occurring Cocaine-use Disorder who have already been taking prescribed buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone at a stable dose for at least one week. This NIH/NIDA-supported study is conducted by Drs. Kyle Kampman and Dr. Anna Rose Childress. - Screening (approx. 1-2 weeks) - Baseline (1-2 visits; includes baseline assessments, behavioral tasks/fNIRS session, and randomization) - Outpatient treatment (8 wks; 2 visits/wk, includes daily cariprazine (or placebo), daily buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone (at the participants' usual community treatment site), and brain imaging (fNIRS/fMRI), behavioral tasks after 10-17 days on cariprazine. - Follow-up: A follow-up visit to assess medical and psychological status will occur approximately 1 week after the last dose of study medication. Compensation: $25-$100 per visit, depending on the study activity Study Contact Numbers: [215-746-2767](tel:215-746-2767) or [215-746-7712](tel:215-746-7712) Opioid Treatment Studies ED-initiated Buprenorphine at Presbyterian Medical Center Substance of Use: Opioids Study Description: Emergency physicians at Penn Presbyterian ED are leading a NIDA funded national study, ED-INNOVATION, to address the optimal formulation of buprenorphine for initiation of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). CAM2038 is a slow-release injection of buprenorphine that lasts for 7 days. The clinical outcomes at 7 days with CAM2038 will be compared to those with the conventional shorter-acting formulation of buprenorphine-naloxone (sublingual film). The study hypothesis is that the long-acting formulation may be a better 'bridge' to ongoing buprenorphine maintenance. The study team is led by Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone and includes colleagues Dr. David Jang, Dr. Anish Agarwal, Dr. Zachary Meisel and RIDE+ Substance of Use: Opioids with co-occuring diagnosis of HIV Study Description: This CDC-funded research study will help us see whether providing medical services in a mobile unit will help persons who inject drugs (PWID) start and stay on anti-HIV medicines and medicines for opioid use disorder better. All participants will be assigned to one of two groups by random chance (the equivalent of throwing dice). The difference between the groups is that the first group will receive health care services delivered on a mobile unit. These services include medication for opioid use disorder, HIV testing, HIV treatment for people living with HIV and not in care, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for people who do not have HIV, and STI testing and treatment. The second group will have their initial Screening and Enrollment Visits in the mobile unit, but all other visits will occur in regular clinics in the area. Participants in both groups will be assigned a peer navigator for 26 weeks who will assist participants in accessing and remaining in medical care. All participants will come in for study assessments at approximately six and 12 months after starting the study and will be in the study for about a year total. The study is led by Dr. Dave Metzger and Dr. Cecile Denis.
