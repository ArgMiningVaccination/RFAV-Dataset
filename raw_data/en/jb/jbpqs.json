On October 15 Hilton unveiled The Spa Club - a global spa treatment membership. After identifying the need to increase foot traffic during slower weekday periods, Hilton developed the offering as the first to shift the $15.5 billion spa industry from a typically weekend-driven business to weekdays. The membership targets a new set of customers - those living near Hilton spas - positioning the hotel spa in a new light for locals. \u00b7 The Spa Club encourages customer commitment to wellness and offers local residents a discounted spa treatment each month, access to amenities at the Hilton nearest them, and a host of other perks. \u00b7 The Spa Club provides a unique business solution for spas at select Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Curio - A Collection by Hilton, DoubleTree by Hilton and Embassy Suites by Hilton properties around the world while also catering to wellness seekers looking for an affordable offering. \u00b7 Hilton Worldwide is one of the largest providers of spa services on a global scale, with more than 400 hotels offering spa services worldwide. \u00b7 With overall spa treatment utilization being approximately 40%, slower weekday traffic and seasonally weak periods have a significant negative affect on overall traffic at spas. The Spa Club addresses this head on. [Image courtesy "}
