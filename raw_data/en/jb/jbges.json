Balance Bike vs Tricycle vs Training Wheels A balance bike differs from a tricycle or a bike with training wheels by focusing on balancing rather than pedaling. By mastering their ability to stabilize themselves, they will have a much easier time transitioning to a traditional bicycle. Why Buy a Wooden Bike? Wooden bikes serve as the perfect tool to teach your child how to ride the bike. Teaching them to peddle is easy, teaching them to retain their balance is much more difficult. A wooden balancing bike makes this task easier - and safer! Wooden bikes are also thicker than aluminum frame bikes, allowing for a larger center of balance. This difference assists in keeping your child well-balanced as they learn to ride. 6 Things to Consider When Buying a Wooden Balance Bike To ensure that you get the best balance bike for your child's needs, let's explore some key factors that will play a role in your purchase. Bike Weight The rule of thumb to follow when investing in any bike is that the bike should not weigh more than 30% of your child's weight. So if your child weighs 50 pounds, for example, the bike should weigh around 15 pounds. With this in mind, you will be able to choose the best balance bike based on your child's weight. Seat Height and Adjustability When purchasing a bike, especially your child's very first bike, you want to make sure that you choose one that fits their size and weight. This means selecting a bike that isn't too big for them, as this can lead to injury. While it's certainly alright to invest in a bike that grows with your child, you never want to get a bike that your child has to grow into. You can make sure that a bike is suitable for your little one by measuring their inseam and subtracting an inch. If the seat's lowest height equals the number you got, you know that the bike is safe for them to ride. And if you buy a bike with an adjustable seat, your child is sure to get many years of use out of it. Tire Type There are five tire types: EVA foam, pneumatic, rubber, hard plastic, and big apple tires. Each of these tires has its own unique benefits and applied uses. EVA foam tires are very light and require little maintenance. These tires are ideal for children three years of age and younger. Pneumatic tires are prone to popping and weigh much more than EVA foam. Pneumatic tires require frequent maintenance and will become a pain for a parent of a younger child. Rubber tires also weigh in on the heavier side. These tires rarely pop but are better suited for indoor use. Hard plastic tires are the lightest of all the tires, but they are also the lowest in quality. These tires are generally used with indoor riding toys. And lastly, big apple tires are much wider than other options. They offer a built-in suspension system that provides the user with a smoother ride. These tires are ideal for anyone, including younger children. Frame Materials Wooden bikes are environmentally-friendly, with a focus on teaching kids better balance. However, they are less adjustable than most other bikes and should be used on flat, hard surfaces, like sidewalks. Design Most kids like personal items that speak to their unique preferences. When it comes to buying a bike for your child, the design is just as important as every other consideration. If the bike is something that they like, your child is more likely to spend the necessary time on it to practice improving their balance. Warranty Whether a product comes with a warranty is a consideration that should be made on any purchase. Since bikes are prone to get bumped and scuffed, it's important to have the proper coverage in the event that something breaks. Balance Bike FAQs What age is best for a balance bike? Children who are aged anywhere between 18 months and five years old can benefit from a wooden balance bike. Oftentimes, a child is ready to safely transition to a traditional bicycle once they reach the age of five. With that being said, children typically benefit the most from balance bikes between the ages of 18 months and 2 \u00bd years. It is during this time that a child begins developing the necessary motor skills to keep themselves well-balanced. Are balance bikes worth it? Balance bikes are excellent tools that go a long way in assisting with your child's development. By focusing on balance instead of pedaling, your child is sure to benefit from using a wooden balance bike. Can you add pedals to a balance bike? Some balance bikes have the option of adding pedals. But remember, the goal here is to teach your child how to properly maintain their balance. While you certainly can invest in a model that accepts pedals, you want to be sure not to overwhelm your child or deviate from the main learning objective. When they get to the point that they are able to ride a pedal bike without losing balance, the best thing to do is buy them their first pedal bike. Can I take the pedals off a bike to make a balance bike? Taking the pedals off of a bike to create your own balance bike is a good idea. In fact, once your child has mastered the wooden balance bike, it is suggested that you do this. However, it is always better to start your child on a thicker wooden balancing bike. This allows them to start off with a larger center of gravity, which will allow them to retain their balance much more easily. What makes a wooden balance bike high-quality? Wooden balance bikes are used to teach your child how to maintain and regain their balance. This is an important development for any child, especially children eager to ride a bike. We believe that a high-quality balance bike will grow with your child between the ages of 18 months and five years. Once your child turns five, they will likely outgrow any wooden balance bike and be ready for the real deal. The best wooden balancing bikes also use the best materials. A wooden balance bike should weigh around 10 pounds, making birch the ideal wood for balance bikes, as it tends to weigh less. How can I encourage my child to use the balance bike? The most important thing you can do is buy a wooden balance bike that speaks to your child's preferences. Whether the bike is their favorite color or features their favorite cartoon character, your child will appreciate the uniqueness of it and be more apt to use it. Another way to encourage your child to use a balance bike is by demonstrating how to use it; perhaps by a sibling or friend. Young children mimic what they see. So by seeing someone they look up to using the balance bike, they are more likely to give it a go themselves. Above all, however, try to make the experience fun. Allow them to enjoy being on the balance bike and create an enjoyable atmosphere that they can associate with riding the wooden balance bike. Will a scooter teach my child the same skills as a balance bike? A scooter essentially teaches the same skills as a balance bike. Both teach balance and allow your child to get a better understanding of how gravity works. However, children often struggle with balancing on a scooter, as more support is needed. Riding a scooter requires more skill than using a balance bike. Think about it this way: you can start your child on a balance bike shortly after learning to walk, but you can't say the same for a scooter. Is my child already too old for a balance bike? Unless your child is over the age of five, it is unlikely that they are too old to benefit from a balancing bike. Children as young as 12 months can use these types of bikes all the way up to the age of five. The use of a balance bike is recommended to get your child ready to ride a bike. Once they have mastered riding the balance bike, they will then be ready to safely transition to a conventional bicycle.
