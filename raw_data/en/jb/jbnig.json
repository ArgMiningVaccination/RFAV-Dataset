This plan clearly lays out guiding principles for the City to follow as we continue on our journey to greater sustainability. Just as following strict fiscal princi ples has helped the City weather the current economic storm, adhering to these sustainabi lity principles will help us avoid problems in the future. The path that has been paved makes economic sens e with the added benef it of providing a better environment for future generations. I co mmit to you, the citizens of Spokane, that I will move the City onto the path provided. Ultimately, of course, the City can 't achieve the results we are l ooking for on our own. All of us will have to work together to make Spokane sust ainable and more resilient . I appreciate all the work that already has been done, and I look forw ard to engaging our community on this topic as we work to make a stronger and healthier Spokane. Sincerely, Mary B. Verner Mayor, City of Spokane \"Spokane - Near Na ture, Near Perfect\" 808 W. Spokane Falls Blvd., Spokane, Washington Phone: (509) 625-6250 mverner@spokanecity.org 4 1.0 Acknowledgements 1.01 Mayor's Task Force on Sustainability The members of the Mayor's Task Force on Sustai nability extend a note of personal appreciation to the individuals, companies, institu tions, agencies, and especially th e employers involved. Their support made each individual's participation in this important community initiative possible. This initiative included dozens of meetings and many individual hour s invested by the Task Force, meeting four hours every three weeks since April 2008. Such community participation shows that Spokane is a valued home, well worth the time and energy invested to ensure its future as a livable city.

Through the partners' networks and resources, they helped spread the buzz of sustainability, helping City staff and Task Fo rce members to engage more than 100 active participants. This process genera ted more than 800 individual contributions from the public. Additional meetings were hosted by Outreach Part ners including on-going discussions with other organizations and associations. Outreach Partners Greater Spokane Incorporated The Lands Council Futurewise NW Climate Change Center Spokane Regional Health District YMCA Spokane County Conservation District The Faith & Environment Network Downtown Spokane Partnership 1.04 Sounding Board The Task Force was also aided by a special Sounding Board. The Board consisted of City elected officials and staff and ot her leaders throughout the community. Their charge was to keep the Task Force focused on real issues and practic al solutions that can be successfully introduced into the City's operations, se rvices, programs, and policies. The Sounding Board applied a feasibility filter to all Task Force recommendations.

City staff cont ributed as Work Group participants, symposium attendees, and Green Team participants. The particular individuals listed below guided the City's effort to assess its current practices in relation to draft Task Force recommendations. City staff synthesized and documented the many concu rrent efforts involved in developing the Task Force recommendations. The contributions of thes e City staff members enabled the Task Force to complete its recommendations this past year: Susanne Croft, 2008 Sustainability Coordinator Lloyd Brewer, Environmental Programs Manager Brandon Betty, Project Planner Deborah Bisenius, Environmental Analyst Gerry Gemmill, Deputy Division Director, Public Works & Utilities 2.0 Introduction \"Spokane: A city near nature, unequaled fo r living, working, learning, and leisure\" 1... for the long haul. The City of Spokane's mission is \"To deliver e fficient and effective serv ices that facilitate economic opportunity and enhance quali ty of life.\" To this end, one of the critical roles of City's government is to secure the vibrancy of our community into the future. Doing so requires awareness of the challenges and opportunities th at can either hinder service effectiveness or strengthen economic vitality. With Mayor Dennis Hession's and City C ouncil's support Spokane's Environmental Programs office began the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory process in earnest in 2007. On February 7, 2007, Mayor Hession became the 104 th Mayor to endorse the U.S. Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement. And, on February 19, 2007, the City Council unanimously passed Resolution 07-09, the Quality of Life Initiative. Subsequently, the Planning Services Department began the City's first Green Building Initiati ve, which became the foundation for developing a strategic action plan for sustainable practices, in centives, policies and regulations across all City programs and activities. In la te 2007, the City was awarde d a $75,000 grant from Washington State Department of Community Trade and Economic Development (CTED) to develop such a Sustainability Action Plan. 1 City of Spokane Strategic Plan Update, 2007 http://www.spokanecity.org/government/strategicplan/summary/ 7 Mayor Mary Verner continued this focus on sustainability as a framework to secure Spokane's future vitality. She created her Sust ainability Initiative almo st immediately after assuming the office of Mayor. The CTED grant enabled the City to assess its operations in terms GHG emissions and preparedness to deal with a ny unavoidable consequences of c limate change. The grant also called for the City to plan for a time in the near future when petroleum-based fuels will be prohibitively expensive and sometimes unavailable. Sustainability is comprised of the concepts of economy, the environment and social networks (community). Since the Mayor's Sustainability Initiative uses these three concepts as its philosophical underpinnings, th e City was poised to respond to CTED's challenge. A thirteen-member Task Force was recruited from all parts of the Spokane community to meet the CTED challenge by developing a Sustaina bility Action Plan. Simultaneously the public was invited to participate in a ny of four workgroups establishe d by the Task Force. Several other citizens groups also assisted the Task Fo rce in developing ideas & recommendations for consideration. Participants were encouraged to recognize the s ynergy between the work of the Task Force on the challenges of climate change and petroleum fuel availability (commonly called \"peak oil.\") and the City's Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 2.1 The central role of planning \"Planning is a part of everyone's life. We make plans for our careers, vacations, families, and housing. Planning is how we increase the likelihood that these things will occur in ways we desire. Without plans, we face neverending uncertainty about future events. Consequently, we end up reacting to one situation after another. For similar reasons, communities make plans. In large urban areas where the landscape is highly complex and constantly changing, community plans shape the future in desirable ways. The city is a place where people have many varied needs, a place where citizens live, work, shop, and play. It is, therefore, a place where material goods, police and fire protection, sewers, water, transportation, recreation, and many other services must be provided.2\" The Task Force believes that its recommenda tions are a powerful planning tool to ensure that City government can continue to provi de those services we have come to expect of a city that presents itself to the world as \"near nature, near perfect. The Task Force has faith that City government will use this report as a navigation aid to a secure and sustainable vibrancy many generations into Spokane's future. To learn more about addressing the challenges of climate change and peak oil, Mayor Verner and City staff identified similar planning mode ls from leading cities both large and small. Seattle; Portland; Vancouver, B.C.; and Denver ar e some of Spokane's larger neighbors, all of whom are addressing sustainability issues. However, it is not just th e larger cities taking action: Burlington, VT; Sebastopol, CA; Boulder, CO; and Shoreline, WA are a few am ong many smaller cities that are working to address climate and energy issues. The globa l trend is clear: Re gardless of geography, demographics, or politics, municipalities are questioning basic assumptions and taking initiative to improve how their communities function over the long haul. Spokane's approach to sustainability planning is uniquely ahead of the curve. Previously, some cities have studied climate, while others have examined energy security. Spokane's 2 City of Spokane Comprehensive Plan, 2001 http://www.spokaneplanning .org/documents/BEGIN.pdf 8 Sustainability Task Force addressed climate ch ange and oil dependency simultaneously. We're not aware of any city that has previously done this. Spokane's Action Plan shows how planning for all three of these challenges can help government address economic vitality, environm ental integrity and community resilience in ways that turn these challenge s into opportunities for our comm unity. The Task Force set to work quickly with the following goals for inclusion in a sustainability plan for Spokane's future: 1. Climate Mitigation 2. Climate Adaptation 3. Energy Security Over the course of one year, our Task Force worked its way through the sequential phases of the project: discovery, risk assessm ent, deliberation, and consensus. A well-communicated public outreach plan produced significant citizen input that guided the overall direction of the final recommendations. The process yielded one simple message , accepted by members of every constituency the Task Force encountered during its work: Strive for good stewardship and efficiency in all things. The message is clear. Through good stewardshi p and improved efficiency, the City of Spokane will be better prepared for any number of possible conditions such as oil scarcity, energy price volatility, or changes in te mperature and precip itation patterns. Sustainability is about recognizing the limitations to our ecosystem and functioning within those limits to ensure the health, well-being and longevi ty of current and future generations. The United Nations Brundtland Commission ( 1990) definition of sustainability is: \"[to meet] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" 3 Source : Johann Dr\u00e9o/Wikimedia Commons This Action Plan does not contain all the an swers or solutions. It is not a bundle of regulations and mandates. The Plan is a portfolio of principles, strategies, and recommendations promoting energy-efficient development, sensible conservation of resources, and investment in money-saving alt ernatives to current materials, behaviors and practices. With the help of this plan, City government can increase its efficiency and enhance its ability \"to deliver efficient and effective services that facilitate economic opportunity and enhance quality of life\" for generations to come. The success of the Sustainability Action Pl an depends on the support it receives. The Mayor's Office and Executive Team, other City managers and employees, as well as the City Council, other organizations in th e community, and the public at large all have a role to play. 3 Our Common Future , 1987. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 9 Active and visible engagement by the City's major decision makers and the workforce is critical. This plan must be more than a well-ch arted but untraveled course to better stewardship and greater efficiency. The Task Force, with good guidance from citizen s who participated in the process, has provided clear strategies and recommendations to address climate change and peak oil concerns. The City gove rnment is now left to determine the best path forward the specific policies and practices need ed to implement the Action Plan. For information about the process used to ge nerate this Action Pla n, please refer to the supporting document, Sustaina bility Action Plan: Backgr ound, Process, & Deliberation (available at www.greenspokane.org ). 3.0 Summary of Action Plan Hundreds of suggestions, complaints, ideas, a nd recommendations were gathered by the Task Force and its Work Groups. Each contribution wa s inventoried, addressed and prioritized during the nearly year-long planning process. The Task Force also engaged in its own research by inviting local and national expert s to share their expertise on c limate and energy issues. Other cities' approaches to sust ainability planning also played a role in the shaping of Spokane's final recommendations. The many specific recommendations are too numerous to list in a simple summary. They are listed in Section 4, Sustainable Actio n Plan, which follows this section. Under the goals of Climate Mitigation, Clim ate Adaptation, and Energy Security, the Task Force identified four guiding principles to move toward sustainability and improve efficiency and stewardship within City govern ment. The principles are to: 1. Build stewardship into all facets of local government 2. Strengthen the connectivity of people, communities 3. Lead with incentives and education before mandates 4. Foster community resilien ce and socio-economic health In harmony with these guiding principles, the Ta sk Force also identified eight strategies to serve as the foundation for specific departmental policies designed to achieve the three goals. 1. Improve continuously 2. Emphasize renewable energy 3. Promote clean mobility 4. Enable optimal land use 5. Conserve water everywhere 6. Maximize energy efficiency 7. Optimize operating practices 8. Prepare through planning The final recommendations listed in the Sustainable Action Plan that follows this summary are associated with each of the eight strategies. They are not intended to be reactive responses to short-term problems. Rather, they sh ould be considered groundwork for the development of internal policy by decision makers within City government. They should frame an operating environment that will allow the City to make significant changes to ensure a vibrant future for Spokane. 10The visible and active response by the Mayor and the Executive Team, Division and Departmental Managers, and the City's workforce in general, is essential to implement lasting changes in behavior that positively af fect the well-being of the City. In a strong first step forward, the Mayor has aske d the Sustainability Task Force to continue to serve in an advisory role with regard to assessing the Action Plan's implementation. In that capacity, the Task Force will continue to seek stewardship, efficiency, and resilience in actions that will allow the City of Spokane gove rnment to become more sustainable. 4.0 Sustainability Action Plan 4.01 Goals When the Task Force commenced its strategic planning effort to find ways for the City of Spokane government to operate sustainably in its operations, services, programs, and policies, they were given three goals to provide a fram ework for deliberations. Spokane's unique planning model is highly sophisticated in its streamlined approach addr essing climate and energy issues simultaneously. The goals include: 1. Climate Mitigation: attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 2. Climate Adaptation: adjust practices to deal with the effect s of climate change 3. Energy Security: increase energy alte rnatives to reduce dependence on oil These broad goals will ultimately lay the founda tion for specific actions the City will take. City government will attempt to address the po tential impacts of climate change, adapt to changing temperature and precip itation patterns, and prepare for the development and use of alternative energy sources as petroleum oil beco mes more expensive and harder to find. The recommendations contained in the Action Plan a ddress one, two, and in so me cases, all three of the goals listed above. 4.02 Guiding Principles The Task Force received more than 800 unique contributions to its base of information in the form of Work Group recommendations, citizen comments, citizen and st aff complaints about current City practices and polic ies, and general suggestions. The Task Force also received multiple references to helpful resources. As the Task Force reviewed the public i nput, four \"guiding prin ciples\" emerged. These principles were the prominent messages embe dded in the Work Group and public feedback aimed at how City government should address climate and energy issues: The four guiding principles are: 1. Build stewardship into all facets of local government 2. Strengthen the connections between people and their communities 3. Lead with incentives and education before mandates 4. Foster community resilience and socio-economic health The Task Force believes these principles, wh ich represent the wisdom of hundreds of civic- minded citizens, point the way to reasonable, effici ent and sustainable ways to govern the City of 11Spokane. These four principles will promote best practices for the wise use and conservation of limited resources. Here's how. 4.02.1 Build stewardship into all facets of local government Building stewardship into local government will help the City deliver high quality services and operations over time. As stewards of the loca l environment, the City recognizes the value of available natural resources and identifies how the City can best incorporate that value into the City's decision-making framework. 4.02.2 Strengthen the connectivity of people, communities The City must foster strong connections am ong people and their communities in Spokane. To do this, the City must recognize in policy an d practice the diversity in transportation modes required for the movement of people, goods , and services into , through and around our community. Active transportation options, in cluding pedestrian and bicycle travel, are clean, efficient, and cost-effective over shorter distances. Expand ed public transit allows individuals of all income levels to travel to work, medical faci lities, recreational opport unities, and day-to-day destinations. Connectivity strengthens the local economy. Promoting the local production of goods and services promotes connectivity and reduces cost of living in the community. As people gain access to local goods and services, the need to ship and travel long distances is minimized. The transportation element of the cost of many goods is reduced. This saves the city money for other uses. The Task Force's recommendations point to a relationship between community connectivity and the capacity to deal with o il price volatility. For this reas on, City government should play a leading role in strategies that promote more than the traditional design for single-occupancy vehicle travel. 4.02.3 Lead with incentives and education before mandates Leading with incentives and education prior to mandating action is the sensible approach to governance whenever feasible. Th e City has the opportunity to l ead by example in this regard. Through sustainable policies and practices, the City can educate the genera l public to community and individual savings to be had in more sust ainable everyday practices. The City can adapt its incentive programs to encourage residents to adop t practices and particip ate in behaviors that preserve and enhance the beauty of Spokane rath er than mandating policies that merely attract resistance. 4.02.4 Foster resilience and socio-economic health Fostering resilience and socio-economic hea lth enables the City to \"bounce back\" from unforeseen or unavoidable change s with little or no interrupt ion in service delivery. This principle suggests that the City plan ahead for different scenarios and prepare itself accordingly. Fostering socio-economic health means that the C ity appreciates that all individuals, regardless of demographics or economic status, must have that same opportunity to \"bounce back.\" 12 Equitable and comprehensive planning for varying s cenarios of change will help the City and its citizens recover if faced with unforeseen hardship. 4.02.5 A Foundation to build upon Guided by these four principles, the Task Force proposes eight strategies to achieve the goals laid out by CTED when it funded th e work of the Task Force: Mitigation, Adaptation, and Energy Security . To help implement the strategies identified, the Task Force created clear recommendations specific to each strategy. Th e eight strategies and their recommendations are presented below. 4.1 Recommendations The following recommendations of the Mayor's Su stainability Task Force are described here as strategies. The term \"strategy\" implies the flex ibility and commitment to change that is called for in this case. The Task Force recognizes that implementation of the recommendations contained herein can be challenging. The implemen tation of such strategies is the first important step toward a more sustainable future for Spokane. 4.1.1 Strategy 1: Improve continuously Monitoring progress is particularly important when the goals are significant and the timeframes long. To get the most efficient processes, it is important to measure results, learn from others and adapt along the way. Committing to continuously improve in all policy and process helps assure good stewar dship and facilitates achievement of goals. For these reasons, we recommend that the City: Times require new equipment & new ideas 1-A: Set goals because what gets measured gets done. Regularly measure and report progress toward sustainability goals. A ssess the quality of outcomes and revise efforts to improve outcomes as necessary. 1-B: Talk to the community about the merits and results of investments in sustainability. Explain what the City is doing to achieve a more sustainable community and why. 1-C: Share information with the community about how to reduce oil use, conserve resources and increase energy efficiency to promote lower carbon emissions and a cleaner environment. 1-D: Invest in education for City staff, elected officials and the community. Promote the wise use and stewards hip of City resources. 13 4.1.2 Strategy 2: Emphasize renewable energy Taking advantage of regionally available renewable energy not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also helps reduce reliance on outside sources of oil-based energy. This enables Spokane to be more resilient. Supporting new local clean energy technologies helps local businesses thrive and helps workers develop the skills important to serve this growing market segment, here and elsewhere. For these reasons, we recommend that the City: 2-A: Increase the percentage of renewable energy the City acquires each year, targeting 100% by 2030. 2-B: Use distributed small-scale power technologies in City facilities (e.g. solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, fuel cells, wi nd) where it is practical and feasible. 2-C: Encourage renewable energy development and use by publishing an inventory of wind and solar resource pot ential within City limits for use by planners and developers. 2-D: Amend land use policy and regulation to preserve options and provide incentives for development of renewabl e resources (e.g., renewable zones, pre- approved standards, fee waivers). 4.1.3 Strategy 3: Promote clean mobility Gasoline and diesel fuel used to power vehicles is a significant source of GHG for City government and is the most significant source of emissions for the community. This is why reducing oil dependence and improving air quality is so dependent on choices we make about transportation. Our intent here is to recognize the importance of mobility to community connectivity by encouraging use of alternative fuels and expanding modes of travel for a variety of economic, health and environmental benefits. Fo r these reasons, we recommend that the City: 3-A: Prioritize investments that improve non-motorized modes of transportation and encourage the purchase, conversion to, a nd use of alternative vehicle fuels (e.g., biodiesel, natural gas, electricity) and transit-oriented development. 143-B: Review and revise standards and practices to remove barriers restricting expansion, safety, and use of pedestrian and bike ways. 3-C: Support STA in its efforts to expand a multi-modal public transportation system that is clean, efficient, and user-friendl y -- particularly in: 1) securing right-of- way for fixed-route rapid tr ansit; and 2) aligning rout es with Corridors established in the City's current Comprehensive Plan. 3-D: Review and revise work policies and practices to incr ease support of employees who walk, bike, carpool, vanpool or bus to work. 3-E: Support use of electric transportation within City limits (e.g., special parking for all-electric cars). 4.1.4 Strategy 4: Enable optimal land use Land use choices affect energy consumption, carbon sequestration an d overall community resilience. The manner in which land is used significantly drives how, how far and how often people and goods must travel. Land use determines how well natural processes that clean the air and water can function, and how much local production of food and other goods is possible. For these reasons, we recommend that the City: 4-A: Encourage compact communities by amending land use policies and regulations to eliminate barriers and incentivize mi xed-use, sustainable development (e.g. natural landscaping, transit-oriented de velopment, fuel and energy efficiency, community composting and recycling, urban agronomy). 4-B: Incentivize the preservation and use of eco-system functions (e.g., trees, wetlands, aquifers) via amendments to land use policies and regulations. 4-C: Put suitable City land to productive use, under appropriate terms and conditions, by allowing community gardens, farmers' markets, and other uses related to local food production. Tap the capabilities of other institutions and community organizations to help. 15 4.1.5 Strategy 5: Conserve water everywhere We are fortunate to live where a large water source, the Spokane Va lley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer and its watersheds efficiently deliver high quality water from a vast area to our doorsteps. But demand on this water source is growing. It has been called upon to serve needs from areas outside of Spokane where water resources are in decline. The commercial and residential quest for water will not diminish. Water conservation is the surest way to preserve the resource for future generations and enable the City to grow and prepare for possible climate-related changes to water availability. Pumping water from the aquifer and delivering it to homes and businesses in the community is an energy intensive operation. This is why choices made about water allocation and use have significant implications to energy consumption. The treatment of wastewater that results from domestic and commercial water use also uses large amounts of energy. Close to ha lf of the pumping from the aquifer comes in summer as people water outdoor landscaping. Summer is also the time of year when river and hydropower operations are at their lowest capacity. Pumping from th e aquifer, particularly at these low water times, negatively impacts river leve ls and concentrates pollutants already in the river system. For these reasons, we recommend that the City: 5-A: Model best practices by developing and implementing specific management plans to conserve water and increase usag e efficiency in all City facilities and operations. 5-B: Prioritize implementation of projects and practices that improve water use efficiency for the City's largest cons umptive uses - parks, golf courses and wastewater treatment. 5-C: Develop innovative projects for water reuse and conservation on and in City properties and buildings. 5-D: Invest in large-scale water re-u se and storm water management projects where practical and beneficial. Strive to achieve a net reduction in energy use and subsequent gain in carbon-capture. 5-E: Develop a coordinated response to storm water challenges that looks ahead to the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrologic patterns for our region. 5-F: Review and revise City policies, codes, ordinances and programs to allow for and incentivize best practices a nd innovation in water conservation. 16 5-G: Promote wise use and conservation of water via public information and education. 5-H: Evaluate the City's water rate structure and adjust fees to equitably incentivize water conservation and ensure that ra tes reflect the market value of energy. 5-I: Engage all large water users in long-range water resource planning and conservation. 5-J: Support state and local efforts to remove legal barriers to small-scale rainwater harvesting. 4.1.6 Strategy 6: Maximize energy efficiency Energy costs are expected to continue rising in the face of increasing world demand. The more the City can do to limit its energy demand and maximize its efficient use, the less cost it will bear for continued City operations. Increasing energy efficiency in facilities and operations also means that the City will be reducing its contributio n to GHG emissions. For these reasons, we recommend that the City: 6-A: Model leading practices by developing and implementing specific plans fo r reducing and managing energy use in all City operations. 6-B: Move toward carbon-neutral operations in all new and retrofit construction involving City facilities. 6-C: Encourage innovative building design that is climate responsive and energy efficient by creating incentive programs and removing any barriers in City codes. 6-D: Establish strategies to support more recycling market opportunities and resource recovery enterprises. 6-E: Prioritize workforce development initiatives and partnerships that grow green jobs and green businesses, particular ly in the realm of energy efficiency. 6-F: Fully leverage the financial and technical support from private and public sectors to maximize incentives for, and accelerate implementation of, energy efficiency. \"Within 5 to 10 years, non-OPEC production will reach a peak and begin to decline, as reserves run out. There are new proofs of that fact every day. At the same we'll see the peak of China's economic growth. (That's why) the time has come to leave oil before it leaves us.\" Dr. Fatih Birol, IEA Chief Economist Interview in French pub., Le Monde June 2007 17 4.1.7 Strategy 7: Optimize operating practices The goal of this recommendation is an improved environment and a more resilient city. As with any budget, little things add up, and what gets measured gets done. So it makes sense to examine the routines, policies and practices of daily operation in City government and adapt them to new objectives that support improved environmental conditions and a more resilient city. The focus in this recommendation is on operational changes that can internalize a value system to reduce the City's oil dependence, overall energy demand and GHG emi ssions. The innovation called for here is to restructure purchasing and financia l reporting at the City. These systems need to support more than dollar costs and time to delivery as eval uation criteria. The City should add potential GHG emissions reduction, resource cons ervation and other environmental performance criteria to the evaluation of all procurement decisions and to th e systems for measuring the financial performance of the City. For these reasons , we recommend that the City: 7-A: Develop and implement plans for a leaner City fleet. a. Reduce the number and size of vehicles and increase vehicle fuel efficiency; b. Shift to using lower carbon fuels (e.g., biodiesel, natura l gas, electricity), emphasizing those that are regi onally available and renewable wherever practical. c. Develop and implement a plan to increas e the City's use of electric vehicles, including the appropriate in stallation of the necessary support infrastructure. 7-B: Buy wisely and amend procurement policies to in corporate energy and environmental criteria into all procurement decisions. Purchase decisions shoul d favor materials and supplies that use less fuel and fewer virg in materials in production, delivery, and disposal. 7-C: Look to local vendors first because buying local provide s the environmental and energy benefits of reduced transportation cost s. Buying locally k eeps local taxpayers' money in the local economy. It also s upports the continued development of local sources for goods and services, contributing to the community's resiliency and energy independence. Implementing this recommendation may mean the City will need to seek exemption to state procurement requireme nts. The City also may need to seek a legislative remedy to existing low bidder requirements that do not include the embedded cost of transportation in calculations of low bids. 7-D: Target zero-waste and evaluate ways to incentivi ze reduced packaging, the reuse of materials and other alternatives to traditional disposal. Include the cost of disposal and the willingness of manufacturer s to take back spent merchandise in purchasing and bid evaluation criteria. 187-E: Centrally monitor and report costs and benefits of City operations . Develop the infrastructure to monitor spending pattern s beyond assignment to specific source accounts. Design reporting systems that can monitor expenditures and resource allocation according to their effects on the environment and the use of petroleum-based fuels by the City. 7-F: Improve work patterns and strategically eliminate, consolidate and repackage City services to reduce unproductiv e drive time and the increased air pollution that comes with it. For example, look for opportuniti es to offer more services on-line, to economize on waste collection routes and fr equency, and to encourage more staff telecommuting. 7-G: Analyze service requirements and carefully examine work flows. Commit to an efficient reprioritization of City departme nt operations with energy conservation and reduced GHG as objectives. 7-H: Incorporate environmental stewardship cri teria into evaluation procedures for all City employees. City policies and personnel protocol s should include a performance evaluation standard for environmental stewar dship for all City employees, particularly those empowered to define workplace expectations. 7-I: Establish a point person or persons within City government. The City should designate one or more sustainability officer s to work with the Executive Team and top City management to coordinate sustainabil ity efforts within City government. Duties would include operating a central reporting system for procurement decisions and educating staff and management on the valu es and objectives of a sustainability program at the City, and coaching managers in how to develop those values and reporting systems within their departments. 4.1.8 Strategy 8: Prepare through planning City government performs many vital functions and has a complex role in addressing issues of climate change and peak oil that go beyond routine operations. The City is simultaneously a leader, a model and a symbol for the community. It works in collaboration with numerous jurisdictions and entities to jointly identify and solve problems. No jurisdiction operates alone. Many issues require mutual problem solving. Preparation and planning is one of the keys to future success in addressing climate change and peak oil. The recommendations below help decision makers consider options. For these reasons we recommend that the City: \" I rejoice to live in such a splendidly disturbing time! \" Helen Keller \"The essential rule is play safe. It is easier to avoid a crevasse than to get out of one.\" ---Field Manual, Antarctica New Zealand 198-A: Think ahead and adapt continuously. Collaborate with others to identify possible risks including, but not limited to: a. Increased fire hazards from longer warm and dry seasonal variations; b. Reduced water availability from unpred ictable shifts in precipitation; c. Rising numbers of new residents creating ne w demands on food, housing, health, utilities, roads and other support systems; d. Sudden changes in fuel availability and the a ssociated rise in cost , particularly where it affects first responder emergency services, esse ntial city operations, or the disruption of food transportation and othe r essential activities. 8-B: Collaborate with others, considering and adopting joint init iatives with other public service providers and plan together for contingencies. Work with partners to help address identified risks: a. Understand and respond to changes to aquife r and river systems (working for example with the U.S. Climate Center, Depa rtment of Ecology, and others); b. Prepare a comprehensiv e drought response plan; c. Establish mechanisms to evaluate the impact s of new industries requiring large amounts of water; d. Maximize the use of available, regi onally generated hydroelectric power. 8-C: Support growth of \"clean and green\" businesses in the community. Emerging local businesses and activities that ca pitalize on growing public concern for environmental stewardship and local resiliency should be encouraged in any way possibl e. The City should seek to complement with its own activities and programs that will use local asse ts developed around new models of sustainability and commun ity resilience in the private sector. 8-D: Support the growth of small businesses that diversify local producti on and increase community self-sufficiency. 8-E: Monitor global, federa l, and state initiatives , and where appropriate, al ign local efforts with them. 8-F: Participate in cooperati ve small-scale pilot projects to test and demonstrate new ways to support sustainable practices and be more efficient with local renewable resources. 8-G: Support region-wide research and development and invest in j ob training in those areas that serve to support sustainable practices. 8-H: Reinforce an employee culture of sustainability and adopt sustainability as a core value of the City. Support initiatives and those who would ch ampion such in every City department. These champions will work with and be accountable to a sustainability officer for such initiatives. 8-I: Track the progress of carbon sequestration methods for possible use at the Waste-To-Energy Facility. 8-J: Incorporate the principles and stra tegies reflected in this Action Plan into neighborhood planning, particularly as these prin ciples and strategies relate to land use, transportation, energy, and economic development. 205.0 Next Steps This plan addresses in general terms, actions that should be take n by City government to be more sustainable and resilient in the face of issues such as peak oil, climate change, and climate mitigation. However, the Action Plan is just a beginning. Community outreach and input. The Task Force recommends that the community at large have ample opportunity to advise the City on the merits of the Action Plan. Then as the City staff develops its implementation strategies, the package can be fully articulated in public forums between now and mid- year 2009. In that time frame, the Task Force unders tands that City Environmental Programs staff will conduct outreach in the community and within the C ity departments making the Action Plan known to as many stakeholders and staff as po ssible. Community outreach can al so be enhanced with continuing support from the Outreach Partners (see \"Acknowledgement s section for list) . The results of this outreach can then be reported to City Council and the community at large. Also this Action Plan should be presented to the community with a question: What can the community beyond City government do to a ddress these concerns and capture similar opportunities? Although beyond the scope of this Ac tion Plan it is hoped that the resulting conversations will prompt individuals and organizati ons beyond the confines of City government to find ways to operate more sustainably, fo r them and for the larger community. Implementation strategies. This Action Plan lays out clear prin ciples and a path forward. Specific actions need to follow to make the Action Plan come alive. The exact steps to its implementation need to be developed and follow ed. We understand that the Mayor has charged Public Works and Utilities, specifically Environmental Programs, to expedite implementation of the Action Plan . Environmental Programs would do this with the assistance of the City's Green Team of designated staff and Department heads. A three- to five-year detailed implem entation plan will be developed and forwarded to City elected official s for consideration and endorsement . Given sufficient data to evaluate effectiveness, the Task Force encourages taking early actions where ever practical consistent with Task Force recommendations and City goals. Continued community oversight. To help the Action Plan stay on course and come to fruition, the Mayor has asked the Sustainability Task Force to conti nue to serve in an adviso ry role. To perform this role effectively, the Task Force needs a clear point of contact with the City and access to regular reporting of implementation actions under taken by the City. In that advisory capacity, the Task Force recomm ends that all City departments and commissions consider the Guiding Principles, St rategic Priorities, and Proposed R ecommendations in this plan, and incorporate them as appropriate in their operating policies and ongoing operations. The Task Force also notes that the Action Plan includes some recommenda tions that may require amendment of the City's Comprehensive Plan. The decisions to amend the Co mprehensive Plan should be made in consultation with the Planning Department, and shortly after the Ac tion Plan is finalized. At this writing, the City Council is considering an inve ntory of greenhouse gases and wh at reduction goal(s) might be appropriate for the City. Actions in dicated by the result of this asse ssment should be incorporated into the implementation of the Action Plan as appropriate. The time to act is now. The Task Force is confident that implementing this Sustainability Action Plan will be instrumental in ensuri ng that the City has a sustainable fu ture that will offer to those who live here and love this place a quality of life that is near nature, near perfect . 21-END- 6.0 Glossary of Terms Action Plan : An implementation tool containing goa ls and strategies to achieve a desired outcome.
