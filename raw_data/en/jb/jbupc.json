Home remedies that may work for arthritis A potent antioxidant found in green tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) may help put the brakes on the joint pain and inflammation that are hallmarks of [rheumatoid arthritis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/art.39447), according to a study in mice published in Arthritis and Rheumatology. While the results are preliminary (and animal research isn't always applicable to humans), there's no harm in sipping a cup or two of green tea a day until scientists know more. And if we are talking about osteoarthritis, the wear-and-tear form of the disease, a substance in red hot chili peppers may do the trick. Chili peppers contain capsaicin, and a study review published in Progress in Drug Research found that in topical form it can [reduce joint pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941673), stiffness, and swelling related to osteoarthritis. Try applying a capsaicin cream four times daily to sore joints. [23 Science-Backed Natural Home Remedies for Arthritis Pain Relief](https://www.thehealthy.com/arthritis/natural-arthritis-remedies/) Home remedies that work for bug bites For run-of-the-mill itching, look no further than that breakfast staple, oatmeal. \"Colloidal oatmeal has a long history and equally solid biological basis for its anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects,\" says [Adam Friedman](https://gwdocs.com/profile/adam-friedman), MD, professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington School of Medicine and Hospital in Washington DC. Find it as a cream or even an over-the-counter bath powder, and follow instructions on the label. If you've already scratched the bite, prevent infection with Manuka honey (not regular honey), which comes from New Zealand and may help in the treatment of wounds. \"It is a great osmotic agent, meaning that it pulls water into the wound/skin and is an antibacterial agent,\" Dr. Friedman says. \"Hydrating the skin can help cool it off, and the antibacterial properties are useful as a scratched bug bite is susceptible to infection.\" Get The Healthy @Reader's Digest [newsletter](https://www.thehealthy.com/newsletter/?link_name=newslettersignup&link_module=newslettersignup&link_pos=+notificationbar) Home remedy that may work for colds Your mother was right. (Isn't she always?) \"Chicken soup has been shown to be helpful for colds in a study,\" says [Len Horovitz](https://www.lenhorovitz.com/), MD, a clinical instructor in medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. One of the best home remedies, chicken soup may have anti-inflammatory properties that can ease the symptoms of [upper respiratory tract infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11035691), according to a study published in Chest. The researchers found that chicken soup curbs white blood cells called neutrophils, reducing their movement when tested in laboratory dishes. Just keep in mind that a warm cup of chicken noodle is no stand-in for a visit to a doctor. \"It's important to be seen and examined, to have a strep test or influenza test to be sure it is 'just a cold,'\" Dr. Horovitz says. Home remedy that works for cough Regular store-bought honey may be more effective at [easing cough](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638) and improving sleep for kids than honey-flavored over-the-counter cough suppressant, according to a study in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. (This is a big deal, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said that over-the-counter [cough medications](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/when-give-kids-medicine-coughs-and-colds) are too risky for kids under 2.) The researchers gave one-half teaspoon of honey to children ages 2 to 5, 1 teaspoon to children 6 to 11 and 2 teaspoons to those ages 12 to 18. Just don't give honey to children under 1 because it can cause potentially life-threatening infantile botulism. Home remedy that works for constipation Fiber is the best fix for constipation, and of all the proven ways to boost your fiber intake, flaxseed may be the best home remedy. \"It's almost as if nature tailor-made ground flaxseed to relieve constipation because there are actually four mechanisms by which it helps,\" says [Will Bulsiewicz, MD](https://theplantfedgut.com/), a gastroenterologist in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. For starters, this effective remedy for constipation is a great source of both insoluble and soluble fiber, which work in different ways, he explains. \"The insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool, helping it to move quickly through the intestines, [and] the soluble fiber acts as fertilizer for the gut garden, promoting the growth of good bacteria.\" There's more to it. \"Unique to ground flaxseed is the mucilage component of its soluble fiber. Mucilage is a slimy, gum-like compound that provides both bulk and softness to help relieve constipation,\" Dr. Bulsiewicz says. Finally, ground flaxseed is an excellent source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids that are known to help soften stool and relieve constipation. His Rx? Aim for two to three tablespoons a day as part of a fiber-rich diet. \"Be sure to drink a lot of water when consuming ground flaxseed to ensure adequate hydration,\" he adds. Home remedy that may work for cuts, scrapes, and burns Another reason to keep Manuka honey on hand: \"One of my all-time favorite home remedies\u2014that works 100% of the time\u2014is Manuka honey on open cuts, burns or scrapes,\" says Nadia Kumentas, ND, a naturopathic doctor in Toronto, Canada, and founder of [affecthealth.com](http://affecthealth.com/). \"Its potent antibacterial and wound-healing abilities help you heal quickly, minimize scarring and prevent infection,\" she says. \"Make sure you apply a thin layer of Manuka honey to the wound and cover it to keep the environment moist. Change the dressing/Band-Aid daily.\" Home remedy that works for headaches If you have a throbbing headache, try reaching for a cup of coffee. \"The caffeine constricts blood vessels, which can help with headache relief,\" says [Tania Elliott](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1598924243/tania-mucci-elliott), MD, a clinical instructor in medicine at NYU Langone in New York City. Caffeine also provides relief by blocking adenosine receptors, or neurotransmitters in the brain that are elevated during a migraine, she adds. If the pain is overwhelming, try pairing your cup of joe with OTC pain medication. \"Studies have shown that caffeine taken in combination with pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen enhances pain relief,\" she says. Just don't overdo this remedy. \"The body can become tolerant to caffeine and withdrawal symptoms include headaches,\" Dr. Elliott warns. Home remedy that works for hemorrhoids For [natural hemorrhoid relief](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/7-best-worst-home-remedies-hemorrhoids/), experts at the Cleveland Clinic recommend Sitz baths\u2014a shallow bowl that fits over your toilet and allows you to bathe just your bottom. Sitting in warm water for 15 minutes, several times a day\u2014especially after a bowel movement\u2014can soothe the irritated area. Home remedy that may work for hiccups A spoonful of sugar doesn't just help the medicine go down\u2014when it comes to hiccups, it may be the solution. Why does it help? Hiccups are spasms of the diaphragm, which is a muscle beneath the lungs that helps you breathe. Anything that stimulates the back of your throat, including swallowing a gritty spoonful of sugar, could [stop hiccups](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-causes-hiccups), according to a 2018 \"Ask the Doctor\" column in the Harvard Health Letter. Home remedy that works for infected nails If you have the tell-tale signs of a bacterial or fungal infection\u2014nails that are thick, crumbling and yellow\u2014try soaking in white vinegar, a natural anti-fungal. \"The white vinegar soak should be half vinegar and half water,\" says Dr. Friedman. Soak the affected finger or toe three or four times a day for 15 to 20 minutes until it clears up. [11 Home Remedies for Stinky Feet that Are Surprisingly Effective](https://www.thehealthy.com/foot-care/foot-odor-home-remedies/) Home remedy that may work for leg cramps \"Magnesium deficiency happens to be one of the most common culprits of muscle cramping,\" says [Carolyn Dean,](http://drcarolyndean.com/) MD, ND, a naturopathic physician in Maui, Hawaii and author of The Miracle of Magnesium. \"Magnesium encourages relaxation within the body\u2014including muscle tension.\" Not all forms of magnesium are easily absorbed by the body, however, she says. \"Magnesium citrate powder is a highly absorbable form that is fast acting and can be mixed with hot or cold water and sipped at work or at home immediately in the event of muscle cramping and throughout the day.\" Home remedy that may work for menstrual cramps Got chamomile tea? Get brewing. \"Cold packs or heating pads on the lower abdomen or back can help relieve cramps, as can soaking a washcloth in warm water and chamomile tea and placing it on the same areas,\" says [Jill Rabin](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/urogynecology/dr-jill-maura-rabin-md-11311889), MD, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care at the Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services of Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York. If cramps are severe, see a doctor to make sure that you are doing all you can to ease your period pain. Home remedies that work for nausea Hands down, the best home remedies for nausea are ginger and peppermint. \"Even just smelling them can curb nausea or prevent it from occurring in the first place,\" Dr. Rabin says. If nausea is severe and you can't keep food down, it's time to check in with your doctor, she adds. Home remedy that works for sunburns Yes, prevention with a broad-spectrum sunscreen that has a sun protection factor of 30 or higher is key. But if you've already been burnt, Dr. Freidman recommends \"cool compresses, lots of moisturizer to damp skin and cold black tea bags, because caffeine is anti-inflammatory and a vasoconstrictor, which will help with redness.\" Home remedies that work for tooth and gum pain Warm salt water rinses can often help sore or swollen gums feel better due to an antimicrobial effect, shares [Saul Pressner](http://www.newyork-cosmeticdentist.com/), a dentist in New York City. And there's a natural remedy for tooth pain: \"Oil of cloves can sometimes soothe an inflamed tooth.\" But, he cautions, \"it is very important to see your dentist when these symptoms occur.\" Home remedy that works for urinary tract infections Of all the home remedies to ward off urinary tract infections, or UTIs, cranberry capsules may be the winner. In a study investigating the [popular UTI treatment](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2815%2900355-5/abstract), researchers from the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor observed 160 women aged 23 to 88 who were undergoing gynecological surgery. Typically, 10 to 64% of such women develop a UTI following the removal of the catheter. In the study, half of the women took two cranberry juice capsules twice a day\u2014the equivalent in strength to two 8-ounce servings of cranberry juice\u2014for 6 weeks after surgery. The others took a placebo. Women who took the cranberry capsules were half as likely to develop a UTI as their counterparts who got the placebo, according to the study, which was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Why? Cranberries contain A-type proanthocyanidins, which may interfere with the bacteria's ability to breach the bladder wall, reducing the likelihood of infection, Dr. Rabin explains. Home remedy that works for warts To [remove a wart,](https://www.aad.org/public/kids/skin/warts/how-to-get-rid-of-warts) the American Academy of Dermatology suggests sticking a piece of duct tape on the wart and then changing it \"every few days to peel away layers of the wart.\" A study out of Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, found that using duct tape is more effective than a doctor applying liquid nitrogen to \"freeze\" the wart\u201485% of people in the duct tape group [eliminated the wart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12361440) during the study versus 60% of those in the liquid nitrogen group. Home remedies that may work for zits When it comes to acne you can skip the toothpaste, witch hazel, tea tree oil, lemon honey and aloe vera, as these will likely do more harm than good to your complexion, says Dr. Friedman, Instead, \"cover the pimple with a Band-Aid overnight,\" recommends [Anthony Youn](http://www.dryoun.com/plastic-surgery/dr-youn/), MD, chief surgeon at Youn Plastic Surgery in Troy, Michigan, and author of The Age Fix: A Leading Plastic Surgeon Reveals How To Really Look Ten Years Younger. \"This will help decrease inflammation to make it look much less red and swollen in the morning.\" If it's blackheads that are plaguing you, try applying Elmer's glue to the area and letting it dry. \"Then peel it off, taking many of the blackheads with it,\" he says.
