Aromatherapy massage oils are super simple to create. If you are new to DIY essential oil recipes, this is a great start! Aromatherapy massage oils are a perfect way to enjoy the benefits of essential oils while relaxing in complete comfort. Here are just a few of the ways aromatherapy massage oils can benefit your well-being. How to Make Massage Oils Do you like getting massages? Many people do, because massages feel wonderful. They can help improve your circulation, ease tension headaches, and make you feel generally more relaxed. Here is how to use essential oils to make massage oil to give yourself, or someone else, a massage. First, you need to determine what your goals are for the massage oil: - Is it for a full body massage or a specific ailment? - Do you want it to be calming or invigorating? - Are you applying to someone or is it a self-massage? - What carrier oils and essential oils do you have available? Once you answer these questions you should have a clearer idea of what kind of massage oil you want to make. Once you know your goals for your massage oil, you will need to choose a carrier oil for the base of your recipe. You will also need a glass bottle for storage. I would recommend a glass bottle with a lotion pump so it is spill-proof and mess-free to dispense your massage oil. Dropper bottles can also be used to dispense your oil. Next, you can choose what essential oils you want to use in your massage oil. We have 22 Aromatherapy Massage Oil Recipes below to pick from, or if you are feeling adventurous you can create your own. Best Essential Oils for Massage Oils No matter your preferred method of relaxation, be it reading, sleeping or taking a bath, adding aromatherapy to the mix is a great way to achieve even deeper relaxation and peace. Different scents have different effects on the mind and body, so finding the right oil mixture for you is key. Single essential oil massage oils can be as powerful as any blend, so no need for a recipe here because you will just need the single essential oil and carrier oil of choice.

This dilution chart is helpful to determine how much essential oil and carrier oil you will need. This is the best way to enjoy your essential oils without being wasteful or overdoing it. | | 2% Essential Oil Dilution Rate | | For our massage oils, we like to use a 2% dilution. This dilution level is perfect for daily use for teens and adults and is safe for skin. | | 1% Essential Oil Dilution Rate | | If massage oil is to be used on a child (5-12 years old), person with sensitive skin, pregnant or breastfeeding mother, it is recommended to use a 1% dilution.

Well, I am sure this is really dependent on the user but for me, it is grapeseed oil. I absolutely love this oil! It leaves my skin silky smooth without a greasy feel. It can be used daily, I especially like to use after taking a shower. Plus it is a perfect carrier oil to use with essential oils. Carrier Oils For Massage Carrier oils are the base oils in any massage oil. You can use a variety of carrier oils but I recommend starting with just a single carrier oil in your massage recipe. Pick one and give it a try in one of the 22 recipes below. 1. Grapeseed Oil Rich in vitamins A, E, B, and D plus amino acids and essential fatty acids. These are essential for keeping your skin looking youthful and healthy. Known for its regenerating properties that may help treat sun-damaged, dry skin which in turn will help minimize fine lines and wrinkles.

Sweet Almond Oil Sweet almond oil is a popular carrier oil for use with aromatherapy, providing essential fatty acids and vitamin E. Known for its skin-nourishing benefits and gentleness on the skin, it safe for even the most sensitive skin types.

If you have a nut allergy, this oil should not be used. Read More: [Sweet Almond Oil Spotlight](https://www.lovingessentialoils.com/blogs/healthy-living/sweet-almond-oil-uses-benefits) 3. Jojoba Oil An ideal carrier oil for massage oil recipes. Jojoba oil is actually a wax that is one of the closest things to the natural oils the body produces. Since it is similar to what the body produces, it is absorbed into the skin easily. It is able to replenish what is stripped away by soaps, shampoos, as well as the elements.

Fractionated coconut oil is a light, non-greasy oil that's odorless. It's called fractionated because it contains only a fraction of the whole oil, made up mostly of medium-chain triglycerides, similar to those found in your skin's natural sebum. Fractionated coconut oil makes a luxurious all-over body moisturizer and an economical choice for deep-tissue massage (plus it doesn't stain the sheets). Virgin Coconut Oil is different than fractionated coconut oil. Virgin coconut oil is usually in a solid form unless warmed, it does make a good massage oil base but tends to be a little greasy and has the coconut aroma which you may or may not want in your recipe. You will need to blend in a glass jar instead of a dropper bottle or lotion pump bottle if using coconut oil as your base oil.

Avocado Oil Avocado Oil is rich in vitamin E and nutrients for the skin. Hydrate and renew your skin tone with this rich oil that is teeming with essential and trace minerals.
