Two Campuses. One Community. The Morsani College of Medicine offers two parallel programs that give you a choice of emphasis and geographical focus. The [Core MD program](/medicine/mdprogram/core) is based in Tampa for four years and features a strong preclinical integrated curriculum with a small group and engaged learning emphasis, integrated clerkships, and year 4 career tracks that prepare you for the residency of your choice. The Scholarly Concentrations program option allows you to focus and develop yourself in an area of interest outside the normal curriculum in fields such as Health Disparities, Health Systems Engineering, Public Health, and Medical Education. The [SELECT MD program](/medicine/mdprogram/select) is based in Tampa (2 years) and Allentown, Pennsylvania (2 years). It has the same integrated curriculum focus as the Core MD program but also offers a graduate certificate in leadership, health systems, and values-based patient-centered care, all important domains for future leaders in medicine.
