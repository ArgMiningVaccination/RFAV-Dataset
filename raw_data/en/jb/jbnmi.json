The Human Chemistry method is a revolutionary way of tackling health problems aimed at removing blockages, starting the recovery process down to cellular level. With homeopathic remedies in combination with orthomolecular nutritional supplements and nutritional advice, harmful substances which are stored in the body are better removed. This restores organ functions, so that health problems decrease or disappear. The Human Chemistry method can greatly improve long-standing (vague) complaints and complaints of serious chronic diseases such as asthma, eczema, PMS, AD(H)D, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, migraine, autism, Lyme's disease, epilepsy, and diabetes type I and II. The acute and chronic consequences of vaccinations can also be treated. In fact, every complaint can be improved by Human Chemistry. From birth and even before, a person encounters substances that can be harmful to the body. The body has excellent ways to remove these harmful substances, but gradually the toxic substances can accumulate, and the body can no longer remove these sufficiently. Every person is different, so one will suffer more from this than the other. This can eventually lead to (chronic) complaints. Examples of harmful substances which can be detoxed by the Human Chemistry method are the contraceptive pill, hormone coil, anesthesia for surgery and dental treatment, antibiotics, hormone ointment, vaccinations, painkillers, paint and solvents, narcotics, and environmental pollution. Orthomolecular nutritional supplements will be prescribed temporarily until your body has regained strength. Partly by eating healthily, the body will then be able to extract vitamins and minerals from the food itself.
