The economic forecasts of both the executive branch and the estimates adopted by the Legislature's Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee called for modest growth in revenues. Although viewed cautiously by a Legislature that has been sorely tested over the last few years to balance a budget, this welcome change in economic outlook set the stage for a budget process that was able to keep intact all of the state's current year spending obligations as well as covering the major inflation factors for FY 2013 including Medicaid costs and caseload, indigent health care, educational enrollment growth and inmate growth. The Governor's General Fund budget recommendation for FY 2013 called for a 7.4 percent increase overall, but the Legislature's final action on general funds came in slightly lower at a 6.8 percent overall increase. Public schools received a 4.6 percent increase, college and universities received an 8.6 percent increase, Medicaid received an 8.7 percent increase, and corrections received a 7.3 percent increase. The Legislature approved a 2 percent salary increase for state employees, judges and higher education, provided a tax relief package of $35.7 million, and restored the state's cash reserves by about $49.5 million. This session also saw the typical number of farranging issues that land on legislators' desks in the course of representing constituents from across the state. These public policy issues touched on everything from regulating oil and gas exploration and production to texting while driving, wolf management, the constitutional right to hunt, fish and trap, tax relief, animal cruelty issues, preabortion ultrasounds, lifting the cap on public charter schools, partnering universities and the private sector for economic development, and \"Occupy Boise\" issues, just to name a few. Throughout this legislative session, individual legislators dealt with the pressures inherent in redrawn legislative districts, oftentimes finding themselves facing a decision to run against friends or colleagues, or having to run in unfamiliar territory. The largest turnover in state legislators typically occurs every 10 years as a result of redistricting, and this time around is no exception, with an expectation of 30 percent to 40 percent turnover in the Idaho Legislature. The loss of decades of institutional experience with the announced retirements of experienced legislators will effect a profound change on the Legislature. Yet any large turnover also offers the opportunity for the institution to refresh, refocus and influence public policy decisions in Idaho for a whole new generation of Idaho citizens. As legislators prepare for the 2013 legislative session, all of the interim action will be detailed on the Legislature's website at www.legislature.idaho.gov. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 6 Volume of Legislation and Length of Session During the 201 2 legislative session , 826 proposed piec es of legislation were prepared for legis- lative commit tees and individual legislators. From that initi al group of draft proposals, 554 bills were actually in troduced, along with 74 resolutions, memorials and proclamations. By the end of the session , 342 bills had been passed by both houses . After final legislative action and fo l- lowing the Governor 's review, all 342 introduced bills became law, with the majority of the new laws to become ef fective 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003From Drafting to Enactment 10-Year Comparison Bills Enacted into Law Bills Introduced Legislation Drafted Length of Session When the Legislature adjourned sine die on March 29 , it had been in session for 81 days. The 2012 legislative session , the longest since 2009, was seven days shorter than the previous session .

The Legislature can prevent pending rules from going into effect, as well as prevent final rules from remaining in effect, by rejecting them. Pending fee rules go into effect only if the Legislature approves them. Temporary rules expire at the end of the legislative sessio n unless approved by the Legislature. During the 2012 l egislative session, the Senate and the House of Representatives were each asked to review 200 individual rulemaking dockets, totaling 2,182 pages. This figure is down slightly from the 206 dockets reviewed during the 2011 l egislative session. Eight of the 168 pending rule dockets review ed were rejected entirely or in part: Part of a State Tax Commission docket regarding income tax rules (HCR 3); Part of a Board of Veterinary Medicine docket (HCR 37); Parts of a Department of Health and Welfare docket regarding Medicaid enhanced plan benefits (SCR 114); Part of a Bureau of Occupational Licenses docket regarding rules of the Board of Drink-ing Water and Wastewater Professionals (SCR 115); An entire rulemaking docket of the Division of Building Safety governing the use of the National Electrical Code (SCR 118); Part of a Department of Administration docket regarding group insurance (SCR 119); An entire rulemaking docket of the Idaho Fish and Game Commission governing licen s- ing (SCR 121); and Parts of an Idaho State Police docket regarding the Idaho Peace Officer Standards and Training Council (SCR 122). Part of a final rule of the Department of Agriculture governing the importation of animals and relating to parasiticide was rejected (SCR 117). Three of the 24 pending fee rule docke ts were rejected (SCR 128): A Bureau of Occupational Licenses docket regarding the Idaho Driving Businesses Licensure Board; A Division of Building Safety docket governing continuing education requirements; and A Division of Building Safety docket governing plumbing safety licensing. Two of the eight temporary rule docke ts were rejected (SCR 129): A Department of Health and Welfare docket relating to Medicaid basic plan benefits; and A Department of Parks and Recreation docket relating to the winter recreational parking permit program. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 8 2012 Legislative Action on Major Issues Agriculture H 401 Provides a procedure for the transfer of lands between irrigation districts through exclusion from one district and annexation in to another.

Education H 383 Provides that up to $50,000 in annual Opportunity Scholarship Fund earnings may be used for costs related to administration of the program. Current law limits administrative funds to 5 percent of earnings (not to exceed $75,000). Investment earnings on the fund have been consistent with national economic conditions for the past several years such that 5 percent does not generate funds sufficient to administer the program.

H 556 Allows community college employees to transfer up to 90 days of sick leave accrued at the community college to the state system if they become state employees. Community college employees will have the same benefits teachers in the public school system currently have. These changes will help to facilitate the transfer of qualified employees who work in the community college system to positions with state agencies. H 564aa Provides more transparency and open communication between Idaho's public schools and the Professional Standards Com mission with regard to investigations and sta tus of review of complaints and charges of un ethical conduct that may affect the employ ment decisions and employee status of Idaho's certificated public employees. H 603 Provides for 97 percent average daily attendance (ADA) funding protection for Idaho school districts. Allows school districts that lose more than 3 percent of students from one school year to the next to continue receiving state funding as if the district only lost 3 per cent of its students.

H 698 Beginning in fiscal year 2013, elimi nates reductions in salarybased apportion ment for school district teachers, administra tors, and classified support staff that are re quired in statute. These required salary reduc 2012 Sine Die Report Page 13 tions were included in the 2011 Students Come First reforms and were intended to gen erate General Fund savings to pay for a por tion of last year's reforms. Provides that any increased funds appropriated for public schools in FY 2014 will first be used to pay for growth and the statutory cost of pay for per formance, public school technology, the next implementation phase for mobile computing devices in high schools and the Dual Credit for Early Completers Program, prior to funding increases for any other items with in the public schools budget. Requires that the minimum teacher salary increase at twice the rate of base salaries in the future, after both the base and minimum salary have reattained their FY 2009 funding level, as opposed to 1.5 times the rate, as is currently provided in law. S 1224 Clarifies that the requirement to in clude a parental input component in teacher evaluations begins with the 20122013 school year. This ensures that the timing of this re quirement for teacher evaluations is aligned with the same requirement for administrator evaluations. S 1301 Directs the State Department of Edu cation to define and implement a process outlining secondary school accreditation re quirements for the purpose of participation in extracurricular activities. S 1237 Revises the definition of an online course. The current language prohibits the teacher of an online course from being at the same location or school where the course is being taken. This language could prohibit a teacher from loading course content into a learning management system in his or her of fice while students are online completing as signments in a computer lab in the building and could decrease the efficiency of imple menting the online learning graduation re quirement for second ary students. S 1327 Amends cer tain provisions of the 2011 Students Come First legislation (S 1108) to clarify that: School districts may deliver teacher con tracts electronically; A designee of the school board may declare a position vacant if a teacher contract is not returned in a timely manner; The provision that allows school districts to suspend employees in cases where a court order prevents the individual from being in contact with children also includes a court order that prevents the individual from be ing in contact with another employee at the school; The first portion of the required annual teacher evaluation must be completed by March 1st, rather than before February 1st; Reassigning an employee from an adminis trative position to a nonadministrative posi tion may include a contract term change; The parties to a master agreement must 2012 Sine Die Report Page 14 provide written notice of ratification activi ty; and The definition of employee benefits is li mited to the items listed in statute. S 1328 Amends certain provisions of the 2011 Students Come First legislation to: Correct an allocation of funds for districts to meet graduation requirements for science and math. Allow students to participate in the Dual Credit for Early Completers Program if they meet their state graduation requirements. Clarify that students need not complete their senior year math requirement in order to be eligible for the Dual Credit for Early Completers Program. Limit the number of online courses in which a parent can enroll their child without school district permission to no more than 50 percent of their courses. Require online course providers to report attendance to each student's school district or public charter school, using one of the two methods provided by law. S 1329 Amends certain provisions of the Stu dents Come First legislation to clarify that: State paid employee benefit apportionment (PERSI and FICA) is apportioned from funds allocated for pay for performance; Academic growth calculations may be made based on cohorts of students with similar scores; School administrators may earn only up to one local Student Achievement Awards share; Pay for performance funds must be distri buted to districts by no later than the No vember 15th payment; The implementation date for the require ment that at least 5 percent of certificated district staff pay be based on student per formance is moved back one year. S 1397 Appropriates $28,349,900 to the State Board of Education for community colleges for fiscal year 2013, provides guidance for com pensation and benefits and exempts the ap propriation from object and program transfer limitations. The appropriation reflects a Gen eral Fund increase of 20.5 percent. S 1410 Appropriates for public schools an ad ditional $10,740,200 for fiscal year 2012 and $1,566,813,100 for fiscal year 2013. This ap propriation includes $1,279,818,600 from the General Fund, which is an increase of $56,238,200, or 4.6 percent, from the previous year.

In January 2012, DFM revised this forecast down ward to 4.4%. This represented a projected loss of $48.6 million for the remaining six months of the fiscal year. However, a forecast of 4.4% with legislative changes equates to $2,565.7 million, and is $40.1 million more than what the Legislature originally budgeted for FY 2012. FY 2012 General Fund Revenue Forecast History Before legislative changes After legislative changes Jan 2011 DFM Original 6.9% over FY12 estimate $2,521,456,000 $2,429,965,700 N/A Jan coll. $2,552,710,000 $2,565,721,000 Source: Legislative Services Office, Budget Summary, LBB, LFR The Legislature used an estimated $96.6 million of accumulated cash from the prior and current fiscal year in FY 2013 to support changes in the revenue stream and fund new budgetary obliga tions. Of this total, $69.9 million is the cash balance from the end of FY 2011 and carried over into FY 2012, and $26.7 million is the cash surplus estimated to be generated in FY 2012. Included in this balance is $13.3 million that will be paid to the state this spring due to the efforts of the Idaho Attorney General when Idaho joined the statefederal mortgage foreclosure settlement. Ongoing revenue was reduced by $289,000 due to legislation providing a sales tax exemption for aircraft parts in H 417, and a reduction in individual income tax collections for a new employee in come tax credit in H 661. Transfers authorized last session totaling $38 million from the Millen nium Fund, Liquor Control Fund, Permanent Building Fund, and several small dedicated funds re mained in place. The Legislature did appropriate and transfer $4.2 million for deficiency warrants, $2 million to the Disaster Emergency Fund in the Military Division, and $500,000 to the Attorney General to support consumer protection aspects of the mortgage foreclosure settlement. At the very end of the session, the Legislature directed, through H 702, that any cash balance above what was necessary to meet appropriations and the statutory transfer to the Budget Stabilization Fund (BSF) for FY 2013 be transferred into the BSF at the end of FY 2012. H 702 allows for a free fund balance of $5 million to remain in the General Fund at the end of the year for FY 2013 sup plementals and deficiency warrants. By the end of the legislative session it was estimated that the statutory transfer to the BSF in FY 2013 would be $23.5 million, and the available free fund balance in the General Fund was $4.5 million. Any surplus generated from now until the end of the current year will increase the statutory transfer, up until the maximum allowed by Section 57814, Idaho Code, and any remainder will transfer to the BSF at the end of FY 2012. H 702 also transfers $21.5 million into the Public Education Stabilization Fund this fiscal year. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 25 General Fund Revenues - FY 2013 The Governor used the DFM revenue estimate of 5.8% growth to develop his FY 2013 executive budget. The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee (EORAC) recommended the Legislature use a reduced forecast of 4.5% for FY 2013, which is $32.7 million less than the Gover nor's recommendation. FY 2013 General Fund Revenue Forecast History Before legislative changes After legislative changes Jan 2012 DFM Original 5.8% over FY12 estimate $2,700,260,000 estimate $2,667,582,000 $2,634,083,300 Source: Legislative Services Office, Budget Summary, LBB The Legislature passed nine pieces of legislation that, in total, reduced the ongoing General Fund revenue stream by $38.5 million. The single most significant legislation was H 563, which reduced the rates of corporate and individual income taxes with a fiscal impact of $35.7 million. With these changes, the estimated effective revenue growth has been reduced down to 3%, or $76.4 million, from 4.5%, or $114.9 million. In addition, S 1410, the appropriation for public schools, includes $13.1 million from the General Fund for the Bond Levy Equalization Program. Each year this program is fully reimbursed from cig arette taxes transferred into the General Fund. The full amount of $13.1 million of cigarette taxes is available to reimburse the General Fund in FY 2013, rather than $8.1 million included in the ex ecutive revenue estimate, resulting in a revenue increase of $4,977,000. Governor's Executive Budget Recommendations and Revisions The Governor's original General Fund recommendation, excluding the onetime 3% CEC, amounted to a 5% increase over FY 2012. In contrast, the Governor's revised General Fund recommendation for FY 2013, including the onetime 3% CEC, amounted to a 7.4% increase over FY 2012 original ap propriations. Legislative Action The Legislature supported most of the Governor's recommendations for supplemental spending in FY 2012 and line items and initiatives for FY 2013. The Legislature's final budget for FY 2013 amounted to a 6.8% increase over FY 2012 original appropriations. The Legislature did not support transferring $20 million from the Division of Veterans Services either to Medicaid, as recommended by the Governor, or to the General Fund. It did direct the Division of Veterans Services to work with DFM and LSO to study and report back to the Governor and the Legislature as to the causes of the excess fund balances in both the state and federal funds. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 26 The Legislature funded line items including occupancy costs and equity funding for higher educ a- tion, longitudinal data system in the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, contractual increas es and a fund shift from the Millennium Fund for substance abuse treatment in the De- partment of Correction, Idaho Education Network in the Department of Administration, Medicaid Readiness in the Department of Health and Welfare, and funding to eradicate Eurasian m ilfoil in the Department of Agriculture. The Governor included a new initiative called the Idaho Global E n- trepreneurial Mission ( IGEM) , for which he recommended ongoing funding for the Center for A d- vanced Energy Studies (CAES) in Idaho Falls, competitive technology develo pment grants to the state universities, and technology transfer grants for the commercialization of the university - developed technologies into the marketplace to the Department of Commerce. The Legislature supported this initiative. Decisions that were significantly different from the Governor's reco m- mendation are described in the following narrative. Supplementals and Rescissions: The Idaho Legislature approved $19.9 million for supplemental appropriations, or $5.5 million less than the revised recommended level. The supplemental r e- quest for the Catastrophic Health Care Program was funded at $13.1 million instead of $17.6 mil-lion as recommended, with savings of $4.5 million. Of the total $13.1 million approved, $7.5 was ongoing and $5.5 million was one -time. Also, the Legislature did not rescind $18.6 million from the Medicaid Program in the Department of Health and Welfare as recommended, instead choosing to provide carryover aut hority into FY 2013, and reduce the amount that was recommended for growth in FY 2013. A supplemental request for a fund shift to the General Fund for Temporary A s- sistance for Needy Families (TANF) of $951,500 in Health and Welfare was also not considered. Change in Employee Compensation: The Governor recommended a 3% one -time merit -based CEC that would be paid in two separate payments in July 2012 and January 2013. The CEC was conti n- gent upon FY 2012 revenues meeting the forecasted 4.4% growth, which would then result in half being paid out after July 1, 2012. The second half would be paid after January 2013, if the state continued to meet FY 2013 forecasted revenues of 5.8% between July and December 2012. The Legislature approved a 2% ongoing CEC for all state employees and classified employees in the public school system. A pay increase for school administrators and teachers is addressed separat e- ly with additional funding for pay for performance as part of Students Come First reform in public schools. Permanent classified state employees, including probationary employees, are eligible to receive an ongoing 2% pay increase if they are performing satisfactorily with a current perfo r- mance evaluation. Nonclassified state employees not requiring a performance evaluation prior to a pay change will be eligible for the pay increase if judged to be performing in a satisfactory man- ner by their appointing authority. Agencies were also directed to use salary savings, if available, for additional merit pay for permanent and temporary employees. The total General Fund cost for this acti on was $12.3 million, including funding for the statutory increases for elected officials, judges and appointed commissioners, as compared to $41.1 million for a one- time 3% CEC. The savings available by not providing an additional 3% CEC to public school administrators and teac h- 2012 Sine Die Report Page 27 ers was redirected to fund other items in p ublic schools. Replacement Items for Critical Needs: The Legislature provided $2.4 million on a one -time basis to fourteen different agencies for operating expenditures and capital outlay for items that were crit i- cally necessary for the safety or the continued performance of core operations of the agency. Education agencies received $997,500 for Agricultural Research and Extension, Health Education Programs, Professional- Technical Education, Public Broadcasting, and Special Programs. Health and Welfare received $177,400 for the state hospitals, the Department of Correction received $400,000, and Idaho State Police $580,700. The remaining $244,400 went to the Department of Water Resources, Department of Lands, Historical Society, Office of Performance Evaluations, and the Secretary of State. Public School Funding: The Legislature appropriated $1,279.8 million ongoing from the General Fund, as compared to $1,255.3 million in the Governor's recommendation. The Governor sep a- rately recommended an additional $25.5 million for a one -time 3% CEC for all school district pe r- sonnel, subject to revenue meeting established targets in FY 2012 and 2013. The Governor's re c- ommendation included funding for 150 support units of enrollment growth and all of the statutory requirements of Students Come First for technology and pay for performance. After the session began, the Superintendent of Public Schools revised his request for new support units from 150 to 50. Although this created savings of $7.2 million in the Governor's recommendation, the s uperin- tendent requested those funds be directed elsewhere in p ublic schools, and the Governor did not revise his recommendation. The Legislature provided additional funds to halt the reduction of sa l- ary-based apportionment to fund Students Come First, partially replaced the loss of state dedicat- ed and discretionary funding, provided new funds for school district IT staff, and raised the mini-mum teacher salary. Unde r the requirements of Students Come First , school administrators and teachers will be eligible for pay for performance that average s out to a 4.5% increase in FY 2013. Higher Education Funding: The college and universities received $2.4 million for occupan cy costs instead of $4.8 million included in the Governor's recommendation. All other line items were funded as recommended. Health and Human Services Funding: The Catastrophic Health Care Program was provided an o n- going appropriation of $36.5 million instead of $19.3 million , as recommended by the Governor. Beginning in FY 2014, and subject to the implementation of health care reform , there is a possibili- ty that some of these resources will be redirected to the Medicaid Program in the Department of Healt h and Welfare to support newly eligible persons. In the end, the CAT Fund received $4.2 mi l- lion more in FY 2013 compared to FY 2012. The Governor did not include $36.4 million from the General Fund for the sunsetting of Medicaid assessments for hospital s, nursing homes, and intermediate care facilities in his original reco m- mendation. He recommended partial relief with a one -time $20 million transfer and appropriation to Medicaid from fund balances in the Divis ion of Veterans Services, a stand -alone agen cy in the 2012 Sine Die Report Page 28 Depar tment of Self- Governing Agencies . Later in the session he revised his recommendation to fully fund the loss of the assessments in FY 2013 by reducing Medicaid's FY 2012 ongoing appropr- iation by $18.6 million, and dedicating that money in FY 2013 for assessments. His revision also included funding the balance of the cost of the assessments with a one -time appropriation of $17.8 million that would need to be reconsidered in next year's budget cycle. The Legislature fully funded Medicaid assessments on an ongoing basis and restored some of the reductions in services made last legislative session due to budget constraints. In total, the Department of Health and Welfare was appropriated $25.8 million less from the Gen-eral Fund for nondiscretiona ry adjustments and line items as compared to the revised recommen- dation. Most of these savings were due to lack of growth in caseload and utilization of Medicaid. State Stabilization Funds: The Legislature transferred $21.5 million to the Public Education Stabili- zation Fund in FY 2012 and will transfer an estimated $23.5 million to the Budget Stabilization Fund in FY 2013, for a total increase of $44.9 million over the two fiscal years. Any increase in rev- enues over the forecasted amount of 4.4% in the current year will be deposited into the Budget Stabilization Fund at the end of June 2012. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 29General Fund Comparison Original Appropriation to Governor's Recommendation & JFAC Action Change Change FY 2012 from FY 2013 Dollar Dollar from Department/AgencyOrig Approp OrigJFAC Action Difference from GovDifference 19,269,800 0.0% 36,532,800 4,463,500 0.4% 4,463,200 (one-time)FY 2012 General Fund Revenue & Appropriations 2012 Sine Die Report Page 30 \"Where the money comes from . . .\" Dollars In Millions (Percent of Revenue) \"Where the money goes . . .\" Dollars In Millions (Percent of Appropriations) Individual Income Tax, $1,219.6 , 47.5% Sales Tax, $1,013.2 , $21. & Human Ser vi ces , $609.8 23.9% General Fund Ending Balance = $96.6Balances and Transfers = $79.8 General Fund Revenue = $2,565.7 General Fund Appropriations = $2,548.9All Education $1,562.0 , 61.3%FY 2013 General Fund Revenue & Appropriations 2012 Sine Die Report Page 31 \"Where the money comes from . . .\" Dollars In Millions (Percent of Revenue) \"Where the money goes . . .\" Dollars In Millions (Percent of Appropriations) Individual Income Tax, $1,246.8 , 47.3% Sales Tax, $1,068.5 $24. & Human Ser vi ces , $654.9 24.2% General Fund Ending Balance = $4.5Balances and Transfers = $72.5General Fund Revenue = $2,634.0 General Fund Appropriations = $2,702.1All Education $1,645.7 , 60.9%State of Idaho Major Reserve Fund Balances 2012 Sine Die Report Page 32 Budget Stabilization Fund Public Ed Stabilization Fund Economic Recovery Fund Idaho Millennium Fund Emergency Funds* Higher Ed Stabilization Fund Balance June 30, 2008 $ 140.625 $ 112.046 $ 66.133 $ 70.367 $ 3.337 $ 0 Balance June 30, 2009 $ 128.225 $ 17.979 $ 68.101 $ 74.207 $ .720 $ 0 Balance June 30, 2010 $ 30.820 $ 23.174 $ 48.847 $ 76.967 $ .792 $ 0 Balance June 30, 2011 $ .100 $ 11.154 $ .054 $ 74.589 $ 3.339 $ 0 FY 2012 K-12 After Year-End Adjustment 4.229 Forecast Interest Earnings .112 .002 .917 .366 Tobacco Settlement and Receipts 6.528 2.081 Disbursements/Expenditures (3.628) (2.982) H 329 Catastrophic Health & Welfare FMAP Shift** (37.888) S GF*** 21.453 2.000 Reverted Appropriations/Adjustments .128 Estimate June 30, 2012 $ .228 $ 36.947 $ .055 $ 15.559 $ 4.438 $ .366 FY 2013K-12 After Year-End AdjustmentForecast Interest Earnings 5.000 Disbursements June 2013 $ 37.317 $ .056 $ 16.943 $ 4.438 $ .733 In Millions of Dollars * Emergency Funds include: 1) Governor's Emergency, \u00a757-1601; 2) Disaster Emergency, \u00a746-1005A; and 3) Emergency Relief Fund, Federal Emergency Management Act. ** Section 6 of H 341, 2011, authorized the SCO to transfer up to $42,317,700 from the Millennium Fund to the Cooperative Welfare Fund to cover the FY 2011 Medicaid shortfall.

This budget also provides $4.15 million ongoing from the General Fund to keep discretionary funds at the same amount as the current year, $1.1 million of ongoing General Funds to increase discretionary funds, $2.9 million of ongoing General Funds to increase the minimum teacher salary from $30,000 to $30,500, an additional $4 million of onetime dedicated funds to the Idaho Digital Learning Acade my (IDLA), and $2.5 million of ongoing General Funds for school district IT support staff. Discretion- ary funds are set at $19,706 per support unit. The total for this budget includes $1,279,818,600 of General Funds, which is a 4.6% increase from the previous year. A single bill, S 1410, includes ap propriations for all six divisions of the public schools budget, including administrators, teachers, operations/classified staff, children's programs, facilities, and the educational services for the deaf and the blind.

These reductions were implemented during the 2011 session as a way to provide funding for pay for performance, tech nology, and laptops and maintenance. Removing these reductions will shift $34,747,500 to the General Fund in FY 2013 through FY 2017. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 34 College and Universities An appropriation of $446,362,200 went to the State Board of Education and the Board of Regents of the University of Idaho for college and universities. They received an 8.6% General Fund in crease, and the appropriation includes: $6,655,200 for the FY 2013 enrollment workload adjustment; $3,431,200 for a 2% change in employee compensation (CEC); $3,100,100 for benefit cost increases; $2,370,400 for building/facility occupancy costs at the four institutions; $2,000,000 to BSU, ISU, and UI for ongoing personnel and operating costs for their work at the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES); and $2,000,000 to be allocated under the direction of the State Board of Education by the High er Education Research Council for competitive university research. Agricultural Research and Extension Service The appropriation for FY 2013 to the Agricultural Research and Cooperative Extension Service is $23,654,100. The bill provides $325,000 for critical replacement items including asbestos removal at the Nancy M. Cummings R&E Center near Salmon; roof replacement and greenhouse renova tions at the Parma center; a new HVAC system and greenhouse renovations at Aberdeen; green house renovations at Kimberly; and agricultural equipment at various locations. This appropriation provides a 4.6% increase in General Funds. Community Colleges The appropriation for FY 2013 of $28,349,900 is to the State Board of Education for community col leges. This budget results in a 20.5% increase from the General Fund and includes benefit costs in creases, a 2% change in employee compensation, and $1,697,200 for enrollment increases at the three community colleges. There were two line items funded, the first for $1,410,400 for build ing/facility occupancy costs at two institutions. Of this amount, $563,100 will be provided to the College of Southern Idaho for the Health Science & Human Services building, and $848,600 to the College of Western Idaho for the main building in Nampa and the Canyon County Center. The second line item provides $1 million for an enrollment equity adjustment to the College of Western Idaho. Professional Technical Education The appropriation in the amount of $58,074,200 is to the Division of Professional Technical Educa tion. It includes $390,000 of onetime General Funds for educational equipment at the six technical colleges to be allocated at $65,000 per institution. This budget reflects a 3.8% increase in General Funds. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 35 Superintendent of Public Instruction The Superintendent of Public Instruction received $46,389,900 that includes standard maintenance items, a 2% CEC, and $3,400 for the statutory salary increase for constitutional officers. This budg et reflects a General Fund increase of 14.1%. There were two line items funded in this budget. The first line item provides $11,573,800 of onetime dedicated funds from the J.A. and Kathryn Albert son Foundation for continued development of an instructional management system. Once devel oped, this system will allow teachers and administrators to access current data on student atten dance; access content standards and align curriculum to those standards; develop lesson plans; share best practices; create assessments; and provide funding for digital content and professional development. The second line item provides $873,800 of ongoing General Funds for the remaining funding necessary for maintenance and operation of the statewide longitudinal data system. Health and Human Services Catastrophic Health Care Cost Program The FY 2013 appropriation for the Catastrophic Health Care Cost Program is $36,352,800, which reflects an increase of $17,265,100 or 89.6% over the FY 2012 original appropriation. However, the FY 2012 original appropriation knowingly underfunded the program with the understanding that a supplemental would be needed to cover total program costs in FY 2012. The program received a supplemental of $13,070,000 for FY 2012, bringing the total FY 2012 appropriation to $35,427,700. Measured from the FY 2012 total appropriation, the FY 2013 original appropriation for the program reflects an increase of $1,105,100 or 3.1%. Department of Health and Welfare The FY 2013 appropriation for the Department of Health and Welfare is $2,364,038,800, consisting of $601,164,900 from the General Fund, $246,102,100 in dedicated funds, and $1,507,771,800 in federal funds. This reflects an increase of 8% from the General Fund and 5.7% in total funds. Medicaid: The budget for the Medical Assistance Services Division, or Medicaid, includes $474,177,200 from the General Fund and $1,911,359,500 in total funds. This represents 77.7% of the department's General Fund appropriation and 80.9% of the department's total appropriation for FY 2013. Funding for Growth: Medicaid is a federal/state partnership program that pays health care ex penses for eligible individuals. The proportion of eligible costs paid by the federal government is called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP rate. Idaho's rate increased from 69.88% in FY 2012 to 70.81% in FY 2013. The department estimates that the increased FMAP rate will result in a shift of $15,707,600 from the General Fund to federal funds in FY 2013. In addition to this fund shift, the Legislature provided an ongoing increase in General Fund support in the same amount for FY 2013. The net result of the General Fund reduction from the increased FMAP rate 2012 Sine Die Report Page 36 and the increased nondiscretionary funding for the program is zero for FY 2013. After the session began, Health & Welfare estimated it was over appropriated by $18.6 million from the General Fund in FY 2012. Rather than including an ongoing General Fund rescission in that amount, the Legislature provided carryover authority for any unused and unencumbered Gen eral Fund moneys at the end of FY 2012. This will allow the department (1) to devote those unused moneys to program growth in FY 2013 and, (2) since Medicaid's FY 2013 Base was not reduced as would have been the case with a rescission, to benefit from the higher level of funding for FY 2013. This translates into funding growth in the amount of $37.2 million consisting of $18.6 million one time (from estimated cash remaining at the end of the current fiscal year) and $18.6 million ongo ing from setting the FY 2013 budget that much higher than current year estimated expenditures. Health Care Provider Assessment Sunset: Idaho statute includes provider assessment acts for three provider types: hospitals, nursing facilities, and intermediate care facilities. The primary pur pose of the assessments is to allow providers to contribute nonfederal moneys in order to receive increased amounts of federal funds. This portion of each assessment is called the upper payment limit, or UPL. As state revenue declined in recent years, each provider assessment act was tempo rarily modified to include an allowance for the state to use a portion of assessment contributions from providers to offset reductions in General Fund support. Similar to UPL assessments, the non federal contribution from providers was used by the state to bring in additional federal funds. To do so, provider assessment payments were used in the same way as General Fund resources de voted to the program; they paid for program expenses at the standard FMAP rate. The difference, therefore, is that under this allowance, those federal resources did not go directly back to contri buting providers; they were used to pay broader program expenses. This allowance within each assessment was called the Gap/Trustee and Benefit Assessment. The Gap/Trustee and Benefit As sessment allowance for all three provider types sunsets at the end of FY 2012. To offset the sunsetting of the Gap/Trustee and Benefit Assessment allowances, Medicaid received an ongoing General Fund increase of $36.4 million, which is the amount the three provider types contributed for that purpose in FY 2012. The UPL assessment will remain in place in FY 2013 and beyond, and the department maintained the necessary dedicated and federal spending authority to facilitate. Other Medicaid Enhancements: In addition to shifting dedicated assessment funds back to the General Fund, the Division of Medicaid received nine line items totaling $999,300 from the General Fund and $29,462,200 in total funds. Highlights include: $324,000 from the General Fund and $324,000 in federal funds for a total of $648,000 to prepare a statewide managed care implementation plan. This implementation plan is a continuation of an effort that began in 2011 when the Legislature provided Medicaid with funding to prepare an existing conditions actuarial analysis for health care services in Idaho. The actuarial analysis is intended to act as the baseline in considering the feasibility of ma 2012 Sine Die Report Page 37 naged care by region and Medicaid plan throughout the state. The FY 2013 funding will build on the actuarial analysis and identify implementation steps for establishing a managed care system in Idaho. $1,551,900 from the General Fund and $3,764,700 in federal funds for a total of $5,316,600 to reinstate services that were suspended under H 260 of 2011. Those services include pre ventative dental coverage for individuals under the Developmentally Disabled and Aged and Disabled waivers, and skills training within both mental health and developmental disabili ties services (rather than either/or for individuals eligible for both). This line item parallels policy changes included in H 609. Other Department of Health and Welfare Budget Highlights The Division of Child Welfare received an ongoing increase of $150,000 from the General Fund and $498,100 in federal funds for a total increase of $648,100 to increase foster care reimbursements to host families. The Division of Welfare received an ongoing increase of $250,000 from the Gener al Fund and $250,000 in federal funds for a total ongoing increase of $500,000 for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or Food Stamps) Job Search Assistance. This funding will allow the division to require able bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs) to participate in job search assistance as a condition of receiving SNAP benefits. Due to a lack of funding, ABAWDs are the only SNAP recipients not required to participate in job search activities to receive benefits. Three divisions within the department, Indirect Support Services, Medicaid, and Welfare, received funding for Medicaid Readiness. That funding included a supplemental of $750,000 from the Gen eral Fund and $6,750,000 in federal funds for a total onetime increase of $7,500,000. The de partment also received a onetime increase of $1,520,000 from the General Fund and $13,680,000 in federal funds for a total onetime increase of $15,200,000 for Medicaid Readiness in FY 2013. The full amount of FY 2012 and FY 2013 funding is for Phase 1 of the Medicaid Readiness project. Phase 1 is intended to automate and streamline existing processes within the department. Out comes include new connectivity between the department's eligibility systems and federal/other systems to automatically verify applicant eligibility, elimination of paper based processes, and crea tion of new online application functionality. The total estimated cost of the Medicaid Readiness project is $34.8 million. The department received $22.7 million for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 and intends to request the remainder in future years, pending national decisions pertaining to health care reform. Although there is no new funding, the divisions of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention identified $50,000 of ongoing block grant funding to devote to an Idaho Suicide Cri sis Line. The department already has spending authority for these funds, which currently go to sui cide research. A onetime appropriation of $110,000 from the Division of Veterans Services will also assist in establishing the suicide crises line. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 38 Public Safety Department of Correction The General Fund appropriation for the Department of Correction increased from $157.4 million in FY 2012 to $168.8 million in FY 2013. This level of funding represents an increase of $11.4 million, or 7.3%. For FY 2012, the Legislature moved a total of $625,200 between expense classes for community based substance abuse treatment services and appropriated an additional $1.5 million to cover the cost of housing inmates in county jails for the remainder of the year. For FY 2013, the Legislature approved: $3.3 million to cover employee benefits and change in employee compensation, and changes made in the Statewide Cost Allocation Plan. $400,000 to meet critical capital replacement items as determined by the director. $912,500 to cover a contractual 3% increase in the operation of the private prison facility. Per diem will increase from $41.49 to $42.73 per inmate day for the first 1,894 inmates and from $4.07 to $4.19 per inmate day for the next 146 offenders housed at the facility. $76,700 to cover expenses related to the Sexual Offender Management Board that replaced the older Sexual Offender Classification Board per S1154 last session. The replacement of the fourmember Sex Offender Classification Board with an eightmember Sex Offender Management Board resulted in increased expenses. $3.8 million to continue coordination, assessment and community based substance abuse treatment and recovery support services for felony offenders, in lieu of incarceration at a state facility. Another $1.9 million was also appropriated from the Millennium Income Fund, on a onetime basis, for this same purpose. $1.3 million to pay for contract medical services provided to offenders housed in state pris on facilities and the Correctional Alternative Placement Program (CAPP). Per diem will in crease by an estimated 4.5%, rising from $12.85 to $13.43 per inmate day. $112,600 to the Commission for Pardons & Parole to reinstate one parole hearing officer and one office specialist that were eliminated as a result of previous budget reductions. Idaho State Police The General Fund appropriation for the Idaho State Police (ISP) increased from $14.9 million in FY 2012 to $17.6 million in FY 2013. This level of funding represents an increase of $2.7 million, or 18.3%. For FY 2013, the Legislature approved: $1 million to cover employee benefits and change in employee compensation, changes made in the Statewide Cost Allocation Plan and replacement vehicles. $1 million to implement phase one of two phases in replacing ISP's existing radio system with 700MHz dual band radio technology. 2012 Sine Die Report Page 39 $334,000 to hire two forensic scientists per S 1067 that passed last session and requires all convicted felons to provide a DNA sample for inclusion into the state and national DNA In dex System databases, also known as CODIS. $350,000 to cover increased fuel costs. It should also be noted that H 450aa created a dedicated funding source for the Alcohol Beverage Control Bureau within the Idaho State Police to cover staffing and operational costs. The bill shifted an estimated $1.5 million collected from alcohol beverage license fees away from the Gen eral Fund to the newly created Alcohol and Beverage Control Fund. S 1412 then appropriated a like amount to allow the department to hire two ISP sergeants, eight ISP specialists, and two technical records specialists, along with necessary equipment and supplies to improve alcohol beverage con trol enforcement efforts in fiscal year 2013. The program is responsible for the administration and issuance of licenses, background checks of potential licensees, premises checks of licensed establishments, and enforcement and interpreta tions of alcohol beverage laws. It also conducts underage drinking compliance checks, investigates serving intoxicated patrons, provides training, and investigates or assists other law enforcement agencies. Natural Resources Department of Environmental Quality S 1359 appropriated an additional $671,200 to the Department of Environmental Quality for FY 2012 from the Hecla mine settlement to operate the institutional controls program and soil reposi tories in the Silver Valley. The bill also appropriated $61,954,400 to DEQ for FY 2013. The budget transferred $1.5 million from the Water Pollution Control Fund to the Environmental Remediation Fund, expressed legislative intent regarding an annual progress report of the superfund cleanup, and acknowledgement that the Water Pollution Control Fund is being used for a variety of projects not specified in Idaho Code. The budget included $398,700 from the Water Pollution Control Fund to continue the Beneficial Use Reconnaissance water quality monitoring program. The Legislature approved two onetime line items related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Legislature also approved $50,000 ongoing from the General Fund for the Pend Oreille Lakes Commission and $50,000 ongoing from the General Fund for the Bear Lake Regional Commission.

Department of Fish and Game H 641 appropriated an additional $7,589,600 to the Department of Fish and Game for FY 2012 to finish construction of Deyo Reservoir near Weippe; to complete planning, design, and compliance work for the Springfield fish hatchery; and to continue project specific commitments from federal and private fund sources. The bill appropriated $93,068,800 for FY 2013. JFAC authorized twelve 2012 Sine Die Report Page 40 line items. The largest was $13,119,000 from Bonneville Power Administration funds to construct the Springfield fish hatchery to address the recolonization phase of the Snake River Sockeye Brood Program. The budget was a 20.5% increase over the current year, but only a 3.1% increase in the ongoing portion of the budget. Department of Lands H 655 appropriated $46,137,600 to the Department of Lands for FY 2013. The Legislature approved five line items including nearly $1.4 million in dedicated funding for phaseone of the Land Informa tion Management System.
