Following the aims of this review and its inclusion criteria, this section is split into five subsections: 1) Food costs for individuals with FHS ; 2) Non- food costs of FHS ; 3) Review studies on people living with FHS; 4) Studies of cost/burden in other chronic conditions and disabilities, and 5) Statistics on food consumption. The Food costs section includes studies that reported the cost of restricted diets in FHS individuals. (These are financial costs only) The Non-food costs section includes studies that looked at lost productivity, time loss due to the FHS and other burdens reported by people living with FHS or caregivers of children with FHS. The non- food costs section also includes studies that reported combined direct or indirect costs of living with a FHS. (These are both financial and economic costs) The Non-FHS studies section reviews studies reporting on the cost or price differen- tials for a variety of chronic conditions or disabilities. Finally, the Statistics on food consumption section reports the statistics available on general food consumption patterns in the UK. Note that unless otherwise stated, the price year of figures reported is equivalent to the year of the study (or the paper didn't report the price year, generally because they calculated costs directly from supermarkets). Terminology of C osts There are a number of different, overlapping ways of categorising costs which can become confusing. The key distinctions are outlined here: Food versus non- food costs. For the purposes of our analysis we have made the dis- tinction between the impact of FHS on food cost s, and all the other impacts of FHS on out -of-pocket costs and time ( non- food costs ). Economic versus financial costs. Financial costs are those where money changes hands, economic costs include both financial costs and elements that carry an op- portunity cost for example, time spent reading labels that could be used for something 2 else. Economic costs are a wider category often used for assessing value for money, whereas financial costs im pact on budgets and affordability. Cost of illness versus maintenance/management costs. This project is focused only on the costs of remaining well with a FH, i.e. not including the cost incurred by illness. For example, regular medical appointments like c heck -ups are included, hospitalisation due to illness is not. Direct vs. indirect (vs. intangible) costs. Many of the studies we looked at, particularly those not focused on food hypersensitivities, are typically economic burden of disease studies. These l ook at the main costs incurred as a consequence of a particular health condition. In these studies , typically the distinction is between direct costs (usually medical and food costs) and indirect costs (usually knock -on im pacts of the condition, like the i mpact on productivity). They can also consider intangible costs which relate to quality of life/pain and suffering. Somewhat confusingly this distinction is not well -de- fined when it comes to the focus of much of this study, for example, non-medical finan- cial costs and time spent including out -of-pocket spend (spend that is directly from an individual's cash reserves) on food, equipment etc. Often these are considered as di-rect non- medical costs, but sometimes they are included as indirect costs. Food Costs for Individuals with FHS The majority of studies looking at the differences in food costs for individuals with FHS compared the cost of gluten- free and non- gluten- free products, perhaps due to the fact that gluten- free products are often clearly distinguished as such. Our search returned eleven such studies, the findings of which are presented in Table 1 below. Table 1: Studies comparing the price of gluten- free and non- gluten- free food products Author (Year) Country Compared food items Price Capacci, Leucci, & Mazzocchi (2018) UK All gluten -containing cereal products available in four major UK supermarkets (online shops) and their gluten- free substitutes Gluten -free products were on average 188% more expensive than their gluten- containing counterparts (\u00a31.12/100g vs. \u00a30.59/100g respectively) 3 Author (Year) Country Compared food items Price Fry, Madden, & Fallaize (2018) UK 679 gluten -free food items from ten categories of food products (brown bread, white bread, breakfast cereals, wholegrain flour, white flour, pizza bases, wholegrain pasta, regular pasta, crackers, biscuits) found in five UK supermarkets (online shops) and 1045 comparable regular products Gluten -free products were on a 159% more expensive than their gluten- containing counterparts (Median: \u00a31.14/100g vs. \u00a30.44/100g respectively) Allen & Orfila (2018) UK All available gluten -free products (n=49) from four food categories (white bread, brow n bread, seeded bread, white past) found in four major UK supermarkets (online shops) and their gluten- containing equivalents (n=61) Gluten -free products were significantly more expensive across all four product categories, as follows: White & Whelan (2011) UK Ten wheat -based and 10 everyday food products that frequently contain gluten, available at 30 different stores across five store categories (quality supermarkets, regular supermarkets, budget supermarkets, health food shops, corner shops) and All 10 gluten -free versions of the wheat -based products were on average more expensive than their standard counterparts (76 - 518%). Some gluten- free versions of everyday foods were also more expensive (2-124%). 4 Author (Year) Country Compared food items Price their gluten -free equivalents. Four versions of each product were surveyed (branded gluten- free, cheapest gluten- free, branded standard, cheapest standard) Burden et al. (2015) UK Ten commonly purchased gluten- free food items available in supermarkets and internet shops delivering to homes in a single UK city (Sh effield) and their gluten- containing equivalents All 10 gluten -free products cost more than their standard equivalents (4.1 times more on average) Missbach et al. (2015) Austria 63 gluten -free food products from 19 brands and seven food categories (convenience, snacks, cookie. and cakes, cereals, pasta and cereal -based products, bread/bakery products, flour/bake mix) available in 12 different Austrian supermarkets (three different chains) and 126 equivalent standard products (two standard products per one gluten- free product - one budget, one pricier) Average cost of gluten -free products was significantly higher compared to gluten- containing products across all product categories (\u20ac11.58/kg vs. \u20ac6.62/kg), ranging from 205% to 267%. 5 Author (Year) Country Compared food items Price Panagiotou & Kontogianni (2017) Greece All gluten -free products available in four supermarket chains in Athens, all gluten- free products available in pharmacies and their non- gluten- free equivalents. 24 food categories were represented. All gluten -free products in supermarkets (except for pasta sauce) were 22- 334% more expensive than their standard counterparts. All pharmacy gluten- free products were 88- 476% more expensive than their standard counterparts. Lee et al. (2019) US 'Market basket' of regular food products (10 food categories: bread, cereals, pasta, crackers, pretzels, cookies, waffles, pizza, macaroni and cheese, cake) and their gluten- free equivalents available across four store categories (traditional grocery store, health food store, upscale market, online) and f ive geographic regions of the US. Overall, gluten -free products were 183% more expensive than their non- gluten free counterparts across all food categories. Lambert & Ficken (2015) Australia Gluten -free supermarket basket and gluten-containing supermarket basket for a seven- day meal plan for four different family types (nuclear family, single parent with two children, single elderly female, single The gluten -free basket was more expensive than the gluten- containing basket on 22 out of 24 occasions (four family types across six areas). Average price differential (cost of food basket per week) across the 6 Author (Year) Country Compared food items Price young male), in which one member required a gluten- free diet. The basket items were priced at two main supermarkets across six suburbs of the Illawarra region in NSW. six areas was +5.78% for the nuclear family, +11.30% for the single mother, +16.67% for single elderly female, and +15.98% for the single young male. Arias - Gastelum et al. (2018) Mexico Fourteen wheat -based items (and two additional items not suitable for gluten- sensitive individuals) from a 'Mexican market basket' were compared to their gluten- free alternatives available in regular supermarkets and health food stores in five Mexican cities Twelve of the 14 gluten -free products were significantly more expensive (by 190% - 1088%) than their gluten-containing counterparts. The other two products could not be compared due to their low availability. Est\u00e9vez, Ayala, Vespa, & Araya (2016) Chile Thirty -four gluten -containing items from a basic food basket (53 items in total) and their gluten- free counterparts available in stores (mid -range and wholesale supermarkets) in Santiago, Chile. Only 19 items were analysed, because they were low - priced, si milarly to their non- gluten- free equivalents. The 19 gluten -free items were on average 3x more expensive than their gluten- containing equivalents. The cost of the 19 gluten- free items was US$132.8 person/month compared to US$44.3 person/month for the non- gluten -free equivalents. 7 In addition to comparing the gluten- free and non- gluten free food products, the above studies also reported the following information: Product Availability and Cost Differences Allen and Orfila (2018) also found that gluten- free products were significantly less availa- ble across all four food categories in the UK . The mean number of available gluten- free products ranged between 4 and 11, whereas the mean number of standard products ranged between 23 and 62. The authors also looked at the nutritional profile of the four categories of products and found that gluten free products tended to be higher in fibre and fat and lower in sugar and protein. Additionally, only 5% of all gluten -free breads were for- tified with all four fortification minerals (in accordance with UK law for standard breads). Singh and Whelan (2011) further found that the prices of different food products varied based on store category, with regular supermarkets generally stocking ch eaper gluten- free versions in the UK . In terms of availability, across all stores, only 41% of the 20 food items were available in a gluten- free version per store. The highest availability was found in regular supermarkets (90%) and the lowest availability in budget supermarkets and cor- ner shops (both 9%). Burden et al. (2015) found that the difference in cost for different food items was minimal across different store categories in the UK . The availability, however, varied widely, with none of the budget or corner shops surveyed stocking any gluten- free products. Larger supermarkets stocked the most gluten- free products. The median number of items availa- ble across all 10 surveyed stores was four. Lee et al. (2019) also found that there were differences in prices across geographical re- gions in the US . The difference in price between gluten- free and conventional product ranged from 162% to 245% based on geographical area. The availability of products also varied by region and store category. Health food and upscale stores had the greatest availability of gluten- free products (66% of the gluten -free market basked products). Tradi- tional grocery store was the cheapest place for gluten- free products, with the mean cost of the gluten- free market basket being $0.45/o unce at the traditional grocery store, and $0.59/ounce online. Arias -Gastelum et al. (2018) also looked at the availability of the gluten- free products in Mexican stores and found these to be substantially less available. The availability ranged between 0% and 81% in supermarkets (average 28.8%) and between 6.2% and 62.5% in 8 health food stores (average 25%). A survey with 36 participants who were following a glu- ten-free diet on their doctor's recommendation revealed that 33 of them (91.6%) found the diet moderately or very difficult to follow, particularly due to its high cost and the low avail-ability of the gluten- free products. Thirty -five (97.2%) respondents also reported they were afraid of dining out, 32 (88.8%) were avoiding social activities and 30 (83.3%) had difficul-ties travelling. Est\u00e9vez et al. (2016) further found that in Chile, the gluten- free items were 42% less avail- able and they also had lower protein (24.2% less on average, up to 69% less in breads and cereals) content compared to the compar able non- gluten- free items. The food basket used in the study included 34 foodstuffs that contained gluten or may have been contami-nated by it. Socio- economic impact Capacci et al. (2018) further estimated that coeliac consumers in the UK pay on average \u00a310 extra each week for their food, just to keep their pre- diagnosis utility level. This corre- sponds to 29% of their food budget. Additional analyses revealed that coeliac consumers at different income levels incur the same extra cost in absolute terms, whic h corresponds to 36% of the food budget of poor consumers (lowest income quartile) and 24% of the food budget of rich consumers (top income quartile). Panagiotou & Kontogianni (2017) estimated the economic burden of a gluten- free diet by designing weekly dietary menus for children, adolescents and adults in Greece. The upper energy intake was considered for each age group to estimate the maximum economic burden. They found that this ranged from + EUR 12 to + EUR28 per week, depending on the individual's age and place of purchase of the gluten- free products. For children, this was an extra EUR12.12 for supermarket gluten- free products and EUR 15.38 for phar- macy gluten- free products. For adolescents, this was an ext ra EUR 23.56 and EUR27.84 and for adults it was an extra EUR18.21 and EUR23.80 respectively. Lambert and Ficken (2015) also looked at the affordability of the gluten- free supermarket basket for a seven -days meal for each one of the four family types (nuclear family, single parent with two children, single elderly female, single young male) in Australia and found that with the exception of the single elderly female, the gluten- free supermarket basket was unaffordable for all family types (to be considered aff ordable, the food purchase had to represent less than 25% of the household's disposable income). 9 Nutritional impact Fry et al. (2018) also compared the nutritional content of the gluten- free and non- gluten- free products in the UK and found that the gluten- free diet is unlikely to offer health bene- fits compared to regular foods, except for those who require a gluten- free diet. A signifi- cantly higher proportion of gluten- free products (65%) were found to contain high or me- dium content of fat, saturated fat, s ugar and salt, compared to regular products. Protein and fibre content were also lower in gluten- free products. 679 gluten- free food items from ten categories of food products (brown bread, white bread, breakfast cereals, wholegrain flour, white flour, piz za bases, wholegrain pasta, regular pasta, crackers, biscuits) found in five UK supermarkets (online shops) and 1045 comparable regular products were used. Missbach et al. (2015) further found that across all food categories, the energy content, carbohydrate, fat, saturated fatty acids, fibre and sugar content did not differ significantly between gluten- free and non- gluten- free products in Austria . Protein content was, how- ever, lower in gluten- free products. 63 gluten- free food products from 19 brands and seven food categories (convenience, snacks, cookie. and cakes, cereals, pasta and ce- real-based products, bread/bakery products, flour/bake mix) available in 12 different Aus- trian supermarkets (three different chains) and 126 equivalent standard products (tw o standard products per one gluten- free product - one budget, one pricier) were used. Our search returned several other studies that looked at direct food costs in individuals with FHS. As above, some of these studies also looked at indirect costs associat ed with FHS. These studies are briefly summarised below: A US study (Wolf et al., 2016) examined the cost of the six -food elimination diet (SFED; which excludes dairy, wheat, eggs, soy, nuts and seafood) required for eosinophilic esophagitis, compared to an unrestricted diet. A dietitian with experienced of the condition , produced calorie- and nutrient -matched menus for a week's worth of meals for the SFED and the unrestricted diet. The menus were used to generate a shopping list and prices of items were s urveyed at standard and specialty stores. The results showed that the average weekly price of the SFED diet was $ 92.54 compared to $79.84 for unrestricted diet, when shopping at standard supermarkets. The availability of the products also varied; 32% of th e SFED shopping list items were not available, compared to 3% of unrestricted shopping list items, and would have to be obtained from another store. In specialty stores, the average weekly price of the SFED diet was $ 106.47 vs. $ 105.96 for unrestricted diet. Six% vs. 2% of the 10 shopping list items respectively would have to be obtained from another supermarket. The study also found that compared to the unrestricted diet, the SFED diet generated an overall excess annual cost of $654 when shopping at a standard supermarket. A study conducted in Finland (Alanne et al. , 2012) used a prospective design, where the development of allergic disease (atopic dermatitis, food allergy to cow's milk or wheat, asthma) in infants was followed from birth to 24 months. Sixty children developed allergic disease by the age of two and they were compared with 56 age- and sex -matched controls who had no allergic diseases. Twenty -three infants in the sample developed food allergy, but some of these also had atopic dermatitis, asthma, or both. Data was collected from insurance companies, health care providers, from parents through questionnaires, and from medical examinations. In terms of family dietary costs, the diet of infants with food allergy was a median of EUR47 (mean EUR115) more expensive than that of healthy infants in the first 24 months of their life. Once the insurance company -reimbursed part of the formulae for infants with cow's milk allergy was included, this difference rose to a median of EUR778 (mean EUR2041). In a related study conducted with the same cohort in Finland, Alanne (2012a) used 3- day diet records to estimate nutrient intake and diet -related costs of 23 infants with food allergy at 6, 12, and 24 months of age and compared them to 57 infants without food allergy. Food prices were obtained from local supermarkets and prices of supplements from a pharmacy. The daily dietary costs of families with infants with food allergy vs. families with healthy infants were EUR1.64 vs. EUR1.21 at 6 months, EUR3.18 vs . EUR2.69 at 12 months, and EUR2.91 vs. EUR2.89 at 24 months (2006 prices). The difference was, however, not statistically significant at 12 and 24 months. The cost was higher for infants on hydrolysed formulae compared to those using soy -, oat-, or rice -based alternatives, or those that were breastfed for longer. A secondary analysis of cross -sectional survey data (Bilaver et al. , 2016) collected from 1,643 US caregivers of a food- allergic child looked at the medical costs borne by the health care system and out -of-pocket costs borne by the families. The study looked at differences based on household income and race/ethnicity and the analyses were weighted to be representative of US children with current food allergies. The survey enquired about the child and household demographics, food allergy severity and reaction history, resource use, lost 11 productivity, health insurance coverage and willingness to pay for an effective food allergy treatment. Relevant to this report, mean past year cost of special food (adjusted for demographic characteristics) incurred by the families with a food- allergic child was as follows (2010 prices): Table 2: Adjusted mean past year cost of 'special food' for families with food -allergic children by race/ethnicity, from Bilaver et al. (2016) Race/ethnicity past year cost of 'special food' for families with food -allergic children by household income, from Bilaver et al. (2016) Household income Total special food costs <$50,000: $744 $50,000 -99,000: $941 >$100,000: $1,545 Using of 1,643 US caregivers of a food- allergic child, Gupta et al. (2013) looked at the direct medical, out -of-pocket, lost labour productivity, and related opportunity costs due to the child's food allergy. Relevant to this section, the annual cost per child for special diets and allergen- free foods was $285. Another study (Cerecedo et al., 2014), which utilised a prospective longitudinal cost analysis design, was conducted in Spain and Poland with 42 patients with food allergies (31 of these were child ren). The study looked at the impacts of a double- blind placebo- controlled food 12 challenge (DBPCFC), a test considered the gold standard for diagnosing food allergies, on the socioeconomic cost of food allergy. Patients (or parents of patients) completed a questionnaire six months before and six months after the DBPCFC. After the food challenge, patients with negative challenge results reintroduced the food into their diet. The difference in the median total annual direct cost (food, health care, medication, costs of living, leisure activities) from baseline to six months was +813.1 international dollars1 for the allergic group and -87.3 international dollars for the tolerant group (a statistically significant difference). This was driven by the increase in food costs: six months post -challenge, individuals with confirmed diagnoses of food allergies experienced a median increase in food costs equivalent to 1,257.3 international dollars annually, versus baseline (ie. six months before the food challenge), comp ared to a zero median change for the allergy -negative group. Note that change in food costs , a component of the direct cost calculation, is higher than the direct cost change, implying cost savings in other components of the direct cost calculation: leisur e activities, medication, healthcare, etc. The difference in the total annual indirect cost (health care, time spent on household tasks, loss of leisure time, time spent on information seeking) was not significantly different between the groups (allergic group: median -32.8 vs. tolerant group: median - 538.3 international dollars). Finally, a US study conducted by Howell (2018) used an online survey with 27 respondents who had been diagnosed with coeliac disease or were caring for someone with coeliac disease to compare the experiences of those living in urban (n = 9) and rural (n = 18) areas. When asked about the additional monthly cost of their specialty diet, participants' estimates varied. One urban and 3 rural participants said between $1 and $100, 4 urban and 6 rural participants said between $100 and $200, 1 urban and 3 rural participants said between $200 and $300, 2 urban and 1 rural participant said between $300 and $400 and 1 urban and 4 rural participants said between $400 and $500. It is diffic ult to infer very much from these findings, however, given the small sample size. 1 Geary -Khamis dollar, equivalent to the purchasing power in a given country of 1 US dollar in the US. This paper used 2007 prices. 13 Non-food costs of FHS Across the reviewed studies, participants talked about a range of different types of costs associated with their own FHS or their child's FHS. These ar e summarised below under appropriate headings. Lost productivity Studies with caregivers of children with FHS found that the child's FHS was often associated with changes in parents' working hours, lost productivity or job- related opportunity costs ( eg. Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2019; Chooniedass et al., 2020; DunnGalvin et al., 2020a; Gupta et al., 2013). For example, a cross -sectional survey (Gupta et al., 2013) conducted with a representative sample of 1,643 US caregivers of a chil d with a food allergy found that 9.1% of the caregivers reported a job- related opportunity cost. This was due to the need to change jobs, losing a job, having to give up a job or being restricted in career choices due to the child's food allergy. By assessing the hours of work lost and multiplying this by the mean hourly wage rate, the annual opportunity cost due to forgone labour market activities was estimated to be $2,399 per child (2011 prices). In a cross -European study on peanut allergy (DunnGalvin et al., 2020a), which utilised semi - structured interviews conducted with children, teenagers and caregivers of a peanut allergic child, a quarter of the caregivers (out of a total of 44) reported that they had to take time off work to supervise their childr en on school trips, appointments or other activities, and a quarter had to reduce their working hours, with some feeling that this negatively affected their career progression. A Canadian study (Chooniedass et al., 2020), which utilised focus groups with 40 parents of a child with food allergy, also reported negative impacts on the families' finances due to changes in caregivers' work schedules. Some caregivers needed flexible jobs to be able to be present for school activities, others reported missing wor k in order to accompany their child to events or appointments and others decided to leave their job completely in order to home- school their child. 14 Yet another study (Ferretti, Branchi, Dell'Osso, Conte, & Elli, 2017) conducted in Italy with 55 caregivers of a child with coeliac disease , who were administered self -report questionnaires, found that despite the diagnosis resulting in a higher burden on the family, social and economic domains, the caregivers' working habits were minimally affected. Time spen t on food shopping and food preparation The amount of time needed for food shopping, food preparation and planning for food shopping was reported in multiple studies as a major burden on person living with FHS s as well as parents of children with FHS (Asth ma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2019; Bilaver et al., 2016; Broome, Vetander, Wickman, & Lauritzen, 2014). The following bullet points illustrates the burden involved in shopping for and preparing allergy -safe food: Time spent on: Planning for food shopping: Preparing two different menus; one for the child with FH, one for the rest of the family Calling manufacturers to ensure the food is safe Learning about the food allergy and suitable food products Shopping: Having to visit multiple shops due to low availability of allergen- free food products Travelling to speciality food stores Travelling quite far to buy safe food (depending on where they live) Reading food labels (some people read all the labels every single time, because ingredients can change) Preparing food: Cooking from scratch to ensure adequate nutrition The studies reporting the above results were conducted in Europe (UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden), US, Canada and New Zealand and utilised cross -sectional self -report surveys, interviews and focus groups to collect data from adults with FHS and parents of children with FHS. 15 Eating out and socialising A lot of studies conducted with adults and adolescents with FHS, and also parents of children with FHS, reported that eating out with food allergies can be a challenge and is often avoided, which then limits the opportunities for social interactions (Abrams, Kim, Gerdts, & Protudjer, 2020; Abrams, van Nunen, & Campbell, 2015; Asthma and Allergy Foundation of Amer ica, 2019; Barnett et al., 2017; Barnett, Vasileiou, & Lucas, MacKenzie, Roberts, van Laar, 2010; 2017; et Peters et al., 2020; Sommer et al., 2012; Sommer, MacKenzie, Venter, & Dean, 2014; Neil, 2012; Stjerna et al., 2014; V oordouw et al., 2016). Eating out and socialising were often interlinked in the reviewed studies and this is well captured by one of the studies, which showed that \"managing a [food allergy] outside the home involves dilemmas of managing health and social risks\" (Barnett et al., 2020, p.7). Although assessing psychological/quality of life burdens of FHS is beyond the scope of this study, we summarise the results on the burden associated with eating out and socialising reported across the studies we included, which were largely similar: Burden associated with eating out and socialising: Difficulties eating out : No spontaneous decisions to eat out Some participants reported not eating out at all Bringing home- made food for their child when they are eating out Bringing own food to social events Avoiding certain restaurants Feeling restricted/limited in choosing where to eat out Always eating in the same restaurants that one knows are safe Always ordering the same thing that one knows is safe Difficulties finding safe foods when eating away from home Researching restaurants and their menus before leaving house Contacting the restaurants beforehand to enquire about allergen information Always asking restaurant staff about allergen information 16 Having to take risks by eating foods that may contain allergens or having to go hungry/not eat Feeling like a difficult customer when having to explain about food allergies to restaurant staff Feelings of fear and worry due to the risk of cross -contamination Being worried about having a reaction when eating out. Restricted social life : Some parents do not allow their child to go to parties, others do not allow the child to go by themselves Caregivers having to contact the host of a social event to enquire about food and make them aware of their child's allergy Children being excluded from age- appropriate activities (camps, sleepovers, school trips, birthday parties), because other parents do not want to take on the responsibility Extra planning needed for special events/activities Avoiding social events Not joining activities that involve food Feeling anxious or stressed out when participating in social occasions involving food, some also felt worried during occasions not involving food Feeling isolated and excluded from social activities Feeling limited when planning social activities Not having people over for meals and gatherings meant a loss of friends for some The studies summarised in the table above used surveys, interviews and focus groups to collect data. They were conducted in several European countries, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Of interest for the scope of this study, i.e. for cost implications, are two studies (Benson, Albakri, & Windle, 2019; NatCen Social Rese arch, 2017), which utilised data from waves 1 -5 of the Food and You survey, a cross -sectional survey of adults living in private households in the UK. The studies compared people living with FHS and people without and found no significant differences betwe en the two groups on how frequently they eat outside of home. 17 Travelling Travelling has also been identified as an area of difficulty by individuals with FHS in the reviewed studies (Bilaver et al, 2016; Brome al., 2015; Komulainen, 2010; Peters et al. 2020; Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2019; DunnGalvin et al., 2020a; Abrams et al., 2020). The below studies were conducted in several European countries, the US and Canada. They used surveys and interviews and found that : Family's vacation ch oices can be restricted due to a child's food allergy (Bilaver et al., 2016; Komulainen, 2010) Some individuals do not travel very much due to their FH, which means they see their family less (Brome et al., 2015) Sourcing safe food can be challenging when travelling ( Peters et al., 2020) Travel needs to be planned ahead and families are usually self -sufficient (eg. they bring their own appliances on holidays) (Abrams et al., 2020) Some families had to cancel or alter their vacation plans due to their child's food al-lergy ( Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2019) Travelling means packing the emergency kit, checking expiration dates on medica-tions, preparing food and determining the distance of the destination to the nearest hospital beforehand (DunnGalvin et al., 2020a) Health and Wellbeing A large number of studies looked at the health and wellbeing of indivi duals with FHS, particularly quality of life (Abrams et al., 2020; Alanne 2012b; Allen et al., 2015; Barnett et et al., & al., 2010; Voordouw et al., 2012; Wai et al., 2019). As with other non- cost-related burdens, this is out of the scope of this study, but the following provides a s ummary of the findings from the papers we included: Health and wellbeing burden associated with FHS: Compared to healthy controls, people living with FHS s (or caregivers of people living with FHSs) report: 18 Lower overall wellbeing Lower overall health stat us Lower health- related quality of life Higher levels of anxiety and depression Higher levels of stress More nutritional concerns People living with FHS s or their caregivers also reported: Negative emotional impact of the FH, particularly around the diagnosis time Feeling anxious (for example, about whether food is safe to eat, at social occasions in-volving food, about leaving child in others' care) Concerns about nutritional adequacy of allergen- free food and one's health in general Feeling overwhelmed and alone, isolated, stigmatised, or even defective Feeling sadness, stigma, fear, worry, frustration, uncertainty, annoyance, stress, embar-rassment Being constantly alert Being bullied or made feel different in a negative way because of FH Questioning own parental competency Low relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction The above studies utilised data from survey questionnaires, linked secondary datasets, interviews, focus groups and daily diaries and were conducted across Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Other studies reported demographic differences in the health and wellbeing of individuals with FHS. For example, caregivers with lower educational levels and those who were unemployed had higher levels of stress com pared to those with higher education levels and those who were employed (Ferretti et al., 2017); caregivers who were single, divorced or widowed had lower quality of life compared to those who were married or cohabiting and those who were employed had bett er quality of life compared those who were unemployed (Knibb & Stalker, 2013); lower income families had lower quality of life compared to higher income families (Howe, Franxman, Teich, & Greenhawt, 2014; Violato & Gray, 2019); quality of life worsens with age (Miller et al., 2020); and mothers report greater psychological 19 empowerment to care for their child's food allergy than fathers, but they also report lower quality of life (Warren et al., 2015). Another study worth mentioning separately was conducted with 1,234 parents of US children with food allergies, who completed an online survey. Parents reported major impacts on their own mental, social and emotional wellbeing and 31% of them reported seeing a mental health professional in relation to their chi ld's food allergy (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 2019). An interview study conducted in Canada with 13 low -income adults with food allergies and ten key informants who work with low -income families in the context of food allergies, found that individuals who rely on food banks report feeling stressed due to the difficulty of obtaining allergen- free foods, as food banks in Canada do not substitute the allergen food, but instead simply remove it from the hamper. These participants also felt unsaf e at discount supermarkets, compared to regular supermarkets, due to perceived higher risks of cross - contamination in the former (Minaker, Elliott, & Clarke, 2014a; Minaker, Elliott, & Clarke, 2014b). Another survey study (Shah et al., 2014) conducted in the US with 341 individuals with coeliac disease and a comparison group of 368 non- coeliac disease patients with other conditions (gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure, end- stage renal disease (ESRD)), found that compared to the other conditions, coeliac disease patients rated their health status higher than any other group (mean score of 81.61 out of 100, using a Visual Analogue Scale), and their perceived treatment burden was higher than that of patients with hypertension and GERD and comparable to those with ESRD (mean score of 44.9 points on the Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 represented very easy and 100 very difficult). Other areas of dif ficulty Studies have also mentioned other areas of difficulties, such as having to make certain home adjustments due to the FH, such as completely eliminating allergens from one's home (Brome et al., 2015), or having a dedicated work surface in the kitchen where allergen food can be prepared for other members of the family (Abrams, Simons et al., 2020). One study 20 also mentioned that a child with FHS has their own glass and plate at the nursery (Stejrna et al., 2014). Childcare issues have also been highlig hted as an area of difficulty, for example, a denial of childcare provision due to child's food allergy (Minaker et al., 2014b) or the high costs of childcare due to safety issues and liability (Brome et al., 2015). Yet another study reported that compare d to healthy controls, individuals with FHS were more likely to have experienced a break down in their relationship or they have delayed having children/expanding their family (Voordouw et al., 2016). Combined Costs of FHS Several reviewed studies presented the costs of FHS as a total figure, combining different areas of cost (including food, healthcare and other out -of-pocket costs). These studies are presented below individually, as they all calculated the total costs in different ways: A question naire survey study (Protudjer et al., 2015) conducted in Sweden with parents of 226 children (aged 0- 12 years) and adolescents (aged 13- 17 years; 84 allergic children and 60 allergic adolescents; 94 control children and 56 control adolescents) looked at the differences between cases and controls in terms of total annual household cost. This was the sum of annual direct (costs related to living, consulting, medications, health insurance, travel to visit child/adolescent in hospital or to visit health care pr ofessionals) and indirect (costs related to losses of time and productivity and opportunity costs) costs. The results showed that the total household costs were significantly higher for cases than controls, both in children (higher by EUR3,961) and in adol escents (higher by EUR4,795). Overall direct annual household costs were significantly higher in cases than controls in children (higher by EUR2,085), but not adolescents. In terms of overall indirect costs, these were significantly higher in cases than controls in children (higher by EUR1,876), but not in ado- lescents. (2014 prices.) Another questionnaire study (Jansson et al., 2014) conducted in Sweden with 81 adults with food allergies and 85 age and sex matched controls looked at the differences in household costs between the two groups. Total annual household cost included the sum of direct costs (medical treatment, drugs, travel, help with domestic duties, food, leisure activities) and indirect costs (lost hours owing to healthcare visits, hospitalizati on, grocery shopping, food allergy information seeking, lost productivity and opportunity costs) and it 21 was found to be significantly higher for cases than controls (by EUR8,164 per annum ). This difference was largely due to the indirect costs (higher in c ases by EUR6,424 per an- num), as the direct costs did not differ significantly between cases and controls. A US study (Bilaver et al., 2016) analysing secondary survey data collected from a repre- sentative sample of 1,643 caregivers of food allergic children looked at the direct medical and out -of-pocket costs borne by families with food allergic children, separately for differ- ent racial and income groups in the US . Relevant to this section of the review were the out-of-pocket costs, which included health care- related items (co- payments, travel ex- penses), medication, counselling and mental health services, legal guidance, school, camp, childcare and special food (the cost of special food was reported in the food costs section). The results are presented in the table below. It should be noted, however, that the differences between the groups were not statistically significant (although low non-white sample size may have been a factor, the sample was 74% white). (2010 prices.) Table 4: Costs by race/eth nicity and by household income from Bilaver et al. (2016) (n=1,643) Race/ethnicity: Total out -of- pocket costs Total mental health and legal costs Total school, camp and childcare costs -of- pocket costs Total mental health and legal costs Total school, camp and childcare (Voordouw et al., 2010) using survey methodology, conducted in the Netherlands and UK, compared the household costs of families with a food allergic member (126 respondent s) and families without food allergies (64 respondents). Direct costs included travel costs for medical treatment, expenditure on food, holiday expenses, additional equipment required to prepare safe meals and domestic help. Indirect costs included time lost, lost productivity and opportunity costs, including time spent obtaining health care, shopping for safe foods, lost leisure time and time spent on searching for more information about food allergy. The results showed that the total direct cost for households with food allergic members was not significantly different from the cost for households without food allergic members, but the former incurred a significantly higher indirect cost (by EUR2,758 per annum ). Total costs value of time spent on food shopping and preparing food, time spent visiting household members in the hospital and time spent with all health professionals were not significantly different between cases and controls. The following table shows the breakdown of indirect costs (incremental) that were significantly different between cases and controls (note that this does not add up to the total as only statistically significant differences are included in the table below): Table 5: Costs from Voordouw et al. (2010) (n=126 families with a food allergic individual, n=64 without) Total costs value of... Incremental cost per annum ... lost time being unable to perform domestic tasks due to sick household member EUR2,199 ... seeking information on food allergy EUR122 ... lost earnings EUR458 Another survey study (Wai et al., 2019) conducted in Sweden compared the direct and in- direct hous ehold costs between 70 parents of a food allergic child and 70 parents of age and sex matched controls. Direct costs included medical -related costs (eg. co- payments), food expenses, including food preparation, transportation and lost wages due to healthcar e visits. Indirect costs included the caregivers' productivity and opportunity losses due to their child's food allergy. It was found that total annual household costs did not differ between the two groups. However, total direct household costs were signif icantly 23 higher in cases than controls (by EUR285.82), but there were no significant differences in the total indirect household costs (in terms of the cost of time losses). (2018 prices.) Finally, a survey study (Voordouw et al., 2016) conducted in Netherl ands, Poland and Spain with 584 individuals with FHS (or their parents) and 974 healthy controls, compared the direct and indirect costs associated with FHS in the two groups. The direct costs in- cluded medical treatment not covered by insurance, travel to obtain medical treatment, medication, cost of health insurance and costs of living (incl. food, holidays, leisure activi- ties, equipment required to prepare safe meals, domestic help). Indirect cost included lost working days, loss of education or working o pportunities, lost earnings, lost human capital, time spent searching for health- related issues and time spent obtaining medical treatment. The results showed that across countries, the average direct and indirect costs for house- holds with FHS individuals are not higher than those of households without FHS individu-als. FH-related Review Studies We included in our search reviews that looked at the financial or economic burden of living with food hypersensitivities. Bilaver et al (2019) reviewed studies on the economic burden of food allergy. Eleven studies were included. Four of these studies were from the EuroPrevall project (a multinational initiative to understand the impacts of food allergy) using a specifically developed questionnaire for assessing household- level economic burden. The remaining papers either used direct questionnaires or analysis from existing surveys to calculate cost. They reported on direct medical costs (out of scope for this study), out -of-pocket costs (medical and non- medical), and opportunity costs (loss of potential earnings and potentially loss of leisure or household production time). Out-of-pocket costs per annum averaged $1,874 across two studies looking at individual costs, $3,339 across four studies lo oking at household costs and $1,405 per child in one study looking at a broad range of costs incurred as a result of food allergy. Cost categories included visits to physician or Emergency Department (including co- payments); travel (for visits); cost of li ving (food, equipment, domestic help); medications; diet and food; health insurance and childcare, schools, camps and/or counselling. According to the authors, the \"highest proportion of out -of-pocket costs stemmed from caregiver estimates of changes in 24 childcare, special schools or camps, and counselling because of allergy ($349.02 per patient) followed closely by the cost of special diets and allergen- free foods ($319.84).\" On opportunity costs, five studies had calculated estimates. Mean individual -level productivity lost was valued at $1,038 across three studies, and at the household- level was valued at $4,881 across three studies. Giving up jobs or choosing different jobs was the main component of this. Most of the studies valued lost household task time, and time spent information seeking, as well as lost work time. (2018 prices.) White et al. (2016) looked at the burdens of coeliac disease and the gluten- free diet, with specific focus on adolescents in studies worldwide . (They also considered factors associated with adherence and impact on health- related quality of life, beyond the scope of this study.) A Canadian study (n=3,408) reviewed suggest that 60% of participants had difficulty finding GF foods, 48% avoided restaurants and 25% avoided travelling. Another Canadian study (n=222) found that CD patients spent more time, energy, and money on food and food preparation as well as consumed more home -made meals. In looking at the economic burden, they covered a study from the USA compari ng cost and availability of foods in standard and gluten- free 'market baskets', reporting large variations in cost and availability by different supermarkets and an overall additional cost of 240%. A similar Canadian study found 242%, an Australian study also found the gluten- free healthy eating basket to be significantly more expensive than a gluten- containing equivalent. In the UK, one study identified ten wheat -based products and ten everyday products and found gluten- free versions to be available in only some places, and 76- 518% more expensive. Polk and Dinakar (2017) looked at patient -centered outcomes in food allergy for adults , which included a section on economic impact. They reported on one study of population- level costs in the US which found cos ts incurred by the family totalling $20.5 billion annually, including lost productivity ($0.77 billion relating to caregiver time off work for medical visits), out-of-pocket costs totalling $5.5 billion (31% based on the cost of special foods) and opportunity costs (leaving or changing jobs) totalling $14.2 billion. They also report that \"Allergy friendly foods on average cost two to four times more than food that contain common allergens and gluten\". 25 Mogul et al. (2017) looked at \"the unknown burden and c ost of celiac disease in the U.S.\" As well as looking at incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality and quality of life impact, they reviewed four studies that looked at the cost associated with coeliac disease (three from the US, one from the UK). Only one provided figures on non- medical costs, a US study which \"found that gluten- free products were consistently more costly, in some cases more than double the equivalent gluten- containing product\". Patel et al. (2017) looked at the emotional, social, and f inancial burden of food allergies on children and their families. In terms of financial impact, one study reported annual out -of- pocket costs incurred by families of $931 per child, including travel, medications, school changes, camps and allergen- free foo d. Looking at diets specifically they report that on average the annual cost of special diets and allergen friendly foods was $285 per child. Lost productivity was $130 per child with opportunity cost (cost related to forgone labour market activities) esti mated at $2,399 per child including restricted career choices and leaving a job. Mearns et al. (2018) reviewed literature on the economic burden of coeliac disease in North America and Europe. Although the majority of the study focused on medical costs, they also reviewed the cost of gluten- free foods and absenteeism and performance due to coeliac disease , Six studies examined the cost and availability of gluten- free foods, all finding they were significantly more expensive than gluten -containing equivalents. They included the studies from Canada and US reported in White et al (2016) above, as well as a study from Greece estimating the weekly economic burden ranging from EUR12 to EUR28 per person (2017 prices). They found three studies on absenteeism based on postal questionnaires, finding that diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease reduced absenteeism . Dyer et al (2020) looked at the cost of food allergy, considering - as well as medical costs - out-of-pocket costs (listing: allergen- free food products, medications, transportation costs, co- payments, deductibles and coinsurance) and reporting on a study that found the total burden in the US of $5.5 billion annually, as well as reporting the findings from Bilaver et al. (2019). On household level lost opportunity costs they note that \"the majority of food allergy - associated costs are borne by families themselves at the household level with the goal of preventing an unintentional ingestion\" and that these are significant across several studies reviewed. Again, they report findings from the Bilaver review. 26 Warren et al. (2020) looked at the epidemiology and burden of food allergy, with an economic burden section reviewing studies already mentioned above. Tarantino (2016) assessed the financial burden to households of allergies to staple foods (ie. hen's eggs, cow's milk and/or wheat). Two studies were found, both from Sweden. Both used the FA -ECOQ (Prevalence, Cost and Basis of Food Allergy ac ross Europe) to collect data on costs. The first (n=84 children; n=60 adolescents) found total additional household costs per annum (above the control group) of EUR8,164 (for adults, 2011 prices); the second (n=81 for households with allergies; n=85 for control groups) found cost differences per annum of EUR3,691 for children and EUR4,792 for adolescents (2011 prices). Dierick et al. (2020) looked at the burden and socioeconomics of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy in studies f rom all over the world. Relevant elements for this study were the indirect costs considered (absenteeism and presenteeism). They reported findings on absences from school and work for asthma and allergic rhinitis but not food allergies. Fedorak et al. (2012) looked at the impact of coeliac disease in Canada. On economic costs, they considered direct medical costs and costs of a gluten- free diet (as indirect costs), reporting figures discussed above (in White et al. 2016). Studies of cost/burden in other chronic conditions and disabilities Our search looked for studies in comparable areas to food hypersensitivities, such as other chronic conditions and disabilities, that had a focus on estimating the economic or financial burden of those conditions. As establishing health costs is out of scope for this study, we have excluded studies that focused only on this. At full text stage, we also excluded studies that estimated costs using U.S. insurance claims data, as this does not translate usefully to a UK context. Our focus for these papers was the methods used to generate an estimate, rather than the results per se, and so this section focuses on those. 27 The vast majority of studies were 'economic burden of disease' type studies that generally considered three categories: the direct costs of the condition, the quality of life impact of the condition and the indirect costs of the condition. Direct costs usually encompass healthcare/medical costs, although sometimes direct non- medical costs were included, such as travel, equipment or diet costs. These latter costs are in scope for our study. Indirect costs are generally defined as productivity impact although direct non- medical costs are sometimes included here, as ar e other non- financial elements such as informal caregiver time. Intangible costs relate to quality of life impacts and are out of scope for this study. Many of the studies covered used existing national databases or panel surveys (ie. representative longi tudinal studies of a population) to gather data, sometimes including regression analysis or similar forms of analysis to assess cost by disability/illness: Gaskin (2012), who assessed the economic costs of pain in the US through existing panel data, using the 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to assess time missed from work due to pain conditions and using hourly wages to value this. They gathered information on days missed and on hours missed in order to capture sick days used and reductions in working hours Guy et al. (2017) also use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to assess the preva-lence and economic effect of chronic conditions among survivors of cancer in the US . The relevant elements to this study they include were productivity loss calculat ed from employment disability, missed workdays and additional days spent in bed. Lost house-hold productivity was measured based on the number of additional missed, other than work/school, in which at least half a day was spent in bed due to illness or injury. Productivity loss was valued using median US wages. Gupte- Singh et al. (2017) also used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in their study on the economic burden of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder among paedi- atric patients in the US. By cross -referencing children's missed school days with aver- age US wages, they calculated loss of productive days to parents Chevreul et al. (2013), who assessed the cost of stroke in France based on national databases and work from existing studies on the proport ion of working- age stroke sur- vivors in work 28 Cloutier et al. (2015), assessing the societal costs of bipolar I disorder in the US, used existing literature and governmental publications to assess indirect costs, covering productivity loss from unemployment, reduced productivity at work, productivity loss from premature mortality and caregiving costs. (This drew largely on an existing em-ployment -to-population ratio for individuals with BDI.) Costs were estimated using the human capital approach (ie. valuing l ost productivity by its wage value) Ghosh (2013) estimated the economic wellbeing of families with more than one child with disabilities, in the US. They used the Survey of Income and Program Participation which contains measures on disabilities, material hardship and income poverty Campbell et al. (2013) looked at the burden of multiple sclerosis in the US, using na-tionally representative dat a from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to estimate di- rect costs, indirect costs in terms of wage losses and abs ences, and health- related quality of life Leigh (2011) combined a variety of primary and secondary sources to estimate the na- tional costs of occupational injury and illness among civilians in the US. US datasets on work -related injury and illness were used to estimate current and future lost earn- ings, fringe benefits and home production (ie. unpaid house and care work), valuing these based on estimates in the literature Cullinian et al. (2011), assessed the extra cost of living for people with disabilities in Ireland by comparing income, disposable income/standard of living metrics and disa- bility from a longitudinal study. This was intended to provide a top- down overall esti- mate of the cost of disability. Dall et al. (2010) assessed the economic burden of di abetes in the US, combining multiple sources into a model. The indirect cost element captured was productivity, measured through information from the National Health Interview Survey on workdays lost per year Popova et al. (2015) looked at the economic bur den of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disor- der (FASD) in Canada, using existing literature on the work impacts of FASD due to morbidity and mortality and cross -referencing this with employment and wage data from Statistics Canada Jhaveri et al. (2019) conducting a cross- sectional study using data from the US's Na- tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess the economic burden of noc-turia. They used measures for weekly hours worked and employment, cross -refer- enced with average US wages, to calculate productivity loss 29 Wittenborn et al. (2013) looked at the economic burden of vision loss and eye disor- ders among the US population younger than 40. They included cost of lost productivity using data from the US Survey of Income and Program Participation and used pub- lished estimates to assess costs of informal care, low vision aids, special education, school screening, government spending and transfer payments. Some studies used direct surveys, interviews or cost diaries: Einfeld et al. (2010) looked at the costs of caring for children with intellectual disabili-ties in Australia through a modified version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) adm inistered to parents or carers, covering costs including speech therapy, special education needs, certain food, home adaptations and loss of income, and cross- referencing these with the level of disability . The CSRI itself is \"a research in- strument developed ... to collect information on service utilisation, income, accommo-dation and other cost -related variables.\" Dean et al. (2019), looking at the cost differences between US breast cancer survivors with or without lymphedema, used 12- monthly cost diaries based on the Goossens' cost diary to collect out -of-pocket expenditure and lost productivity. As well as health costs, this included elements such as wellness resources (eg. gym membership), transportation, nutritional supplements. Productivity elements were collected through questions on number of days in which participants couldn't carry out usual activities and/or needed help (including payments for domestic assistance). This was valued us- ing median wages. Souliotis et al. (2017) looked at the annual direct and indirect costs of adults with asthma in Greece through a questionnaire administered to physicians, asking about caregiver time and work loss days due to sick leave prescribed by the physician Gimenez et al. (2 014), assessing the economic burden of myelofibrosis in Spain, pro- duced a questionnaire which included questions on limitations on daily activities and the consequence implications for productivity and the need for formal care Yang et al (2020) estimated t he current and future economic burden of Parkinson's disease in the US. The relevant elements from the scope of this study were indirect and non- medical costs of Parkinson's disease, eg. cost of hiring professional non- medical caregivers, home modification costs and increased transportation costs, as- sessed through a primary survey. 30 One study, Etchegary et al. (2015) was a qualitative inquiry into the perceived economic burden associated with an inherited cardiac condition, carried out in Canada. Through se mi- structured interviews, the authors identified themes of financial burden: economic deprivation during childhood due to death of a parent, impact on career choices and the types of work that can be done, impact on disposable income due to illness and tra vel for appointments, impact on attainability and affordability of insurance. Some participants reported no economic burden, however. We also looked at reviews covering this topic: Stabile (2012) looked at literature across the world on the costs of childhood disability, covering indirect costs in terms of productivity impacts and receipt of benefits, col- lected directly through surveys or using panel data. Deb et al. (2017) reviewed literature looking at the cost of managing Alzheimer's dis- ease and related dementias in the US, and included indirect costs in terms of informal caregiving, productivity loss (and productivity loss for informal carers). This was scarce but where available measured in terms of hours per month and valued based on the replacement c ost of hiring paid formal care or the opportunity cost of lost wages. Sexton et al. (2015) looked at the epidemiology, treatment, psychosocial impact and economic burden of the co- occurrence of Reading Disorder and ADHD in studies around the world. Only on e study reviewed looked at the economic burden: parents of participating children completed a questionnaire including time lost from work for par- ents and hours of extra school assistance Two studies: Shaughnessy et al. (2017) and Skaer (2014) were not syst ematic re- views but summaries of evidence, discussing the economic cost of mental diseases in the US and fibromyalgia in studies worldwide , respectively. Both found several studies reporting productivity losses and Shaughnessy found evidence of in -work productivity losses (which, unlike absenteeism and job loss, is rarely quantified). Salas (2012) looked at the burden of restless legs syndrome in the US , and found two papers that reported a productivity impact, covering both work absence and presen-teeism (re duced productivity at work due to illness) Mitra et al. (2017) examined the literature on extra costs of living with a disability in studies on a global scale, in a systematized (not systematic) review. They found a va- riety of methods being used: asking di rectly about goods and services used (ie. spend- ing); asking about goods and services required (what's needed to perform tasks the 31 individual currently can't do); and the expenditure equivalence/Standard of Living ap- proach, which looks at how much extra inc ome would be required to match wellbeing to someone without the disability and the same income (this can be done by measur-ing income and then a proxy measure for standard of living, such as asset ownership). Eight papers in the review use the Standard of Living approach, six provide descriptive analysis, five use multivariate regression analysis and two mixed methods based on qualitative and survey data. Coyne et al. (2014) reviewed studies on the economic burden of urgency urinary in-continence (UUI) in the US. One included study measured work productivity impact using data from an existing study, another looked at direct non- medical costs (eg. pads, diapers, laundry and dry cleaning) through the use of a direct survey, asking about cost per week. Rehman et al. (2018) produced a systematic review on the economic burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the US, Europe, and Asia. In terms of indirect cost, they found that six studies estimated work production loss due to sick days and early ret irement, using the human capital approach (valuation using wages) and the friction cost method (valuation using wages only for an adaption period based on the notion that the job will be replaced) Patel et al (2014) specifically looked at indirect costs as they relate to COPD in the US, with a focus on the burden to employers and to individuals. They found eleven rel- evant studies: eight were survey -based and three were retrospective analyses using claims data. Outcomes included were: prevalence of workforce participation, annual days of absenteeism and presenteeism, activity limitation, bed days, short -term and long- term disability, and the associated costs to the individual, employer and/or soci- ety. The study that measured presenteeism through a survey used the World Health Organization's Health and Work Performance Questionnaire to assess performance at work. One study included home production in its costs. Shields and Beard (2015) looked at the economic and humanistic burden of gout in studies worldwide. O nly three of the thirteen studies examined looked at indirect costs: these looked at work days lost, social days lost, sick leave days, short -term disability costs and days of work disability. Alleman et al (2015) looked at the humanistic and economic burden of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (a complication of diabetes) in Europe. Non -medical economic burden was reported in two studies, one looking simply at how many people reported 32 disruption/productivity impacts at work, one providing a monetised value based on ab- senteeism and presenteeism. Blaiss (2010) looked at the direct and indirect costs of allergic rhinitis. They look at di-rect medical costs (including highlighting what they describe as \"hidden\" direct costs, based on other medical conditions brought about by the index condition, eg. sinusitis) and indirect costs, covering income lost due to missed work, decreased productivity, missed school time and unpaid caregiver time. They looked at a 2006 US study called Allergies in America which recorded the proportions who had missed work and asked participants to self -rate their productivity. Several employer based studies also found productivity impacts. Statistics on F ood Consumption We also looked at existing statistics on food consumption in the UK, which could be used in lieu of a control group to compare against the amount paid by individuals with food hypersensitivities. The main source for food spend data is the Office for National Statistics' Living Costs and Food Survey, and some additional potentially useful information is provided in the FSA's Food and You Survey.

FSA Food and You Wave 4 The Food and You consumer survey is administered by the FSA and is intended to collect information on \"the public's reported behaviours, attitudes and knowledge relating to food safety and food issues.\" In the latest release of the data (Wave 4), relevant data for this study can be found in chapter 1 (covering shopping, cooking and eating) and chapter 3 (covering eating out). Data that may be of use for this research includes statis tics on the prevalence of food reactions (including diagnosed and not), information on where households shop (eg. large supermarket, mini supermarket, independent shops, home delivery), and frequency of eating out (and type, eg. restaurant, fast food, pub) . This data is broken down by age group, country, household size, whether there are children in the household (under 16, under 6), work status, household income status and marital status. 35 References Abrams, E.

These were as follows: 1. What are the costs incurred by people living with a food hypersensitivity? 2. What are the burdens of living with a food hypersensit ivity more generally? 3. What research has been done in related areas on price differentials/representa-tive 'baskets of goods' between groups? 4. What statistics are available on food consumption patterns and costs among groups? For people with FH, Question 1 w as focused on food consumption costs and other financial costs (for example, equipment, prescriptions, travel costs, education/ training); question 2 was much broader and could include changes to behaviours or consumption patterns, like shopping and eating out, as well as time spent due to hypersensitivities (for example, time spent reading labels or travelling to appointments), which can be quantified as econo mic costs. This allows us to pick up studies that have quantified the burden of FHS in monet ary terms and studies that identify and measure the burden in a way that could lead to quantification, to understand the burdens in monetary terms . These questions were taken together, and results are presented by food cost and non- food cost. For question 3 we focused on looking at studies that measured the cost or burden of other chronic conditions or disabilities, summarising the methods they used found here and looking specifically for any findings on price differentials or representative baskets of goods. For question 4 we looked for information from the UK on general food consumption costs that could be used to compare costs for people with FHS against. Evidence assessment methodology We reviewed the following four sources of evidence: 1. Research and lit erature recommended to us by the FSA team and our expert advisors 46 2. Relevant literature databases 3. Grey literature 4. Relevant statistics on food consumption patterns The idea behind first reviewing the recommended research and literature was to provide us with the most relevant background knowledge and to help us formulate our search strategy for the systematic search of the published literature in the next step. Scope The scope was defined by the research questions, although we also restricted our search to studies published in 2010 or later (including reviews of earlier studies), in the English language and focused on OECD countries. Studies focused only on cost of illness were deemed out of scope, as these will be covered by the other projects commis sioned by the FSA. Search strategy We conducted two database searches. The first was a focused search of the following literature databases: Pubmed, NHS Evidence, HMIC, Embase, Cinahl, Emcare, Medline. terms varied across the databases, but inc luded a variation of the following: food hypersensitivity AND burden food hypersensitivity AND cost food hypersensitivity (economic or financial or management) food allergy AND burden food allergy AND cost food allergy (economic or financial or management) coeliac disease AND burden coeliac disease AND cost food allergy (economic or financial or management) food intolerance and burden food intolerance and cost food intolerance (economic or financial or management) 47 This search was focused on research questions 1 and 2 and yielded approximately 2,000 results. These were then reduced by de- duplication and looking for items that answered aspects of the research questions. After an initial screen by library services we were provided with 169 abstr acts. We then conducted a second, broader search in Google Scholar for the first three research questions. This focused on evidence on cost or burden for food hypersensitivities but also on evidence on cost or burden for chronic conditions, chronic diseas e and disabilities. After an initial screen by library services this search yielded 265 abstracts (42 of these were duplicates of abstracts retrieved in the first search). Additionally, we searched grey literature for relevant unpublished articles. This i ncluded grey literature databases, such as Open Grey, but also websites of relevant charities, such as Anaphylaxis Campaign, Allergy UK or Coeliac UK. Google searches were also conducted, focusing on original unpublished research in the area of food hypers ensitivities. Research question 4, searching for statistics on food consumption, was primarily conducted through specific Google searches. The whole literature searching was conducted between August and September 2020. Study selection Studies included in the review were selected based on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria References the costs of living with a food hypersensitivity (beyond the cost of illness) OR References the impact of a food hypersensitivity on a day -to-day life OR References the cost, price differentials or 'based of goods' for food hypersensitivity or a different chronic condition/disability OR Contains statistics on general food consumption patterns and costs 48 Exclusion criteria Not in English language Published/Released prior to 2010 Conducted in a non- OECD country Does not meet any of the inclusion criteria above Initially, we applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria to the abstracts (where available) of the retrieved studies. At this stage, studies that clearly did not meet any of the inclusion criteria and met at least one of the exclusion criteria, were excluded. Studies that met the inclusion criteria, or those where a decision could not be made based on the abstract alone, were selected f or the next stage, which involved full text review of the retrieved studies. At this stage, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the full texts and the results are summarised in Figure 1 below. The total number of included studies was 107. References are included in the Annex, and detail on the papers screened and included at each stage is provided in the diagram below. 49 Figure 1 : Study Selection In the first stage there were 165 records identified through database searching and 232 addit ional records identified through other sources. Next, duplicates were removed leaving 397 rec ords, which were further screened and an additional 188 were excluded. The eligibility of remaining records was checked, whereby 209 full -text articles were assess ed and 102 were excluded with reasons. Overall 107 studies were included in review. 50 Data extraction and synthesis During the full text review of the retrieved studies, once it was decided that a study met the inclusion criteria, we looked for the following information, which we extracted to later summarise for this report: Study information (title, authors, year of publication/release) Country of origin Aims Methods Appendix 3: Interview Topic Guide RSM have been commissioned by the FSA to look at the fin ancial cost of living with a food hypersensitivity. We are considering both food costs and non- food costs, among them direct costs like supplements and medication; indirect costs like travel and lost income, and non- financial costs like time spent reading labels. This will feed into a wider piece of work they are doing on the cost of illness due to FH and the impact on quality of life. The aim of this interview is to understand the costs you face as an FH sufferer/parent of a child with FH and to test some of the questions that we will be using in our survey that will go out to a wider group of FH sufferers 2/parents of children with FH. Please let us know if there are any questions you think don't make sense, or any questions you think w e should be asking, but haven't. Note that all will be anonymised & that respondents only need answer questions they're comfortable with. Background information 1. Which of the following groups do you fall into?

Introduction RSM have been commissioned by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to calculate the financial cost of living with a food hypersensitivity (food intolerance, food allergy or co eliac disease). In this survey, we are seeking to understand both food costs and non- food costs, among them direct costs like supplements and medication, indirect costs like travel and lost income, and non- financial costs like time spent reading labels. If you would prefer, you can fill out the survey in Welsh, Smart Survey in Welsh Os byddai'n well arolwg yn Gymraeg, dilynwc h y ddolen hon More information on this project and an accompanying project on the quality of life impacts is available on the Consumer research on living with a food hypersensitivity. The survey should take no longer than 20- 30 minutes to complete, and is completely voluntary. In line with GDPR, all responses will be kept anonymous and confidential. No identifiable data will be collected. For questions with text responses, please make sure that you do not provide any personally identifiable information (information that could be used to identify you or your household.) In accordance with new data protection laws and RSM data protection protocols, information we obtain will be stored on password protected computers. The data will be kept for a maximum of 30 days after the completion of this project (scheduled to finish in June 2021) and will then be destroyed by RSM. The collected data will be used to produce a statistical report to be published on the FSA website. We may use quotes from the survey in this report to support our findings and we will ensure they are not used in any way that might identify you. No other disaggregated (i.e. individual) information will be included. The survey is designed to explore your experiences of having a food hypersensitivity, and it is possible that you might recollect a stressful or challenging situation. There are national support groups that can help with questions about your condition, including Allergy UK (www.allergyuk.org), the Anaphylaxis Campaign (www.anaphylaxis.org) and Coeliac UK (coeliac.org.uk) Appendix 4: FHS Survey and Food Diary 60 If you have any questions about this research, please contact Katherine.Troeller@rsmuk.com. 55.

Appendix 5: Control Group Survey and Food Diary Food Hypersensitivity: a comparator survey amongst UK Grocery Shoppers Introduction The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has commissioned a study of UK grocery shoppers to un- derstand the financial cost of living with a food hypersensitivity (food intolerance, food allergy or coeliac disease). As part of this study, we want to gather views of respondents who DO 71 NOT suffer from food hypersensitivities to understand how to they compare to those of suffer- ers. Please note that If you DO suffer from a food hypersensitivity, you will not be able to take part in this survey. A separate survey is being conducted for people with food hypersensitivi-ties. The current survey is only for respondents who a) DO NOT suffer from food intolerances and b) have responsibility for grocery shopping in their household. This survey is being administered by BMG Research, an independent research agency. It takes on average 15 minutes to complete. All responses will be treated confidentially , and all results will be anonymised. BMG Re- search abides by the Market Research Society Code of Conduct and data protection laws at all times. If you would like to check that BMG is a genuine market research agency, you can do so by visiting the MRS website . The collected data will be used to produce a statistical report to be published on the FSA website. Further details about what we will do with the information collect ed can be found in our privacy notice .

Thank you very much f or your time. 84 Direct food costs Data There are three food consumption costs asked for in the survey which was used for analysis. They are: Food Diary Costs - weekly spend on food and beverage consumption broken down to a representative basket of goods Weekly Groceries Spend - weekly spend on any food and non- alcoholic beverages bought from a store/supermarket (excluded eating out/takeaway spend) Monthly Eating Out / Takeaway Spend - monthly spend on food and beverages bought from restaurants, cafes etc. This cost was converted into a weekly spend for the primary analysis to be consistent with the other two costs. There were a total of 1 225 observations for adults with FHS and 1530 observations for the adults without FHS . However, as it was not compulsory to complete the food diary costs sec- tion, only about 45.7% of respondents from group with FHS completed the food diary costs section, but 100% of respondents in the comparison group completed the food diary costs section. As the aim is to compare each FHS group ( FIO, CD, and FA ) with the non- FHS group, three datasets were created for the analysis: Dataset A: consisting of FIO versus non-FHS Dataset B: consisting of CD versus non-FHS Dataset C: consisting of FA versus non-FHS Also, there was a difference in total number of responses across the three outcome varia-bles. This difference stemmed from difference in number of outliers in each outcome variable (1 for weekly food diary costs, 4 outliers for weekly groceries costs, and 1 for monthly eating out / takeaway costs) and non- responses for food diary costs (116 non- responses for FIO , 319 for CD, and 214 for FA ). Thus, these three datasets were created for each outcome vari- able. This meant that there were 9 datasets in total, as listed below: Appendix 6: Statistical Methods 85 Weekly Food Diary Costs o Dataset 1: consisting of FIO and non- FHS (1648 observations) o Dataset 2: consisting of CD and non- FHS (1862 observations) o Dataset 3: consisting of FA and non- FHS (1656 observations) Weekly Groceries Costs o Data set 4: consisting of FIO and non- FHS (1764 observations) o Dataset 5: consisting of CD and non- FHS (2178 observations) o Dataset 6: consisting of FA and non- FHS (1869 observations) Monthly Eating Out / Takeaway Costs o Dataset 7: consisting of FIO and non- FHS (1 764 observations) Dataset 8: consisting of CD and non- FHS (2181 observations) o Dataset 9: consisting of FA and non- FHS (1869 observations) The methods listed below were implemented individually for each outcome and dataset. For example, propensity score mat ching, multiple imputation combined with missing indicator, and multivariate regression were performed on Dataset 1. This process was then repeated for the rest of the 8 datasets. Missing data There were 498/2755 missing data in total for the Household Income variable in the com- bined FHS Household Group Survey and the Control Household Group Survey. There were also missing data for a few other demographic variables such as education, gender, region, geography, age, and ethnicity; however, those constitute only 0.0 8%-3.60% of missing data. The specific level of missingness for each variable can be found in the table below . Table 1: Level of missing data for each variable from both FHS (n = 1,225) and non- FHS household (n = 1,530) group survey conducted in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales between November 2020 and January 2021 Variables Level of missingness: FHS Household Group Survey Level of missingness: Control Household Group Survey Household 9/1225 (0.7%) None 86 The following paragraphs explain how the missing data was dealt with and why an extended Multiple Imputation (MI) method was chosen. Jakobsen et al (2017) 3 sets out guidelines for situations when MI can be used for handling missing data in randomised clinical trials. Similar considerations apply in non- randomised studies such as the current study. Adopting this framework, we rejected the Missing Com-pletely at Random (MCAR) 4 assumption because exploratory analysis showed that missing- ness was associated with observed variables. The 'mcar_test' function in R based on Little's (1988) 5 test statistic was used to assess if data is MCAR. Test output showed a low p- value (p < 0.001) and high Chi -squared statistic (55.7), which provided indication that the data is not MCAR. The MAR and MNAR conditions cannot be distinguished based on the observed data be- cause by definition the missing data are unknown and it can therefore not be assessed if the observed data can predict the unknown data (Jakobsen et al, 2017). We hypothesised that covariates such as household income and the outcome measures could be MNAR. When there is a relationship between the propensity of a variable to be missing and its values, the data are said to be Missing Not at Random (MNAR)6. Standard multiple imputation (MI) methods require the missing data mechanism to be MCAR or Missing at Random (MAR)7 and may fail when the data is MNAR. 3 Jakobsen, J.C., Gluud, C., Wetterslev, J. et al. When and how should multiple imputation be used for handling missing data in randomised clinical trials - a practical guide with flowcharts. BMC Med Res Methodol 17, 162 (2017). https://doi. org/10.1186/s12874- 017-0442-1 4 MCAR means that the probability of values being missing is similar across all cases 5 Little, R.J.A. (1988) A Test of Missing Completely at Random for Multivariate Data with Missing Values. Journal of the American Statisti cal Association, 83, 1198- 1202. http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1988.10478722 6 MNAR means that the probability of values being missing differs for reasons that are known to the researchers 7 MAR is broader than MCAR and means that the probability of values being missing is similar only within groups that are defined by observed data 87 Thus, an extended MI model was chosen for this data. Based on Choi, Dekkers, and le Ces- sie (2018)8, a multiple imputation combined with missing indicator method was used that has been recommended for dealing with missing data that are MNAR. Firstly, MI was used to im-pute the missing covariates using the chained equations (MICE) procedure. Then, variables representing the missing data (with \"1\" indicating missing data and \"0\" without missing data) was created for each covariate with missing data and added to the propens ity score model. This approach has been shown to reduce bias in MNAR scenarios (Sperrin and Martin, 2020) 9. The extended MI method was used to generate 5 imputed datasets with all relevant out- comes, and prognostic and confounding variables included in the imputation models. These variables are: Relevant outcome - either Food Diary Costs, Weekly Groceries Costs, or Eating Out / Takeaway Spend Type of FHS - whether the respondent is a part of CD, FA, FIO, or the non- FHS group Control variables such as: o Hous ehold size o Household income o Region o Gender o Education o Age o Ethnicity o Geography o Place of shopping (ie large supermarket / online / specialist shops) - only for Food Diary Costs and Weekly Groceries Costs o Frequency of eating out - only for Eating Out / Takeaway Spend 8 Choi, J., Dekkers, O.

European journal of epidemiology, 34(1), 23- 36. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654- 018-0447 -z 9 Sperrin, M., Martin, imputation with missing indicators as proxies for unmeasured variables: simulation study. BMC Med Res Methodol 20, 185 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874- 020-01068-x 88 It was implemented using the MICE package in R with 5 imputations for each of the imputed datasets. In order to implement propensity score matching with multiply imputed models, a \"Within\" approach was taken (Mitra & Reiter, 2016). In this approach, treated and controlled units were matched within each imputed dataset. The relevant multivariable regression model was then fitted to each imputed dataset for each outcome/dataset combination, and the re-sulting 'treatment' estimates and standard errors were averaged using Rubin's rules. All im- puted variables are categorical variables, thus a logistic regression was used for in the impu-tation process. Further sensitivity analysis with different number of multiple imputations was performed and is described in Section 1.6.2 below. Removing outliers The boxplots below show the outliers present for each of the costs. As some of the spend fig- ures provided by respondents in the survey appeared to be too large an amount for food con- sumption costs, these were considered as measurement errors and removed (highlighted in red box). Similar regression analysis was performed wi thout outliers removed and the differ- ence in estimates between the two analyses was small. Thus, the primary analysis presented is with outliers removed. Weekly Food Diary Costs There is a clear outlier above \u00a32500, which we will drop for the analysis going forward. There appears to be another outlier around \u00a31000, which was kept in the analysis as the distance between it and the Q1 line is not too far. 89 Weekly Groceries Costs The boxplot clearly shows there are five points that are distanced further above the Q1 line, which have been identified as outliers to be removed. It is assumed that spending \u00a310000 or more weekly on groceries (excluding eating out / takeaway spend) is not realistic and may represent a data error. Thus, these points are removed to ensure they won't distort the addi- tional costs. Weekly Eating Out / Takeaway Costs The boxplot for eating out/takeaway spend shows a significant outlier at around \u00a313000. While there appears to be another outlier at \u00a32500, this observation has been kept as it is not far from the Q1 line and could be a true outlier. The \u00a313000 observation, on the other hand, is assumed to be unrealistic and thus, has been removed. 90 Results were also regenerated with the outliers kept in the datasets. Among the nine da- tasets presented in Section 1.1 in this appendix, only four of those included outliers. Th ey are: Weekly Food Diary Costs o Dataset 3: consisting of FA and non- FHS - 1 outlier removed Weekly Groceries Costs o Dataset 5: consisting of CD and non- FHS - 3 outliers removed o Dataset 6: consisting of FA and non- FHS - 1 outlier removed Monthly Eating Out / Takeaway Spend o Dataset 9: consisting of FA and non- FHS - 1 outlier removed For Datasets 6 and 9, the results were similar even with the removal of outliers. However, for Datasets 3 and 5, the estimates of the cost difference between FA / CD and non- FHS were 5-10% higher than when the outliers were removed. However, these outliers can be reasona- bly assumed to be data errors (for example, spending \u00a335000 per week on groceries) and if these were included, it could lead to misleading and results in overinflated estimates. Propensity score matching Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was applied using the \"nearest neighbour\" method. The logit of the propensity score was used as the matching scale with a caliper width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score, in line with the recommenda- tions of Austin (2011) 10. Variables used in deriving the propensity score are similar to the de- mographic and household characteristics used in the multivariate regression which are: Household size Household income Region Gender Education Age Ethnicity 10 Austin P. C. (2011). An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational Studies. Multivariate behavioral research, 46(3), 399 -424. https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2011.568786 91 Geography Place of shopping (for example, large supermarket / online / specialist shops) As mentioned in the section (section 1.1) before in this appendix, PSM was performed for each type of FHS ( CD, FA, and FIO ) with the non- FHS g roup and for each type of food con- sumption costs. The balance statistics can be found in Appendix 10. A matching assessment was done on the log -linear regression analysis (comparing FIO to non-FHS when using Food Diary Costs) with 5 imputations to determi ne the best method to use. Pre and post matching standardised mean differences were compared using different Matching methods. Methods tested were: \"Nearest neighbour\" matching with a 0.2 caliper \"Nearest neighbour\" matching with a 0.01 caliper \"Exact\" mat ching (not included in the table below ) \"Full\" matching with probit link \"Full\" matching with logit link Except for \"exact\" mat ching, none of the other matching methods were able to achieve negli- gible covariate imbalance using a commonly used threshold (standardised mean differences, SMD< 0.1 for all matched variables; Austin, 2011) 1. For \"Nearest neighbour\" matching with a 0.01 caliper. more than 50% of the FHS household observations were unmatched and thus would have been left out of the analysis. Meanwhile, for \"full\" matching 11, although the sam- ple size would have remained large, the matching was not adequate with many matched vari-ables with standardised mean differences > 0.1. The matching assessment with standardised mean differences is presented in the table below (standardised mean differences < or close to 0.1 are highlighted in bold) 11 Full matching (also known as optimal full matching) is a matching method which assigns every treated and control unit to one subclass each. It then computes weights based on subclass and these weights act like propensity score weights to be used to estimate a weighted treatment effect. ( MatchIT specification from cran.r -project reposit ory ) 92 Table 2: Matching assessment showing the standardised mean difference for each var- iable from both FHS (n = 1,225) and non- FHS household (n = 1,530) group survey con- ducted in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales between November 2020 and January 2021 Variables Pre- matched Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper = 0.2) Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper 0.01) Matched (using Full and probit link) Matched (using Full and logit link) Household size - Large household -0.2147 0.1313 0 -0.7317 0.3682 -0.3998 0 0.0406 0.162 -1.7721 93 Variables Pre- matched Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper = 0.2) Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper 0.01) Matched (using Full and probit link) Matched (using Full and logit link) Region - England -1.0216 - Other -0.3441 0 0 -0.0066 -0.0033 Education - Entry level education Levels 1, 2, 3) 0.5068 0.0191 -0.0724 -0.5943 0.5462 Education - Entry level education 5, 6, 7, 8) -0.5894 0.214 0.214 94 Variables Pre- matched Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper = 0.2) Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper 0.01) Matched (using Full and probit link) Matched (using Full and logit link) Age 18 Sizes: Matched: and 106 from treated Sample Sizes: Matched: 84 from control and 84 from treated Sample Sizes: Matched (Effec-tive Sample Size): 2.69 from Sample Sizes: Matched (Effec-tive Sample Size): 3 from 95 Variables Pre- matched Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper = 0.2) Matched (us- ing nearest neighbour and caliper 0.01) Matched (using Full and probit link) Matched (using Full and logit link) FHS group un- matched: 12 Non-FHS group un- group 34 Non-FHS group un-matched: 1446 control and 1530 from treated control and 1530 from treated Thus, the first option of \"Nearest neighbour\" matching with a 0.2 caliper was chosen as it matched more than 50% of observations but still achieved a high degree of covariate balance across most of the matching variables. It must be noted that for Food Di ary Costs, the matching for FIO with the non- FHS group is poorer than the matching for CD with the non -FHS group with the matching method above. As also mentioned above, the matching can be improved in terms of achieving covariate bal- ance but then more than 50% of the observations will be unmatched resulting in substantial loss of power. For example, the matching for FIO with the non- FHS group had nearly 30% of sub-characteristics12 with standardised mean differences of > 0.1 whilst the matching for CD with the non -FHS group had only about 6% of sub- characteristics with standardised mean differences of > 0.1. However, for Weekly Groceries Costs, the matching results were similar across the three groups, with only about 3% of sub- characteristics (equivalent t o 1 sub- char- acteristic) with standardised mean differences of > 0.1. We address any lack of covariate bal- ance by using multivariable regression adjustment for the relevant confounding factors after selecting the matched samples. This doubly robust approach is recommended as a strategy 12 Sub-characteristics here are defined as the specific groups within a demographic or household characteristic. For example, sub- characteristics of the characteristic 'region' will be England, Northern Ireland, and Wales 96 for removing confounding if imbalance exists after propensity score matching (Nguyen et al, 2017)13. Regression analysis Multivariate regressions were performed with a list of key demographic variables (controls) included to reduce confounding bias. The fully adjusted model was constructed by sequen- tially adding all relevant control variables using a manual stepwise procedure. The control variables were added in order of univariate significance and magnitude of eff ect on the out- come. Initially, a Box -Cox transformation was used on the response variables (the different costs) to transform the data to help ensure the model assumptions are valid (including independence of errors, equal variance of errors and normality of residuals). This is done by recovering a value of the power parameter, lambda, that will achieve the maximum log- likelihood and transforming the response variable with the lambda value. 14 The lambda value that was found, 0.2, made it difficult to numerically interpret the regression analysis results. Thus, as a lambda value of zero was close to the maximum log- likelihood, the final model used has a log transformed response variable (when lambda equals to zero, it is a log- transformation), which will allo w for easier numerical interpretation. For eating out / takeaway spend, there was a higher number of observations that are zero before any transformation or addition was applied. The presence of excess zeroes in the da-taset could contribute to overdispersion and/or zero inflation in the dataset, which can lead to biased estimates and errors in interpretation of the result. Thus, a multi -stage model was ini- tially used to deal with the excess zeroes, which combines the use of a logistic regression and a log- linear regression (Fletcher et al., 2005). In this method, a logistic regression is used to model the occurrence of a zero value and a log- linear regression is used to model the pos- itive costs. The results from the log- linear regression part of the multi -stage model were simi- lar to the model where all cost values underwent a log( + 1) transformation, in terms of sta- tistical significance and direction of effect. Meanwhile, the binomial regression results were 13 Nguyen, TL., Collins, G.S ., Spence, J. et al.

Thus, the log( + 1) transformation was used in a single stage regression for eating out / takeaway spend to ensure consistency with the other cost variables. 98 The full multivariate regression equation is presented below: (+1)= + 11,+....+11,+2_+ Where; = Food consumption costs for the i -th household15 = Intercept 1 = Average difference in log cost between households with FHS and non- FHS = FHS type / non- FHS in i-th household = Number of categories of exposure variables (eg. three groups of FHS) 2 = Vector of coefficients for control variables used _ = List of control variables used which are age, gender, et hnicity, educa- tion, household income, household size, region, geography (rural/urban household), place of shopping, and frequency of eating out = Error term Two log linear regression methods were used for fitting the outcome models and the results are compared in Appendix 7. They were applied to check whether the results were sensitive to different model specifications. Previous studies have shown that no single method is best in all circumstances and it is recommended to consider alternative estimati on approaches to allow for common data issues such as heteroscedasticity. The two methods we considered are: Log-linear regression (ordinary least squares regression on ln(y)) Generalised linear model (GLM) with a Gamma family and a log- link The control variables included in both types of regressions are as mentioned above but will be listed again below: Household size 15 The model presented here is for the Gamma family with log- link. For the log linear regression, the food consumption costs will be log( +1) 99 Household income Region Gender Education Age Ethnicity Geography Place of shopping (ie large supermarket / online / specialist shops) There were also 4/1559 (0.26%) and 145/1559 (9.3%) observations that were zeroes for weekly groceries spend and eating out / takeaway spend, respectively. This was handled by adding a constant term to the cos ts before the log -transformation was applied, thus the cost variables are represented as \"( + 1)\".16 Addition of the constant term ensures the zero costs are strictly positive. Use of the logarithmic transformation for the food consumption costs was c hosen as this pro- vides a natural basis for modelling skewed outcomes that are all -positive. The log- transfor- mation can help ensure the assumptions of additivity and linearity are reasonable and im- prove model fit (Gelman and Hill, 2007). The resulting linear model on the logarithmic scale corresponds to a multiplicative model on the original scale and ensures all predictions of costs are necessarily positive. Use of the generalised linear model with a Gamma family and a log- link provides an alternative, and potentially more flexible, way to model the cost out- come that can appropriately model the error structure (Manning and Mullahy, 2001)17. The results from the Gamma distribution with log link are overall similar to the results gener- ated from the log -linear regressions. However, there is one exception when weekly food diary costs are used as the outcome. The food diary costs estimates generated from the log- linear regression model are not statistically significant for the comparison of all three FHS groups vs the non- FHS group. On the other hand, the results generated from the Gamma distribution 16 A quasi -likelihood model (which could have included the zeroes) with a \"log\" link and variance of mean- squared was explored for the eating out / takeaway analysis as there is a higher proportion of zeroes. However, the algorithms did not converge, and so it was not possible to obtain valid model estimates. 17 Manning, W. G. and J. Mullahy (2001). 'Estimating log mo dels: to transform or not to transform?' Journal of Health Economics, 20: 461- 94. 100 with log link are statistically significant when comparing those in the FIO category and those with CD with the non- FHS group. A brief comparison of the weekly food di ary cost estimates and their p- values from the two approaches are shown below: Table 3: Comparison of weekly food diary costs estimates from Gamma distribution with log link and Log -linear approaches from FHS (n = 1,225) and non- FHS household (n = 1,530) g roup survey conducted in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales between November 2020 and January 2021 - How much more those in FIO cate- gory spend than non- FHS How much more those in with CD spend than non- FHS How much more those with FA spend than non-FHS Gamma distribu- tion with 0.6] Thus, as seen from the table, there is a difference in the statistical significance and estimates of results generated between the gamma distribution with log link and the log- linear regres- sion model. The residual plots were then analysed for these outcome / FHS type combina-tions. These plots are presented below and show some evidence of heteroscedasticity for both models. We note that the ordinary least squares (OLS) log- linear regression estimates can be biased in the presence of heteroscedasticity. The GLM gamma model protects against bias in the presence of heteroscedasticity but can be less precise than the OLS model in some scenarios. Our emphasis is on minimising bias and so we selected the GLM with a gamma family and log link as the main model of analysis - and this is the one pre- sented in Section 5 of the main report. 101 Weekly Food Diary Costs - Comparison of FIO vs Non -FHS Residual plot of original data Residual plot of Gamma family with log link 102 Residual plot of log- linear regression Weekly Food Diary Costs - Comparison of CD vs Non -FHS Residual plot of original data 103 Residual plot of Gamma family with log link Residual plot of log- linear regression The full results from the log- linear regression and Gamma distribution with log- link can be found in Appendix 7. 104 Sensitivity analysis High proportion of females Due to the very high response rate from females compared to males in the FHS household survey ( 79%) sensitivity analysis was conducted to address potential response bias and ef- fect modification. In addition to adjusting for any confounding effect of gender, a model with interaction effects was constructed to assess whether the cost differentials between FHS types and non- FHS varies between females and males. To explain, _ is the exposure variable consisting of either one of the three FHS groups ( FIO, CD, or FA ) and the non- FHS group. An interaction term of _ , was created for the dataset with all types of FHS and non- FHS respondents. Multivariate regression using a fully adjusted model was then performed for food consump-tion costs in all datasets with the addition of the appropriate interaction terms. If the coeffi- cients of the interaction terms are significant, this i ndicates that there is a difference in effect of FHS presence on costs between genders. Multiple imputation The final model presented in the main analysis was originally run with five imputations. In general, two to 10 imputations are usually sufficient for the efficiency of point estimates how-ever, higher number of imputations may be needed for standard errors that would not signifi- cantly change if data was imputed again (Von Hippel, 2018). Thus, the analysis for the food costs was separately run with imputations of 10, 20, 40, and 100 times to check the sensitiv- ity of the results to different number of imputations. The results are discussed in Section 5.4.2 in the main report. The results showed that overall, the results remained stable even a s the number of imputa- tions increased from five to 100; with the exception of the comparison of FA and non- FHS with Weekly Food Diary Costs. Thus, the results of this comparison presented in the main analysis was generated with 100 imputations whilst the r esults of other comparisons pre- sented was generated with 5 imputations. 105 Non-food direct costs d ata In addition to the food consumption costs, there are other direct costs. These costs are: Kitchen equipment costs o Additional costs of kitchen equipment incurred by those living with FHS due to their FH S Medical costs o Total medical costs consisting of: Nutritional supplement and/or over the counter medication costs Prescription medication costs (for example, adrenaline auto-injectors, antihistamines, and corticosteroids) Specialist medical costs (for example, medical bags, inhalers) These costs were only collected for the FHs household group survey, thus there is no com- parison group survey to use as a comparator and all analysis will focus on difference in cost estimates between FH types. In the survey, only data on type of kitchen equipment used was collected. These types were then coded into categories (for example, separate toaster, separate prep area, separate chopping board etc.) These kitchen equipment items were then quantified using the average price of the item, which was calculated by taking the average of their prices in different retail-ers. Retailers are B&Q, Wilko, Tesco, Asda, Currys, and Amazon. These retailers were cho- sen to try and represent a range of shopping behaviours and demographics. For answers that could not be quantified (ie separate prep area, separate storage etc.), these were as- sumed to be of zero cost as it is likely that consumers will have existing storage space or prep areas in their homes. None of the data specified in this section underwent PSM or MI as these costs are not in- cluded in the main report due to being out of scope of the research question. However, they have been left in this appendix and results can be found in Appendix 7 for reference. Removing outliers As there were no outliers identified for kitchen costs due to the costs being quantified by RSM, all 1 225 observations were kept in for the analysis. For medical costs, there were outli- ers identified for each individual cost category except specialist medical costs. These are de-tailed as: 106 Table 4: Outliers removed from medical costs and justification of removal from the FHS (n = 1,225) group survey conducted in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales be- tween November 2020 and January 2021 - Cost 1: Nutritional sup- plements and/or OTC medication (per month) Cost 2: Prescription medication (adrenaline auto -injector s, anti -his- tamines, corticosteroids) (per month) Observations with costs be- yond con-sidered as outliers and re- moved: \u00a3100 \u00a337.40 Justification: It would be difficult to spend hundreds, let alone thousands of pounds per month on over the counter medi- cines or nutritional sup-plements in the UK. Any expenditure above \u00a3100 is confirmed to be impos- sible by Coeliac UK. The cost of an NHS pre - payment annual certificate is \u00a3108.10 equating to \u00a39 per month (or \u00a330.25 for a 3 month PPC), therefo re anything over \u00a337.40 (4 prescriptions per house-hold per month) is highly unlikely. Pharmacies will usually tell customers who order repeat prescriptions frequently to buy a pre - payment certificate. Number of outliers 29/1559 (1.9%) observations were removed for the analysis of total medical costs. Out- liers were not removed for Cost 3: Specialist Equipment as there could be special medical equipment that would cost a significant amount, thus it would be diff icult to judge whether the reported costs are implausible. 107 Regression analysis There were a high number of zeroes with 982/1559 (63%) and 650/1559 (41.7%) zero values for kitchen equipment costs and medical costs, respectively. As described above, the pres- ence of excess zeroes demanded that a different analysis be used. In this case, the multi - stage model as described in Section 1.1.5 was used to analyse these costs. For the multi - stage model, two datasets were created where the appropriate regression w as performed on the relevant dataset: Dataset comprising all observations , but the costs were transformed into zeroes (for costs with zero value) and ones (for all positive costs), for the logistic regres-sion Dataset comprising only observations where the costs were positive (higher than zero) for the log- linear regression For k itchen equipment costs, the log- linear regression model had 577 observations while the logistic regression model has 1,559 observations. For medical costs, the log- linear regression model has 635 observations while the logistic regression model had 1,051 o bservations (479 missing observations dropped for the analysis). The reduced number of observations used for the medical costs analysis is explained below. Bootstrapping performed for medical costs The initial findings for medical costs from the log- linear regression component showed there is a statistically significant difference in positive spending between the FHS types, while this difference was statistically insignificant for kitchen equipment costs. Additionally, the differ- ences in odd of spending on medical costs from the logistic regression were also found to be statistically significant between the FHS types. Thus, additional analysis was performed for medical costs to combine estimates from the two components of the model using nonpara- metric bootst rapping. Non- parametric bootstrapping was used as it is the safer option when the underlying specification of the model cannot be accurately ascertained. In addition, the sample size used in this analysis, N = 1051, is large enough that the issue of reproducing spurious fine structure (present in the original sample but not in the population sample) in the simulated data is not relevant. The rest of the section details the specifications of the non- parametric bootstrapping method. The expected average cost, (), is given by equation (1) below (Fletcher et al., 2005): ()= , (1) 108 where =exp/{1 + exp} (2) and =exp (+2 2) (3) are estimates o f (expected probability of non- zero medical costs for a survey respondent with vector of covariates ) and (expected medical cost for survey respondents that have a non-zero cost) from the logistic and log- linear regression models, respectively. Her e, is a vector of coefficient estimates from the logistic regression, and is the corresponding vector of predictor variables. Meanwhile, is the vector of coefficient estimates from the log- linear regression, and 2 is the residual mean square of the model (Fletcher et al., 2005). The esti- mates of the difference in expected average cost between the FHS types (with FIO as a ref- erence categor y) and its corresponding confidence intervals were obtained with nonparamet- ric bootstrapping. This involved repeated resampling from the observed data and fitting lo- gistic and log- linear regression models to each bootstrap resample to estimate , , and 2. These estimates were combined using equations (2) and (3) to estimate the distribution of (). The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were chosen to produce a 95% confidence interval from 1000 bootstrap samples. The cost difference between the FHS types and their confi- dence intervals were then calculated from the bootstrap samples. Due to the complexity of bootstrapping multiple imputed data, complete cases analysis was used (where rows with missing values were dropped for the analysis) for medical costs, which reduced the total ob- servations used. 109 Indirect costs d ata The indirect costs asked in the survey are as: Days lost from paid work due to FHS : FHS households were asked how many days of ab- sence from paid work they had in the past year due to FHS. Days lost from unpaid work due to FHS : FHS households were asked how many unpaid days they had lost in the past year due to FHS. Unpaid work includes days spent on edu- cation, training, voluntary work, lost leisure time, caring for others, and housework time. Extra time spent on food shopping/planning/FHS education due to FHS (Extra time costs): FHS households were asked on the extra time spent on the below activities. These hours were converted into hours per week and summed up to provide a total extra time spent due to FHS Time on food shopping per week Time on planning food shop and reading food labels per week Time to travel further for food shopping per week Extra time on planning and preparing for eating out/takeaways per month Extra time on planning and preparing for visiting/hosting friends and family per month The first outcome, days lost from paid work due to FH was converted into financial cos t by multiplying it with the 2019 -2020 annual median income of \u00a329,900 ( Office of National Statis- tics, Median Income 2019 to 2020). For the second and third outcome, unpaid work and time spent on food shopping etc. was converted into financial cost with the multiplication of the lat-est hourly National Living Wage of \u00a38.72 ( GOV.UK, April 2020, National Living Wage ). None of the data specified in this section underwent PSM or MI as these costs are not in- cluded in the main report due to being out of scope of the research question. However, they have been left in this appendix and results can be found in Appendix 7 for reference. 110 Removing outliers For the first two outcomes on day s lost from paid work and days lost from unpaid work, there were no outliers identified as the maximum value given by respondents is 365 days, which can be interpreted as one year. Thus, all 1559 observations were kept for the analysis. For the extra time costs, outliers were also removed using the boxplot method. As some of the time spent per week provided by respondents in the survey appeared to be beyond the maximum number of hours available per week, these were considered as measurement er- rors and remov ed (highlighted in red box). Additionally, although there was another outlier (~217 hours) that was close to the Q1 line, it was also removed as it is impossible to spend more than 168 hours per week. Also, the respondent had indicated they spent 200 hours per week alone on food shopping, which is impossible and thus, can be assumed to be a meas-urement error. Extra Time Spent Per Week Regression analysis Two of the indirect cost variables also suffer from a similar issue of excess zeroes as the kitchen equipment costs and medical costs, with 1196/1559 (76.7%) zero values for days lost from paid work due to FH, and 1262/1559 (80.9%) for days lost from unpaid work due to FH. As a natural model for paid work days lost and unpaid days lost is a count data model (ie the 111 response variable has observations that can only take the form of non- negative integer val- ues such as 0,1,2,3,...), a different regression model was used for these two costs. Thus, a negative binomial regression was used to produce the es timates as this type of modelling is typically used to model count data with overdispersion of data (when the conditional variance is larger than the conditional mean) and/or a high number of zero values. This regression model can only be used for count da ta, hence why it was not used for kitchen equipment costs and medical costs (these costs are continuous). For consistency with the other non- lin- ear regression models, only multivariate regression analysis was performed for these costs. For the third outcome, extra time costs, there are only 6/1559 (0.4%) observations that have zero value, thus the log- linear regression model - that was used for food consumption costs - was applied here as well. This means that a ( +1) transforma tion was applied for the extra time costs variable. Converting household food costs to individual food costs This section presents how the estimates for food costs have been extrapolated to individual costs and scaled up for the whole population. This was done as the survey collected house-hold costs, however individual costs are needed for the development of the FSA's Cost of Ill- ness model 18. Additionally, this also provides a big picture of the estimates generated in Chapter 5. The steps used to perform this conversion are: 1. According to the FSA's Food and You 2 Wave 3 survey19, in the UK, there are 300,000 estimated individuals with coeliac disease, 800,000 with food allergy , and 1.2 million with food intolerance and other conditions . The proportion of those with coeliac disease as a proportion of total FHS population is 13 % (300,000 / 2.3 million), the pro- 18 The FSA is currently developing a COI model that will estimate the annual societal burden of FHS in the UK. 19 Note: these FHS prevalence figures are 'self -reported clinically diagnosed' and on an FHS only basis so that those with multiple conditions are only counted once to avoid overestimated costs. 112 portion of individuals living with food allergy is 35% ( 800,000 / 2.3 million), and the pro- portion of FIO is 52% (1.2 million / 2.3 million) . The total prevalence of FHS in the UK is 3% (2.3 million / 67.1 million20). 2. The average weekly spend, per person, on food and drink is \u00a326.04. ( Family Food Survey, 2018/19 ). 3. These allow us to calculate average non- FHS population spend on weekly groceries costs: 4. The difference in spending on weekly groceries costs for people living with CD is then the average non- FHS population spend [\u00a32 5.92] multiplied by the average increase for those with CD [11.9%] (according t o Weekly Groceries Costs). This process is re- peated for those with FA and FIO, changing the [11.9%] for [14.4%] and [15.8%], re- spectively. 5. This gives an average weekly difference per person of \u00a33. 08, \u00a33. 73, and \u00a3 4.10 for CD, FA, and FIO , respectively 6. The figures from Step 5 can be multiplied by the prevalence of those with CD [300,000], FA [800,000 ], and those in the FIO category [ 1.2 million]. 21 20 Estimated total population in the UK from the ONS in 2020 [https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populatione stimates] 21 National statistics were used to provide scaling to a national level. Using any in- sample estimates would not have been able to provide any figures in the millions as we only have proportions of each FHS group. The average weekly spend on food and drink [\u00a326.04 ] The prevalence of non - FHS [0.97] The prevalenc e of FHS [0.03] Proportio n of CD [0.13] The average increase in costs for CD [1.119] Proportio n of FA [0.35] The average increase in costs for FA [1.144] Proportio n of FIO [0.52] The average increase in costs for FIO The average non - FHS population spend [\u00a325.92] 113 7. Steps 1 to 7 are then repeated for Weekly Food Diary Costs and Weekly Eating Out / Takeaway Costs, which are reported in the table below . Table 5: Additional weekly spend of CD/ FA/FIO adults compared to non- FHS adults in Eng- land, Wales, and Northern Ireland for different food consumption costs at a population level Type of cost Additional weekly spend of CD adults Additional weekly spend of FA adults Additional weekly spend of adults i n the FIO category Weekly Groceries Costs \u00a3 925,344 \u00a3 4,660,20022 For weekly eating out / takeaway costs, it must be noted that the difference between those in the FIO category and the non- FHS group is not statistically significant. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting the significance of the f igures produced and this caveat must be included in any future work using these weekly eating out / takeaway cost figures. Also, the additional weekly spend for those in the FIO category are higher than those in the CD and FA category as these have been multiplied with the prevalence of their respective FHS type; and there is greater prevalence of those nationally in the FIO category (1.2 million ) compared to those in the CD ( 300,000) and FA ( 800,000). These are estimated figures, that assumes the results of our survey can be generalised across the wider population. In addition, the percentage differences captured in the costs were measured at the household level, as opposed to individual level. Thus, we are using es- timates of expected increases in costs in FHS groups at the household level as if they apply to the individual level. However, a precise estimate of cost differences at the individual level cannot be generated from the data collected in the survey. The estimates presented in this 22 This re sult is not statistically significant 114 chapter are reliant on the assumption that the costs differences at the household level simi- larly apply to the individual level. A more accurate figure would require future studies to col- lect costs on an individual level, although this will be challenging given th at spending deci- sions are generally taken at a household level. Lastly, the only available FHS prevalence and population figures are for the UK whereas our study excludes Scotland because the FSA's jurisdiction does not include Scotland. Thus, this estimat ed figure assumes that even with the exclusion of Scotland, the FHS prevalence and population figures will not significantly differ. 115 Austin P. C. (2011).

P<0.05*,p<0.01**, p<0.001*** Multivariate regression analysis for kitchen equipment costs - two-part model Kitchen equipment costs The findings presented below are the estimates for the two part -model. As mentioned in Sec- tion 2.5.3, there are two datasets created for each compound regression model. The kitchen equipment costs are reported as a one- off cost. The first component is a logistic regression which models the occurrence of a zero value in the kitchen equipment costs based on 1,559 observations (of which 577 had non- zero costs). This estimates the difference in probability of spending on kitchen equipment between the FHS types. The second component is a log- linear regression which models the non- zero costs (based on 577 observations). This estimates the difference in costs between FHS types that reported spending on additional kitchen equipment due to their FH S. 168 The key findings (statistically significant results are bolded) from the analysis from both com- ponents are: Lower odds of having non- zero kitchen equipment costs for those with FA than those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model, those wit h FA have 6.9 fold [95% CI 5.2 - 9.2, p < 0.001] higher odds of having a one- off spending on kitchen equipment than those with CD. Lower odds of having non- zero kitchen equipment costs for those in the FIO category than those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model, those in the FIO category have 5.0 fold [95% CI 3.6 - 6.9, p < 0.001] lower odds of having a one- off spending on kitchen equipment than those with CD . For those that reported spending on kitchen equipment costs, there is higher spend- ing for those with FA compared to those with CD: Conditional on reported spending, those with FA spend 18.6% more than those with CD [p = 0.1] For those that reported spending on kitchen equipment costs, there is higher spend- ing for those in the FIO category compared to those with CD: Conditional on reported spending, those in the FIO category spend 20.0% more than those with CD [p = 0.2] Given that the log- linear regression models (second component based only on reported spending) did not identify cost differences between FHS types there will be no estimates combining the two components.

The two- part model process used here is similar to the one for kitchen equipment costs, except this does not include observations where there are missing values (explained in the paragraph below). As the findings below show, conditional on spending on medical costs (eg nutritional supplement costs, prescription medication cists, specialist medical costs) , there is a statistically significant difference in costs between the FHS types in both model compo- nents. Thus, the results from both parts of the model were combined through bootstrapping (see Section 1.2 in Appendix 6 for further details) to provide a combined expected average cost and their confidence intervals for each FHS type. Due to the com- plexity of the analysis, only observations without missing values were kept for this analysis. This meant the log- linear regression model has 635 observations while the logistic regression model has 1,051 observations. 180 Firstly, the results from the two -part model are presented below with the statistically significant results in bold. The key findings from the analysis are: Higher odds of having non- zero medical costs for those with FA than those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model. t hose with FA have 1.9 [95% CI 1.5 - 2.4, p < 0.001] higher odds of spending on medical costs than those with CD. Higher odds of having non- zero medical costs for those in the FIO category than those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model, those i n the FIO category have 1.3 [p = 0.1] higher odds of spending on medical costs than those with CD. For those that reported spending on medical costs, those with FA have higher costs than those with CD: Conditional on having reported spending, those with FA have 3.5% [p = 0.7] higher costs than those with CD. For those that reported spending on medical costs, those in the FIO category have higher costs than those with CD: Conditional on having reported s pending, those in the FIO category have 56.2% [95% CI 29.3% to 88.7%, p < 0.001] higher costs than those with CD. The bootstrapped results which provide combines estimates from both model stages are: Higher medical costs for those with FA and those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model, those with FA spend \u00a35.21 [95% CI 2.02 - 8.92] more than those with CD. Higher medical costs for those in the FIO category than those with CD: On average, with a fully adjusted model, those in the FIO category spend \u00a38.57 [95% CI 4.42 - 13.86] more than those with CD. 181 Table 33: Monthly medical costs of FHS households broken down by FHS group using a generalised linear stepwise re- gression model of Binomial family (Model 2) and a linear regression model with log- transformed costs larger than \u00a30 (Model 1) Dependent variable Model 1 Model 2 FHStype CD -0.393*** -0.363** Standard (0.218) 2 genderother 1.474 Standard error (0.364) (1.085) educationHigher level Levels 4, 5, 0.083 Standard (535.411) ethnicityWhite -0.463** -0.407 184 Dependent variable Model R2 0.132 - P<0.05*,p<0.01**,p<0.001*** Multivariate regression analysis for indirect costs The sections below present the findings for the three indirect cost outcomes. As mentioned in Section 2.5.4, the negative binomial model was used for both paid days and unpaid days lost, while a log -linear regression was used for extra time costs. For all three costs, there is no comparison with the non- FHS household group as these outcomes are not relevant to them. The statistically significant results are in bold. 185 Multivariate zero -inflated negative binomial regression analysis for paid work days lost The key findings from the fully adjusted model when all demographic and household variants are considered are: Higher costs of paid days lost per year for FA compared to CD: On average, those with FA lose 1.38 days more [p = 0.4] due to FHS compared to those with CD. The cost of paid days lost for FA is then \u00a3158.70 more than those with CD.23 Higher costs of paid days lost per year for those in the FIO category compared to CD: On average, those in the FIO category lose 2.54 days more [95% CI 1.11 - 5.80, p = 0.03] due to FHS. compared to those with CD. The cost of paid days lost for those in the FIO category is then \u00a3292.10 more than those with CD.24 23 This cost is calculated using annual median income of \u00a329,900 with the equation: 1.3829,900 525 24 Calculated using equation: 2.5429,900 525 186 Table 34: Paid days lost per year of FHS households broken down by FHS group using zero- inflated negative binomial stepwise regression models Dependent variable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Model 8 (Intercept) Dependent variable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Model 8 hh_incomeLow - 0.563 188 Dependent variable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Model 8 - - - - (0.483) (0.411) educationHigher level education (NQF Levels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) - - - - -0.774 -0.820 -0.867 -0.928* - - - - - - - - - - (0.419) age_groupChild - - - - - 1.078* - - - - - (0.437) (0.431) (0.463) ethnicityOther - - - - - - -36.213 -50.509 - - - - - - - (24.006) (29.668) 189 Dependent variable Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Model 8 ethnicityWhite - - - - - - -0.834 -0.703 - - - - - - - (0.546) (0.630) GeographyUrban - - - - - - - 0.452 - - - - - - - 1559 1559 1559 P<0.05*,p<0.01**,p<0.001*** Multivariate zero -inflated negative binomial regression analysis for unpaid days lost The key findings from the fully adjusted model when all demographic and household variants are considered are: Higher costs of unpaid days lost per year for FA compared to CD : On average, those with FA lose 2.13 days more [95% CI 1.17 - 3.88, p = 0.01] compared to those with CD.
