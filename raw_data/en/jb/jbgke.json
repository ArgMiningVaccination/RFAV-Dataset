Itineraries are entirely customized and might include craniosacral massages to break up fascia and align your spine, skin-firming micropuncture facials or ceremonial-like body treatments: The Roots Unbound, for example, starts with a frankincense-, hyssop- and ginger-infused massage to boost immunity and finishes with a fresh serving of digestive bitters (and more plant-based delights await in the restaurant, which is overseen by Danish culinary wonder Mads Refslund).

Arctic Bath, Lapland With the rise in outdoor wellness experiences, [Arctic Bath](https://arcticbath.se/) in Sweden's Lapland region takes that concept to a new level. The open-air, six-cabin hotel and spa hovers on the Lule River, where it freezes into the ice in winter and peacefully floats on the surface in summer. Inspired by the practice of transporting felled trees down rivers, the sustainably-built, circular structure is lined with local pine wood and houses three saunas, hot and cold plunge pools and a treatment room, where you can book deep-tissue body fixes and lymphatic facials with tailor-made botanical creams and serums from Sweden's own Kerstin Florian range. (And if you don't have your sea legs, no worries\u2014there are six cabins on land, too.)

Six Senses Fort Barwara, Jaipur To experience the transformative benefits of [Ayurvedic treatments](https://www.vogue.com/article/taza-ayurvedic-beauty-brand-skincare-health-digestion-wellness) firsthand, consider a trip to the epic Six Senses [Fort Barwara](https://www.sixsenses.com/en/new-openings/fort-barwara), situated 68 miles southeast of Jaipur in India (the birthplace of Ayurveda medicine).

The 30,000-square-foot spa is located in the former women's palace and includes a meditation temple, sauna and tepidarium (warm room), and an array of healing therapies, including Swedana (a traditional steam treatment), integrated sleep programs, and sunrise and sunset yoga to cap it off.
