It was the kind of chance meeting that had us both believing that 'if everything happens for a reason (something we both believe!)' there was a reason (beyond the initial need to fill her request) that the Universe brought us together in that moment in time. An immediate connection followed by a fast friendship was made where I helped her with some of her marketing needs, and she opened her heart and home to the kind of genuine friendship you don't always find in the Hamptons. [Michelle is a woman of many talents. Prior to opening her family home as a B&B some 6 years ago, Michelle studied: interior design, feng shui, trompe l'oiel painting, gardening, cooking, holistic health remedies, and whatever other interests she found within her heart's desire. A 'student of life,' she is constantly learning, reading and studying those pursuits that interest her or that may be of service to those she loves.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a3fcc60586970b-pi) Originally from Bayonne, NJ, Michelle came to Long Island to attend Southampton College. Like so many of our residents, Michelle was drawn to the area for its' natural beauty, beaches, and the kind of healthy lifestyle those amenities would provide for her and the family that would follow. She worked her way through college waitressing and bartending, met and married her husband, Ken Simmons, and together they had 3 boys. They purchased their home on North Magee Street in Southampton twenty years ago, when their first-born was a baby. As the family grew, they expanded the house to accommodate their growing brood, as well as a day care center that Michelle operated when the boys were young. [Well-known within the community, Michelle was always conscious of 'giving back'. She trained with and joined the Ambulance Corps, PTA and other community efforts. She and her family took in, fostered and nurtured many rescue animals through the years, three of which remain in their care today.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a73d812ad2970d-pi) Besides the day care center, Michelle found herself opening up her home to many neighbors and friends who she saw may have needed much of what she was so able to lovingly provide: a warm bed, home-cooked meal, caring soul to talk to. The idea of a B&B was a natural extension to the kind of person she already was, as well as to the talents she already possessed for doing so. If, as the saying goes, 'Everything in your life has prepared you for this moment,' it couldn't be more true of how Hamptons House of Gardens came to be. Through the years of learning (and practicing) how to cook, create, paint, decorate, garden, nurture and build, Michelle, with the help of her handy electrical contractor husband, expanded upon their modest family home to create a 5-bedroom Bed & Breakfast with all the loving touches she herself wanted for her family, and that she would want to bestow on any personal guest she would welcome into her own home. Staying here is like having that proverbial 'best friend in the Hamptons.' Michelle treats each guest with equal care, making sure they all have a clean room, fresh towels, plush robe and spring water with fresh floral sprays picked straight from the garden in season. She has put together binders filled with business cards, menus and brochures from local restaurants, beaches and recreational activities and she can make individual recommendations for each based on your needs or desires. She'll even provide the transportation to get there, if she is available, or arrange for cab service, where appropriate. [The property has a salt-water pool, hot tub, tiki bar, home-grown gardens in front and back; a hammock, swings, fire pit and tent to take cover from the sun as needed.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a3fcc6064e970b-pi) Overnight accommodations come with a full, organically-grown and prepared gourmet breakfast, much of which is raised right in the garden. On summer weekends, there is often a holistic chef in house preparing those special meals. [A spiritual person, Michelle designed each room to induce a restful, relaxing ambiance conducive with the natural elements surrounding. The Enlightenment Room reflects the sun streaming in, while the Transformation Room resembles a rain forest. There is an Inspiration Room, filled with musical notes and eclectic collections, inspiring creative imaginations to soar.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a3fcc60fb1970b-pi) [For those seeking more privacy, there is a suite in a separate building on the grounds, complete with full bathroom, fridge and mini-bar. Each room has a television, desk, air-conditioning, wifi and window overlooking the gardens.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a73d8111bf970d-pi) A living room with fireplace, library and television is open for guests to enjoy, as is the outdoor deck and patio. The B&B is close enough to town to get in and out of easily, while still being far enough away to enjoy the peacefulness of the area's gardens, woods and bay. [Close to the golf courses, restaurants, movies and shopping, horseback riding, tennis, beaches and spas, HHOG has the best of the Hamptons at your fingertips, yet, you can be just as comfortable enjoying the amenities provided right there during your stay.](https://theartmarketer.typepad.com/.a/6a01156f835127970c01a3fcc60754970b-pi) Prices are more reasonable here than you may find elsewhere in the Hamptons, especially in season. And while HHOG may not have many of the 5-star amenities you'll find elsewhere, what you will find here is an elusive quality unlike anyplace else you'll ever stay that includes: a comfortable home, hospitable host, home-cooking, handcrafted details and a new friend who will open her home and heart with just about any amenity you may need for the season you are there: hot toddies, herbal tea or hot chocolate in winter, wrapped in cozy blankets by a roaring fire; cold-pressed juices and lemonade in summer served with fresh fruits from the garden... I have been a guest at different times through most of the seasons and have always felt very much at home here with Michelle and her family. That's a very different feeling than the kind of (impersonal) feeling you get staying someplace else. Michelle is just that kind of host that will do everything she can to make you feel right at home. As such, HHOG is conducive to the kind of family reunions, gatherings or retreats you'd want to bring a small group to. Its' grounds lend itself to creating weekend yoga retreats, gardening club getaways, crafting holidays or spa weekends. Michelle can help your group organize the speakers or workshops to present to your group. A natural event planner, she often hosts yoga nights, holistic health workshops, comedy nights and more for her guests and the general public at large. There is even a separate studio for such endeavors for herself and her guests to enjoy. There is no doubt you will leave Hamptons House of Gardens more relaxed than when you came. I can't even begin to tell you how many friends commented to me on how relaxed I looked after my stays at HHOG. Michelle does everything she can to make your stay 'stress-free'.
