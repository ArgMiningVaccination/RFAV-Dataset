M o r g a n , M D7 MD 1 , 2 and Alexander Monto , Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects approximately 1.3 % of the United States population and 4 % of veterans who use Department of Veterans Affairs medical services. Chronic HCV is the primary cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation in the United States. Management of chronic HCV is aimed at halting disease progression, preventing cirrhosis decompensation, reducing the risk of HCC, and treating extrahepatic complications of the infection. As part of a comprehensive HCV management strategy, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, along with the addition of a hepatitis C protease inhibitor therapy for many genotype 1-infected patients, are the current standard of care. Antiviral therapy should be provided to those individuals who are clinically stable, have moderate liver disease or compensated cirrhosis, and are motivated to pursue therapy. Many patients have comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, which may affect their adherence to antiviral therapy or worsen while on antiviral therapy. To optimally manage hepatitis C and associated comorbidities, patients bene t from multidisciplinary teams that can provide HCV-speci c care and treatment. Sustained virologic response is associated with \" cure \" of chronic HCV, and results in improved liver disease outcomes and prolonged survival.

BOC and TVR represent a new era of therapy, as they are the fi rst commercially available hepatitis C direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, which directly inhibit viral replication. In clinical trials of HCV geno-type 1-infected patients receiving BOC or TVR, SVR was achieved in 63 - 75 % of treatment-na \u00ef ve patients, in 69 - 88 % of PegIFN and RBV relapsers, and in up to 33 % of PegIFN and RBV nonresponders ( 11 - 14 ). Triple therapy is associated with more side eff ects and requires closer patient follow-up than treatment with PegIFN and RBV alone. Increased hematological toxicity from triple therapy may lead to increased utilization of growth factors, which will further strain medical resources in healthcare systems. Additionally, BOC and TVR carry the risk of inducing HCV resistance mutations, and it is likely that cross-resistance to future generations of PIs will develop in some patients who do not achieve SVR ( 15 ). Extensive patient monitoring for virologic response and counseling on adherence will be necessary to minimize the development of resistant vari-ants. With the approval of HCV PIs, providers will need to identify candidates who require immediate treatment, as well as those who can wait another 4 - 6 years for the likely availability of IFN-free regimens. Future IFN-free regimens may include oral second gen-eration PIs, polymerase inhibitors, HCV nonstructural protein 5a inhibitors, and combinations of these drugs ( 16 ). Th e following treatment recommendations summarize the cur- rent best practices in the management of hepatitis C, including the use of PegIFN, RBV , and BOC- or TVR-containing regimens. Th ese recommendations are based on an extensive review of published data; the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis, Management and Treat-ment of Hepatitis C (2009); An Update on Treatment of Geno-type 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection (2011); CDC; FDA, and NIH recommendations; as well as input from thought leaders involved in the care of veterans with HCV infection ( 17 - 20 ). Rec-ommendations were developed using systematic weighting and grading of the quality of evidence according to criteria used by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 2009 Practice Guidelines ( Table 1 ) ( 18 ). Limited data that are currently available only in abstract form also have been included when the data are derived from prospective randomized, controlled trials. Each author participated in the preparation and review of the draft recommendations, and agreed with the consensus state- ments refl ected in the fi nal document. Feedback from external peer reviewers was obtained. Th e fi nal recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by: the V A Hepatitis C Resource Centers, the V A HCV Technical Advisory Group, the V A Gastrointestinal Field Advisory Committee, and the National Hepatitis C Program Offi ce. Additional resources pertaining to the care of the HCV- infected patient developed by the V A Hepatitis C Resource Cent-ers are available at www.hepatitis.va.gov . Recommendation: 1. All patients with chronic HCV infection should be evaluated for HCV antiviral treatment. (Class IIa, Level B). The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY Th e 2009 American Association for the Study of Liver Dis- eases Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment of Hepatitis C describe that HCV antiviral therapy is indicated for patients with chronic HCV who are at greatest risk for progression to cirrhosis. Th ese are patients with detect- able serum HCV RNA and liver histology showing signifi cant hepatic fi brosis (more than portal fi brosis, greater than stage 1) ( 18 ). Additional patient risk factors for increased fi brosis progres- sion include male gender, obesity, steatosis, heavy alcohol serum alanine transaminase, Pretreatment assessments are summarized in Table 2 . PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENTS Laboratory testing H CV antiviral therapy generally should be used only in patients with preserved liver function (serum bilirubin < 1.5 m g/ dl; Inter-national Normalized Ratio < 1.5; albumin > dl; and no evi-dence of hepatic encephalopathy or ascites), along with adequate hematological and biochemical parameters to tolerate therapy (hemoglobin > 12 g / dl; neutrophil count > 1.5 k / mm 3 ; platelet count > 75 k / mm 3 ; serum creatinine < 1.5 mg / dl). HCV genotype should be determined, as it infl uences the selection of therapy and treatment duration. Baseline viral load should be measured using VOLUME 104 | XXX 2012 www.amjgastro.com Table 1 .

REVIEW Management and Treatment of HCV Infection 3 Al ternative approaches, such as liver imaging and serum fi brosis markers, can be performed instead of a liver biopsy, although with careful recognition of their limitations ( 25 - 28 ). Psychiatric assessment All patients should be evaluated for psychiatric disorders, par-ticularly depression and suicide risk. Uncontrolled depression or active suicidal ideation is an absolute contraindication to IFN-based therapies. Patients with psychiatric disorders that are sta-ble or in remission may receive antiviral therapy. Standardized depression scales (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory or Patient Health Questionnaire) serve as useful tools for baseline and on-treatment psychiatric assessment. Patients may require referral to a psychiatrist or mental health professional for evaluation and therapy before initiation of antiviral treatment ( 29 ). Assessments for substance use disorders All patients should be evaluated for current alcohol and other sub-stance use, with validated screening instruments such as AUDIT-C or CAGE ( 30 ). Th e presence of current heavy alcohol use ( > 14 drinks per week for men or > 7 dr inks per week for women), binge alcohol use ( > 4 drinks per occasion at least once a month), or active injection drug use warrants referral to an addiction spe-cialist before treatment initiation. Urine toxicology screens for opiates, cocaine, or amphetamines may be used to supplement patient self-report. Alcohol and illicit drug use may aff ect HCV treatment adher- ence and response to therapy; however, on a case-by-case basis, individuals with active alcohol or substance use have been treated successfully ( 20 ). Integrated care models have demonstrated that patients who have recently become abstinent can also be treated successfully ( 31 ). Patients with pa st or recent substance abuse dis- orders oft en require close monitoring, and care should be coordi- nated with addiction specialists. Adherence Adherence to a treatment plan is imperative to achieve SVR and to reduce the potential for HCV resistance associated with DAA agents. Although improved SVR is achieved with the addition of BOC or TVR to PegIFN injections and oral RBV in genotype 1-infected patients, these regimens are complex, involve response-guided therapy (RGT), have a high pill burden (12 - 18 pills per day), confer a potential for viral resistance, and require frequent follow-up. Treatment adherence should be discussed with patients considering antiviral therapy, and the likelihood of adherence should be assessed. Evidence of prior non-adherence to medi-cal, psychiatric, or other therapies may predict non-adherence to HCV therapy. In patients who do not comply with pretreatment evaluations, treatment initiation should be deferred and attempts to improve adherence should be made. Evaluation for HIV co-infection Th ere is signifi cant overlap in the epidemiology of and risk fac- tors for HIV and HCV infections. Patients with a new diagnosis of HIV infection may benefi t from HIV antiretroviral therapy. The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGYa quantitative HCV RNA assay, so that treatment response can be assessed later (see the section \" Monitoring therapy \" ). Liver disease staging L iver biopsy is the best method for staging the degree of fi brosis (typically staged from 0 to 4 with the METAVIR, and 0 to 6 with the Ishak scoring system) and grading infl ammation (typically graded from 0 to 4) ( 22,24 ). In most cases, patients who initiate antiviral treatment for HCV should have more than portal fi bro- sis (greater than stage 1). Although liver biopsy is the preferred approach, it is invasive, is subject to sampling error, and carries a risk for severe complications ( 24 ). As such, it is not required before reaching a treatment decision, and may be less useful among patients in whom the results are unlikely to alter management ( 18 ). \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology Table 2 .

REVIEW HIV / HCV co-infection increases the risk of HCV-related liver damage, may infl uence the duration of HCV therapy and lowers the likelihood of SVR. Because of the potential clinical and public health benefi ts of HIV detection, all patients with HCV infection considering antiviral therapy should be off ered a voluntary HIV test if the HIV status has not been established previously. PegIFN and RBV treatment, SVR rate was 60 - 80 % with retreat-ment invo lving a HCV PI-containing regimen regardless of IL28B genotype. However, the results of these retrospective subgroup analyses should be viewed cautiously because of the small sample size and potential diff erences in demographic or clinical charac- teristics. / RBV \u00b1 DAA agent is recommended if results might alter treatment decisions. For example, patients who are reluctant to receive treat-ment may be better informed of their chance of achieving an SVR if they know their IL28B genotype. Aft er with PegIFN \u00b1 DAA agent), the decline in HCV RNA level during treatment (e.g., at weeks 4, 8, and 12) is more strongly asso-ciated with SVR than is IL28B can be performed before PegIFN - RBV therapy, with or without a PI, if the information on the prob-ability of treatment response or duration would alter treatment decisions (Class IIa, Level B). Pregnancy RB V is potentially teratogenic (Pregnancy Category X). A preg- nancy test should b e obtained from women of childbearing poten- tial before the initiation of HCV treatment, and women who arepregnant or attempting to conceive should not be treated. Preg-nancy also must be avoided in the partner of an HCV-infectedmale patient receiving treatment. Contraception for both partnersis required and should include at least one barrier method of con-traception (condoms or diaphragm plus spermicide) throughoutthe course of HCV treatment and for 6 months aft er treatment cessation ( 32,33 ). Routine monthly pregnancy tests should be per-formed during this time, and if a patient or their partner becomespregnant, RBV should be discontinued immediately and the preg-nancy should be reported to the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry at1-800-593-2214 or www.ribavirinpregnancyregistry.com . Although BOC and TVR are Pregnancy Category B agents, they must be used in combination with RBV . Due to drug - drug inter-actions (DDIs), oral contraceptives may be ineff ective because of a decrease in their plasma levels when they are co-administered with either BOC or TVR. Th us, two alternative eff ective methods of contraception, such as intrauterine devices and barrier meth-ods, should be used in at-risk patients and partners. Aft er TVR has been discontinued for 2 weeks, oral contraceptives may be used as one of two forms of birth control ( 34,35 ). Testing for IL28B genotype S ingle-nucleotide polymorphisms in chromosome 19, in the region of the IL28B gene (which encodes IFN- 3), are strong ly associated with the probability of achieving SVR with PegIFN and RBV tr eatment in genotype - 38 ). particular, 1-infected subjects carrying the favorable CC genotype at rs12979860 have an approximately two-fold increase in SVR to PegIFN and RBV , compared with those with the less favorable CT or TT genotypes. African Americans and Hispanics have a lower frequency of the CC genotype at rs12979860, which partially explains the lower SVR in these groups ( 36 - 38 ). In geno-type-2- or 3-infected patients, IL28B genotype does not appear to be strongly associated with SVR to PegIFN / RBV ( 39 - 41 analyses ve, genotype 1-infected patients with IL28B genotype CT TT have a higher SVR when treated with DAA-PegIFN and RBV as compared with PegIFN and RBV \u00ef BOC to PegIFN and RBV did not appear to improve SVR rates compared with PegIFN and RBV alone (80 - 82 and 78 % , respectively), whereas the addition of TVR to PegIFN and RBV resulted in higher SVR rates compared with PegIFN and RBV alone (90 and 64 % , r espectively). Among genotype 1-infected patients who failed The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY Concomitant medical conditions T reatment with IFN-based therapy may exacerbate the underlying autoimmune disorders. Patients with stable autoimmune thyroid disease or diabetes mellitus can generally be treated safely, but pso-riasis, Crohn 's dis ease or rheumatoid arthritis may be worsened by therapy, and should be co-managed with a specialist. HCV treat-ment should be administered with caution if liver histology reveals features suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis. Among patients with risk factors for retinal disease (e.g., hypertension or diabetes) or baseline visual abnormalities, a detailed eye exam should be per-formed before and during treatment as indicated, to identify any worsening of disease while receiving IFN ( Table 2 ). Recommendations in patients being considered for HCV therapy: 3. Patients should receive pretreatment assessments as summa- rized in Table 2 (Class I, Level B). 4. Pat ients with more than portal fi brosis, including those with compensated cirrhosis, who lack contraindications, should be considered for treatment (Class I, Level B). 5. Patients should be counseled on their likelihood of achieving SVR, based upon individual factors such as body mass index, genotype, race, stage of fi brosis, and viral load before initiating therapy (Class I, Level B). DEFINITIONS OF RESPONSE HCV RNA decline during therapy is highly associated with the likelihood of achieving an SVR. Attaining rapid virologic response (R VR), extended RVR (eRVR), and early virologic response (EVR) can provide guidance as to the likelihood of achieving an SVR (refer to Figure 1 ) ( 11 - 15 ). A sensitive real-time quantitative HCV RNA PCR assay should be used to assess viral response. Th e assay should have a lower limit of quantifi cation for HCV RNA VOLUME 104 | XXX 2012 www.amjgastro.com REVIEW Management and Treatment of HCV Infection 5 T wo HCV protease inhibitors, TVR and BOC, were approved by the FDA in May 2011, for use in combination with PegIFN and RBV in treatment-na\u00ef v e and -experienced HCV genotype 1-infected patients with compensated liver disease. Th ese oral agents selectively inhibit the HCV nonstructural 3 / 4A serine achieved in HCV 1-infected patients, following the addition of TVR or to PegIFN and RBV compared with PegIFN and RBV alone. Th e addition of an HCV PI to PegIFN and RBV represents a signifi cant advance in the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1. Therapy for previously untreated patients with genotype 1 infection: PegIFN alfa, RBV, and TVR or 3 trials have shown signifi cantly higher SVR in previously untreated compared with PegIFN and RBV alone; SVR 63 - 75 % compared with 38 - 44 % , respectively ( Table 4 ). SVR was achieved in 87 - 97 % of those who met RGT criteria for a shortened treatment duration (24 - 28 weeks). Approximately 44 - 65 % of patients qualifi ed for a shortened treatment duration if HCV RNA levels were unde-tectable ( < 10 - 15 IU / ml) at treatment weeks 4 and 12 with TVR-based regimens, or during treatment weeks 8 - 24 with BOC-based regimens. In traditionally diffi cult-to-treat populations, SVR was achieved in 42 - 62 % of African Americans and 52 - 62 % of cirrhot-ics with BOC- or TVR-based regimens, compared with 23 - 38 % SVR in those receiving PegIFN and RBV alone ( 11,12 ). Th e following pivotal and supplemental Phase 3 studies evalu- ated the safety and effi cacy of in combination with PegIFN and RBV ( Table 4 ): SPRINT-2 was designed to compare the effi cacy of BOC / PegIFN RBV lead-in to PegIFN / RBV alone. Triple therapy for 44 weeks also was compared with a response-guided approach. PegIFN alfa-2b (1.5 mcg / kg per week) and RBV (600 - 1,400 mg orally daily), followed by the addition of BOC (800 mg orally every 8 h) or placebo, was studied in 1,099 treatment-na\u00ef v e HCV genotype 1-infected patients, including 158 African American patients ( 11 ). Th e three treatment arms for randomization were: (i) PegIFN and RBV plus placebo for 48 weeks; (ii) 4 weeks of PegIFN and RBV , followed by the addition of BOC for 28 weeks of therapy in total, if HCV RNA was undetec-table from treatment weeks 8 through 24; if virus was detectable at any of these timepoints, PegIFN and RBV were continued until week 48; (iii) a 4-week PegIFN and RBV lead-in, followed by the addition of BOC for 44 weeks. SVR was achieved in 38 % , 63 % , and 66 % , respectively ( 11 ), demonstrating clear superiority in SVR with the BOC-containing regimens. Patients with bridging fi brosis or cirrhosis who received BOC / PegIFN / RBV for 44 weeks achieved higher SVR rates than those treated with triple therapy for only 24 weeks (42 vs. 34 % , respectively). Higher SVR rates were also achieved in African American patients in BOC-containing arms (42 - 53 % ) compared with control (23 % ). In late responders who were IFN responsive ( 1.0 log 10 dec line in HCV RNA) following the 4-week lead-in with PegIFN and RBV , but had detectable HCV RNA at week 8, treatment with BOC / PegIFN / RBV for 44 weeks The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGYof 25 IU / ml, and a lower limit of detection of 10 - 15 IU / ml. Th e lower limit of detection of < 10 - 15 IU / ml should be used for deci-sion-making to determine treatment duration and RGT ( 34,35 ). Careful virological monitoring and prompt assessment of HCV RNA results are necessary to determine when treatment is futile and should be halted to avoid the emergence of resistance. THERAPY AGAINST HEPATITIS C IN PATIENTS WITH GENOTYPE 1 INFECTION IFN-bas ed regimens will remain the \" backbone\" of HCV antiviral therapy for at least the next half decade. Either of the two pegylated IFNs, once weekly in combination with oral RBV were the standard of care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection from 2001 to 2011, yielding overall SVR rates of 42 - 46 % among treatment-na \u00ef ve patients ( 43,44 ). SVR rates were lower in specifi c patient populations, such as African Americans and cir- rhotics ( 45 ). Adverse events from either PegIFN alfa-2b, and RBV are similar. Th e optimal RBV dose appears to be between 800 and 1,400 mg per day, based on weight in combination with either PegIFN product ( Table 3 ) ( 46 ). Th e standard treatment duration of PegIFN and RBV has been 48 weeks, except in patients who are slow responders (detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks but undetectable HCV RNA by 24 weeks into treatment), in whom extending therapy to 72 weeks may be benefi cial ( 47,48 ). \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology 0 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 781Log HCV RNA (IU/ml)234567Relapse Partial responseNull responsePegIFN/RBV/DAA Weeks on = rapid responseRVR = rapid responseSVR EVR = early response4 Figure 1 . Patterns of virologic response related to treatment. Rapid viro- logic response (RVR): undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA at week 4. Extended RVR (eRVR): HCV RNA < 10 - 15 IU / ml at weeks 4 and 12, as de ned by clinical trials with telaprevir (TVR)-based therapy ( 12,13 ). Early virologic response (EVR): 2 log 10 reduction from baseline HCV RNA, but virus remains detectable (partial EVR) or is undetectable (complete EVR) at week 12. Early responders: HCV RNA < 10 - 15 IU / ml at week 8, as de nded by clinical trials with boceprevir (BOC)-based therapy ( 11,14 ). Partial response: 2 log 10 reduction from baseline HCV RNA at week 12, but virus remains detectable through week 24 or treatment end. Break-through: undetectable HCV RNA during treatment followed by appearance of HCV RNA, despite continued treatment. End-of-treatment response (ETR): undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment. Sustained virologic response (SVR): undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after treatment completion. Relapse: undetectable viremia during treatment and / or at the end of treatment, but subsequent viremia following treatment cessation. Non-response: detectable circulating HCV RNA throughout treatment. Null-response: < 2 log 10 reduction from baseline HCV of PegIFN and RBV . Th ose with eRVR were randomized at week 20 to either 4 or 28 additional weeks of PegIFN and RBV . Th e study included 540 treatment-na\u00ef v e genotype 1-infected patients. Patient characteristics when compared with ADV ANCE were as follows: more North Americans (94 vs. 60 % ), slightly older (51 vs. 49 years), a higher proportion of African Americans (14 vs. 9 % ) and cirrhotics (11 vs. 6 % ). Despite these diff erences, results were similar to ADV ANCE and con- fi rmed the effi cacy of shortened treatment duration if eRVR is achieved, with 92 % SVR in patients with eRVR treated for 24 weeks, and 88 % in those treated for 48 weeks. SVR occurred in 72 % overall, and rates were relatively high in cirrhotics (63 % ) and African Americans (60 % ). I n the Phase 3 studies, only small proportions of patients were African American (9 - 15 % ), Hispanic or Latino (10 - 11 % in TVR trials), Asian / other (4 % in BOC trials), or had bridging fi brosis or cirrhosis (6 - 16 % ). Additional prospective studies withDAA / PegIFN / RBV are needed to evaluate their effi cacy and tolerability in these subgroups of patients. Recommendations for therapy among treatment-na \u00ef ve patients with genotype 1 infection: 6. PegIFN alfa and RBV , in combination with BOC (800 mg orally every 7 - 9 h with food) or TVR (750 mg orally every 7 - 9 h with 20 g of fat) is the standard of care for most treatment-na\u00ef ve genotype 1-infected patients (Class I, Level A). 7. If a TVR-containing regimen is used in treatment-na\u00ef ve n on-cirrhotic patients who achieve eRVR, TVR should be discontin-ued at week 12 and PegIFN - RBV should be continued for an VOLUME 104 | XXX 2012 www.amjgastro.comresult ed in higher SVR than did treatment for only 24 weeks. In these patients, discontinuation of BOC at week 36, with continu-ation of PegIFN and RBV for another 12 weeks, was supported by modeling to limit adverse eff ects, and was recommended by the FDA, but this was not prospectively studied in SPRINT-2 ( 34 ). AD V ANCE compared 8 and 12 weeks of TVR / PegIFN / RBV , with subsequent PegIFN / RBV duration of 12 to 40 weeks deter-mined by a response-guided approach to PegIFN / RBV alone for 48 weeks. TVR (750 mg orally every 8 h) or placebo was combined with PegIFN alfa 2a (180 mcg once weekly) and RBV (1,000 or 1,200 mg orally daily) in 1,088 ve HCV genotype 1-infected three arms for randomization were: (i) TVR for 8 weeks plus PegIFN and RBV for 24 weeks if HCV RNA was unde-tectable at weeks 4 and 12 (eRVR), 48 weeks if not; (ii) TVR for 12 weeks plus PegIFN and RBV for 24 weeks if eRVR was achieved, 48 weeks if not; (iii) PegIFN and RBV plus placebo for 48 weeks. SVR was achieved in 69 % , 75 % , and 44 % , respectively, demonstrat-ing clear superiority of TVR-containing among cir- rhotics (62 % ) and African American patients (62 % ) compared with PegIFN and RBV alone (25 - 33 % ), and lower relapse and resistance rates were seen compared with the 8-week TVR-treated arm. SVR was not signifi cantly reduced in the 8-week TVR-containing arm compared with the 12-week arm (69 and 75 % , respectively) as such, TVR may be discontinued early if it is not well tolerated without compromising SVR.

Before the availability of HCV PIs, there were limited retreatment options for these patients. Retreat-ment strategies included PegIFN / RBV at higher doses and for longer durations, or the combination of daily consensus IFN and RBV . However, only 7 - 16 % of nonresponders to PegIFN / RBVachieved SVR using ). PegIFN RBV improved response rates compared with nonresponders, with SVR occuring in approximately 50 % of patients using these re-treatment strate- gies ( patients with HCV genotype 1 has produced higher SVR rates than with PegIFN and RBV alone.

Following a 4-week lead-in with PegIFN - RBV, the addition of BOC to Peg - RBV for 44 weeks achieved higher sustained virologic response (SVR) compared with 24 weeks in late responders (detectable HCV RNA at week 8) in the registration trials. \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY10 Yee et al . REVIEW patients were based on extrapolation. In RESPOND-2, HCV RNA decline aft er 4-week lead-in was a stronger predictor of SVR than was the historical treatment response. Th e following pivotal Phase 3 and supplemental studies evalu- ated the safety and effi cacy of retreatment of genotype 1 patients with TVR, in combination with PegIFN / RBV ( Table 4 ): REALIZE e valuated TVR (750 mg orally every 8 h) or placebo, in combination with PegIFN alfa-2a and RBV , in 663 patients PegIFN and RBV , including relapsers (53 % ), partial responders (19 % ), and null responders (27 % ) ( 13 ). For all ients, t he total treatment duration was 12 weeks with TVR or cebo, in combination with PegIFN and RBV for 48 weeks. One he two TVR arms used a 4-week lead-in with PegIFN and RBV ore the addition of TVR, and achieved a similar SVR rate as he arm without the lead-in (SVR 66 and 64 % , respectively). h TVR-containing arms achieved higher SVR than PegIFN RBV alone (17 % , P < 0.001). In TVR-containing arms, SVR achieved in a greater proportion of PegIFN and RBV relapsers - 88 % ) as compared with prior partial responders (54 - 59 % ) rior null responders (29 - 33 % ), compared with control (24 % , , and 5 % , respectively). Prior null responders with cirrhosis similar SVR rates with a TVR-based regimen compared with IFN and RBV alone (14 and 10 % , respectively). In contrast, rates were higher in null responders with minimal or bridg- fi brosis with a TVR-based regimen compared with PegIFN and alone (39 - 41 and 0 - 6 % , respectively). n a subanalysis of null responders, IFN responsiveness during 4-week lead-in before the addition of TVR was a predictor of . In patients who had < 0.5 log 10 decline and those with 0.5 - 1 10 dec line in baseline HCV RNA during the PegIFN and RBV -in, SVR occurred in only 6 and 20 % , respectively. In those h > 1 log 10 decline during the PegIFN / RBV in 44 - 80 % ( 53 ). Th e fact that the arm with a 4-week PegIFN and RBV lead-in before the addition of TVR allows IFN responsiveness to be determined raises the issue of whether this approach could be used with TVR in general. RES POND-2 evaluated BOC (800 mg orally every 8 h) or placebo, and PegIFN alfa-2b and RBV in 403 patients who had previously failed PegIFN and RBV , specifi cally prior partial responders and relapsers ( 14 ). Previous null responders were not included in the trial. Patients were randomized 1:2:2 to treatment in 3 arms: (i) PegIFN and RBV plus placebo for 48 weeks; (ii) a 4-week PegIFN and RBV lead-in, followed by the addition of BOC, with 32 weeks of triple therapy if HCV RNA was undetectable at treatment weeks 8 and 12; if virus was detectable at week 8, but undetectable at week 12, triple therapy was continued to week 32, at which time BOC was discontinued, and PegIFN and RBV were continued until week 48 (RGT arm); (iii) a 4-week PegIFN and RBV lead-in, RBV . SVR rates were signifi cantly higher in the BOC-containing arms than in the arm receiving PegIFN and RBV (SVR 59 % RGT, 66 % BOC / PegIFN / RBV for 44 weeks, 21 % control). PegIFN and RBV relapsers achieved higher SVR rates than prior partial responders in the BOC-treated arms (SVR 69 - 75 and 40 - 52 % , respectively) and in the control arms (SVR 29 % and 7 % , respectively). Th e relapse rate was 12 % in the BOC-containing The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY arms vs. 32 % for control. SVR was lower among patients with < 1.0 log 10 decline in HCV RNA than in those with > 1.0 log 10 decline in HCV RNA at treatment week 4 aft er a lead-in with PegIFN / RBV (SVR 33 - 34 % BOC / PegIFN / RBV and 0 % control vs. SVR 73 - 79 % BOC / PegIFN / RBV and 25 % control, respectively).

If a BOC-containing regimen is used for re-treatment of non-cirrhotic prior partial responders or relapsers, the recommended treatment duration is 36 weeks if HCV RNA is undetectable from weeks 8 to 24. If HCV RNA is detectable at week 12, but < 100 IU / ml, and is undetectable from weeks 24 to 36, BOC can be dis-continued at week 36 and PegIFN - RBV can be continued for an additio nal 12 weeks (refer to Fig ure 3 ; Class I, Level B). a BOC-containing regimen is used for re-treatment in cir- , the treatment duration is 48 weeks if HCV RNA is detect- week 12, but < 100 IU / ml, and becomes undetectable from 24 to 36 (refer to Figure 3 ; Class I, Level B).

Once BOC is combined with PegIFN - RBV , BOC remains part of triple therapy for the majority of the treatment duration based on RGT ( Figure 3 ). TVR is ad- ministered with PegIFN and RBV for the fi rst 12 weeks, followed by PegIFN and RBV alone, for a duration based on RGT ( Figure 2 ). VOLUME 104 | XXX 2012 www.amjgastro.com REVIEW Management and Treatment of HCV Infection 11 Anemia . In clinical trials, signifi can t anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g / dl) occurred nearly twice as frequently in BOC- or TVR-treated patients than in patients receiving PegIFN and RBV alone. Th is led to an additional decrease in hemoglobin levels of approximately 1 - 1.5 g / dl, which resulted in greater RBV dose interruptions and use of growth factors. In the Phase 3 TVR trials, initial dose reduc-tion of RBV to 600 mg daily was mandated, and use of erythropoi-etin generally was prohibited. In contrast, RBV dose reductions occurred in 200 mg decrements, and erythropoietin use was allowed in the Phase 3 BOC tria ls. On the basis of retrospec- tive subanalyses, RBV dose reduction alone did not appear to compromise SVR rates ( 61 - 63 ). Initial management of HCV treatment-related anemia should consist of RBV dose reduction The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGYAddi tional studies are needed to confi rm whether TVR given at 1,225 mg twice daily is as eff ective as 750 mg every 7 - 9 h ( 55 ). Drug - dru g interactions . BOC and TVR are strong CYP3A and CYP3A substrates. Clinicians should be caref DIs, and should make therapeutic substitutions befor C- or TVR-containing regimens (e.g., replace simvas pravastatin; to table entary Materials ) ( 34,35 ).

If RBV is stopped for 7 days or more in patients who are concomitantly receiving BOC or TVR, then BOC or TVR also should be permanently discontinued to avoid the potential development of HCV-resistant variants. P harmacological considerations . Patients should be instructed not to take a missed dose if it is within 2 h or less of the next sched-uled BOC dose, or within 4 h or less of the next scheduled TVR dose ( 34,35 ). TVR and BOC should be administered with food, three times daily, 7 - 9 h apart. TVR must be taken with food that contains approximately 20 g of fat (e.g., bagel with cream cheese, \u00bd cup nuts, 3 tablespoons peanut butter, 1 cup ice-cream, 2 oz American or cheddar cheese, 2 oz potato chips, or 1 \u00bd cup trail mix). PegIFN should be refrigerated (36 - 46 \u00b0 F) during storage ( 57,58 ). BOC should be refrigerated (36 - 46 \u00b0 F) during storage, or stored at room temperature up to 77 \u00b0 F for up to 3 months ( 34 ). TVR can be stored at room temperature between 59 - 86 \u00b0 F ( 35 ). Adverse effects Almost all patients receiving hepatitis C antiviral therapy will expe-rience some treatment-related adverse eff ects. Close monitoring is crucial throughout treatment. Poor tolerability can lead to early treat ment discontinuation. Clinicians can promote adherence by counseling patients on the recognition and management of treat-ment-related adverse eff ects. Patients should be reassured that most treatment-related adverse eff ects can be minimized or managed. Th e addition of DAA agents to PegIFN and RBV is associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, requiring discon-tinuation of the DAA agent in 10 - 21 % of patients ( 11 - 14,59,60 ). Adverse events with increased frequency among subjects receiving a DAA agent include anemia, neutropenia (BOC), dysgeusia anal discomfort (TVR) ( 11 - 14 ). On the basis of the TVR adverse eff ect profi le, BOC in combination with PegIFN - RBV may be more appropriate in patients with skin disorders (e.g., psoriasis) or gout. \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology Table 5 .

Rash oft en devel- n 1 month of TVR initiation, and required 4 - 6 weeks discontinuation to resolve. Rashes were primarily s, maculopapular, or papular-lichenoid and pruritic. moderate rash can be treated with oral antihistamines ical corticosteroids; systemic steroids are contraindi- mbination with TVR. If rash becomes severe ( > 50 % tropenia sh man ufactu incidence oper mm 3 ) in coof body surface area), TVR should be discontinued. All HCV therapy should be discontinued immediately for any rash asso-ciated with signifi cant systemic symptoms, including evidence of internal organ involvement (e.g., hepatitis, nephritis), facial edema, mucous membrane erosions or ulceration target lesions, epidermal detachment, vesicles, or bullae. Th e patient should be promptly referred for urgent medical care and dermatological consultation ( 35 ). Drug Rash The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY with Eosino philia and Systemic Symptoms and Stevens Johnson Syndrome occurred in < 1 % of TVR-treated patients ( 35 ). Anorectal signs and symptoms . symptoms, variously described as hemorrhoids, anorectal discomfort, anal pruritus, and rectal burning, were reported by approximately 25 % of patients receiving TVR ( 12,35 ). Th e symptoms generally were were mild to moderate in severity and rarely required treatment discontinuation. Symptomatic treatment with topical steroids or local anesthetic can be considered. Ele vated uric acid levels . Elevated uric acid levels occurred in up to 73 % of patients receiving TVR, with onset during the fi rst 2 weeks of therapy ( 12,13,35 ). In patients receiving TVR, uric acid levels should be measured at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and as clinically indicated ( 35 ). Treatment with allopurinol can be con-sidered if uric acid level is > 10 mg / dl. Elevated bilirubin levels . Elevated bilirubin levels occurred more frequently in TVR-treated patients than in those treated with PegIFN - RBV alone (41 and 28 % , respectively), but were not accompanied by liver dysfunction ( 35 ). Th e steepest increase in bilirubin occurred during the fi rst 1 - 2 weeks of TVR therapy. In patients receiving TVR, bilirubin levels should be measured at baseline, at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and as clinically indicated ( 35 ). Recommendations for dose modifi cation: 17. PegIFN alfa and RBV doses should be reduced in response to decreases in white blood cells, neutrophils, hemoglobin, or platelets, as outlined in Table 5 (Class I, Level A). 18. If RBV is stopped for 7 days or more in patients who are concomitantly receiving BOC or TVR, then the PI also should be permanently discontinued (Class I, Level A). 19. HCV PIs should be either continued at full dose or discontin-ued (Class I, Level A). 20. Initial management of HCV treatment-related anemia should consist of RBV dose reduction in a symptomatic patient with a hemoglobin < 10g / dl, or as clinically indicated.

Initial management of HCV treatment-related neutropenia should consist o f PegIFN dose reduction for an ANC < 750, or as clinically indicated. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor sh ould not be given as primary therapy to prevent PegIFN alfa dose reductions (Class I, Level C). Monitoring therapy P atients with a history of depression should be followed closely for recurrence of depression while receiving PegIFN therapy. Patients should also receive a clinical evaluation by a mental health professional if depression scores increase during treatment. Standardized depression screening instruments can be used to supplement the clinical exam. Periodic laboratory monitoring of hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count with diff erential, platelet count, and serum alanine transaminase is necessary in all patients receiving hepatitis C antiviral therapy (refer to \"M onitoring Table\" in Supplementary Materials ). Increasing the frequency of these tests is advised in patients with signifi cant reductions in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, or platelet count, or in those who experience signifi cant clinical adverse events. Quantitative and / or qualitative HCV RNA assays should be per- formed at weeks 4, 8 (with BOC-containing regimens), 12, and 24 of treatment, at the end-of-treatment, and 24 weeks aft er completion of therapy. Patients receiving BOC- or TVR-containing regimens may need additional HCV RNA determinations as clinically indicated. HCV resistance . Hepatitis C resistance is a new clinical entity with the introduction of PIs and other DAA agents. HCV resist- ance is defi ned as the selection of viral variants that have altered binding to the drug target and are less susceptible to the drug ' s inhibitory activity ( 66 ). HCV resistant viruses carrying ami-no acid changes in the nonstructural 3 / 4A position have been described in vitro a nd in vivo with BOC and TVR ( 67 - 69 ). Resist- an t viruses can develop with all genotype 1 subtypes, but are more likely to occur in patients with genotype 1a than in those with genotype 1b, when BOC or TVR ( 70 ). More impor-tantly, resistant viruses develop in most patients within 7 days of DAA use as monotherapy. Consequently, BOC and TVR should never be used without PegIFN - RBV . Patients with poor IFN response ( < 1.0 log 10 decline in HCV RNA) to the PegIFN and RBV lead-in had lower SVR rates and higher resistance rates than IFN-sensitive patients. A good viro-logic response to the 4-week PegIFN and RBV lead-in, defi ned by a 1.0 log 10 decline in HCV RNA, was a strong predictor of SVR. Patients without such a response had lower SVR and higher resistance rates ( 11,53 ). In patients with a < 1.0 log 10 decline in HCV RNA during the lead-in and in prior null responders, consideration should be given as to whether the benefi ts of triple therapy outweigh the potential risk of developing resistance / cross-resistance to future therapies, along with determining whether the patient can wait for the availability of better treatment options. \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology Among patients who develop resistant viruses, the resistant vari- ants are no longer detectable in the serum approximately 1 - 2 years aft er discontinuing BOC or TVR ( 66 - 68 ). However, due to limi- tations of current tests for resistance, it is unclear whether small numbers of resistant viruses continue to be present for prolonged periods of time. Because of the similar resistant mutations to BOC and TVR, patients who develop resistance when treated with one PI (e.g., BOC) should not be treated with the other PI (e.g., TVR), because of the high likelihood of having or developing cross resist-ance to the second PI. Th ere are no commercial assays to test for the presence of resist- ant viruses before or during treatment ( 66 ). Th e only way to sus- pect that a patient has developed a resistant virus is to monitor for HCV RNA rebound ( > 1 log 10 incr ease from the nadir HCV RNA) during treatment. Criteria for failure to respond adequately to BOC or TVR, necessitating stopping of the PI, as outlined in the package insert are given below (refer to section \" Futility (stopping) rules \" ) ( 34,35 ). Stopping rules because of failure to respond are the same for treatment-na \u00ef ve and for treatment-experienced patients. Futility (stopping) rules . Viral breakthrough with trip an infrequent event, particularly among patients ced eRVR with TVR-containing regimens or earl V RNA < 10 - 15 IU / ml by treatment week 8) w taining regimens ( 11,12 ).

In addition, BOC or TVR must be dis manently if RBV is stopped for longer than 7 day notherapy may be continued if appropriate (refer to egIFN and RBV (without BOC or TVR) can be co ents with presumed resistant viruses, although the of achieving an SVR is low.

Recommendations for treatment monitoring: 22. Patients should be monitored for treatment-related adverse eff ects at intervals of at least 2 weeks early in the course of therapy, and at intervals of 1 - 2 months during treatment as clinically indicated (Class I, Level C). 23. Patient adherence to therapy should be assessed at every visit (Class I, Level C). 24. Patients should be evaluated for depression, suicidal idea-tion, alcohol, and illicit drug use at each visit (Class I, Level C). 25. Patients should be counseled about avoiding pregnancy by using two forms of contraception during treatment and for 6 months The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY14 Yee et al .

If virologic failure occurs with a BOC- or TVR-containing regimen, the other PI must not be substituted (Class I, Level C). GROUPS WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THERAPY Th e following recommendations for each subgroup of patients have taken into account the natural history of disease, the likelihood of achieving an SVR, and the adverse eff ects and need for dose discon- tinuations with treatment. Current management of patients with genotype 2, 3 or 4 infection, end-stage renal disease and other popu-lations are available online in Supplementary Materials . Refer to the Appendix for summary recommendations in these groups. PegIFN - RBV therapy without a PI for HCV genotype 1- infected patients Th ere are some HCV genotype 1-infected patients who may be treated without an HCV PI in whom SVR rates to PegIFN - RBV alone are predicted to be very good ( 71 ). Patients who experience an RVR to the 4-week lead-in with PegIFN - RBV , those who have a low baseline HCV RNA ( < 400,000 IU / ml), or those who have the IL-28B CC genotype have predicted sustained response rates toPegIFN - RBV of 60 - 90 % ( 36,42,71 ). Treatment options for patients who were previously intolerant to therapy include PegIFN alon e, or PegIFN with reduced doses of RBV ( 72,73 ). Treatment should be discontinued if there is < 2 log 10 decline in HCV RNA at week 12 and / or if HCV RNA remains dectectable at week 24. Recommendations for PegIFN alfa with or without RBV treat-ment in genotype 1 patients: 30. PegIFN alfa monotherapy may be used to treat patients with contraindications to RBV (Class I, Level A). The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY 31. F or patients who achieve RVR and have a low baseline viral load (HCV RNA < 400,000 IU / ml), 24-weeks of treatment with PegIFN - RBV may be suffi cient (Class I, Level B). Patients with minimal histological evidence of liver disease P atients with grade 1 infl ammation and minimal fi brosis are at lower risk for developing advanced liver disease in the near future, and observation without treatment may be an option. Liver biopsy may be repeated aft er 5 years if results would change management. Despite minimal fi brosis, HCV treatment should be provided if patients desire treatment or have extrahepatic manifestations (leukocytoclastic vasculitis, membranoproliferative glomerulone-phritis, symptomatic Recommendations in patients with mild disease: 32. Treatment can be deferred in patients with minimal infl amma- tion and / or minimal portal fi brosis on liver biopsy (Class I, Level B). Patients with compensated cirrhosis P atients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) can be treated successfully with HCV antiviral agents, but experience higher rates of adverse events and lower SVR com-pared with patients with early-stage disease ( 11,12,43,44,75,76 ). Th e decision to treat should be individualized in these patients. Among treatment-na \u00ef ve genotype 1-infected patients with bridging fi with BOC / PegIFN / RBV , higher SVR was achieved with 48 weeks of treatment as compared with 28 weeks of treatment (SVR 52 and 41 % , respec-tively) or to control (SVR 38 % PegIFN - RBV , SVR was achieved in 62 % compared with 33 % in the control arm ( 12 ). In treatment-experienced patients with advanced fi brosis (METAVIR stage 3 or 4), who were re-treated with a BOC-containing regimen in RESPOND-2, SVR occurred in 68 % , although 64 % of patients in the trial were prior relapsers, 36 % were prior partial responders, and null responders were not included. In treatment-experienced patients with METAVIR stage 3 or 4 fi brosis, who were re-treated with a TVR-containing regimen in REALIZE, SVR rates were 84 - 85 % in prior relapsers, 34 - 56 % in partial responders, and 14 - 39 % in null responders. Child-Pugh Class B or C patients (score 7) were excluded from the PI trials. (refer to Supplementary Materials f or additional information on PegIFN and RBV treatment in this population). I mprovements in liver histology and clinical outcomes occur among patients with cirrhosis who achieve SVR ( 9,10,77 - 79 ). Despite achieving SVR, patients with cirrhosis remain at risk for developing HCC, and routine screening for HCC should continue. Recommendations in patients with cirrhosis: 33. HCV genotype 1-infected patients with compensated cirrho-sis (Child-Pugh Class < 7), adequate neutrophils ( > 1.5 k / mm 3 ), and adequat e platelet coun ts ( > 75 k / mm 3 ) s hould be considered for treatment with BOC (for 44 weeks) or TVR (for 12 weeks) combined with PegIFN - RBV at standard doses for 48 weeks (Class I, Level B).

Al l patients with chronic HCV infection should be evaluated for HCV antiviral treatment. (Class IIa, Level B) Re commendation for IL28 genotype testing: 2 IL28B gen otype testing can be performed before PegIFN - RBV therapy with or without a PI, if the information on the probabil ity of treatment response or duration would alter treatment decisions (Class IIa, Level B). Recommendations in patients being considered for HCV therapy: 3. Patients should receive pretreatment assessments as summarized in Table 2 (Clas s I, Level B). 4. Patients with more than portal fi brosis, including those with compensated cirrhosis, who lack contraindicatio ns, should be considered for treatment (Class I, Level B). 5. Patients should be counseled on their likelihood of achieving SVR, based upon individual factors such as body mass index, g enotype, race, stage of fi brosis, and viral load before initiating therapy (Class I, Level B). Recommendations for therapy for treatment-na \u00efve pa tients with genotype 1 infection: 6. alfa and RBV , in combination with BOC (800 mg orally every 7 - 9 h with food) or TVR (750 mg orally every 7 - 9 h wi th 20 g of fat), is the standard of care for most treatment-na\u00ef ve gen otype 1-infected patients (Class I, Level A). 7. I f a TVR-containing regimen is used in treatment-na\u00ef ve n oncirrhotic patients who achieve eRVR, TVR should be discontinued at week 12 and PegIFN - RBV should be continued for an additional 12 weeks. If HCV RNA is detectable, but < 1,000 IU / ml a t treatment week 4, and remains < 1,000 IU/m l or becomes undetectable by week 12, TVR should be discontinued at week 12, and PegIFN and RBV can be continued for another 36 weeks (refer to Figure 2 ; Class I, Level A). 8. I f a TVR-containing regimen is used in treatment-na\u00ef ve ci rrhotics who achieve an HCV RNA that is undetectable or < 1,000 IU / m l r ; - s t s r lat treatment weeks 4 and 12, TVR should be discontinued at week 12, and PegIFN - RBV can be continued for another 36 weeks (ref er to Fig u re 2; Clas s I, Level A). 9. I f a BOC-containing regimen is used in treatment-na\u00ef ve n oncirrhotics, if HCV RNA declines by 1 log 10 d uring the 4-week lead-in, and HCV RNA is undetectable at weeks 8 - 24, BOC - PegIFN - RBV for 24 weeks is suffi cient. If HCV RNA is detectable at week 8, but < 100 IU / ml at week 12 and negative at week 24, BOC - PegIFN - RBV should be continued until week 36, followed by PegIFN - RBV alon e fo 12 more weeks. If HCV RNA declines by < 1 log 10 during the lead-in, BOC - PegIFN - RBV can be contined for 44 weeks (refer to Figure 3 Class I, Level A). 10. If a BOC-containing regimen is used in treatment-na \u00ef ve cirrhotics, 44 weeks of BOC - PegIFN - RBV is required aft er the 4-week lead-in (refer to Figure 3 ; Class I, Level A). Recommendations for treatment of nonresponders and relapsers with genotype 1 infection: 11. For patients previously PegIFN RBV retreatment with BOC be considered, particul arly in patients who were relapsers (Class I, Level A). 12. I f a BOC-containing regimen is used for re-treatment of noncirrhotic prior partial responders or relapsers, the recommende d treat ment duration is 36 weeks if HCV RNA is undetectable from weeks 8 - 24. If HCV RNA is detectable at week 12, but < 100 I U / ml and is undetectable from weeks 24 - 36, BOC can be discontinued at week 36 and PegIFN - RBV can be continued for an additional 12 w eek (refer to Figure 3 ; Class I, Level B). 13. If a BOC-containing regimen is used for re-treatment in cirrhotics, the treatment duration is 48 weeks if HCV RNA is detec table a week 12, but < 100 IU / ml, and becomes undetectable from weeks 24 - 36 (refer to Figure 3 ; Class I, Level B). 14. If a BOC-containing regimen is used for re-treatment of prior null responders, the treatment duration is 48 weeks if HCV R NA i detectable at week 12, but < 100 IU / ml, and becomes undetectable from weeks 24 - 36 (refer to Figure 3 ; Class II, Level C). 15. If a TVR-containing regimen is used for re-treatment of prior relapsers, and HCV RNA is undetectable from weeks 4 and 12, TVR should be discontinued at week 12 and PegIFN - RBV should be continued for an additional 12 weeks. If HCV RNA is detectable, bu t < 1000 IU / ml at week 4 and / or 12, TVR can be discontinued at week 12, and PegIFN - RBV can be continued for an additional 36 weeks (refeto Figure 2 ; Class I, Level B). 16. If a TVR-containing regimen is used for re-treatment of prior partial responders or null responders, and HCV RNA is < 1000 IU / m at weeks 4 and 12, TVR should be discontinued at week 12 and PegIFN alfa plus RBV should be continued for an additional 36 week s (refer to Figure 2 ; Class I, Level B). The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY VOLUME 104 | XXX 2012 www.amjgastro.com APPENDIX REVIEW Management and Treatment of HCV Infection 19 Re commendations for dose modifi cation: 17. P egIFN alfa and RBV doses should be reduced in response to decreases in white blood cells, neutrophils, hemoglobin or plat elets, as outlined in Table 5 (Class I, Level A). 18. If RBV is stopped for 7 days or more in patients who are concomitantly receiving BOC or TVR, then the PI also should be pe rmanently discontinued (Class I, Level A). 19. HCV PIs should be either continued at full dose or discontinued (Class I, Level A). 20. I nitial management of HCV treatment-related anemia should consist of RBV dose reduction in a symptomatic patient with a he mo- globin < 10 g / dl, or as clinically indicated. Erythropoietin may be administered in patients with symptomatic anemia r elated to PegIFN - RB V therapy with or without BOC / TVR to limit anemia-related RBV dose reductions or dose discontinuations (Class II, Level C) . 21. Initial management of HCV treatment-related neutropenia should consist of PegIFN dose reduction for an ANC < 750, o r as clini- cally indicated. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should not be given as primary therapy to prevent PegIFN alfa dose reduc tions (Class I, Level C). Re commendations for treatment monitoring: 22. Patients should be monitored for treatment-related adverse eff ects at intervals of at least 2 weeks early in the course of therapy, and at intervals of 1 - 2 months during treatment as clinically indicated (Class I, Level C). 23. Patient adherence to therapy should be assessed at every visit (Class I, Level C). 24. Patients should be evaluated for depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol, and illicit drug use at each visit (Class I, Leve l C). 25. P atients should be counseled about avoi ding pregnancy by using two forms of contraception during treatment and for 6 months post-treatment, and pregnancy tests should be performed as indicated in (refer to \" Monitoring Table \" in Supplementary Materials ). If a patient is receiving a BOC- or TVR-containing regimen, two alternative eff ective methods of contraception, such as intrauterine devices and barrier methods, should be used in at-risk patients and partners, during and for at least 6 months aft er treatment (Class I, Level B). 26. Serum markers of biochemical and virologic response should be measured, and treatment-related adverse eff ects monitored at inter- vals as outlined (refer to \"M onitoring Table \" in Supplementary Materials ; Clas s I, Level C). 27. In patients receiving TVR - PegIFN - RBV , all treatment should be stopped if any of the following occur: (1) HCV RNA level > 1,000 IU / ml at week 4 or 12; or (2) detectable HCV RNA levels at week 24 or at any timepoint thereaft er; or (3) HCV RNA rebounds at ( 1 log10 increase from the nadir HCV RNA) (Class I, Level C). 28. I n patients receiving BOC - PegIFN - RBV , all treatment should be stopped if any of the following occur: (1) HCV RNA level 100 IU / ml at week 12 with a BOC-containing regimen; or (2) detectable HCV RNA levels at week 24 or at any timepoint thereaft er; or (3) HCV RNA rebounds at log10 i ncrease from the nadir HCV RNA; Class I, Level C). 29. If virologic failure occurs with a BOC- or TVR-containing regimen, the other PI must not be substituted (Class I, Level C) . Recommendations for PegIFN alfa with or without RBV treatment in genotype 1 patients: 30. PegIFN alfa monotherapy may be used to treat patients with contraindications to RBV (Class I, Level A). 31. For patients who achieve RVR and have a low baseline viral load (HCV RNA < 400,000 IU / ml), 24-weeks of treatment with PegIFN - RBV may be suffi cient (Class I, Level B). Recommendations in patients with mild disease: 32. T reatment can be deferred in patients with minimal infl ammation and / or minimal portal fi brosis on liver biopsy (Class I, Level B). Re commendations in patients with cirrhosis: 33. HCV genotype 1-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class < 7), adequate neutrophils ( > 1.5 k / mm 3 ), and adequate platelet counts ( > 75 k / mm3 ) should be considered for treatment with BOC (for 44 weeks) or TVR (for 12 weeks) combined with PegIFN - RBV at standard doses for 48 weeks (Class I, Level B). 34. P atients with cirrhosis remain at risk for HCC and should undergo routine screening regardless of viral clearance status, in accordance with current guidelines (Class I, Level B). Re commendation in African Americans: 35. B OC or TVR combined with PegIFN - RBV is the standard of care for genotype 1-infected African American patients (Class I, Level A). Recommendations for treatment-na\u00ef ve and -experienced patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection: 36. Treatment-na\u00ef ve pa tients should be treated with PegIFN - RBV for 24 weeks (Class I, Level A). 37. For patients with low viral load (HCV RNA < 600,000 IU / ml) and mild fi brosis who achieve a RVR, 12 - 18 weeks of treatment may be suffi cient (Class I, Level A). \u00a9 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology The American Journal of GASTROENTEROLOGY20 Yee et al . REVIEW 38. For patients with genotype 3 infection and a high HCV RNA ( > 600,000 IU / ml), steatosis or advanced fi brosis, treatment beyond 24 weeks may improve response (Class I, Level B). 39. Re treatment duration is 48 weeks (Class I, Level A). Recommendations in patients with genotype 4 infection: 40. A ppropriate candidates with HCV genotype 4 infection should be treated with PegIFN alfa-2a 180 mcg per week or PegIFN alfa -2b 1.5 mcg / kg per week, plus RBV up to 1,400 mg per day for 48 weeks (Class I, Level A). Re commendations in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: 41. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Class I, Level B). 42. Antiviral therapy is contraindicated in most patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Class II, Level B). 43. IFN-based therapy in combination with RBV may be considered in patients awaiting liver transplantation with a Child-Pugh sc o r e < 7 and a MELD score 18 (Class I, Level A). 44. I f antiviral therapy is undertaken, reduced IFN doses should be used and growth factors can be given to counteract treatme nt- associated cytopenias (Class II, Level B). Re commendations in patients following solid organ transplantation: 45. IFN-base d antiviral therapy is contraindicated following heart, lung or kidney transplantation (Class III, Level C). 46. In patients with biopsy-proven chronic HCV disease following liver transplantation, PegIFN - RBV for 48 weeks may be consi dered (Class IIa, Level B). 47. T oxicities of antiviral therapy should be managed with frequent monitoring, dose reductions, and growth factor support (Cl ass IIa, Level B). 48. P ost-liver transplant patients on antiviral therapy should be monitored closely for evidence of rejection, and antiviral t herapy should be stopped if rejection is documented (Class IIa, Level B). 49. Pr e-emptive antiviral therapy early post-t ransplantation in patients without histolog ical recurrence should be avoided (Cl ass IIa, Level B). Recommendations in patients with renal disease: 50. P atients should be considered for antiviral therapy with IFN (standard or pegylated) with RBV at modifi ed doses ( Table 3; Clas s IIa, Level C). 51. A ntiviral therapy for HCV treatment is not recommended in patients post-renal transplant; however, it may be considered if patients develop fi brosing cholestatic hepatitis (Class III, Level C). Re commendations in patients with comorbid conditions: 52. I n patients with limited life expectancy from comorbid conditions, antiviral therapy is not recommended (Class I, Level C) . 53. I n patients with signifi cant comorbid conditions that will be exacerbated by PegIFN - RBV , treatment should be deferred (Class I, Level C). Re commendations for patients on methadone: 54. A ntiviral therapy should be off ered to patients enrolled in a methadone maintenance program who meet criteria for therapy (Class I, Level A). 55. T reatment should be coordinated between HCV treatment providers and substance abuse specialists (Class I, Level B). Re commendations in patients with ongoing alcohol use: 56. P atients should be encouraged to decrease alcohol consumption or to abstain, and should be referred for behavioral intervention to reduce alcohol use (Class I, Level B). 57. A ntiviral therapy should be off ered to patients who are otherwise appropriate candidates, regardless of prior alcohol use (Class I, Level B). 58. A lcohol consumption should be discouraged during antiviral treatment because alcohol reduces adherence and treatment respo nse (Class I, Level B). Recommendations in obese patients and those with hepatic steatosis: 59. P atients with a body mass index > 30 should be considered for antiviral treatment (Class I, Level A).

Recommendations in patients with HIV-HCV coinfection: 61. P atients with controlled HIV infection and evidence of liver disease on biopsy should be considered for HCV antiviral ther apy (Class I, Level B). 62. Patients should be treated with PegIFN - RBV at doses similar to those with HCV monoinfection (Class I, Level B). 63. Patients should be treated with PegIFN - RBV for 48 weeks, regardless of genotype (Class I, Level A). Recommendations in patients with acute HCV infection: 64. Patients should be observed for a period of 8 - 20 weeks from time of initial exposure to monitor for spontaneous resoluti on of infection (Class I, Level C). 65. For those who fail to resolve infection spontaneously, treatment should be initiated with PegIFN alfa, with or without RBV for 24 - 48 weeks, based on genotype and HCV RNA response during therapy (Class I, Level B).
