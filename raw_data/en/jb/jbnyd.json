Naturopathic doctors are trained as primary care practitioners, with a focus on treating acute and chronic health problems through prevention, careful assessment, diagnosis and a range of natural approaches to care. Four years of post-graduate training covers conventional medical sciences-- anatomy, physiology, pathology, microbiology, immunology etc.-- as well as a detailed study of natural therapies including nutrition, herbs, supplements and lifestyle. Naturopathic medicine goes deeper than Western medicine, with the ability to understand and treat \"mystery\" symptoms often misdiagnosed by Western medical doctors. Naturopathic doctors achieve this through a blend of age-old holistic healing and advanced modern techniques, providing a wide array of tools for patient care. Call us to book an appointment. "}
