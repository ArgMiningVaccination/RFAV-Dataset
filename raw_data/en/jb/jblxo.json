Wellness is a state of well-being that comes from proactively seeking ways to live a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. Wellness is not simply being free from illness, but a holistic integration of all dimensions of life that help you achieve your maximum potential and enrich the quality of your life. Wellness is a holistic state of physical, mental, and social wellbeing is an ancient concept that has been practiced in Indian and Chinese cultures for more than 5000 years.

Since the late 18th century, many alternative medical care methods with a holistic approach have evolved, including homeopathy, osteopathy, naturopathy, and chiropractic treatment. These systems of healthcare became hugely popular in Europe and the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Interest in these systems of medicine waned with the rise of modern evidence-based medicine in the mid-20th century. In the 21st century, with an increase in chronic lifestyle diseases and healthcare costs, the focus has once again shifted towards holistic wellness. According to the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness economy grew to become a USD 4.5 trillion dollar industry by 2017. Why is wellness so important?
