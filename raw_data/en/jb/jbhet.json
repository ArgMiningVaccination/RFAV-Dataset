Revised: Nov 2022 SIDE EFFECTS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the Prescribing Information: [Cytokine](https://www.rxlist.com/cytokine/definition.htm)Release Syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Lymphopenia [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Hypersensitivity Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Placebo-Controlled Study In Patients With Stage 2 Type 1 Diabetes The data in Table 1 are derived from the placebo-controlled study (Study TN-10) in patients aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D) [see Clinical Studies]. These data reflect exposure of 44 patients of whom 93% completed the full 14-day treatment course. Pool Of Five Controlled Clinical Studies In Stage 2 Type 1 Diabetes And In An Unapproved Population Adverse reactions in TZIELD-treated patients were also evaluated in a larger pool of adult and pediatric patients who participated in five controlled clinical studies (including Study TN-10 described above): - One study in patients with Stage 2 T1D (Study TN-10) [see Clinical Studies], - Three placebo-controlled studies in an unapproved population, - One open-label standard-of-care controlled study of TZIELD in an unapproved population. In this pool: - 773 patients received TZIELD (44 patients with Stage 2 TID and 729 patients from an unapproved population), and - 245 patients received either placebo or [standard of care](https://www.rxlist.com/standard_of_care/definition.htm)control (32 patients with Stage 2 T1D and 213 patients from an unapproved population). In these studies, 436 patients received a 14-day dosing regimen of TZIELD with a total drug exposure that was comparable to the total drug exposure achieved with the recommended dosage [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION], 168 patients received a 14-day course of TZIELD with a lower total TZIELD drug exposure, and 169 patients received a 6-day course of TZIELD with a lower total TZIELD drug exposure. The mean age of TZIELD-treated patients was 17.6 years (median 15 years), 62% were <18 years old (40% age 12 to 17; 21% age 8 to 11), and 64% were male. The population was 72% White, 26% Asian, 1% Black or [African American](https://www.rxlist.com/african_american/definition.htm), 1% were multiple or unknown race, and <1% American Indian or Alaska Native; 5% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 presents common ( 5%) adverse reactions that occurred during treatment and through 28 days after the last study drug administration in Study TN-10. Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients 8 years and older who received TZIELD were consistent with those reported in adult patients in this study. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions1 in Adult and Pediatric Patients Aged 8 Years and Older with Stage 2 Type 1 Diabetes (Study TN-10)2 during treatment and through 28 days after the last study drug administration | 2 Adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more TZIELD-treated patients 3 Composite of rash-related terms including rash erythematous, rash macular, rash papular, rash maculo-papular, rash pruritic Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) In Study TN-10, CRS was reported in 2% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Of the 39 TZIELD-treated patients that developed CRS (5% of all TZIELD-treated patients) in the pool of 5 clinical trials, 13% of the CRS cases were serious adverse reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Liver transaminase elevations were observed in 56% of TZIELD-treated patients who experienced CRS: 64% were up to 2.5 times ULN, 32% were more than 2.5 to 5 times ULN, and 4.5% were 5-10 times ULN. Serious TN-10, serious infections ( [cellulitis](https://www.rxlist.com/cellulitis/definition.htm), [gastroenteritis](https://www.rxlist.com/gastroenteritis/definition.htm), [pneumonia](https://www.rxlist.com/pneumonia/definition.htm), wound infection) were TZIELD-treated patients compared to 0% (0/32) of placebo-treated patients any time during or after the first dose of study treatment. Rash And Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported with TZIELD in Study TN-10. Serum sickness was observed in 2% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 0% (0/32) of placebo-treated patients. The patient who developed serum sickness had a prior history of positive anti-nuclear antibody and presented with arthralgias and elevated [c-reactive protein](https://www.rxlist.com/c-reactive_protein/definition.htm) and low C4 complement five days after completing their course of TZIELD; illness resolved in 2.5 months. In the pool of 5 clinical trials of patients: [Anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm)(with [hypoxia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoxia/definition.htm)and bronchospasm) was observed in one TZIELD-treated patient who was hospitalized. [Angioedema](https://www.rxlist.com/angioedema/definition.htm)(periorbital and facial) was observed in 0.3% TZIELD-treated patients, compared to 0% in control-treated patients. Peripheral and generalized edema was reported in 1.6% of TZIELD-treated patients and 0% of control-treated patients. - Rash was observed in 48% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 15% in control-treated patients, with 33 excess cases of rash per 100 patients. The majority of rashes observed with TZIELD treatment were not serious and resolved without intervention; although 0.3% (2/773) of TZIELD-treated patients had a serious rash compared to 0% (0/245) of placebo-treated patients. [Urticaria](https://www.rxlist.com/urticaria/definition.htm)was reported in 1.9% and in 1.2% of control-treated patients. Immunogenicity: Anti-Drug Antibody-Associated Adverse Reactions In Study TN-10, rash occurred in 39% of TZIELD-treated patients who developed anti-teplizumab-mzwv antibodies and in 33% of TZIELD-treated patients who did not develop anti-teplizumab-mzwv antibodies [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Other Adverse Reactions Lymphopenia In Study TN-10, lymphopenia was reported in 73% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. The average lymphocyte count [nadir](https://www.rxlist.com/nadir/definition.htm) occurred at Day 5 of treatment, with recovery and return to baseline by Week 6 [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Neutropenia In Study TN-10, [neutropenia](https://www.rxlist.com/neutropenia/definition.htm) was observed in 7% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. Anemia And Thrombocytopenia In the pool of 5 clinical trials of patients, [anemia](https://www.rxlist.com/anemia/definition.htm) was reported in 27% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 21% of placebo-treated patients, and [thrombocytopenia](https://www.rxlist.com/thrombocytopenia/definition.htm) was reported in 13% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients during the 14-day treatment course; recovery occurred within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. In clinical trials, 1.8% of TZIELD-treated patients discontinued treatment due to hemoglobin less than 8.5 g/dL (or a decrease of more than 2 g/dL to a value less than 10 g/dL), and 1% discontinued TZIELD due to platelet count less than 50,000 platelets/mcL. Liver Enzyme Elevations Liver enzyme elevations were observed in TZIELD-treated patients, both in the context of CRS and in patients without CRS. In the pool of 5 clinical trials, elevated aminotransferases were reported in 25% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 11% of placebo-treated patients during the 14-day treatment course. On laboratory analysis, 5.1% of TZIELD-treated patients experienced a peak ALT more than 3 times the ULN compared to 0.8% of control-treated patients. Most liver enzyme elevations were transient and resolved 1-2 weeks after treatment; 98% resolved by follow-up week 14. Other Laboratory Abnormalities In the pool of 5 clinical trials, other laboratory abnormalities including decreased [bicarbonate](https://www.rxlist.com/bicarbonate/definition.htm) (15% in TZIELD-treated patients, compared to 7% in placebo-treated patients) and decreased blood calcium (19% in TZIELD-treated patients, compared to 13% in placebo-treated patients) were noted. DRUG INTERACTIONS No Information provided WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Cytokine Release Syndrome Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been observed in TZIELD-treated patients. In clinical trials, CRS was reported in 5% of TZIELD-treated patients compared to 0.8% of control-treated patients during the treatment period and through 28 days after the last study drug administration. CRS manifestations in TZIELD-treated patients included fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, [myalgia](https://www.rxlist.com/myalgia/definition.htm), [arthralgia](https://www.rxlist.com/arthralgia/definition.htm), increased [alanine aminotransferase](https://www.rxlist.com/alanine_aminotransferase_alt/definition.htm) (ALT), increased [aspartate aminotransferase](https://www.rxlist.com/aspartate_aminotransferase_ast/definition.htm) (AST), and increased total bilirubin. These manifestations typically occurred during the first 5 days of TZIELD treatment [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. To TZIELD treatment [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. - Monitor liver enzymes during treatment. Discontinue TZIELD treatment in patients who develop elevated ALT or AST more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin more than 3 times ULN. - Treat symptoms of CRS with antipyretics, antihistamines and/or antiemetics. If severe CRS develops, consider temporarily pausing dosing for 1-2 days (and administer the remaining doses to complete the full 14-day course on consecutive days) or discontinuing treatment. Serious Infections Bacterial and viral infections have occurred in TZIELD-treated patients. In clinical trials, TZIELD-treated patients had a higher rate of serious infections (3.5%) than control-treated patients REACTIONS]. Use of TZIELD is not recommended in patients with active serious infection or chronic infection other than localized skin infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during and after TZIELD treatment. If serious infection develops, treat appropriately, and discontinue TZIELD. Lymphopenia In clinical trials, 78% of TZIELD-treated patients developed lymphopenia compared to 11% of control-treated patients. For most TZIELD-treated patients who experienced lymphopenia, lymphocyte levels began to recover after the fifth day of treatment and returned to pre-treatment values within two weeks after treatment completion and without dose interruption. Severe lymphopenia (<500 cells per mcL) lasting 1 week or longer occurred in 0.9% of TZIELD-treated patients, and 0.5% of TZIELD-treated patients permanently discontinued TZIELD because of lymphopenia [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Monitor white blood cell counts during the treatment period. If prolonged severe lymphopenia (<500 cells per mcL lasting 1 week or longer) develops, discontinue TZIELD. Hypersensitivity Reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions including serum sickness, angioedema, rash, vomiting and bronchospasm occurred in TZIELD-treated patients [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of TZIELD and treat promptly. Vaccinations The safety of [immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm) with live-attenuated vaccines in TZIELD-treated patients has not been studied. Additionally, TZIELD may interfere with the [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm) and decrease vaccine efficacy. - Administer all age-appropriate vaccinations prior to starting TZIELD [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. - Inactivated or mRNA vaccinations are not recommended within the 2 weeks prior to TZIELD treatment, during treatment, or 6 weeks after completion of treatment. - Live-attenuated vaccinations are not recommended within the 8 weeks prior to TZIELD treatment, during treatment, or up to 52 weeks after treatment. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Cytokine Release Syndrome Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of CRS [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Serious Infections Inform patients that TZIELD may lower the ability of the [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to fight infections. Instruct patients to contact their health care provider if they develop any symptoms of infection [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Lymphopenia Inform patients that although most TZIELD-treated patients had mild lymphopenia; a few had severe lymphopenia that required stopping TZIELD [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and instruct them to stop taking TZIELD and seek medical attention promptly if such symptoms occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Vaccinations Advise patient to receive all age-appropriate vaccinations prior to starting TZIELD and avoid concurrent use of live, inactivated, and mRNA vaccines with TZIELD [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Pregnancy Advise patients to inform their health care provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise patients who are exposed to TZIELD during pregnancy to contact Provention Bio, Inc.\u00e2\u20acs Adverse Event reporting line at 1-844-778-2246 [see Use In Specific Populations]. Lactation Advise a lactating woman that she may interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breast milk during treatment and for 20 days after TZIELD administration to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant [see Use In Specific Populations]. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility No long-term studies have been performed to assess the [carcinogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/carcinogenic/definition.htm) potential of teplizumab-mzwv. No studies have been performed to assess the mutagenic potential of teplizumab-mzwv. As an antibody, teplizumab-mzwv is not expected to interact directly with DNA. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in female and male mice that received a murine surrogate anti-mouse CD3 antibody administered by the subcutaneous route at doses up to 20 mg/kg. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary Available case reports from clinical trials with TZIELD are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm) or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although there are no data on teplizumab-mzwv, [monoclonal](https://www.rxlist.com/monoclonal/definition.htm) antibodies can be actively transported across the placenta, and TZIELD may cause [immunosuppression](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppression/definition.htm) in the utero-exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations). To minimize exposure to a fetus, avoid use of TZIELD during pregnancy and at least 30 days (6 half-lives) prior to planned pregnancy. TZIELD is not active in rodents. In animal reproduction studies, mice were given a surrogate anti-mouse CD3 antibody subcutaneously during organogenesis through lactation. Pups born to dams administered the murine surrogate antibody during pregnancy showed a reduction in the adaptive immune response consistent with the expected [pharmacology](https://www.rxlist.com/pharmacology/definition.htm) (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Report pregnancies to Provention Bio, Inc.\u00e2\u20acs Adverse Event reporting line at 1-844-778-2246. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Transport of [endogenous](https://www.rxlist.com/endogenous/definition.htm) [IgG](https://www.rxlist.com/igg/definition.htm) antibodies across the placenta increases as pregnancy progresses, and peaks during the third trimester. Because teplizumab-mzwv may interfere with immune response to infections, risks and benefits should be considered prior to administering live vaccines to infants exposed to teplizumab-mzwv in utero. There are insufficient data regarding infant serum levels of teplizumab-mzwv at birth and the duration of persistence of teplizumab-mzwv in infant serum after birth to identify a specific timeframe to delay live virus immunizations in infants exposed in utero. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, pregnant mice were administered a murine surrogate anti-mouse CD3 antibody by subcutaneous injection at dose levels of 0, 0.03, 0.3, or 20 mg/kg on Gestation Days 6, 10, and 14. Increase in post- [implantation](https://www.rxlist.com/implantation/definition.htm) loss occurred in the 20 mg/kg group, in the presence of maternal toxicity. In a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in pregnant mice, in which the murine surrogate antibody was administered every 3 days from gestation day 6 through lactation day 19 at doses of 0, 0.3, 3, or 20 mg/kg, no maternal toxicity or increased incidence of post-implantation loss was observed. Reductions in [T cell](https://www.rxlist.com/t_cell/definition.htm) populations and increases in B cells, and a reduction in the adaptive immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were observed in the offspring on postnatal days 35 and 84 at 20 mg/kg. The surrogate antibody was present in the offspring serum at level less than 1.5% that of maternal serum at the high dose. A trend towards reduction in fertility was observed in the offspring of dams administered the murine surrogate antibody at 20 mg/kg. The human relevance of this finding is unknown. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of teplizumab-mzwv in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous maternal IgG and monoclonal antibodies are transferred into human milk. The effects of local [gastrointestinal](https://www.rxlist.com/gastrointestinal/definition.htm) exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to teplizumab-mzwv are unknown. Although the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u00e2\u20acs clinical need for TZIELD and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TZIELD or from the underlying maternal condition, a lactating woman may interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breast milk during treatment and for 20 days after TZIELD administration to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed child. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. Use of TZIELD for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study TN-10) in adults and pediatric patients 8 years of age and older (including 29 pediatric patients). Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older who received TZIELD were consistent with those reported in adult patients [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. The safety and effectiveness of TZIELD have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 8 years of age. Geriatric Use Stage 2 type 1 diabetes is largely a condition that occurs in pediatric and younger adult patients. Clinical studies of TZIELD to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D did not include patients 65 years of age and older. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action Teplizumab-mzwv binds to CD3 (a cell surface [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) present on T lymphocytes) and delays the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. The mechanism may involve partial agonistic signaling and deactivation of [pancreatic beta cell](https://www.rxlist.com/pancreatic_beta_cell/definition.htm) autoreactive T lymphocytes. Teplizumab-mzwv leads to an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells and of exhausted CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies have shown that teplizumab-mzwv binds to CD3 molecules on the surface of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during treatment, with internalization of the teplizumab-mzwv/CD3 complex from the surface of T cells. Pharmacodynamic effects include lymphopenia in the absence of depletion of T cells with a nadir on the 5th day of dosing, during a 14-day course of TZIELD treatment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Teplizumab-mzwv exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of teplizumab-mzwv have not been fully characterized. Pharmacokinetics Steady state concentrations of teplizumab-mzwv are not expected to be achieved during the 14-day course of TZIELD. Distribution The central volume of distribution (Vd) of teplizumab-mzwv was 2.27 L in a 60 kg subject. Elimination Teplizumab-mzwv showed saturable binding and elimination. The mean (SD) terminal elimination half-life and clearance of teplizumab-mzwv are 4.5 (0.2) days and 2.7 (0.8) L/day in a 60 kg subject, respectively. Metabolism Teplizumab-mzwv is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of teplizumab-mzwv were observed based on age (8 to 35 years old), biologic sex, or racial groups (White, Asians). [BSA](https://www.rxlist.com/bsa/definition.htm)-based dosing normalizes the exposure to teplizumab-mzwv across body weight. Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of teplizumab-mzwv or of other teplizumab products. In the placebo-controlled study in patients aged 8 years of age and older with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes (Study TN-10) [see Clinical Studies], approximately 57% of TZIELD-treated patients developed anti-teplizumab-mzwv antibodies, 46% of whom developed neutralizing antibodies. There is insufficient information to characterize the effects of [ADA](https://www.rxlist.com/ada_american_diabetes_association/definition.htm) on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or effectiveness of TZIELD. There was a higher incidence of rash in TZIELD-treated patients who developed anti-teplizumab-mzwv antibodies compared to those who did not develop anti-teplizumab-mzwv antibodies [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Clinical Studies The effectiveness of TZIELD was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, event-driven, placebo-controlled study (Study TN-10; NCT01030861) in 76 patients, 8 to 49 years of age with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. Stage 2 type 1 diabetes was defined as having both of the following: 1. Two or more of the following cell autoantibody (ICA) 2. Dysglycemia on oral glucose tolerance testing In this study, patients were randomized to receive TZIELD or placebo once daily by intravenous infusion for 14 days. Patients in the TZIELD group had a total drug exposure that was comparable to the total drug exposure achieved with the recommended total TZIELD dosage [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the time from [randomization](https://www.rxlist.com/randomization/definition.htm) to development of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Baseline Patient Characteristics In this study, 45% were female; 97% White, 1% Asian, and were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; and 95% were from the United States. The median age was 14 years (72% were <18 years old) (Table 3).

Table 4: Baseline Disease Characteristics of Adults and Pediatric Patients 8 Years of Age and Older with Stage 2 Type 1 Diabetes (Study TN-10)1 |TZIELD to treat (ITT) population | 2 The glucose data are area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) values from the oral glucose tolerance test Abbreviations: HbA1c=hemoglobin A1c, SD=standard deviation, HLA = cell autoantibody Efficacy Results In Study TN-10, Stage 3 type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 20 (45%) of the TZIELD-treated patients and in 23 (72%) of the placebo-treated patients. A Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by age and oral glucose tolerance test status at randomization, demonstrated that the median time from randomization to Stage 3 type 1 diabetes diagnosis was 50 months in the TZIELD group and 25 months in the placebo group, for a difference of 25 months. With a median follow-up time of 51 months, therapy with TZIELD resulted in a statistically significant delay in the development of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes, hazard ratio 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.78; p=0.0066) (Figure 1). Study TN-10 was not designed to assess whether there were differences in the effectiveness between subgroups based on demographic characteristics or baseline disease characteristics.
