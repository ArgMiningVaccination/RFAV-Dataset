An Advance Care Planning Programme Team was established to develop the policy. Implementation of the Advance Care Planning policy will be supported by operational guidance, training and education and public messaging. This report summarises the outcomes of the two phases of early stakeholder engagement undertaken which have informed the development of the Advance Care Planning policy. To ensure engagement with as wide a group of people as possible, an initial stakeholder mapping exercise was completed in November, which remains 'live'. To date, there have been two stages of early engagements with stakeholders to inform the iterative development of the draft Advance Care Planning policy. These engagements have been conducted based on principles of inclusiveness and accessibility. Every effort has been made to reach out to, and maximise engagement with, a wide range of organisations and individuals including those representing and within Section 752 groups. The aim of the engagement was to support the active involvement of all stakeholders, primarily in shaping the policy development. These engagements have also informed the policy implementation plans. Following Phase I and Phase II engagement, the policy is being revised, in preparation for a Public Consultation in autumn of 2021. The Advance Care Planning Programme of work will include the development of operational guidance, training and education, public messaging and an outcome and evaluation framework, which will support the implementation of the final Advance Care Planning Policy. All of this work will include stakeholder involvement as appropriate to meet the given objectives as the work progresses, for example through task and finish groups or work with volunteer partners. 1 Following Phase I feedback, a submission outlining stakeholder recommendations to broaden the scope of the Policy to include wider aspects of Advance Care Planning was presented and subsequently approved by the Minister of Health in May 2021. The outcomes of a feasibility study into the planned adoption of the ReSPECT process (Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment) were also presented and noted by the Minister at this time. 2 Section 75 reference https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/doh-equality 4 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Stakeholder Mapping A stakeholder map was devised using three categories, as shown in the table below. To maximise participation, the stakeholder map (see Appendix 1) has remained 'live', with additional stakeholders added as the engagement work progressed. A list of those who had registered an interest to be informed about Department of Health public consultations was included and additional contacts were made. Early Stakeholder Engagement Level Level 1 Aim: Strategic stakeholders to provide advice and commentary on the engagement plan. Invitation to Phase II engagement opportunities. Level 2 Aim: Information provided on the Advance Care Planning Policy development and related objectives. Invitation to Phase II engagement opportunities. Level 3 Aim: Information provided on the Advance Care Planning Policy development and related objectives. Invitation to Phase I and Phase II engagement opportunities. 5 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021The process of stakeholder identification, engagement activity and outcomes is illustrated in the PRISMA flow chart below.

Letters of invitation were issued to the organisations and individuals identified in the stakeholder mapping. This included 424 letters of invitation issued via e-mail and 6 postal letters (430 in total). Further email communication and telephone calls were made to those who had not responded to the invitation letter in a bid to encourage participation. Phase I engagement consisted of facilitated discussions and other opportunities3 to give feedback on the draft policy. During this phase, the Programme Team held 40 engagement sessions involving 226 people and received an additional 31 written responses from a wide range of sectors, organisations and individuals. Therefore a total of 257 respondents participated. Methodology The sessions were held virtually using the Zoom platform, with a small number of participants invited to each session. Before each session the participants were provided with a briefing pack, which included; an agenda, the current draft of the Advance Care Planning policy (at that time) and five questions which would be used during the facilitated discussion. Each session was scheduled for 90 minutes and accessibility4 arrangements were put in place as required (including for example, a longer session where this was appropriate and Sign Language interpretation). Participants in these sessions were invited to make comment on the current draft of the policy document guided by five questions. (See Appendix 2) 1. What is your overall impression of/comment on the draft? 2. What are you pleased to see in the document and what do you feel is missing? 3. What are your best hopes for Advance Care Planning and/ or this policy? 4. What are your fears/concerns about Advance Care Planning and/ or this Advance Care Planning Policy? 5. Any other comments? Each session was recorded with consent from participants and transcribed for analysis. During Phase I, 31 written responses to the engagement questions were also received. All the commentary was collated and themed for further analysis and coding. 3 By providing tracked changes/comments on the draft policy document and by returning completed feedback forms for consideration (see appendix 2) 4 Inclusiveness and accessibility were central in planning and designing the engagement events; Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) provided Inclusiveness and Accessibility advice and all Advance Care Planning Programme Team members completed Communication Access UK training and accreditation 7 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Phase I Outcomes and Policy Revision A total of 580 comments were noted for consideration as follows; 316 comments for consideration from the 40 engagement sessions 104 comments for consideration from feedback forms received 148 comments for consideration in tracked changes/comments on the draft policy document received 12 other comments for consideration/ comments received in e-mail correspondence Key themes identified from the Phase I Early Stakeholder Engagement data included: The need to normalise Advance Care Planning Conversations Accessibility and inclusivity for all adults The need to ensure that the policy is implemented into practice Overall, there was strong support for Advance Care Planning and the development and implementation of the policy, with commentary also provided in relation to operational elements. Some quotations from the Phase I Early Stakeholder Engagements included; \"[Advance Care Planning] probably the most important conversation you'll ever have\" \"[Advance Care Planning] long term benefits are considerable and should not be underplayed\" \"I know that many older people would be comforted having a conversation about their future which for many would give them peace of mind\" \"Great that the policy is so comprehensive, great that it recognises the need for public readiness\" \"Great to see this happening, like it's ambitious and aspirational\" \"My hope is that families and wider society know (about ACP) and are able to make arrangements in a timely manner\" 8 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021The Advance Care Planning Programme Team analysed all Phase I Engagement feedback. The analysis identified a number of elements of the policy which needed to be clarified and/or strengthened, namely: Clear purpose of the policy and who the policy is for Ethics/Human Rights Behavioural change Inclusivity and accessibility Lasting and Enduring Power of Attorney Mental Capacity Donation of body to medical science Safeguards Values and principles Organ donation Glossary A number of stakeholders also felt that the scope of the Advance Care Planning policy should be broadened beyond the focus on health and social care, to include other aspects such as making a will, financial aspects, spirituality and online accounts. During the Phase I engagements, the ReSPECT process and documentation was raised by stakeholders as a potential alternative to a stand-alone do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) process and form. Subsequently, the Regional Advance Care Planning Policy Steering group approved a recommendation to seek further commentary on the ReSPECT process. A feasibility study/survey was carried out with participation from relevant reference forums for the Advance Care Planning Programme. This included input from members of the Palliative Care in Partnership Programme (PCiP), The Regional Clinical Ethics Forum, HSC Resuscitation Committees and the British Medical Association (BMA). In total, 19 responses were received to the feasibility study/survey indicating a firm agreement to the adoption of the ReSPECT process/form for Northern Ireland. The extension of the scope of the policy was presented and subsequently approved and the proposed adoption of the ReSPECT process/form was noted by the Minister of Health, in May 2021. 5 Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment 9 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021The commentary and feedback from Phase I engagement informed the revision of the draft Advance Care Planning policy document prior to further engagement in Phase II. See the table below for details; Phase I - what the stakeholders said: Clarify the purpose of the policy Increase accessibility and inclusiveness Need to support \"normalising\" Advance Care Planning Need to include a section on behaviour change Include a \"Values\" section Emphasise the Human Rights and Ethics aspect of Advance Care Planning Broaden scope beyond health related aspects of Advance Care Planning More detail regarding mental capacity and Power of Attorney More clarity on decisions regarding resuscitation Provide more detail on how policy will be implementedActions taken in re-drafting the policy prior to Phase II: Purpose of the policy strengthened in the introduction. Accessibility and Inclusiveness added as two separate values and will be reflected in all aspects of this work. Normalising Advance Care Planning added as an \"ambition. \" Added a section on \"behaviour change. \" Added \"Values\" to the \"Principles\" section of the policy document. Specified the Human Rights and ethical based approach of Advance Care Planning. Included additional elements beyond health related aspects e.g. making a Will, funeral wishes, online accounts, donation of body to medical science etc. Added greater detail regarding mental capacity and how it links to Advance Care Planning Added section on Planning for Emergency Care including ReSPECT. Feedback recorded for use in developing the operational documents. 10 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Phase II Engagement Between June and July 2021, a series of 5 Phase II stakeholder engagement events were held to gather feedback on the revised draft Advance Care Planning policy. These events took place online via Zoom webinar. Invitations to these events were circulated to stakeholders inviting them to register. Those who registered received a copy of the revised draft Advance Care Planning policy for consideration in advance of the event. To support the Phase II engagement, the revised draft policy was also made available in an accessible version format6. The letter of invitation included instructions for the use of Mentimeter and also included the themes that would be explored during the webinar session. A total of 461 invitation letters were sent based on the 'live' stakeholder map. Some of the events were in partnership with other organisations, namely; the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA), the Healthy Living Centre Alliance (HLC Alliance) and the Northern Ireland Health Care Leaders Forum. These organisations, along with the Community Development and Health Network (CDHN), provided additional promotion of the events. The Department of Health website also hosted information on the events. Methodology The Phase II events followed a structured format with a series of short presentations on aspects of the draft Advance Care Planning policy interspersed with questions. Beginning with an overview of the process to date, the presentations went on to outline specific areas where the original draft policy had been revised, based on feedback from the Phase I Stakeholder engagements. Aspects of the policy for participants to consider in the Phase II webinars included; Overall Impression of the draft Advance Care Planning policy Accessibility and Inclusiveness Values and Principles of Advance Care Planning Normalising Advance Care Planning and Behaviour Change Advance Care Planning Components Model Planning for Emergency Care and Treatment Mental Capacity Advance Care Planning and You 6 As per guidance from Royal National Institute of Blind People in NI (RNIB Northern Ireland). 11 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Each aspect was presented and followed by a series of related questions. Participants were invited to respond via Mentimeter. There were a total of 21 questions asked during each 90 minute session. A copy of the questions was available as a Word document for anyone wishing to respond in this way. A total of 296 registered to attend. The number of individuals who attended the events was approximately 2007 and a total of 187 individuals responded to the questions using Mentimeter. A further 2 responses were received in document format and 1 response was through the Q&A functionality on Zoom. These responses were added to the dataset and included in the analysis. 7 This number is an estimate based upon attendance figures for those who registered but allowing for shared and late logins not recorded by the system. 12 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Phase II Outcomes The following section provides an overview of the responses to the Phase II engagement questions across all 5 webinar engagement sessions. Further detail is provided in full data tables for each question in Appendix 3. Section 1: Overall Impression of the draft Advance Care Planning policy The questions in this section asked webinar participants to give their overall impression of the revised draft Advance Care Planning policy and if they thought it would improve public understanding of what Advance Care Planning is. Responses indicated a very positive assessment where participants rated the draft policy as: comprehensive, clear, necessary and person-centred. Question 1: Have you read this revised draft Advance Care Planning Policy for Adults?

There were 128 individual responses to this open-ended free text question. Within the 128 responses, 62 people (48%) indicated that they were content with this section of the revised draft stating that no further revision was necessary. Examples of comments include: \"Very comprehensive, no further additions required\" \"Values/principles outlined - very thorough and relevant. \" \"I think you have covered many of the areas I would say are important for values and principles\" \"Inclusive and sensitive\" \"Perspectives on values and principles would need to take account of cultural and diverse beliefs. \" \"Could be reordered. Perhaps, values/principles relating to the interaction with the individual followed by general principles. \" \"The implementation of the values and principles - how to measure their effectiveness\" \"Could be condensed but then you don't want to lose detail\" 20 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Section 4: Normalising Advance Care Planning and Behaviour Change The questions in this section sought participants' views on whether the draft policy would help to normalise Advance Care Planning conversations and the behaviour change that might be needed to achieve the policy's ambition that these conversations would become normalised. Responses indicated that the draft policy would help \"normalise\" Advance Care Planning conversations through raising awareness, and encouraging people to engage in such conversations. Some valuable suggestions were offered in the free text around supporting the necessary behaviour change to engage in Advance Care Planning. These included, for example, training and education across sectors and at all levels. Question 9: One of the policy ambitions is to normalise Advance Care planning conversations. Do you think the draft policy encourages this? Overall the results for this question were positive with 79% (114 of 144) of participants indicating that they thought the draft policy encourages the policy ambition of normalising Advance Care Planning conversations. 17% (25 of 144) indicated 'don't know' and only 4% (5 of 144) indicated 'no'.

Themes identified in Phase I of engagements as needing further clarification or strengthening were addressed in the re-drafting of the policy prior to Phase II. These, changes to the first draft, together with the extension of the scope of the policy and the proposed adoption of the ReSPECT process/ form were welcomed by stakeholders, in Phase II engagement. The overall impression of the revised draft Advance Care Planning Policy was positive, and indicated that people thought it would improve public understanding of Advance Care Planning. The majority of respondents considered the revised draft to be accessible and inclusive and agreed that it set out the case that Advance Care Planning is relevant to all adults. Suggestions put forward to improve the accessibility and inclusiveness of the policy in Phases I & II have been welcomed and noted by the Programme team, with many already in place or under consideration as important factors in supporting the implementation of the policy. Based on feedback from the Phase I engagements, a 'Values & Principles' section was added to the revised draft policy. The addition of this section was very well received by participants in the Phase II engagements with almost half of respondents indicating that they would make no changes. The majority agreed that the Values and Principles were clear, comprehensive and relevant. Responses to questions in Phase II about normalising Advance Care Planning and behaviour change indicated that most respondents felt that the policy would have a positive impact in terms of normalising Advance Care Planning and bringing about behavioural change in the long term. Respondents' suggestions to help bring about the necessary behavioural change, emphasised the need for: training and education, cultural change and a focussed campaign to raise public awareness about the policy. Phase I engagements had highlighted the need for visual illustrations to support people's understanding of the various elements of Advance Care Planning. In response, a components model was developed and included in the redrafted policy. The components model diagram was received very positively by participants in Phase II. Almost one-third indicated that no further changes to the components model were necessary. Suggestions for further additions to the components have been addressed in revision of the policy prior to public consultation. 38 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021Following the Phase I engagements, a further section on Planning for Emergency Care and Treatment was added to the policy. The majority of participants in Phase II welcomed the inclusion of ReSPECT and understood how it linked to Advance Care Planning. Respondents cited that training and education, and case studies would help to make the link clearer. These suggestions will be followed up to support the implementation of the Advance Care Planning policy. The addition of a section on mental capacity was also well received. The majority of respondents in Phase II indicated that they understood how mental capacity links to Advance Care Planning. Suggestions for how this could be clarified further were factored into the revision of the policy prior to public consultation and will be considered in supporting its implementation. The majority of participants in Phase II responded positively to the proposition that there was a role for them in Advance Care Planning, either personally or for their organisation, with only 1% indicating a negative response. Overall, public messaging, training and education, with operational guidance were cited as key to supporting the implementation of this policy. Next Steps Public Consultation Responses and feedback from the Phase II engagements have informed the further revision of the draft policy. The revised draft of the Advance Care Planning Policy will be subject to public consultation in autumn 2021. An Implementation structure is currently being progressed, which aligns with key themes raised during Phase I and Phase II engagements. 39 Advance Care Planning Programme October 2021 APPENDIX 1:
