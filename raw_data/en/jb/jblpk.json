Nucala is not indicated for the relief of acute bron chospasm or status asthmaticus (See 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps Nucala is indicated as add -on maintenance treatment with intranasal corticosteroids in adult patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) inadequately as an add -on to corticosteroids for the treatment of with polyangiitis is indicated as an add -on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) for 6 months without an identifiable non -hematologic secondary cause . 1.1 Pediatrics Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 6 years of age. There is limited efficacy and safety experience with N ucala in patients less than 18 years of age (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). Dosing in children was derived using model ling and simulation of adult and pediatric PK data (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps : Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 5 of 85 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. 1.2 Geriatrics There is limited efficacy and safety experience with N ucala in patients over 65 years of age (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS Nucala is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to mepolizumab, to any ingredient(s) in the formulations, or component(s) of the containers. For a complete listing, see 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSIT ION AND PACKAGING . 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION 4.1 Dosing Considerations Nucala should only be administered as a subcutaneous injection. Nucala is intended for use under the guidance of a physician who is experienced in the monitoring of signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity after administration of biologic agents . Lyophilized powder Nucala (mepolizumab for injection) should be reconstituted and administered by a qualified healthcare professional who is prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life -threatening (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). Following reconstitution, N ucala should be used immediately upon withdrawal from the vial into a syringe (see 4.4 Administration ). This dosage form is acceptable to deliver a 40 mg and 100 mg dose. Solution in 100 mg/mL pre -filled autoinjector or pre -filled (mepolizumab injection) may be self -administered by the patient or administered by a caregiver if their healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate and the patient o r caregiver are trained in injection techniques (see 4.4 Administration ). The 100 mg/mL pre -filled autoinjector and pre -filled syringe deliver a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab, and are not suitable for those who require a 40 mg dose of mepolizumab (i.e. children 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma). Solution in 40 mg/0.4 mL pre -filled syringe (safety syringe) Nucala (mepolizumab injection) must be administered by a healthcare professional or a caregiver. It may be administered by a caregiver if a healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate and the caregiver is trained in injection techniques (see 4.4 Administration ). September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 6 of 85 The 40 mg/0.4 mL pre -filled syringe delivers a 40 mg dose of mepolizumab and is only for use in children aged 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma. 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustm ent Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Adults and Adolescents ( 12 years of age): The recommended dose of N ucala is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. Children (6-11 years of age) : The recommended dose of N ucala is 40 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. Only the lyophilized powder formulation or the 40 mg/0.4 mL pre -filled syringe can provide the recommended 40 mg dose for children 6 to 11 years of age (see 4.4 Administration ). Each vial of lyophilized powder should be used for a single patient, and any remainder in the vial should be discarded. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps: The recommended dose of N ucala is 100 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis : The recommended dose of N ucala is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. The 300 mg dose for treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis requires the administration of 3 separate 100 mg injections (see 4.4 Administration ). Hypereosinophilic Syndrome : The recommended dose of N ucala is 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks. The 300 mg dose for treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome requires the administration of 3 separate 100 mg injections (see 4.4 Administration ). Geriatrics No dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Pediatrics Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 6 years of age. Dosing in children was derived using modelling and simulation of adult and pediatric PK data (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 7 of 85 Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: Nucala is not indicated in patients under 18 years of age. Hepatic Insufficiency Dosage adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment are unlikely to be required ( see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Renal Insufficiency Dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are unlikely to be required (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 4.3 Reconstitution Lyophilized powder Instructions for reconstitution: Nucala does not contain a preservative, therefore, reconstitution should be carried out by a healthcare professional under aseptic conditions. 1. Reconstitute the N ucala powder in the vial with 1.2 mL of sterile Water for Injection , preferably using a 2 to 3 mL sy ringe and a 21 gauge to 27 gauge needle. The reconstituted solution will contain a concentration of 100 mg/mL mepolizumab and may appear colourless to pale yellow or pale brown. Do not mix with other medications. 2. The stream of sterile Water for Injection should be directed vertically onto the centre of the lyophilized cake. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 10 seconds with circular motion at 15 -second intervals until the powder is dissolved. Recon stitution is typically complete within 5 minutes after the sterile water has been added, but it may take additional time. Note: Do not shake the reconstituted solution during the procedure as this may lead to excessive foaming or precipitation. 3. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute N ucala , reconstitution can be accomplished by swirling at 450 rpm for no longer than 10 minutes. Alternatively, swirling at 1000 rpm for no longer than 5 minutes is acceptable. 4. Visually in spect the reconstituted N ucala for particulate matter and clarity prior to use. The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colourless to pale yellow or pale brown, free of visible particles. Small air bubbles or mild foaming are expected, however, an d are acceptable. If particulate matter remains in the solution, or if the solution appears cloudy or milky, the solution must not be used. 5. If more than one vial is required for administration of the prescribed dosage, repeat steps 1 to 4. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 8 of 85 6. If the recons tituted solution of N ucala in the vial is not used immediately: Store below 30\u00baC. Do not freeze. Discard if not used within 8 hours of reconstitution. 4.4 Administration Lyophilized powder Instructions for administration of each 100 mg dose: For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 21 gauge to 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. 1. Just prior to adminis tration, remove 1 mL of reconstituted N ucala . Do not shake the reconstituted Nucala solution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or precipitation. 2. Administer the 1 mL injection (equivalent to 100 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen. If more than one vial is required for administration of the prescribed dosage, repeat steps 1 to 2. Injection sites should be at least 5 cm apart . Instructions for administration of each 40 mg dose: For subcutaneous administration, a 1 mL polypropylene syringe fitted with a disposable needle 21 gauge to 27 gauge x 0.5 inch (13 mm) should preferably be used. 1. Just prior to administration, remove 0.4 mL of reconstituted N ucala . Do not shake the reconstituted N ucala solution during the procedure as this could lead to product foaming or precipitation. Dispose of the remaining solution. 2. Administer the 0.4 mL injection (equivalent to 40 mg mepolizumab) subcutaneously into the upper arm, or thigh. Solution in pre-filled autoinjector or pre-filled syringe (safety syringe) A patient may -inject or the caregiver may administer Nucala injection subcutaneously after the healthcare professional determines it is appropriate. The healthcare professional should provide the patient or caregiver with proper training in injection technique and on the instructions for administration prior to us e. The 100 mg/mL pre-filled autoinjector and pre-filled syringe deliver a 100 mg dose of mepolizumab, and are not suitable for those who require a 40 mg dose of mepolizumab. The 40 mg/0.4 mL pre -filled syringe delivers a 40 mg dose of mepolizumab and is suitable for those who require this dose, i.e. children 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma. Ensure the respective PATIENT MEDICATION INFORMATION and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE are followed. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 9 of 85 Instructions for 1. Remove the pre-filled autoinjector or pre -filled syringe from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to injection. Do not warm N ucala in any other way. 2. Prior to administration, visually inspect the window of the pre -filled autoinjec tor or the pre -filled syringe for particulate matter or discoloration. N ucala injection should be clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow or pale brown in color. Do not use N ucala injection if the product exhibits discoloration, cloudiness, or particulate matter. Do not use the N ucala pre-filled autoinjector or pre-filled syringe if dropped on a hard surface. 3. Administer the subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm ( 2 inches ) around the navel. The upper arm can also be used if a caregiver administers the subcutaneous injection. 4. For use in EGPA and HES , make sure the injection sites for each subcutaneous injection are separated by at least 5 cm (2 inches). 5. Never give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. 4.5 Missed Dose Lyophilized powder If a dose is missed or the patient is unable to attend an appointment for one of the injections, the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible. Solution in pre -filled autoinjector or pre-filled syringe (safety syringe) If a dose is missed, instruct the patient or patient caregiver to administer a dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, the patient can re sume dosing on the usual day of administration. If the next dose is already due, then administer as planned. 5 OVERDOSAGE There is no clinical experience with overdose of Nucala . Single doses of up to 1500 mg were administered intravenously in a clinical trial to patients with eosinophilic disease without evidence of dose -related toxicities. Treatment There is no specific treatment for an overdose with N ucala . If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary. Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available. For management of a suspect ed drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre.

Description Nucala (mepolizumab for injection and mepolizumab injection) is a humanised IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to soluble interleukin -5 (IL -5). Mepolizumab has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa and is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS General Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease Nucala should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. Asthma -related adverse events or exacerbations may occur during treatment with N ucala . Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with N ucala . Corticosteroid Reduction Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids after initiation of N ucala therapy is not recommended. Reductions in corticosteroid doses, if required, should be gradual and performed under the supervision of a physician. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome Subgroup Diagnosis Due to the differential treatment regimens between HES subgr oups, g enetic testing for the FIP1L1 - PDGFR mutation should be completed to aid in the determination of HES variant and to guide optimal treatment decision . Immune Hypersensitivity and Administration -Related Reactions Acute and delayed systemic reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration of N ucala . These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some insta nces had a delayed onset (i.e., days). These reactions may occur for the first time after a long duration of treatment. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 12 of 85 Parasitic Infections Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections were excluded from participation in the clinical program. Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated for their infection prior to initiating therapy with Nucala . If patients become infected whilst receiving treatm ent with N ucala and do not respond to recommended anti -helminth treatment, temporary discontinuation of N ucala should be considered. Opportunistic Infection by Herpes Zoster In controlled clinical trials, two serious adverse reactions of herpes zoster occurred in subjects treated with N ucala compared with 1 in placebo (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Consider varicella vaccination if medically appropriate prior to starting therapy with N ucala . 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women No studies have been conducted with N ucala in pregnant women, and there are no fertility data in humans (see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). In clinical trials there were too few pregnancies reported to inform on maternal and fetal health and development ou tcomes. Nucala should not be used by pregnant women, unless the expected benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women should be advised to contact their physicians if they become pregnant while receiving N ucala , or during the 4 months after treatment is stopped. Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal -fetal outcomes of pregnant women with severe eosinophilic asthma exposed to Nucala , a pregnancy registry has been established. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to register patients, and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1 -877-311-8972 or visiting http://mothertobaby.org/asthma . 7.1.2 Breast -feeding There are no data regarding the presence of mepolizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production (see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast -feeding or discontinue N ucala , taking into account the importance of breast -feeding to the infant and the importance of the drug to the mother. 7.1.3 Pediatrics Pediatrics (< 18 years of age) : Patients less than 6 years of age were not included in the severe eosinophilic asthma clinical trials with Nucala . There is limited efficacy and safety experience with N ucala in pediatric patients less than 18 September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 13 of 85 years of age. A total of 28/1327 (2.1%) patients age 12 to 17 years old were enrolled in the placebo - controlled severe asthma clinical trials with N ucala ; and 36 patients age 6 t o 11 years old were enrolled in the uncontrolled severe asthma clinical trial with N ucala . Patients less than 18 years of age were not included in the chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps clinical trial with N ucala . Patients less than 18 years of ag e were not included in the eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis clinical trial with N ucala . Nucala is not indicated for hypereosinophilic syndrome in patients under 18 years of age. 7.1.4 Geriatrics There is limited efficacy and safety experience with N ucala in patients over 65 years of age. Severe eosinophilic asthma : A total of 119/1,327 (9.0%) patients age 65 and older were enrolled in the placebo -controlled severe asthma clinical trials with N ucala . CRSwNP: A total of 56/407 (14%) patients age 65 and older were enrolled in the chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps clinical trial with N ucala . EGPA: A total of 17/136 (13%) patients age 65 and older were enrolled in the eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis clinical trial with N ucala . HES: A total of 14/108 (13%) patients age 65 and older were enrolled in the hypereosinophilic syndrome clinical trial with N ucala . No dosage adjustment is required in patients 65 years or older (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview In clinical studies that enrolled adult and adolescent patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (events considered to be poss ibly related to treatment with mepolizumab) during treatment with N ucala were headache, injection site reaction, and back pain. In a clinical study that enrolled children with severe eosinophilic asthma, the most commonly reported adverse drug reactions we re headache, injection site reaction, abdominal pain upper, eczema, and pharyngitis. In a clinical study that enrolled adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction during treatment with N ucala was headache . In a clinical study that enrolled adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction during treatment with N ucala was headache. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 14 of 85 In a clinical study that enrolled adult patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction during treatment with N ucala was headache. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, swelling of the face, mouth, and/or tongue; fainting, dizziness, or l ightheadedness; hives; breathing problems; and rash have been reported within hours or days of receiving treatment with N ucala . 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions. The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials; therefore, may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug. Adverse reaction information from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real -world use. Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Adults and Adolescents ( 12 years of age) The safety of mepolizumab has been studied i n three randomized, placebo -controlled, multicentre clinical trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration and three open -label, uncontrolled, extension studies with a median treatment duration of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years). A total of 1,327 adult and adol escent patients with severe eosinophilic asthma received either a subcutaneous (SC) dose or an intravenous (IV) dose of mepolizumab or placebo during randomized controlled trials. The safety profile was comparable between groups that received mepolizumab S C (N ucala 100 mg) or IV (75 mg, 250 mg and 750 mg). Two of the three placebo -controlled studies (MEA115588 and MEA115575) included N ucala 100 mg SC. Adverse events from the placebo -controlled studies that were reported by 1% or more of patients with Nucala 100 mg SC and that were reported more frequently than placebo (1% difference from placebo) are presented in Table 2. Table 2 On-treatment Adverse Events with 1% incidence with N ucala and 1% more common with N ucala than placebo in adult and adolescent subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma from placebo -controlled studies (MEA115588 and MEA115575) Adverse Events1 Nucala 100 mg SC (N = 263) n (%) Placebo (N = 257) n (%) Eye disorders Lacrimation increased 4 (1.5%) 0 Gastrointestinal disorders Gastroesophageal reflux disease 8 (3.0%) 3 (1.2%) Dry mouth 4 (1.5%) 0 Gastrointestinal disorder 3 (1.1%) 0 General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site reaction2 21 (8.0%) 8 (3.1%) Chest pain 5 (1.9%) 2 (0.8%) Local 3 (1.1%) 0 September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 15 of 85 Adverse Events1 Nucala 100 mg SC (N = 263) n (%) Placebo (N = 257) n (%) Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection 10 (3.8%) 5 (1.9%) Pharyngitis 7 (2.7%) 4 (1.6%) Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Ligament sprain 3 (1.1%) 0 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia (6.1%) 13 (5.1%) Back pain 16 (6.1%) 9 (3.5%) Muscle spasms 7 (2.7%) 1 (0.4%) Musculoskeletal pain 4 (1.5%) 1 (0.4%) Neck 4 0 Musculoskeletal stiffness 3 (1.1%) 0 Tendonitis 3 (1.1%) 0 Nervous system disorders Headache 53 (20.2%) 47 (18.3%) Psychiatric disorders Insomnia 7 (2.7%) 3 (1.2%) Reproductive system and breast disorders Dysmenorrhoea 3 (1.1%) 0 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal Eczema 11 (4.2%) 2 (0.8%) 1 MedDRA Version 16.1 2 The most common symptoms associated with subcutaneous injections included: pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation. Adverse drug reactions in adult and adolescent patients (events considered to be possibly related to treatment with mepol izumab) were identified following evaluation of all data from the three randomized placebo -controlled trials and include: headache (very common; 1/10) and pharyngitis, lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasal congestion, upper abd ominal pain, eczema, back pain, pyrexia, and injection site reactions (all common; 1/100 to <1/10). The safety profile of N ucala in a select subset of adult and adolescent subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma (n=998) who were tolerant to N ucala and entered the open -label, uncontrolled, extension studies, and were treated with N ucala 100mg SC every 4 weeks for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years), was consistent to that observed in the placebo -controlled studies. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 16 of 85 Pediatric Population (6 to 17 years of age) The safety of mepolizumab in adolescents (12 -17 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma has been studied in 37 patients enrolled in four placebo -controlled studies, including 27 enrolled in two of these studies (MEA115588 and MEA115575); safety data from these 27 adolescent patients are presented within the adult and adolescent dataset above. The safety of mepolizumab in children (6 to 11 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma has been studied in 36 patients in an uncon trolled, open -label study (200363). Patients received N ucala 40 mg SC (for a weight <40 kg) or 100 mg SC (for a weight 40 kg) once every 4 weeks, for 12 weeks (short -term phase). After a treatment interruption of 8 weeks, 30 children resumed N ucala treatm ent for a further 52 weeks (long -term phase). No additional adverse reactions were reported in children treated with Nucala compared to those reported in adult and adolescent patients enrolled in the severe asthma trials. Adverse events from this study tha t were reported in more than 1 patient receiving N ucala are presented in Table 3.

Data a re presented for both the N ucala (100 mg SC) treatment group and for all subjects receiving any dose of mepolizumab (referred to as the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' treatment group). Additionally, data from children (6 to 11 years of age) are presented for study 200363. Fatalities In placebo -controlled studies that enrolled adults and adolescents, 5 subjects died: 3 subjects (<1%) receiving mepolizumab (severe acute pancreatitis and septic shock in 1 subject receiving 250 mg IV; asthma in 1 subject re ceiving 250 mg IV; asphyxia due to suicide in 1 subject receiving 750 mg IV) and 2 subjects (<1%) receiving placebo (road traffic accident; aspiration and gastrointestinal hemorrhage). None of the deaths were considered related to study medication by the investigator. There were no deaths reported in children receiving N ucala from study 200363. Serious Adverse Events In placebo -controlled studies that enrolled adults and adolescents, serious adverse events were reported in 6% of subjects receiving N ucala, 10% of subjects in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group, and 15% of subjects receiving placebo. Serious adverse events of asthma occurred in 2% of subjects receiving N ucala , 5% of subjects in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group, and 9% of subjects receiving placebo. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 18 of 85 Serious adverse events were reported in 17% and 23% of children receiving N ucala in the short - and long -term phases of study 200363, respectively. Serious adverse events of asthma occurred in 8% and 17% of subjects, respective ly. Adverse Events leading to withdrawal from clinical trial In placebo -controlled studies that enrolled adults and adolescents, 2% of subjects receiving N ucala and 3% of subjects in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group withdrew due to an adverse e vent compared with 3% of subjects receiving placebo. The most frequent AE leading to withdrawal was asthma, which was reported by <1% of subjects in both the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' and placebo groups; no subjects receiving N ucala withdrew due to asthma. Adverse events leading to withdrawal in subjects receiving N ucala included atrial flutter (1 subject), injection site reaction (1 subject) and urticaria (1 subject). An additional subject was withdrawn after receiving one dose of Nucala due to a p re-existing medical condition of left bundle branch block. Adverse events leading to withdrawal in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group occurring in more than one subject included hypersensitivity (3 subjects: 1 received 250 mg IV and 2 received 750 mg IV) and arthralgia (2 subjects: 1 received 75 mg IV and 1 received 250 mg IV). One child receiving N ucala withdrew from study 200363 due to worsening asthma. Immunogenicity The detection of anti -drug antibody formation is highly dependent on the se nsitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collectio n, concomitant medications and underlying disease. In placebo -controlled clinical studies that enrolled adults and adolescents, 15/260 (6%) subjects treated with N ucala 100 mg SC every 4 weeks had detectable anti -mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of N ucala and neutralizing antibodies were detected in one adult subject receiving Nucala . In children from study 200363, 2/35 (6%) subjects had det ectable anti -mepolizumab antibodies after having received at least one dose of N ucala during the short -term (12 -week) phase of the study; no children had detectable neutralizing antibodies. No children had detectable anti -mepolizumab antibodies during the long -term (52 -week) phase of the study. Overall, the clinical impact of the presence of anti -mepolizumab antibodies is not known. The immunogenicity profile of N ucala in a select subset of adult and adolescent subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma (n=998) who were tolerant to N ucala and entered the open -label, uncontrolled, extension studies was consistent to that observed in the placebo -controlled studies; 60/992 (6%) subjects treated with N ucala had detectable anti -mepolizumab antibodies. All sub jects were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Adverse Events of Special Interest Systemic Allergic Reactions: In adults and adolescents, systemic hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 1% of subjects receiving N ucala , 1% of subjects in the September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 19 of 85 group and 2% of subjects receiving placebo. All hypersensitivity reactions were reported as mild or moderate severity. Systemic hypersensitivity events were reported in 3% and 7% of children in the short - and long -term phases of study 200363, respectively. In the short -term phase, one child reported pruritus that was mild in intensity. In the long -term phase, one child reported rash and pruritus that were moderate in intensity, and one child reported a serious event of anaphyla ctic shock (anaphylactic shock due to peanut allergy) that was severe in intensity; anaphylactic shock was considered unrelated to N ucala . All events resolved without N ucala interruption. Infections: In adults and adolescents, overall infections were repo rted with similar frequency in the Nucala (52%), 'mepolizumab all doses combined' (57%), and placebo (58%) treatment groups. Serious infections were reported by 3% of subjects in the N ucala , 'mepolizumab all doses combined', and placebo treatment groups. Serious infectious adverse events that were reported in more than one subject in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group included pneumonia (4 subjects: 1 received Nucala , 1 received 75 mg IV, 2 received 750 mg IV compared to 3 who received placebo ); lobar pneumonia (2 subjects received 75 mg compared to 1 who received placebo ), and herpes zoster (2 subjects received N ucala compared to 0 in the placebo group ). Opportunistic infections were infrequent and were reported in <1% of subjects in the placebo gr oup and in 1% of subjects receiving N ucala . One subject receiving N ucala reported a helminth infection of parasitic gastroenteritis, which resolved with treatment; N ucala was continued. Infection adverse events were reported in 50% and 73% of children treated with N ucala in the short - and long -term phases of study 200363, respectively. Of these infections, 8% and 3% were serious, respectively. Cardiovascular Events: In adults and adolescents, cardiac events were reported in 3% of placebo and 'mepolizum ab all doses combined' patients, and 2% of patients that received mepolizumab 100 mg SC/75 mg IV. Serious cardiac events were reported in <1% of subjects in the N ucala , 'mepolizumab all doses combined', and placebo treatment groups. Vascular events were reported with similar frequency in the N ucala (3%), 'mepolizumab all doses combined' (5%), and placebo (6%) treatment groups. Serious vascular events were reported in <1% in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group and 0% in both the N ucala and placebo treatment groups. No on -treatment cardiovascular events were reported in children enrolled in study 200363. Injection Site Reactions: In adults and adolescents, injection site reactions were reported more frequently in the Nucala group (8%) compared wit h the 'mepolizumab all doses combined', and placebo treatment groups (3% in both). Symptoms included mild or moderate rash, itching, swelling, burning, and pain at the injection site. Injection site reactions were reported in 14% and 0% of children trea ted with N ucala in the short - and long -term phases of study 200363, respectively. Symptoms were mild and included erythema, swelling, rash, itching, pain, and injection site wheal. Neoplasms and Malignancies: In adults and adolescents, neoplasms were reported in 2% of subjects in the placebo group and <1% of subjects in both the N ucala and the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 20 of 85 groups. Malignancies were reported in 3 subjects (<1%) in the placebo group and 2 subjects (<1%) in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' group; no malignancies were reported in subjects receiving N ucala . Malignancies reported during the studies included basal cell carcinoma, basosquamous carcinoma, prostate cancer, uterine cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma. No neoplasms or malignancies were reported in children enrolled in study 200363. Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Severe Eosinophilic Asthma In addition to the adverse events shown in Table 2, adverse events reported less commonly (defined as <1% in the 'mepolizumab all doses combined' treatment group) from the placebo -controlled severe asthma clinical trials in adults and adolescents and were reported in 2 or more patients receiving N ucala compared to no reports in patients receiving placebo are summarized below.

IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to soluble IL -5 with high affinity (a dissociation constant of 100 pM), preventing IL -5 from binding to the a lpha chain of the IL -5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby reducing the production and survival of eosinophils. Inflammation is an important September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 29 of 85 component in the pathogenesis of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps an d eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The reduction of eosinophilic inflammation may play an important role in eliciting a therapeutic effect in the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophil ic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; however, the precise mechanism of mepolizumab action has not been definitively established. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics Severe Eosinophilic Asthma: Following treatment with mepolizumab, dose -dependent pharmacodynamic responses, i.e. reductions in blood eosinophil levels from baseline, were observed in adult asthma patients with mean baseline blood eosinophil levels greater than 300 cells/\u00b5L (ranged 150 - 2420 cells/\u00b5L). Subjects were assigned to receive one of four mepolizumab treatments (administered every 4 weeks for a total of three doses): 12.5 mg SC, 125 mg SC, 250 mg SC, or 75 mg IV. Sixty -six (66) of the 70 randomized subjects completed the trial. A reduction in blood eosinophil levels was observed in all treatment groups by Day 3. On Day 84 (4 weeks post -last dose), model -estimated inhibition of and 88% (95% CI: 85, 90) in the 12.5 mg SC, 75 mg IV, 125 mg SC, and 250 mg SC treatment groups, respectively. The SC model -estimated doses to provide 50% and 90% of maximal inhibition of blood eosinophils at Day 84 were 11 and 99 mg, respe ctively. In adults and adolescents, following SC administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 40 cells/L, which corresponds to a geometric mean reduction of 84% compared with placebo. Consistent results were observed following mepolizumab IV administration at 75 mg and SC administration at 100 mg ( Figure 1). The magnitude of blood eosinophil reduction in a select subset of adult and adolescent subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma (n=998) who were tolerant to N ucala and entered the open -label, uncontrolled, extension studies and were treated with N ucala 100 mg SC for a median of 2.8 years (range 4 weeks to 4.5 years) was consistent with that observed in the placebo -controlled studies. In children (n = 29), following either mepolizumab 40 mg (for a weight < 40 kg) or 100 mg (for a weight 40 kg) adminis tered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks, blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 48 cells/\u00b5L (85% reduction from baseline) and 44 cells/\u00b5L (87% reduction from baseline), respectively. In adults, adolescents, and children, the magnitude of reduction was observed at the first post -dose measurement interval (4 weeks) and was maintained throughout the treatment period. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 30 of 85 Figure 1 Reduction in blood eosinophils from baseline over 32 weeks (MENSA in adults an d adolescents) Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps: Following SC administration of mepolizumab 100 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in subjects with CRSwNP, blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 60 cells/\u00b5L. This equates to a geometric mean reduction of 81% at Week 4 compared to placebo w hich was maintained at 83% at Week 52 (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis: Following SC administration of mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in subjects with EGPA, blood eo sinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 38 cells/\u00b5L. There was a geometric mean reduction of 83% compared to placebo and this magnitude of reduction was observed within 4 weeks of treatment (see 14 CLINICAL T RIALS ). Hypereosinophilic Syndrome: Following SC administration of mepolizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks for 32 weeks in subjects with HES, blood eosinophils were reduced to a geometric mean count of 70 cells/\u00b5L and a geometric mean reduction of 92% compared to placebo was observed and this magnitude of reduction was observed within 2 weeks of treatment (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). This magnitude of reduction was similar following a 20 week open -label extension study in patients that continued mepolizumab treatment. 10.3 Pharmacokinetics Following SC dosing in subjects with moderate/severe asthma, mepolizumab exhibited approximately dose -proportional pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 12.5 mg to 250 mg. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 31 of 85 In population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab in sub jects with CRSwNP dosed at 100 mg SC is consistent with that reported in subjects with asthma. In population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab in subjects with EGPA or HES dosed at 300 mg SC is consistent with that reported in subjects with asthma. Systemic exposure following administration of mepolizumab 300 mg SC in subjects with EGPA or HES was approximately 3 times that of mepolizumab 100 mg administered SC in subjects with severe asthma. Following a single 100 mg SC adm inistration in healthy subjects, mepolizumab systemic exposure was comparable between formulations. Absorption: Following SC administration to healthy subjects or patients with asthma, mepolizumab was absorbed slowly with a median time to reach maximum p lasma concentration (T max) ranging from 4 to 8 days. Following a single 250 mg subcutaneous administration in the abdomen, thigh or arm of healthy subjects, mepolizumab absolute bioavailability was 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively. In patients with asthma, the absolute bioavailability of mepolizumab administe red SC in the arm ranged from 74% -80%. Following repeat SC administration every 4 weeks, steady -state is reached by 16 weeks and there is approximately a two -fold accumulation at steady state. Distribution: Following a single IV administration of mepolizumab to patients with asthma, the mean volume of distribution is 55 to 85 mL/kg. Metabolism: Mepolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are widely distributed in the body and not restricted to hepatic tissue. Elimination: Following SC administration of mepolizumab, the mean terminal half -life (t 1/2) ranged from 16 to 22 days. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated mepolizumab systemic clearance was 3.1 mL/day/kg. Special Populations and Conditions Pediatrics (6 to 11 years of age) : Mepolizumab pharmacokinetics following SC administration in subjects 6 to 11 years of age with severe eosinophilic asthma (n = 36) was investigated in the 12 -week treatment phase of the uncontrolled, open -label study (200363). Exposures (as measured by AUC) following SC administration of either 40 mg (for a weight < 40 kg) or 100 mg (for a weight 40 kg) were 1.32 and 1.97 times of that observed in adults and adolescents administered 100 mg. Based on a p opulation pharmacokinetic model updated by these results, simulation of a 40 mg SC dose every 4 weeks in children, September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 32 of 85 irrespective of weight, resulted in predicted exposures similar to those observed in adults and adolescents. Geriatrics ( 65 years of age) : No formal studies have been conducted in elderly patients. However, in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there were no indications of an effect of age (range included 12 -82 years) on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Ethnic Origin : A populatio n pharmacokinetics analysis of mepolizumab data indicated that there was no significant effect of race and gender on mepolizumab clearance. Hepatic Insufficiency: No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Since mepolizumab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of mepolizumab. Renal Insufficiency : No formal studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, mepolizumab clearance was comparable between patients with creatinine clearance values between 50 -80 mL/min and patients with normal renal function. There are limited data available in patients with creatinine clearance values <50 mL/min; however, mepolizumab is not cleared renally. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL Lyophilized powder Unopened vial Store in the original carton below 25 \u00b0 C until use.

Exacerbation trial (MENSA) - 75 mg IV or 100 mg SC vs. placebo Oral corticosteroid (OCS) reduction trial (SIRIUS) - 100 mg SC vs. placebo These clinical trials were designed to evaluate t he efficacy and safety of mepolizumab administered once every 4 weeks in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma not adequately controlled on high -dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (an equivalent of 1000 g fluticasone propionate/day for subjects 18 year s of age and older) or medium -dose ICS (an equivalent of 500 g fluticasone propionate/day for subjects 12 to 17 years of age) and an additional controller(s) (e.g., long -acting 85 receptor antagonist (LTRA), and/or theophyll ine) with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS)). In SIRIUS, all subjects were required to be on regular maintenance treatment with OCS . An open -label, uncontrolled clinical trial evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (12 week duration) an d safety (52 week duration) of mepolizumab treatment in 36 children (6 to 11 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma.

September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 36 of 85 MEpolizumab as adjunctive therapy i N patients with Severe Asthma ( MENSA) Study Study Design MENSA was a 32 -week, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab 75 mg IV or N ucala 100 mg SC vs. placebo administered every four weeks in the add-on treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma in 576 subjects ( Table 7). MENSA was the only pivotal exacerbation study to evaluate the direct effect of SC dosing on the exacerbation rate. The 100 mg SC and 75 mg IV doses were chosen to provide consistent systemic mepolizumab exposure and reduction of blood eosinophils over the treatment period (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). Subjects had a history of two or more ast hma exacerbations in the past 12 months despite regular use of high -dose ICS (or medium -dose ICS for adolescents) plus an additional controller(s) (e.g., LABA, LTRA, and/or theophylline) with or without OCS. Additionally, subjects had blood eosinophils of 150 cells/L (0.15 GI/L) at initiation (within 6 weeks of first dose) or blood eosinophils of 300 cells/L (0.3 GI/L) within 12 months of enrollment. The primary endpoint was the frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma, defined as worsening of asthma requiring use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization and/or emergency room visits. For subjects on maintenance OCS, an exacerbation requiring OCS was defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days. During the study, the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment and withdrew prematurely from the N ucala 100 mg SC group, mepolizumab 75 mg IV group, and placebo group was 5%, 8% and 6%, respectively. The most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was patients withdrawing consent (3% overall). Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demo graphics and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups ( Table 8). During the trial, subjects continued their baseline asthma therapy, including high -dose ICS (or medium -dose ICS for adolescents), with an additional controller(s). Additionally, 24% of the subjects were on maintenance OCS (median 10.0 mg/day).

Compared with placebo, the reduction in the rate of exacerbations that required hospitalization or emergency room visits was statistically significant for N ucala 100 mg SC, but not for mep olizumab 75 mg IV (Table 9). Additionally, the rate of clinically significant exacerbations requiring hospitalization per year in the N ucala 100 mg SC, mepolizumab 75 mg IV, and placebo treatment groups were 0.03, 0.06 and 0.10, respectively.

September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 38 of 85 At Week 32, the mean change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV 1 in the N ucala 100 mg SC, mepolizumab 75 mg IV, and placebo treatment groups were 183 mL, 186 mL and 86 mL, respectively. Health -related quality of life was measured using St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). At Week 32, mean changes from baseline in SGRQ scores in the N ucala 100 mg SC, mepolizumab 75 mg IV, and placebo treatment groups were -16.0, -15.4 and -9.0, respectively. Study 24 -week, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel group study that evaluated the effect of N ucala 100 mg administered subcutaneously ( SC) on reducing the requirement for maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) while maintaining asthma control in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. A total 13 5 subjects were enrolled in the study ( Table 10). Subjects were required to have blood eosinophils of 150 cells/L at initiation (within 6 weeks of dosing) or blood eosinophils of 300 cells/L within 12 months of enrollment. Similar to MENSA, subjects had a documented requirement for high -dose ICS (or medium -dose ICS for adolescents) with an additional controller(s) in the previous year. Additionally, all subjects were required to be on regular maintenance treatment with OCS (5 to 35 mg/ day prednisone or equivalent). No exacerbation history was required; however the majority of patients (84%) had a history of at least one exacerbation in the previous year. The study included a run -in optimization phase of 3 -8 weeks, in which subjects' OCS dose was adjusted weekly, according to a pre -defined schedule, to establish the lowest dose of OCS required to maintain asthma control (hereafter referred to as baseline dose). Subjects were then randomized to receive either adjunctive N ucala 100 mg SC or placebo treatment once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Reduction of the OCS dose occurred every 4 weeks (between Week 4 and Week 20) according to predefined schedule, and taking into account asthma control and adrenal insufficiency. The OCS dose was reduce d until zero, or to the lowest possible dose required to maintain control during the 20 week OCS reduction phase. No further adjustment was made to the OCS dose following Week 20. The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of OCS dose over Weeks 20 to 24 compared with the dose of OCS established during the run -in optimization phase at the start of the study. Predefined categories included percent reductions ranging from 90 -100% reduction, to no decrease in the OCS dose from the end of the optimisation phase. During the study, the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment and withdrew prematurely from the N ucala 100 mg SC group and placebo group was 4% and 6%, respectivel y. The most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was due to adverse events (5% placebo, 4% N ucala 100 mg SC). Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups (Table 10). With the exception of OCS, subjects continued their baseline asthma therapy throughout the trial i.e. high - dose ICS (or medium -dose ICS for adolescents) with an additional controller(s).

Pediatrics In the double -blind placebo -controlled study MENSA ( Table 7), there were 25 adolescents (12 to 17 years of age); 9 received mepolizumab 75 mg IV, 7 received Nucala 100 mg SC, and 9 received placebo. Adolescents had a reduction in the rate of clinically significant exacerbation that trended in favour of mepolizumab. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 40 of 85 Study 200363 was a multi -centre, open -label, uncontrolled, study that enrolled 36 children (6 to 11 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects received 40 mg SC of N ucala (for a weight < 40 kg) or 100 mg SC of N ucala (for a weight 40 kg). The short -term phase (12 weeks) characterized the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab in children (see 10.3 Pharmacokineti cs and 10.2 Pharmacodynamics ). Following a treatment interruption of 8 weeks , the long -term phase (52 weeks) assessed safety and tolerability. The efficacy of N ucala in children (6 to 11 years of age) for a 40 mg SC dose is extrapolated from efficacy in adults and adolescents with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses and pharmacodynamic analyses. The disease course, pathophysiology, and drug effects in chi ldren are assumed to be sufficiently consistent to adults and adolescents at the same exposure levels. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps Study Design The efficacy and safety of N ucala 100 mg SC as an adjunct to maintenance treatment of patients with CRSwNP was evaluated in a phase III, multi -centre, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 52 weeks duration in 407 patients aged 18 years and older. Subjects received N ucala 100 mg SC or placebo once every 4 weeks while continuing intranasal corticosteroid therapy (see Table 12). Patients must have received background intranasal corticosteroid for 8 weeks pre screening. Patients had recurrent CRSwNP, having had at least 1 surgery for the removal of nasal polyps with in the previous 10 years. Patients were required to have nasal polyps symptoms with a nasal obstruction visual analog scale (VAS) score of >5 out of a maximum score of 10, an overall symptoms VAS score >7 out of a maximum score of 10, and an endoscopic bil ateral nasal polyp score (NPS) of 5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity). The co -primary endpoints were change from baseline to week 52 in total endoscopic NPS (0 to 8 scale) as graded by independent blinded assess ors and change from baseline in nasal obstruction VAS score (0 to 10 scale) during weeks 49 to 52. For NPS, polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale (0 = no polyps, 1 = small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the infe rior border of the middle concha, 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate, 3 = large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle concha, 4 = large polyps causing almost complete conge stion/obstruction of the inferior meatus). The total score was the sum of the right and left scores. Nasal obstruction VAS score was reported daily by the patients (0 to 10 scale [0 = none, 10 = as bad as you can imagine]).

Improvements (decreases) were seen in Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ -5) and asthma exacerbations from post -hoc analyses. For ACQ -5 at Week 52 the mean (SE) change s from baseline were -1.12 (0.095) and -0.46 (0.093) in the mepolizumab and placebo treatment groups respectively Six (4%) patients who received mepolizumab had 6 asthma exacerbations and 11 (7%) patients in the placebo group had 20 exacerbations up to Week 52 . Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Study Design The efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as an adjunct to oral corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with EGPA was evaluated in a phase III, multi -centre, randomized, double -blind, placebo - controlled study of 52 weeks duration in 136 subjects aged 18 years and older. Subjects received 300 mg of N ucala or placebo administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks, while maintaining stable oral corti costeroid therapy ( Table 16). Starting at Week 4, oral corticosteroid dose could be tapered during the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator. The co -primary endpoints were: 1) the total accrued duration of remission over the 52 -week treatment period, defined as Birm ingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) = 0 (no active vasculitis) plus oral corticosteroid dose 4 mg/day September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 45 of 85 (prednisolone/prednisone); and 2) the proportion of subjects in remission at both Week 36 and Week 48 of treatment. Relapse of disease was defined as worsening or persistence of active disease since the last visit warranting: i) an increased dose of OCS therapy (>4 mg/day); OR ii) an increased dose or addition of immunosuppressive therapy; OR iii) hospitalization related to EGPA worsening. Worsening of active disease was characterized by: i) active vasculitis (BVAS >0); OR ii) active asthma symptoms and/or signs with a corresponding worsening in ACQ -6 score; OR iii) active nasal and/or sinus disease with a corresponding worsening in at least one of the sino-nasal symptom questions.

September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 49 of 85 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome Study Design The efficacy and safety of mepolizumab as an adjunct to standard therapy for the treatment of patients with HES was evaluated in a phase III, multi -centre, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 32 weeks duration in 108 subjects aged 12 years and older (Table 20). Subjects received 300 mg of Nucala or placebo administered subcutaneously once every 4 weeks while continuing their stable HES therapy. Standard HES therapy could include OCS and immunosuppressive or cytotoxic thera py, and subjects must have been on stable HES therapy for the 4 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects with non-hematologic secondary HES (e.g., drug hypersensitivity, parasitic non-hematologic malignancy) or FIP1L1 -PDGFR kinase -positive HES were excluded from the trial. Subjects entering the study had experienced at least two HES flares within the past 12 months and had a blood eosinophil count 1000 cells/\u00b5L during screening. Historical HES flares for the trial entry criteria were defined as HES -related worsening of clinical symptoms or blood eosinophil counts requiring an escalation in therapy. The primary endpoint of study 200622 was the proportion of subjects who experienc ed a HES flare during the 32 -week treatment period. A HES flare was defined as worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of HES or increasing blood eosinophils (on 2 occasions), resulting in the need to increase OCS (by at least 10 mg/ day) or increase/add cytotoxic or immunosuppressive HES therapy.

Eosinophils have been associated with immune system responses to some parasitic infections. Studies conducted in mice treated with September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 52 of 85 anti-IL-5 antibodies or genetically deficient in IL -5 or eosinophils have not shown impaired ability to clear parasitic infections. Carc inogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility and Reproduction Long -term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mepolizumab. The mutagenic potential of mepolizumab was not evaluated. The role of IL -5 and eosinophils in tumor surveillance is poorly characterized. However, there is no evidence of defective tumor surveillance in IL -5-deficient or eosinophil -deficient mice. There was no effect of anti -IL-5 antibodies on male and female mice on mating, fertility, and gonadal function or on early embryonic or embryofetal development in pregnant females. Studies in mice did not include a littering or functional F1 assessment. In cynomolgus monkeys, mepolizumab had no effect on pregnancy or on embryonic/fetal and pos tnatal development (including immune function) of the offspring. Examinations for internal or skeletal malformations were not performed. Data in monkeys demonstrate that mepolizumab crosses the placenta. Concentrations of mepolizumab were approximately 2.4 times higher in infants than in mothers for several months post -partum and did not affect the immune system of the infants. Mepolizumab was excreted into the milk of cynomolgus monkeys at concentrations that were less than 0.5% of those detected in pla sma and there were no post -natal developmental effects in breastfed monkey offspring.

This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything about this drug. Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condition and treatment and ask i f there is any new information about Nucala . What is N ucala used for ? Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Nucala (mepolizumab for injection) is a prescription medicine used in addition to other asthma medicines to treat adults, adolescents (12 -17 years of age), and children (6 -11 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma, whose asthma is not controlled with thei r current asthma medicines, such as high - dose inhalers. Severe eosinophilic asthma is a type of severe asthma in which there is a presence of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell). Eosinophils are associated with inflammation of the airways that can cau se your asthma to get worse or can increase the number of asthma attacks. N ucala helps prevent the number of asthma attacks. Nucala is not used to treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood, nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal polyps) to form inside the nose. Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, relieve your nasal congestion and help avoid or delay surgery for nasal polyps. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis and Polyangiitis (EGPA) EGPA is a condition where people have inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) due to too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and tissues. EGPA most commonly affects the lungs and sinuses but often also affects other organs includi ng the skin, heart, kidneys, nerves or bowels. The most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight loss, nasal sinus symptoms, and difficulty breathing . In adults, N ucala , used in addition to corticosteroids, can reduce EGPA symptoms and delay flare -up of these symptoms. N ucala can also help reduce the daily dose of corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 54 of 85 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) HES is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils in the blo od. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the heart, lungs, nerves, and skin. The most common symptoms of a HES flare include abdominal pain or bloating, difficulty breathing , chills or sweats, muscle or joint pain and nasal sinus symptoms. In adults, N ucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and helps reduce symptoms and prevents flares. How does N ucala work? Nucala contains the active substance, mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a specific protein called interleukin -5. By blocking the action of interleukin -5, Nucala limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood, lungs and tissues. What are the ingredients in N ucala ? Medicinal ingredients: The active substance is mepolizumab. Non -medicinal ingredients: The other ingredients are phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, and sucrose . Nucala Lyophilized powder for subcutaneous injection; e ach single -use vial contains 144 mg of mepolizumab (100 mg/mL when reconstituted). Do not use N ucala if: you are allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine. Talk to your doctor about whether this may apply to you. To help avoid side effects and ensure proper use, talk to your healthcare professional before you use Nucala . Medicines of this typ e (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into the body (see What are the possible side effects from using N ucala ?). If you have had a similar reaction before, tell your doctor before you are given Nucala . Nucala does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore, Nucala should not be used to treat such symptoms. Tell your doctor if your asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or get worse while being treated with N ucala . Tell your doctor if you are taking corticosteroids or other medicines for the treatment of asthma, Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps, Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis , or Syndrome . Do not suddenly stop taking your corticosteroids or other medicines once you have started N ucala . Corticosteroids must be stopped gradually, under the supervision of your doctor. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 55 of 85 There are different treatments available for hypereosinophilic syndrome depending on the type of disease, as such, talk to your doctor about genetic testing to guide optimal treatment decision. Talk about any health conditions or problems you may have, including if you : have an existing parasitic infection, live in a region where infections caused by parasites are common, or if you are travelling to such a region. N ucala may weaken your resistance to such infections. Parasitic infections should be treated prior to starting treatment with N ucala . have or have not had chickenpox (varicella) or shingles, or if you have or have not r eceived a chickenpox or shingles vaccine. Pregnancy and breast -feeding: If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, tell your doctor before using this medicine. You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant, unless this is considered necessary by your doctor. There is a pregnancy registry for women with severe eosinophilic asthma who receive N ucala while pregnant. The purpose of the registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby. You can talk to your healthcare provider about how to take part in this registry or you can get more information and register by calling 1 -877-311- 8972 or go to http://mothertobaby.org/asthma/ .

Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical condition and treatment and ask if there is any new information about Nucala . What is N ucala used for ? Severe Eosinophilic Asthma Nucala (mepolizumab injection) is a prescription medicine used in addition to other asthma medicines to treat adults and adolescents (12 -17 years of age) with severe eosinophilic asthma, whose asthma is not contr olled with their current asthma medicines, such as high -dose inhalers. Severe eosinophilic asthma is a type of severe asthma in which there is a presence of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell). Eosinophils are associated with inflammation of the airwa ys that can cause your asthma to get worse or can increase the number of asthma attacks. N ucala helps prevent the number of asthma attacks. Nucala is not used to treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) CRSwNP is a condition in which people have too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood, nose and sinuses. This can cause symptoms such as a blocked nose and loss of smell, and soft jelly-like growths (called nasal p olyps) to form inside the nose. Nucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and can reduce the size of your polyps, relieve your nasal congestion and help avoid or delay surgery for nasal polyps. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis and Polyangiitis (EGPA) EGPA is a condition where people have inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) due to too many eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and tissues. EGPA most commonly affects the lung s and sinuses but often also affects other organs including the skin, heart, kidneys, nerves or bowels. The most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, muscle and joint pain, weight loss, nasal sinus symptoms, and difficulty breathing . In adults, Nucala , used in addition to corticosteroids, can reduce EGPA symptoms and delay flare -up of these symptoms. N ucala can also help reduce the daily dose of corticosteroids you need to control your symptoms. September 15 , 2022 NUCALA, Mepolizumab Page 61 of 85 Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) HES is a condition in which there are a high number of eosinophils in the blood. These cells can damage organs in the body, particularly the heart, lungs, nerves, and skin. The most common symptoms during a HES flare include abdominal pain or bloating, bre athlessness, chills or sweats, muscle or joint pain and sinonasal symptoms. In adults, N ucala reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and helps reduce symptoms and prevents flares. How does N ucala work? Nucala contains the active substance, mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking a specific protein called interleukin -5. By blocking the action of interleukin -5, Nucala limits the production of more eosinophils from the bone marrow and lowers the number of eosinophils in the blood, lungs and tissues. What are the ingredients in N ucala ? Medicinal ingredients: The active substance is mepolizumab. Non -medicinal ingredients: Nucala comes in the following dosage form s: A solution for subcutaneous injection in pre -filled autoinjector or pre -filled syringe. mepolizumab and -filled syringes contain either 100 mg/mL or 40 mg/0.4 mL of mepolizumab. Do not use N ucala if: you are allergic to mepolizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine. Talk to your doctor about whether this may apply to you. To help avoid side effects and ensure proper use, talk to your healthcare professional before you use Nucala . Medicines of this type (monoclonal antibodies) can cause severe allergic reactions when injected into the body (see What are the possible side e ffects from using N ucala ?). If you have had a similar reaction before, tell your doctor before you are given Nucala . Nucala does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore, Nucala should not be used to treat such symptoms. Tell your doctor if your asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or get worse while being treated with N ucala . Tell your doctor if you are taking corticosteroids or other medicines for the treatment of asthma, Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps, Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis , or Syndrome .
