Features of Acupressure Mats If you're unsure which mat is right for you then we've created a handy buying guide to help you make your decision. Below we've explained some of the features you'll come across when shopping for an acupressure mat: Acupressure points Manufacturers will often use the number of acupressure points on a mat to promote their product. Normally quoted in thousands, it relates to the number of individual spikes on the mat. With more spikes you should technically be able to hit more pressure points, of course this depends on the quality. Generally acupressure points are plastic, however you can get metal spikes, like [the Aku Mat](#aku-mat). Their mat has less points in total, but in our opinion the fact that they're metal makes them much more effective. Material Mats can be made from a range of different materials, and typically contain a filling such as foam. Some acupressure mat brands (such as [Pranamat](#pranamat-eco-massage-set-matpillow)) will concentrate on the environmental benefits of the material, while others will focus purely on comfort. Size Acupressure mats can vary in length and width so look closely at the measurements to make sure you'll get the coverage you need. Travel sized acupressure mats are also available, ideal for throwing in your bag for use in the yoga studio or at the office. Added extras Some mats come with an acupressure pillow or neck wrap which can be useful if you're looking to treat pain in the neck and shoulders. Don't immediately rule out mats that don't have this added extra, as certain ones can easily be rolled up and positioned under the neck. Carrying bag Mats can ship with a carrying bag, useful if you're always on the go and want to take your new-found treatment with you! Price Prices range from around $20 and can go up to $100.
