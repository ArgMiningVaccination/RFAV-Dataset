In particular, more and more people are beginning to turn to holistic medicine as a solution for migraines, arthritis, lower back pain, and more. So is holistic medicine the right choice for you? Below are five reasons why many people have sought out a holistic doctor to help with their chronic pain management, and why you might consider doing the same. 1. Holistic medicine produces fewer side effects. Prescription drugs used to treat chronic pain often come with side effects that can be as unbearable as the pain itself. That's not to mention the addictive properties of many medications, which have contributed to the nation's ongoing [opioid epidemic](https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/about-the-epidemic/index.html). 2. The benefits of holistic medicine go beyond pain management. A holistic approach to chronic pain can often involve making lifestyle and dietary changes that have a trickle-down effect on other facets of a person's health. It's not uncommon for a person using holistic medicine for pain management to lose weight, improve blood pressure and cholesterol, sleep better, reduce stress, and improve their overall mood and wellbeing. 3. Holistic medicine carries fewer risks. Being treated by a holistic doctor typically carries reduced risks. There are fewer complications or allergic reactions with holistic medicine than there often are with other approaches such as medication or surgery. 4. A holistic doctor doesn't treat you with chemicals. Holistic medicine uses natural remedies and keeps chemicals and other artificial agents out of your body. [Renewal therapy](https://dynamichealthcarolinas.com/renewal-therapy/) uses your very own body to heal itself, as opposed to external forces. 5. Holistic medicine is less invasive, and less expensive. Holistic medicine tends to be less invasive than more conventional practices and can help you avoid surgeries requiring extended recovery times. It's also generally less expensive than conventional medicine. Schedule Your Consultation Interested in learning more about how a holistic doctor may help you with your chronic pain?
