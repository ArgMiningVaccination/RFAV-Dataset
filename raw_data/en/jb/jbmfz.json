When we think of healthcare we tend to think of the two types: allopathic and osteopathic. These two aforementioned branches are similar in many ways and are both considered a part of modern medicine. But when we look back in history and into ancient Indian culture, we see another type of medicine called Ayurveda that has a different approach to caring for an ill person. In the present day, we also can see an emerging branch of medicine called Naturopathy that attempts to tie in ancient methods with modern science. Let's discuss both schools of thought and analyze their role in the healthcare system today. What is Ayurveda?: Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India. While it is ancient, it is a living tradition that is still practiced widely today. Its main focus is to heal the body through the use of natural resources and practices, and while treating illness is still important, the goal is to prevent disease, promote a healthy lifestyle, and give a personalized treatment for each person. With this personalization comes the idea that each person's body is unique, and there is extra attention to detail that comes with Ayurveda. One of the ideologies applied in treatment is \"pancha karma\" which uses different techniques to rejuvenate, cleanse, and enhance the body. There are five different methods: Virechan (purgation though use powders, pastes or decoction), Vaman (forced therapeutic emesis by use of some medicines), Basti (use of enemas prepared from medicated oils), Rakta moksha (detoxification of blood), and Nasya (administration of medicines like decoctions, oils and fumes through nasal route). These methods each take time, and have preparations that are unique to each bodily system, reflecting the complexities of the human body and immune system. The goal of these methods is to help give the body a type of \"reset\" and allow it to come to its natural, healthy state without any toxins. Benefits: One of the great things about Ayurveda is that opposed to modern medicine, Ayurveda focuses on fixing the whole body, and caters to each person on a case by case basis. Modern medicine tends to generalize and focuses on the specific site of the problem and the inner workings behind that problem to find a solution. The views of Ayurveda vs Modern medicine can be summed up in the analogy between \"whole\" vs \"parts\". While Ayurveda has many methods of dividing up the body and analyzing each part, it uses this knowledge to see how each part works together and how to treat the whole body. Ayurveda also uses natural ingredients and methods to treat the body. While modern medicine and techniques are safe and regulated for proper use, the natural ingredients allow the body to not just recover but to grow and get stronger without artificial ingredients. Concerns: Although Ayurveda has been around for thousands of years, there is very little organized data about its methods and results. The public domain has little to no resources regarding research into the Ayurvedic practice. There is very little documentation about past uses, safety, and adverse drug reactions, and there has been very little communication between various parties and the scientific community. There have been issues related to appropriate research methods and protocols, but none have been addressed. Another problem is that there have been very few randomized controlled clinical trials, which is taken as the highest level of evidence. In order to be seen as more than an outdated ancient practice, the Ayurvedic sector has to look into scientifically proving its effectiveness, and address the questions about its safety and validity. What is Naturopathic Medicine?: Another one of these systems is Naturopathy which is an emerging branch of medicine. While it is not an ancient practice, more and more people are beginning to turn to its methods, as it brings together the old and the new. Similar to Ayurvedic medicine, Naturopathy takes a holistic approach to medicine and patient care, mixing ancient practices with new methods and knowledge. Some methods used are homeopathy, herbal formulations, hydrotherapy, each of which integrate natural elements with modern technique. How to become an ND: In order to become a Naturopathic doctor, NDs go to four year Naturopathic medical school, where they learn about the same basic science as an MD and DO, but also holistic and nontoxic methods of therapy. They also take classes like clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, and botanical medicine. There are currently six accredited naturopathic schools in the U.S and Canada combined, in Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Phoenix, Chicago, and Toronto. Naturopathic school graduates then take the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam which covers the basic sciences, diagnostics and therapeutics, and also clinical sciences. Licensing of NDs is on a state by state basis, and not all U.S states or Canadian provinces have licensing laws for NDs, so it is important to research first. Main focuses: To help a patient recover full health, the ND focuses on restoring the person to an optimal environment, beginning with minimal intervention such as suggesting a change in diet, then proceeding to higher levels of intervention if needed, such as adding in hydrotherapy or yoga as treatment. NDs may also do laboratory tests to further evaluate metabolic function, nutritional status, and other important vitals. One of the main methods used to help improve a patient's health is through personalized diets. These diets usually consist of natural ingredients from all parts of the food pyramid, composing a well-balanced diet. This is believed to maximize nutrition while not creating waste. Conclusion: Overall, Ayurveda and naturopathy are both valid, useful sources of medical information and treatment, and they both give us a different perspective to the way our bodies work and how they should be taken care of. With more research and advancement, these two systems of medicine can grow in their positive impact on our planet. Want to learn more?
