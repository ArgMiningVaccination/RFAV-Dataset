It's part of \"Operation Immunization,\" sponsored by The American Pharmaceutical Association Academy of Students of Pharmacy, taking place now through December as part of a national awareness campaign to boost vaccinations against preventable diseases. The USC students will also post flyers around the community to direct patients to these clinics. Each year, as many as 70,000 adults die from vaccine-preventable diseases or their complications. Vaccines have proven to be safe and effective in protecting against infections. Immunizations are available for illnesses including influenza, pneumococcal disease and hepatitis B as well as measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, tetanus, diphtheria and chicken pox. The benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the risks and problems associated with natural infections. The pharmacist can play an important role in providing information about vaccine-preventable illnesses. To find the nearest clinic offering immunizations, call 1-800-427-8700. Most vaccinations are offered free or at minimal cost. For more information about immunization, call the Immunization Hotline "}
