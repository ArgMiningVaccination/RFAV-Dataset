Effective strategies for countering vaccine misinformation and disinfor-mation are crucial for tackling vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a systematic review to identify and describe communications-based strategies used to prevent and ameliorate the effect of mis- and dis- information on people's attitudes and behaviours surrounding vaccination (objective 1) and examinedtheir effectiveness (objective 2). Methods: We searched CINAHL, Web of Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and MedRxiv in March 2021. The search strategy was built around three themes(1) communications and media; (2) mis-information; and (3) vaccines. For trials addressing objective 2, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias in randomized trials tool (RoB2). Results: Of 2000 identied records, 34 eligible studies addressed objective 1, 29 of which also addressed objective 2 (25 RCTs and 4 before-and-after studies). Nine 'intervention approaches' were identied;most focused on content of the intervention or message (debunking/correctional, informational, use of disease images or other 'scare tactics', use of humour, message intensity, inclusion of misinformation warnings, and communicating weight of evidence), while two focused on delivery of the interventionor message (timing and source). Some strategies, such as scare tactics, appear to be ineffective and may increase misinformation endorsement. Communicating with certainty, rather than acknowledging uncertainty around vaccine efcacy or risks, was also found to backre. Promising approaches includecommunicating the weight-of-evidence and scientic consensus around vaccines and related myths, using humour and incorporating warnings about encountering misinformation. Trying to debunk misin- formation, informational approaches, and communicating uncertainty had mixed results.Conclusion: This review identies some promising communication strategies for addressing vaccine mis- information. Interventions should be further evaluated by measuring effects on vaccine uptake, rather than distal outcomes such as knowledge and attitudes, in quasi-experimental and real-life contexts. /C2112022 The Authors.

Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the ongoing public health challenge of vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal, and the misinformation, disinformation, and myths that feed into them. Even prior to the current pandemic, the World Health Orga- nization (WHO) identied vaccine hesitancy - dened as the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, despite their availability [1]- as a top global health threat [2]. While vaccine controversies in recent years have underscored this threat, the COVID-19 pandemichas thrown a spotlight onto it. Hesitancy is context dependent and varies greatly both within and between countries as exemplied by the COVID-19 vaccina- tion [3]. Several models explain the varied components and ante- cedents of vaccine hesitancy, including the '3C' model (condence, complacency, and convenience) which has been expanded upon by the more recent '5C' and '7C' models (con- dence, complacency, constraints, calculation, collective responsi- bility, and conspiracy), and the '5A' taxonomy of vaccination determinants (access, affordability, awareness, acceptance, and activation [1,4-6] .More complex and context-specic frameworks have also been developed to conceptualize the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy and uptake, such as the Adapted Royal Society of Canada Vaccine Uptake Framework and the SAGE Working Group's Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix, which under- scores the complexity and multitude of factors that can con- tribute to vaccine hesitancy, including the communication and media environment, knowledge/awareness, and the attitudes and experiences of family and health professionals [1,7] . Misinfor- mation dened in the 3C's model as ''trust in (i) the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; (ii) the system that delivers them, including the reliability and competence of the health services and health professionals and (iii) the motivations of policy-makers who decide on the needed vaccines\" [1].There has been an increase in health-related mis- and dis-information in recent years, with vaccines and infectious diseases a major focus [8]. Misinformation is inaccurate information that is unin- tentionally presented as fact, while disinformation involves delib- erately spreading false information to cause harm. In the currentera of 'fake news' and ubiquitous use of the internet and social media, increasing circulation of and exposure to mis- and dis- information has been linked to higher levels of persistent vaccine hesitancy despite some social media platform algorithms attempting to minimize biases and the spread of mis and dis- information [9-13] . Developing and tailoring effective health communications and campaigns to counter vaccine misinformation is essential, both for maximizing vaccine uptake as the COVID-19 pandemic contin- ues and for ensuring high uptake of other existing and future vac- cines to prevent and control disease outbreaks. Understanding the various strategies that have been tested or used to counter vaccine misinformation and disinformation and identifying those that are potentially effective (as well as those that work less well or back- re) is crucial in order to tackle vaccine hesitancy. Previous sys- tematic reviews [14-19] have examined interventions for addressing vaccine hesitancy and correcting misinformation of various health topics, but to our knowledge, no review has specif- ically examined communication-based strategies for countering vaccine misinformation.H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 21.1. The objectives of this systematic review are to: 1) identify and describe communication-based strategies that have been used to prevent or ameliorate the impact of vac- cine misinformation and disinformation on people's atti- tudes and behaviors surrounding vaccination. 2) identify strategies which appear to be effective in countering vaccine mis- and disinformation. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021243341) and is reported in accordance with PRISMA guidance [20]. Changes from protocol are briefly noted in the text. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Search strategy We searched CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo databases using a search strategy developed in consultation with an information specialist (see Appendix A for search strategy used in MEDLINE). Search strategies from previ- ously published reviews on related subjects [21,22] were used as a reference to develop comprehensive lists of search terms, which were grouped around three themes: (1) communications and media, (2) misinformation, disinformation, myths, etc, and (3) vac- cines. Searches were conducted in March 2021 with no limits on publication date. To capture current research on the COVID-19 pandemic, we also searched MedRxiv, a non-commercial pre- print online repository, using truncated sets of the search terms in Appendix A. 2.2. Study eligibility and selection Citations were imported into a Rayyan online library [23]. Stud- ies were screened for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Box 1 . Title and abstract screening was con-ducted by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Articles selected for full text screen- ing were exported to an EndNote library. One reviewer conducted full text screening, with uncertainties resolved by a second reviewer. Data availability No data was used for the research described in the article. 2.3. Data extraction Data were extracted by one reviewer using a pre-dened Excel database. Data extracted included publication descriptors, disease or vaccine of focus, study design, sample characteristics, compara- tor group information, description of the intervention, whether intervention effectiveness was assessed, and key results, including which, if any, outcomes were reported. Relevant outcomes were any author-dened measure of attitudes towards vaccines or vaccine-related information (including vaccine hesitancy), accu- rate knowledge of vaccines, belief in misinformation, and intention to vaccinate. 2.4. Data synthesis For objective 1, the primary approach to data synthesis was grouping interventions by type or format (i.e., pamphlet, social media-based intervention, informational text) and content or com- munication strategy/approach (i.e., informational, myths vs facts approach, use of humor and logic) and summarizing intervention design by group. Groupings were developed inductively, following data extraction, and rened throughout synthesis. For objective 2, study outcomes were iteratively grouped and ultimately classied into (1) belief in or endorsement of mis- or disinformation, (2) knowledge about vaccines and related diseases, (3) attitudes and beliefs about vaccination, including measures of vaccine hesitancy, and (4) intention to vaccinate. Data from com- parative studies was summarized in tabular form, stratied by intervention strategy/approach and outcomes to develop an effect direction plot [25]. meta-analysis was considered inappropriate due to wide variation in both the type/format of interventions and content or communication strategy/approach. For brevity throughout this review, we use the term 'misinfor- mation' as an umbrella term to refer to false information, myths, and misperceptions, as the focus of the included studies and this review is on interventions rather than assessing the source and intent of false information. 2.5. Risk of bias The RoB 2 tool [26] was employed to assess randomized con- trolled trials (RCTs) (n = 25), and one cluster-randomized trial was assessed using the RoB 2 tool for cluster-randomized trials [27]. Two reviewers independently assessed each study. Disagree- ments were discussed and resolved accordingly. The robvis web application [28] was used to generate a summary risk-of-bias plot. 3. Results After deduplication, 1800 unique results were returned from the database searches. An additional 200 articles from MedRxiv were screened from which 6 further articles were identied. A total of 142 articles were selected for full-text screening ( Fig. 1 ).Box 1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Objective 1 & 2 - Publications that describe or assess communication-basedstrategies, programs, orinterventions that explicitlyaim to address misinformation,disinformation, or reactively- interventions World classication[24]- Study type: single-arm studies group(objective 1 comparativestudies (experimental or obser- vational) (objectives 1 and 2).- Literature reviews and systematic reviews-Commentaries, letter to editor,and similar publication types thatdo not describe or assess arelevant communicationsintervention aimed at addressingvaccine misinformation, disinformation, or myths- Conference abstracts-Interventions targeted at healthprofessionals or trainees, ratherthan intended for the generalpopulation- non-English languagepublications Objective 2 only - Studies that utilized a compar- ative or pre/post design - Studies that reported quantita- tive outcomes related to atti-tudes towards vaccines orvaccine-related information, accurate knowledge of vacci- nes, vaccine hesitancy or vac-cine condence- Studies reporting no outcome measures - Narrative descriptions of interventionsH.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 3In total, 34 studies, including four preprints, were eligible for inclusion. Study characteristics are described in Table 1 . These included 25 RCTs (including one cluster-randomized trial and one quasi-randomized trial), six single-arm studies, two narrative descriptions of interventions or intervention development, and one website content analysis. Most were conducted in the United States (n = 21), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 6), and Italy (n = 2). The remaining studies were conducted in Germany, France, Canada, Israel, and Singapore (1 study each). Three studies included respondents from multiple countries. One study did not specify location [29]. All but two studies were published within the past decade. 23 studies addressed specic vaccines and/or diseases (most com- monly measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and influenza), whilenine studies considered vaccines generally and two utilized cti- tious diseases and vaccines. Primary outcomes of interest reported on included vaccine- related beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes, and specically, inten- tion to vaccinate (though this was often assessed as a hypothetical intention). None of the articles measured vaccine uptake or coverage. 3.1. Objective 1 - Description of interventions The interventions presented in the 34 included studies ranged widely, both in form and in messaging strategies. We outlined boththe format and content and messaging approaches below while the format of intervention is described in more details in able. Study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 , with additional detail on sample characteristics in Appendix Table A1 , and the distribu- tion of intervention strategies and approaches is displayed in Table 2 . 3.2. Intervention format A variety of intervention formats and mediums were repre- sented and described in detail in Table 3 . They encompassed question-and-answer style pamphlets about childhood vaccines[30], mock news articles [29,31-33] , government announcements [34], debunking messages posted on social media [35-38] , and complex interactive strategies delivered both in-person [39,40] and online [41]. 3.3. Thematic analysis of communication strategies While the included interventions varied widely in their form, thematic similarities in approach and content emerged. These approaches or strategies emerged as intervention characteristics were extracted, and inductively grouped and re-grouped. Table 2 displays the heterogeneity in interventions and communication strategies' form and approach. Nine 'intervention approaches' were identied; most focused on the content of the intervention or mes-before screening Fig. 1. PRISMA 2020 flow diagram [20].H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M.

Whitehead, C.E. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 6sage (debunking/correctional, informational, use of disease images or other 'scare tactics', use of humor, message intensity, inclusion of misinformation warnings, and communicating weight of evi- dence), while two focused on the delivery of the intervention or message (message timing and message source). 3.3.1. Debunking, correction, and refutational approaches Many studies utilized or assessed different types of refutational or debunking messages or approaches, in which misinformation or myths were addressed head on and corrected. This was done in various forms, including pamphlets and websites that laid out common vaccine myths and corresponding corrective facts [42- 44], while other studies tested the effects of refutational texts as compared to expository, informational texts [45] or compared responding to misinformation on social media with different typesor sources of debunking or refutational messages [35,37] . A com- munity nursing program aiming to address measles vaccine hesi- tancy [40] included aspects of misinformation debunking and refutation, including developing a pamphlet directly countering a disinformation pamphlet that had circulated in the community. Bode & Vraga [46] tested the use of Facebook's 'related news' func- tion to respond to posts containing misinformation by showing related articles that either conrmed or refuted misinformation about the vaccine-autism link. Trujillo et al's study [33] assessed the impact of articles that utilized 'psychographic microtargeting' to address misinformation about the MMR vaccine. 3.3.2. Informational approaches While several included interventions or communication approaches focused on refuting or correcting misinformation, another large group examined communication strategies that took a more informational or educational approach, focused on provid- ing information on vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases in a factual manner (rather than directly addressing or debunking myths and misperceptions), though this was done through both direct (i.e. listing facts) and less direct approaches (such as convey- ing information through a story). The informational/educational interventions, which were often informed by or aiming to address misinformation, included a fotonovela [47], pamphlets PowerPoint presentations for new parents [51], manipulating search engines to provide information on vaccines [52], community-based educational programs [39,40] , virtual, interac- tive dialogues that provide information addressing key vaccine concerns in an empathetic way intended to foster behavior change [41], and different types of informational messages, which range from providing information on the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases [53-55] or explaining how vaccines work or are approved [56]. 3.3.3. Use of disease images & other 'scare tactics' Two studies tested the use of 'disease images' - photos of chil- dren experiencing severe symptoms of vaccine preventable dis- eases - as an intervention, aiming to shock or scare participants into changing their attitudes [42,54] . A similar strategy described by two papers was employing a dramatic narrative of a child's experience with a disease or graphic written descriptions of dis- ease symptoms [33,54] . 3.3.4. Use of humor Three studies examined the use of humor in messages correct- ing or criticizing vaccine misinformation. One [57] tested a humor- ous, satirical text critiquing avoidance of MMR vaccination against a non-humorous version, while two studies [36,38] examined the effect of humor-based and logic-based corrections to misinforma- tion tweets about the HPV vaccine.3.3.5. Strength and certainty of message Three studies examined the effect of communicating vaccine information with differing levels of intensity or uncertainty. Bat- teux et al [34] tested hypothetical government announcements that communicated either with certainty or uncertainty about COVID vaccine effectiveness. Similarly, Kerr et al's study [56] included an experiment trialling no caution, medium caution, and high caution messages about COVID vaccine safety and efcacy and the need to maintain protective behaviours after vaccination. Betsch and Sachse [58] also explored message intensity in their experiment, which assessed strongly or weakly negating either two or ve typical antivaccination misinformation statements. 3.3.6. Misinformation warning Two studies examined the effect of communications that alert or train individuals about the potential for misinformation. Tully et al [59] explored doing so on Twitter by including a tweet about spotting misinformation within a simulated Twitter feed that included misinformation tweets about influenza, while Ludolph et al's experiment [52] tested the effect of including a warning message about misinformation appearing in search results during Google search. Relatedly, educating and training parents to identify misinformation and to critically evaluate evidence was an aspect of the community nursing program described by Marcus [40]. 3.3.7 wt. of evidence Two studies, both considering how to address the mispercep- tion of vaccines causing autism, assessed the impact of communi- cating the weight of evidence surrounding this misperception. Dixon et al [31] compared articles that provided either a one- sided argument against the (false) autism-vaccine link, a 'false bal- ance' article that presented arguments both for and against the link, and weight of evidence articles that presented both argu- ments but included statements underscoring the lack of both sci- entic evidence and consensus among scientists supporting a link between autism and vaccines. A study by van der Linden [60] similarly focused on the lack of scientic consensus support- ing the supposed autism-vaccine link, using both written messages and pie charts to indicate scientic consensus that vaccines are safe. 3.3.8. Message source Several studies manipulated the source of the message/inter- vention to identify the most effective 'messenger', rather than (or in addition to) the message content, considering factors such as the gender, credibility or trustworthiness of the message source [37,50,58,61] . 3.3.9. Message timing One study assessed the effect of the timing of interventions addressing misinformation. Jolley & Douglas [32] assessed whether reading an article with anti-conspiracy arguments about vaccines generally was more effective prior to ('inoculating') or following ('debunking') exposure to misinformation. 3.4. Objective 2: Identifying potentially effective strategies To identify potentially effective communication strategies, studies were grouped by the above approaches and ndings were tabulated in an effect direction plot [25] (Table 4 ). A summary of each approach's effect is displayed in Table 2 . Five studies [40,41,44,48,51] did not assess or measure outcomes, and were excluded. Intermediate outcomes, such as perceived reliability or accuracy of messages or message sources, were not examined in this study. Results were mixed, with no intervention type showing clear and consistent positive or negative results across outcomes.H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 7Table 3 Summary of communication interventions to address vaccine misinformation, by intervention format. Intervention Format Description of interventions Print medium interventions Pamphlets or booklets aimed to address misconceptions and increase knowledge about vaccines and related diseases using approaches such as question-and-answer formats [26], presenting common myths alongside established evidence countering the myth [38,39] , or simply providing simple, comprehensible information statements about vaccines [40]. Study [41] described the development of a fotonovela (similar to a comic book, but using photographs) designed to address myths about the HPV vaccine. Another paper described an evidence-based vaccine magazine developed in response to a locally circulating anti-vaccine booklet thathad been circulated in the same community [36]. Video & multi-media Two studies assessed video interventions, while one trialled a voice-over PowerPoint presentation. One video took a corrective, fact- based approach to addressing common misconceptions about vaccines [42], while the second explained how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work [43]. The PowerPoint addressed common concerns surrounding infant vaccines and was shown to vaccine-hesitant parents of infants at their rst pediatrician visit [44]. In-person interactive interventionsStudies described in-person interactive educational interventions, focused on particular vaccines and targeted at specic groups. Ho 2017 [35] assessed the impact of a series of interactive sessions run by 'Health Ambassador' volunteers with senior citizens in Singapore that aimed to improve knowledge and attitudes about influenza, pneumonia, and their vaccines. Marcus 2020 [36] described different strategies used in a grassroots community-based nursing program that aimed to counter widespreadmisinformation about measles and the measles vaccine among the New York Orthodox Jewish community, including developing an evidence-based magazine for parents, hosting workshops, vaccine fairs, and provider trainings Social media strategies Several studies examined social media-based strategies and interventions. These were mostly trialled through experimental simulations, such as mock Facebook or Twitter feeds. Two studies tested responding to a misinformation tweet with a humor-basedor logic-based correction tweet [32,34] . Similarly, two studies tested different comments responding to Facebook posts including vaccine-related myths or misinformation. Gesser-Edelsburg et al [31] trialled a brief, unequivocal message emphasizing MMR vaccination requirements as well as a lengthier, more empathetic response that provided information responding to vaccine fearsand concerns; Sullivan [33] assessed corrective messages posted as Facebook responses, but manipulated the message source, testing different sources such as libraries and the CDC. Social media-based strategies also included testing Facebook's 'related links' functionality by following a post containing misinformation with links to two related stories that conrm and/or refute it [45] as well as a more proactive strategy of exposing participants to a 'news literacy' tweet about how to spot fake news within a simulatedTwitter feed that also includes a tweet linking to a false story about the flu vaccine causing the flu [46]. Other web-based strategies & interventionsSeveral web-based interventions or strategies that did not involve social media were among the included studies. Ludolph et al [47] conducted an experiment in which experimenters manipulated Google search results to include an information box containing eitherbasic or more difcult to comprehend information about vaccination, and/or a warning that 'false or misleading information' may beencountered during their search. Knight et al [37] described the development of a digital, web-based intervention - a 'chat bot' - that used interactive 'therapeutic dialogues' aimed to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. An experiment by Betsch & Sachse [48] tested websites addressing vaccine-adverse effects; the experiment manipulated the extremity of risk negations as well as the source of the negation by showing information on the websites of a trusted government health institution or that of a pharmaceutical company.Another study conducted a content analysis of government websites informing the public about vaccines, and found debunking andanswering common questions to be the most commonly used approaches [49]. News articles Four studies experimented with different communication strategies countering misinformation within mock news articles that study participants read within online surveys. Stojanov (2015) examined the effect of countering general anti-vaccine misinformation witharticles that either solely provided debunking information or debunking information alongside information explaining the conspiracists' motivation and the fallacies in the anti-vaccine information. Another explored ''psychographic microtargeting\" by developing ctional news articles that aimed to address MMR vaccine misinformation by targeting psychological traits thought to belinked to vaccine attitudes [29]. Dixon et al [27] tested how different journalistic approaches in covering the autism-vaccine link, including a false balance framing and articles that presented the weight of evidence against the link, affects personal beliefs aboutthe link. Lastly, Jolley & Douglas [28] examined the timing of exposure to anti-conspiracy articles rather than message content; this study assessed the effects of exposure to corrective information, in article form, before or after exposure to misinformation presentedin articles supporting general vaccine conspiracy theories. Visual communications Several studies explored communication strategies that utilized visuals such as images or charts to address misinformation. Pluviano et al [38] compared 3 approaches, including a 'visual correction' utilizing infographics to compare the risks of measles, mumps and rubella with the risk of vaccine side effects, as well as a 'fear correction' showing graphic pictures of unvaccinated children infectedwith the diseases. The use of graphic images of infected children was also tested by Nyhan et al [50], while two studies utilized visuals to convey medical consensus or the weight-of-evidence behind accurate vaccine information, with van der Linden et al [51] using pie charts that conveyed medical consensus that vaccines are safe ('descriptive norm') or that parents should be required tovaccinate their children ('prescriptive norm'), while Dixon et al [27] used photos of either a single or group of scientists within a ctional article. The fotonovela project [41] also employed the use of images. Message manipulations Pluviano et al [52] manipulated message source, testing the effects of corrective messages about a ctional disease and vaccine coming from sources deemed to be of high and low expertise and trustworthiness, while Kerr et al [53] assessed message length, testing the effect of short and long messages, as well as manipulating message content and trialling messages that communicatedvarying levels of caution about COVID vaccine efcacy. Most of these studies focused on message content or framing. Kerr et al [53] compared various different messaging strategies to communicate information and address concerns and misinformation aboutCOVID-19 vaccines, including a 'factbox' format presenting benets and harms, question-and-answer format, a message explainingthe vaccine approval processes, and a ''scientic mechanism message\" explaining how mRNA vaccines work. Batteux et al [30] conducted an experiment on messaging around the COVID-19 vaccine, testing hypothetical government announcements that communicated either with certainty or uncertainty about the effectiveness of vaccines that were under development. Nyhan et al [50] tested four interventions for addressing misinformation about the MMR-autism link, including providing information explaining the lack of evidence for this link, information about the dangers of measles, mumps and rubella, a dramatic narrative about an infantalmost dying of measles, and graphic images of children with the diseases. Vaughn & Johnson [54] compared the effects of a refutational text that directly addressed myths about influenza and the flu vaccine with an expository text that provided factualinformation without specically addressing misinformation; Featherstone & Zhang [55] also tested refutational messages, comparing the use of conspiracy and uncertainty framings to counter measles/MMR misinformation. Ryan et al [56] compared a 'disease risk' framing, highlighting the risks of whooping cough in a brief story, with a 'myth busting' approach summarizing evidence refuting misinformation about adverse outcomes from the antenatal whooping cough vaccine; similarly, Nyhan & Reifler [57] compared a 'danger' message about influenza risks with a 'correction' message debunking the myth that the flu vaccine can cause the flu. Moyer-Guse et al [58] tested humorous and non-humorous texts that criticized the decision to not get the MMR vaccine because of the fear of adverse reactions.H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M.

Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 13Five studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias, and the remaining 20 were judged to have some concerns for risk of bias (Fig. 2 ). Four uncontrolled before-and-after studies [30,39,47,49] were not formally assessed, but their ndings are discussed. 3.4.1. Debunking/refutational interventions and messaging Interventions and messaging that focused on debunking or refuting misinformation had mixed results; while three debunking interventions across four studies were found to lessen belief in misinformation, two interventions using myths vs facts pamphlets worsened belief in misinformation and another two approaches had no clear effect on belief in misinformation.1Only one small study examined knowledge as an outcome and found no clear effect [45]. Most studies on debunking interventions examined the effect on reported intention to vaccinate or broader measures of vaccine attitudes, beliefs, and hesitancy. Five debunking interventions had mixed or no clear effect on intention to vaccinate, and 2 experiments found debunking messaging to decrease vaccination intentions among some respondents (those with more hesitant attitudes towards vaccination at baseline) [53,54] . Most debunking interven- tions had mixed or no clear effect on broader vaccine attitudes.One experiment with two different refutational messages found that both tested strategies improved general attitudes towards the MMR vaccine, but had no clear effect on vaccine hesitancy, which was measured as concern over vaccine side effects [62]. Another found that a corrective message reduced false beliefs and safety concerns, but subgroup analysis revealed that this effect held only among respondents with less concern about side effects at baseline [53]. One of the studies testing a myths vs facts booklet found that the intervention worsened beliefs about MMR vaccine side effects [43]. 3.4.2. Informational interventions/communication strategies Informational interventions seemed to generally improve vaccine-related knowledge, with all four studies that assessed knowledge as an outcome reporting an improvement, though 3 of the 4 had very small samples [30,39,47,49] . Most (n = 9) of the informational interventions had mixed results or no clear effects on vaccine attitudes, though a question-and-answer pamphlet [30] and an interactive educational program [39] were found to improve attitudes, and an informational video, when narrated by a male voice, was found to increase reported intention to vaccinate [50]. The effect on belief in misinformation was assessed for ve of the informational interventions with mixed or no clear effects found for four of the ve [33,42,53,54] ; however, a ctional news article providing information about needle-free methods for vac- cine administration was found to reduce endorsement of misinfor- mation among individuals high in 'needle sensitivity' or anxiety and discomfort related to needles and blood [33]. 3.4.3. Disease images & other 'scare tactics' Communications utilizing disease images and other dramatic approaches were largely ineffective. The interventions using pho- tos of children experiencing severe symptoms of vaccine- preventable diseases worsened or had no clear effect on belief in misinformation and vaccine attitudes. The similar tactic of using a dramatic narrative about an infant almost dying of measles also backred, increasing the perceived risk of severe vaccine side effects [54]. However, one study found that a news article includ- ing a parent's graphic description of their child's experience with measles decreased endorsement of vaccine-related misinformation among individuals high in 'moral purity', a psychological trait inwhich decision-making is driven by feelings of disgust and trying to avoid contamination and disease [33]. 3.4.4. Humor Three studies examined the use of humor in messages correct- ing or criticizing vaccine misinformation. One assessed vaccine hesitancy, and found both humorous and non-humorous messages reduced vaccine hesitancy, but were more effective for different populations. The humorous, satirical message reduced vaccine hesitancy among participants that held more false vaccine beliefs at baseline, while the non-humorous message was found to be more effective among respondents that already held positive vac- cine beliefs [57]. Two HPV vaccine studies [36,38] found that both humor-based and logic-based corrections reduced misperceptions, but that the logic-based corrections were found to be more credi- ble and were more effective at reducing misperceptions. 3.4.5. Message intensity 'Stronger' messaging - negating a risk more strongly or commu- nicating with more certainty - seems to backre, with 2 studies nding such messaging to worsen vaccine hesitancy and intention to vaccinate, while communicating with uncertainty or weaker risk negations improved vaccine hesitancy and intentions relative to the stronger messages [34,58] . A third study found mixed results as to the impact of communicating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines with varying levels of certainty on vaccine hesitancy, intentions, and beliefs; for example, messages that didn't caution that protective measures would be needed post-vaccination were associated with higher perceived vaccine efcacy, but this had no effect on vaccination intentions [56]. 3.4.6. Misinformation warning Two studies assessed strategies alerting participants to the potential for misinformation on Twitter [59] and during a Google search [52]. This appears to be a potentially promising approach; Tully et al [59] found belief in misinformation to decrease with a misinformation warning, while Ludolph et al [52] found that com- bining simple, comprehensible information about vaccines with a misinformation warning improved participant knowledge and atti- tudes; however, the effects of the misinformation warning alone are less clear. 3.4.7. Communicating weight-of-evidence/scientic consensus Communicating the weight of evidence surrounding vaccines - that is, explaining which standpoint is supported by evidence and scientic consensus - may be a promising strategy. Two studies found that belief in misinformation was reduced when communi-cating weight of evidence alongside a visual exemplar (photo of scientist(s) for Dixon et al [31]; pie charts highlighting medical consensus for van der Linden et al [60]). Communicating weight of evidence without a visual exemplar had no effect on belief in misinformation [31], indicating the visual exemplar is a crucial piece of the intervention. Vaccine hesitancy and attitudes towards vaccines were also improved in van der Linden's experiment with messages highlighting medical consensus [60]. 3.4.8. Timing of message Only a single study specically tested the timing of message interventions to see whether they are more effective prior to or fol- lowing exposure to misinformation. Jolley & Douglas [32] found that anti-conspiracy arguments improved correct attitudes and increased intention to vaccinate when presented before partici- pants read a conspiracy article, but not if reading it afterwards as a debunking measure.1Interestingly, in Bode & Vraga's study, while a debunking approach on Facebook of linking to articles that refuted misinformation had no effect on respondentattitudes, the same approach was successful for reducing misperceptions about a linkbetween GMOs and illness.H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 143.4.9. Message source Message source seems to be a salient factor in vaccination com- munications. Pluviano et al [61] found that misinformation correc- tions from sources deemed to be high- and low- expertise or trustworthiness did not affect vaccination intent, though correc- tions from high and low-expertise and high-trustworthiness sources decreased participants reliance on the misinformation; the authors concluded that trustworthiness of a message source was more important than expertise. Sullivan [37] tested refuta- tional messages on Facebook from four different sources; one - the American Library Association - actually resulted in lower vac- cination intentions, while messages from the CDC or another Face- book user resulted in reduced vaccine misperceptions. Two studies considered how message source interacts with other factors; Witus & Larson [50] found that while a male-narrated informational video led to improved vaccination intentions across the sample, the same video, when narrated by a female voice, was associated with decreased vaccination intentions among politically conserva- tive participants. Betsch & Sasche [58] looked at message source and intensity together, and found that for a non-credible source, a message with weaker risk negations was more effective at improving vaccination intentions and hesitancy, while for credible sources, the intensity of risk negation communicated made no difference. 4. Discussion Vaccine hesitancy is a key public health concern, contributing to disease outbreaks and interfering with epidemic control. Exposure to misinformation has been shown to decrease intent to accept a vaccine [13], highlighting the importance of identifying strategies that can effectively counter misinformation. This review demon-strates the wide range of communication strategies that have been tested and implemented to date, using a variety of formats - from interactive, in-person educational sessions to social media-based corrections of misinformation - and messaging approaches - including debunking, informational messages, using humor and manipulating the source or intensity of messages. Some strategies seem to be clearly ineffective: employing scare tactics, such as gra- phic images of children infected with vaccine preventable diseases, increased belief in misinformation [42,54] ; communicating about vaccines with certainty - rather than acknowledging uncertainty around vaccine efcacy or risks - was also found to backre [34,58] . Overall, promising communication studies include com- municating the weight of evidence and scientic consensus around vaccines and related myths, utilizing humor, and incorporating warnings about encountering misinformation. The effects of trying to debunk misinformation, informational approaches, and commu- nicating uncertainty may help with some outcomes, but have mixed results and should be investigated further. The most common approaches taken by the reviewed studies - debunking and informational messaging - had very mixed effects across the considered outcomes. This is consistent with research that has shown that providing a dissenting message could backre and reinforce pre-existing beliefs of a particular group [63]. One study however showed that ''pre-bunking\" that involved anticipat- ing the 'myth' and providing the anti-conspiracy message in advance could however increase intention to vaccinate [32], in line with effective prophylactic approaches identied elsewhere [64]. Heterogeneity was also found within studies, with some trials nding that a certain intervention was effective at improving atti- tudes or vaccination intent among some sub-populations but not others. This underscores the complexity of vaccination behaviors and the myriad factors that can influence attitudes, hesitancy, and decision-making [65]. More actionably, this heterogeneityhighlights the need for communication strategies and interven- tions to be chosen and tailored in audience-specic ways. Political views, shown to be associated with COVID-19 vaccination rates [66], are important to consider for both the targeting and tailoring of communications interventions; for example, Witus & Larson [50] found that among politically conservative individuals, an edu- cational video about COVID-19 vaccines could increase vaccination intentions if narrated by a male, but that there was a backre effect with a female narrator; this difference wasn't seen among politi- cally liberal participants. Strategies may work better or worse among individuals with different baseline attitudes towards vacci- nation or belief in misinformation; for example, Moyer-Guse et al [57] found that humor-based misinformation corrections were more effective at reducing vaccine hesitancy among participants holding more false vaccine beliefs, while non-humorous messages were more effective for those who already had positive beliefs towards vaccines. These ndings illustrate that the design of inter- ventions and communications strategies need to consider who, specically, they are targeting and are likely to reach, and under- score the need for future trials to conduct rigorous sub-group anal- yses and understand the baseline beliefs and attitudes of respondents. The body of evidence generated by this systematic review points to several important considerations for its interpretation and for future research. Firstly, many of the studies were random- ized trials conducted as simulated situations unlikely to reflect how a communication strategy would be implemented in real- life; a messaging approach that works when an individual reads an article embedded in an online survey experiment may not have the same effect when translated into a mass media campaign. Only a handful of studies examined actual interventions as they would be realistically delivered, and most of these did not rigorously assess effectiveness. Additionally, none of the studies directly mea- sured the effect of interventions on actual vaccine uptake, though many surveyed participants about vaccination intention. Future research in this arena should aim to conduct real-world piloting of interventions and measure resulting changes in uptake of vacci- nes, in addition to indicators such as vaccination intention, knowl- edge and belief in misinformation. Lastly, research must keep up with the ever-changing media landscape through which misinfor- mation propagates; future studies should consider how to address misinformation spreading on other social media platforms, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok [67], including how modifying search algorithm, ranking different type of evidence and sources of information, and reporting online misinformation may help address disinformation [68]. Our ndings contribute to and build upon the existing body of literature on interventions for improving vaccination rates. A pre-vious review [69] found that text messaging interventions, primar- ily for vaccine appointment scheduling and/or reminders, and immunization campaign websites were among the potentially effective 'new media' approaches to increasing immunization cov- erage; avenues such as incorporating humorous corrections of myths or sharing misinformation warnings as a part of text mes- saging interventions should be explored. A meta -analysis of social media-based health misinformation corrections found that debunking is an effective strategy - but that correcting misinfor- mation related to infectious diseases is more difcult, which may explain the more heterogeneous effects found in this review [19]. A 2015 review of reviews [18] echoes our ndings of there being a lack of strong evidence to specically recommend any interven- tions; the authors noted that educational tools, such as pamphlets, had little or no effect on vaccine hesitancy, and highlights the need to understand groups' specic concerns, rather than seeking an intervention that will be universally effective.H.S. Whitehead, C.E. French, D.M. Caldwell et al. Vaccine xxx (xxxx) xxx 15This review has some limitations. Firstly, most studies were conducted in the United States, and thus ndings should be applied to other settings with caution. Secondly, the literature search was conducted approximately-one year into the COVID-19 pandemic; future research should aim to assess more recent and long-term assessments of communication interventions, and search addi- tional databases. Our searches were restricted to studies published in the English language and we did not search for grey literature. Notably, previous studies indicate that the exclusion of non- English articles has little effect on systematic review results [70,71] .Data extraction was performed by a single study member, rather than cross-checked by a second team member as originally planned. We were also constrained by the body of literature included in this review. None of the included studies directly assessed vaccination uptake rates; intention to vaccinate was themost proximate outcome considered, but still may not accurately reflect actual vaccination behaviors; vaccination attitudes, knowl- edge, and hesitancy are even less closely tied to vaccine uptake. Lastly, the heterogeneity of the included studies -in terms of inter- vention type, targeted vaccine, study context, sample characteris- tics, and assessed outcomes - precluded any formal meta - analyses, and the narrative synthesis approach taken required sub- jective distillation and summarization of the included studies. Despite these limitations, this review's strengths include identify- ing communication strategies that should be avoided, scoping out the body of research in an underexplored area, and identifying key areas for future research. 5. Conclusion Heightened vaccine hesitancy that has arisen with Covid-19 vaccines has put to the fore the need to address ubiquitous vaccine mis- and disinformation. This review provides evidence on some promising avenues for communication strategies for addressing misinformation, such as conveying the weight of evidence and sci- entic consensus around vaccines and related myths, utilizing humor, tailoring communications to specic target audiences, and incorporating warnings about encountering misinformation. Our ndings question the effectiveness of commonplace interven- tions such as vaccine myths debunking, employing scare tactics, and communicating with certainty. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce hesitancy caused by mis- and dis-information and to directly measure their effect on the outcome of vaccine uptake, rather than assessing only distal outcomes such as knowledge or attitudes, in quasi-experimental and real-life contexts. Only then will it be possible to ensure that effective public health interventions such as vaccination benet all.
