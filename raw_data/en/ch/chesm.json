FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY 5BC Medical Services Plan BC MEDICAL SERVICES PLAN The BC Ministry of Health administers the Medical Services Plan (MSP) through Health Insurance BC (HIBC), which ensures that all eligible BC residents have access to medically essential care. All BC residents must have a BC Services Card to receive health services. Health Benefits manages the MSP program for status First Nations who reside in BC; status First Nations in BC who need to register for MSP should do so through Health Benefits rather than the Ministry of Health. MSP registration forms are available online at http://www.fnha.ca/benefits/MSP or by calling Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. MSP Coverage MSP covers medically necessary services provided by doctors, nurses, and midwives. It also covers items and services delivered in hospitals. These include medications clients receive while in hospital, and surgery of various types including emergency oral surgery and cataract surgery. MSP will also cover necessary diagnostic services such as x-rays and blood tests. In addition, MSP provides some coverage for medically required eye examinations for clients 18 years of age and under, and 65 years of age and over. MSP coverage may not be enough to cover the full cost of the eye exam, however Health Benefits vision care benefits may cover some of the remaining cost. For more information, visit the vision care benefits webpage. MSP also covers some supplementary benefits for certain groups, including First Nations Health Authority clients. These supplementary benefits include acupuncture, chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathy, physical therapy, and non-surgical podiatry. However, MSP coverage for these services is fairly limited. For supplementary coverage details clients should visit the MSP website at www.gov.bc.ca/MSP . Note that MSP defines which items and services are medically necessary and not all services clients need may be covered. For details on which items and services are not covered by MSP visit www.gov.bc.ca/MSP . From time to time, the BC Ministry of Health may change the items or services that MSP covers. Health Benefits will not automatically take over covering these items or services. Health Benefits will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the item or services will be covered as a benefit. Clients with questions about MSP coverage can call Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. Who should register for MSP? Clients and dependents who are new to BC; Clients and dependents returning to BC (after 3 or more months away); Clients who have turned 19 years of age; or Clients who previously had their premiums paid by an employer or other source (e.g. individuals on Income Assistance). 6 HEALTH BENEFITS GUIDE | CURRENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. CHECK WWW.FNHA.CA/BENEFITS FOR UPDATES.Clients who previously had their premiums paid by an employer or other source, and would like Health Benefits to pay their MSP premiums, should call 1.855.550.5454 to be added to the Health Benefits MSP group. The Ministry of Health is eliminating MSP premiums in January, 2020. The MSP program will continue to provide eligible B.C. residents with provincially insured health care benefits. Clients should still register for MSP through Health Benefits. Most children are dependents on their parent or guardian's MSP coverage. When an Health Benefits client turns 19 years old, they should confirm with Health Benefits that they have their own MSP account to make sure coverage remains active and they do not receive a bill. Clients who need a PHN Clients who do not have an active PHN should submit an MSP Registration Form with supporting documentation to Health Benefits via mail or fax. Clients will also need to visit an Insurance Corporation of BC (ICBC) driver licensing office and request a Photo BC Services Card. The following information and supporting documentation must be submitted with the MSP Registration form, which is available online at http://www.fnha.ca/benefits/MSP . o Provide the following mandatory information: Band name and number; Full status number; Legal first and last name, as shown on government issued ID; Date of birth; and Residential address (cannot be a P.O. Box number). o Provide a previous PHN if applicable. o Ensure all boxes are marked off and all information is complete. o Include a copy of government issued picture ID such as a Canadian birth certificate, Canadian citizenship card/certificate, or Canadian passport. o Make sure application is clearly printed, signed, and dated by applicant (and spouse if needed). o Provide legal documentation that grants Power of Attorney if an individual is signing on behalf of someone else, or clearly indicate that they are a witness for someone who is incapable of signing personally. Making Changes to MSP Information Clients who would like to update their MSP information (e.g., add, remove, or change information) should complete an MSP Change Request Form available online at http://www.fnha.ca/benefits/MSP and mail or fax it to Health Benefits. All Change Request Forms should be submitted with the necessary supporting documentation (e.g., a copy of the marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.). Backdating MSP Coverage Clients who did not register with MSP through Health Benefits, and have been billed for MSP premiums as a result, may be eligible for backdated MSP coverage. Eligibility for backdated coverage depends on several factors such as the date the client moved to BC or the date the client obtained \"Indian Status.\" For more information about backdating MSP coverage call Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY 7Obtaining a BC Services Card The BC Services Card can be obtained from an ICBC driver licensing office, or by contacting Service BC toll free at: 1.800.663.7867. BC residents are required to update their picture ID in order to maintain an active PHN. For more information visit www.gov.bc.ca/bcservicescard. Extra Billing \"Extra billing\" is when a health care professional (e.g., doctor) bills a client more than what MSP pays for the service, meaning that the client has to pay for the difference in cost. Health Benefits will not pay extra billing charges nor reimburse clients who have paid extra billing charges. If clients receive bills from a doctor or hospital which they think is an \"extra billing\" charge, they should follow up with the Ministry of Health Medical Beneficiary Branch. For detailed information about MSP please visit www.gov.bc.ca/MSP . MSP AND LEAVING BRITISH COLUMBIA Health Benefits eligibility is based on residency in BC, which is defined by MSP. If clients leave BC for extended periods of time it might impact their eligibility for Health Benefits. Travelling Outside of BC or Canada MSP provides limited coverage to BC residents travelling outside of the province or country. Health Benefits clients are strongly advised to purchase additional health insurance before leaving BC, whether travelling to another province or outside of Canada. For more information visit the MSP website at www.gov.bc.ca/MSP . Health Benefits will cover items and services purchased or received in another province as long as they would be eligible for Health Benefits coverage if bought in BC, and were delivered by an eligible health professional. Detailed information about covered items and services under the dental, vision care, MS&E, and pharmacy benefits can be found in the online PBC Member Profile or the PBC Benefit Booklet, and the PharmaCare Plan W formulary. Please note that clients will likely have to pay for the item or service out-of-pocket and request reimbursement from Health Benefits. Clients can contact Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454 if they have any questions. Temporary Absence Clients who are planning to be in another province for up to 24 months (e.g., students or individuals working on a short-term contract) should contact Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454 to make sure their coverage continues while they are away. Interruption to MSP coverage may require the client to re-apply. Permanent Moves Clients who are moving to another province in Canada should contact Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454 to cancel their MSP and enroll in the federally-run Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) program.

FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY | 8 8 HEALTH BENEFITS GUIDE | CURRENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. CHECK WWW.FNHA.CA/BENEFITS FOR UPDATES.Health Benefits Overview Health Benefits covers specific health-related items and services that fall under six health benefit areas: Dental; Vision Care; Medical Supplies and Equipment (MS&E); Pharmacy; Medical Transportation (MT); and Mental Health. The mental health benefit provides coverage through three programs: Mental Wellness and Counselling; Indian Residential School Resolution Health Support; and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Health Support Services. Plan Coverage The Health Benefits program offers a comprehensive, principle-based, and community-driven plan. Items and services that are core benefits under the plan are fully covered. Flexibility in Coverage In order to offer clients more choice and flexibility, the plan also enables clients to access additional, alternative items and services that were previously unavailable. If, in consultation with a medical professional, clients choose an alternative to the core benefits, the plan may pay up to the amount covered for the equivalent core benefit. Clients will be responsible for any difference in cost. This way, clients can choose the item or service that best meets their needs. For example, the plan fully covers white dental fillings as a core benefit. Rather than exclude gold fillings completely, the plan offers coverage for gold fillings up to the amount covered for white fillings. This gives clients greater flexibility when discussing treatment options with a dental professional. Coordination of Benefits When clients have access to another third-party health insurance, they should submit claims to that plan first and to Health Benefits second. One exception is the pharmacy benefit, where clients should submit claims to PharmaCare first. Opting Out of Third-Party Insurance Clients can choose to opt out of private, employer-sponsored, or other public health care coverage once enrolled with Health Benefits. However, it is important to note that private insurance may offer additional benefits not available through Health Benefits. For example, Health Benefits does not include coverage for physiotherapy, chiropractic treatment, massage therapy, naturopathy, or other paramedical or supplementary services. If clients opt out of their private insurance they may lose coverage for those services. FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY 9PARTNERSHIPS Health Benefits provides some benefits through partnerships with First Nations organizations and other provincial health organizations. Health Benefits has partnered with Pacific Blue Cross (PBC), BC PharmaCare, and First Nations organizations to offer clients a convenient way to access their benefits.

The PBC Member Profile is an online service that offers convenient and secure access to benefit information 24 hours a day. Once logged in, clients can: Make and track online claims; View benefit coverage details; Track benefit usage; and Download claim forms. Clients can often receive reimbursements for online claims within two business days if they enter direct deposit information into their Member Profile account. Note that many providers can bill PBC directly for services, which mostly eliminates the need to pay out-of-pocket and then submit a claim for reimbursement. The PBC Member Profile displays benefit areas in three categories: Health, Dental, and Drug. The Health category contains the vision care and the MS&E benefits; The Dental category contains the dental benefit; and The Drug category contains some pharmacy items and services not covered by PharmaCare Plan W. Clients can explore these categories to learn about specific coverage details, including which items and services are core benefits and which are items included to provide flexibility in coverage. Items that show as \"Paid As\" are alternative options, where the plan will pay up to the amount covered for the equivalent core benefit. For example, gold dental fillings are shown as \"paid as white dental fillings\" to indicate that gold fillings are covered up to the same coverage amount as white fillings. Some pharmacy items and services are covered by PBC. Clients can search the Drug category on the Member Profile for details about which items and services are covered. Items that show as \"Not a Benefit\" on the Member Profile might be covered by PharmaCare Plan W.

It is important for clients to have access to the medical care that is most appropriate for their health and their medical condition. Prescription and over- the-counter (OTC) items are used to treat short-term illnesses, and are one of the many ways to help patients with chronic conditions live healthier, longer, and more fulfilling lives. The pharmacy benefit is administered through a partnership between Health Benefits, PBC, and BC PharmaCare. Clients can access detailed information about their pharmacy benefits through BC PharmaCare's formulary search. Additional information about coverage for pharmacy items is available through the online PBC Member Profile, available at www.pac.bluecross.ca. In addition, multiple provincial agencies including the BC Cancer Agency, BC Transplant, BC Renal Agency, and the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS provide specialty pharmacy items to all BC residents living with specific illnesses or conditions. Pharmacy Benefit Coverage Health Benefits covers specific pharmacy items and services under the following categories: Prescription drugs; Over-the-counter drugs; and Non-drug over-the-counter items (e.g., lancets for diabetic use). BC PharmaCare is the primary provider of eligible pharmacy items and services through Plan W. PBC provides supplementary pharmacy coverage. It is very important that clients enroll in Plan W so they can access their pharmacy benefits. Confirming enrollment is especially important for clients who live in communities on the Yukon and Alberta borders, or who have recently: Moved to BC; Turned 19; or Married or divorced. Clients who would like to confirm whether they are enrolled, or who need to enroll with Plan W for the first time, should have their status number ready and call Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. Most pharmacy items are fully covered under the pharmacy benefit. If clients are asked to pay for their medication at the pharmacy counter, it's likely that the item is not covered.

Pharmacies registered with PBC and PharmaCare can direct bill for all eligible pharmacy items and services. 20 HEALTH BENEFITS GUIDE | CURRENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. CHECK WWW.FNHA.CA/BENEFITS FOR UPDATES.Brand Name and Generic Drugs It is important to understand the differences and similarities between brand name and generic drugs . Brand name drugs are the first version of a drug to be sold within a country and can only be sold by the company that researched and developed the drug (e.g., Tylenol). Brand name drugs are more expensive because of the money invested in research, development and marketing. Generic drugs are a copy of a brand name drug that any company can sell (e.g., acetaminophen). Generic drugs have the same active ingredients as the brand name drug but cost less because the drug company does not need to invest money in creating it. Generic drugs undergo the same regulatory testing and are just as safe as brand name drugs. Most public and private drug plans, including Health Benefits, cover a mix of brand name and generic drugs. If there is a medical reason the client cannot take a generic drug on Health Benefits formulary list, the prescriber may be able to request Special Authority to ensure the medication is covered. Approvals Before Services Some items and services covered under the pharmacy benefit require approval before pharmacy providers can bill for them. Approvals for pharmacy items covered under PharmaCare are called Special Authorities. Approvals for pharmacy items covered under PBC are called Prior Authorizations. Prescribers can submit Special Authority requests directly to PharmaCare, and Prior Authorization requests directly to PBC. If they receive authorization, they can provide the item or service and bill PharmaCare or PBC directly. If PharmaCare denies a Special Authority request, prescribers can resubmit the request with additional rationale. If clients decide to pay out-of-pocket for an item or service before PharmaCare or PBC has authorized a Special Authority or Prior Authorization request - or despite PharmaCare or PBC denying the request - reimbursements will not be issued. Pharmacy providers can identify which items and services require approval and which are covered under the pharmacy benefit by checking the Pharmacare Plan W formulary search, or their PBC Provider Portal, \"PROVIDERnet.\" If the provider is unable to determine requirements or coverage, the client or pharmacy provider should contact Health Benefits at 1.855.550-5454.

Mail requests to: Health Insurance BC STN PROV GOVT Victoria, BC V8W 9P7 FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY 33Frequently Asked Questions GENERAL QUESTIONS Can I continue to use my current provider (e.g., oral health provider or optometrist) if they do not bill PBC directly? Yes, that is your choice. However, we encourage clients to call 1.855.550.5454 to make sure that the item or service is covered. If the provider does not bill PBC, clients will have to pay out-of-pocket for the item or service and submit a reimbursement request to PBC. Also, providers may charge more than the rate covered, but PBC only reimburses up to the maximum coverage rate, regardless of what the provider charges. Why should I keep my private insurance if I am eligible for Health Benefits? Some benefits covered under private or employer-sponsored insurance are not covered under Health Benefits (e.g., physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment). Does Health Benefits provide out-of-country coverage? Health Benefits may cover the cost of supplemental health insurance premiums for approved students or migrant workers. Supplementary health insurance coverage for all other travel outside of Canada (e.g., vacation travel) is not a benefit under Health Benefits. When travelling outside of Canada, it is recommended that you buy travel health insurance in case of an emergency. What is the difference between an Exception and an Exclusion? If a client has exceptional needs or circumstances, Health Benefits may provide additional coverage for an item or service as an Exception. Exception requests are determined on a case-by-case basis. Exclusions are items and services that are excluded from Health Benefits coverage under all circumstances. Excluded items and services are not available through the exceptions process and cannot be appealed. Can I appeal a decision and how would I go about it? When coverage for an item or service has been denied, the client or their parent/guardian has the right to appeal the decision. Appeals must be forwarded in writing and can be initiated by either the client, their legal guardian, or the client's interpreter. More detailed information can be found in the \"Appeals\" section of this guide on page 31. How do I make a complaint about a provider or health organization? Clients can email provider@fnha.ca if they would like to make a complaint. 34 HEALTH BENEFITS GUIDE | CURRENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. CHECK WWW.FNHA.CA/BENEFITS FOR UPDATES.AMBULANCE BILLS Why have I received a bill for ambulance services? Health Benefits covers ambulance bills for our clients. To receive coverage, clients must provide BC Ambulance with their status number and PHN to allow BC Ambulance to invoice Health Benefits. Clients with questions about ambulance bills should call Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. I received an ambulance and hospital bill for medical care incurred in the United States and, unfortunately, I did not buy travel insurance for travel outside of Canada. Can H ealth Benefits assist in paying? No, Health Benefits does not cover medical bills incurred outside of Canada. Clients may want to contact the Ministry of Health Out-of-Country Claims Department to discuss any other coverage they may have through MSP. BC MEDICAL SERVICES PLAN (MSP) I filed my income tax return and the Canada Revenue Agency is indicating that I owe for unpaid MSP premiums. Why? If clients receive a bill for unpaid MSP premiums, they likely are not registered with the Health Benefits MSP group. Clients who receive a bill for unpaid MSP premiums should complete an MSP application form, available online at http://www.fnha.ca/benefits/MSP and submit it to Health Benefits with the attached bill and supporting documentation. Health Benefits may backdate coverage for eligible clients up to a maximum of five years. Which services are not covered by MSP? Some MSP exclusions include: cosmetic surgery, reversal of sterilization, in-vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, genetic screening and other genetic investigations including DNA probes, acupuncture, hypnotherapy, acupressure, and procedures still in the experimental or developmental phase. Clients should contact MSP for a complete list of what is covered and what is not. What's the difference between a BC Care Card and a BC Services Card? On February 15, 2013 the provincial government introduced the BC Services Card. This card replaces the BC Care Card and can be combined with a driver's license. It is secure government issued identification that British Columbians can use to prove their identity and access provincially-funded health services. In the future, the BC Services Card will provide in-person and online access to other government services. A BC Services Card can be issued at an ICBC driver licensing office or you can contact Service BC at 1.800.663.7867 for an alternate approach to get a new card. For more information about the BC Services Card, visit www.gov.bc.ca/bcservicescard. FIRST NATIONS HEALTH AUTHORITY 35BENEFITS The provider (e.g., oral health provider, optometrist) is charging me for treatment. Why? Health Benefits has a specific fee schedule for each benefit area that outlines what items and services are covered, how much coverage is available, and how often clients can access the benefit. Health care providers may charge above what Health Benefits covers, and clients are responsible for covering these additional costs. I have been prescribed a drug and the pharmacist has told me that it is not covered through Health Benefits. Why? Health Benefits drug plan is comprehensive. If you have been prescribed an item that is not covered, the prescriber can request Special Authority from BC PharmaCare for exceptional coverage. Alternatively, you can ask the pharmacist for other treatment options that are covered. Clients with coverage questions can call Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. Is my local pharmacy an approved PharmaCare site? Pharmacies in BC and some pharmacies along the BC border are eligible to enroll with PharmaCare. If you would like to know if your pharmacy is enrolled with PharmaCare, please ask your pharmacy directly. If you would like to discuss this further, contact the Health Benefits at 1.855.550.5454. Why does my oral health provider have to send in a request before performing some services? Predetermination, or prior approval, is common practice for most public and private dental plans. The predetermination process ensures that both the oral health provider and Health Benefits client are informed of the policies and under- stand what is covered. Clients must meet all of the clinical criteria and guidelines established by Health Benefits, where applicable, for the treatment to be considered for coverage. Are chiropractic, massage therapy, naturopathy, physical therapy, or podiatry services covered through Health Benefits? No, these services (often called \"supplementary or paramedical benefits\") are not covered by Health Benefits. However, MSP does provide some coverage of supplementary benefits for clients registered with the Health Benefits MSP group. MSP will pay a set amount per visit up to a combined maximum of 10 visits each calendar year. Please note that most health practitioners may charge above what MSP covers, meaning clients will have to pay out-of-pocket for the difference in cost.
