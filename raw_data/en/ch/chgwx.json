Compounding Pharmacies Most of us have needed a prescription drug in our lives; some of us take medication every day. So what happens if we're allergic to something in the pill we need? What if a child can't swallow a pill? What if someone needs a non-standard dose of a medicine? What if a dog won't take its medicine because it doesn't like the taste? All of these problems and more are solved by compounding pharmacies. Compounding is the practice of mixing drugs to fit the specific needs of individual patients. Many pharmacies provide compounding to an extent, but a few specialize in the practice. The Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB) certifies compounding pharmacies by reviewing their standards for quality of staff, policies, procedures, documentation, and handling of problems. There are currently only five accredited compounding pharmacies in Michigan; Clark Professional Pharmacy in Ypsilanti and Specialty Medicine Compounding Pharmacy in South Lyon are two. Pharmacy Solutions in Ann Arbor is working toward this accreditation and expects to receive it by mid-2012. Nathan Worthing, owner of Clark Professional Pharmacy, has expanded his compounding pharmacy to include nutritional counseling with an emphasis on sickness prevention using medicinal foods. He recently became a Certified First Line Therapist through Metagenics nutritional line, which trains practitioners about early detection of and supplement support for diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory disorders. In addition, the pharmacy is now accepting most insurance plans.\"I am interested in talking to patients about food being medicine and how to eat in such a manner to select food choices to reduce medication use,\" said Worthing, who explains that even simple foods like wheat, which is very pro-inflammatory, should be eliminated to improve inflammatory conditions and reduce the use of drugs. Clark Professional Pharmacy has been around since 1980 and the original female pharmacist, Olya Lash, was holistic. Back then the pharmacy existed on referrals alone and wasn't widely known. Nathan Worthing began working and training with Lash in 1999 and eventually purchased the pharmacy from her in 2008 along with another pharmacist, Ahed Salamen. Worthing is the managing partner. \"Veterinary and fertility medications were the main focus in the 1980s and '90s. That eventually morphed into women's health in general, natural hormone balancing, and then again into nutritional compounding, because many women had nutritional needs that were not being met by pharmaceutical industry products,\" said Worthing, who is a Certified Menopause Practitioner and Certified Nutritionist. \"The biggest thing that makes Clark Pharmacy different from traditional pharmacies is me. I actually care about the people that I see. I want to see them do well and I go out of my way to make sure things are done correctly and spend extra money and effort to train my lab staff appropriately,\" said Worthing. \"It's a relationship built business. I have close relationships with the prescribers and also with the patients.\" As a Menopause Practitioner, Worthing works with women to discuss their options for hormone therapies, reviews the studies available about the treatments, and helps them come up with solid choices for their individual situations. He stresses that women on hormone therapy need to take fish oil, magnesium, and folic acid because it makes hormone therapy safer and they should watch what food triggers they may have and how other drug therapies are affecting them. The pharmacy also makes many different preparations for the autistic population that help modulate behavior and are allergen-free drugs because most of the children are on very restricted diets. Worthing is available for private consultations and is always available to do lectures for particular groups.

Many pharmacies provide compounding to an extent, but a few specialize in the practice. Kenny Walkup, owner and compounding pharmacist at Specialty Medicine Compounding Pharmacy. It is a full- service compounding pharmacy and offers high-quality supplements in addition to prescription drugs. See article on page 13.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 12Sahar and Ahab Swidan are the sister and brother team of compounding pharmacists who head Pharmacy Solutions in Ann Arbor. Ms. Swidan opened the pharmacy in 2001 after working at Chelsea Hospital. The pharmacy is a full- service compounding pharmacy, offering all of the products compounding pharmacies are known for: pain gels, hormone replacement therapies, natural thyroid hormones, allergen-free medications, flavored medications for children, and pharmacy-grade supplements. Mr. Swidan says that what sets Pharmacy Solutions apart is the level to which each patient is educated in their own care, \"sometimes more than they want!\" He says it is important to him to counsel each patient to make sure they are taking the correct dose in the correct way to achieve the best therapeutic effect. The pharmacists also help patients coordinate their care; for example, if the patient has several physicians, the pharmacists will make sure communication is happening so there are no harmful drug interactions. Mr. Swidan says that compounding is in a way a return to the old-fashioned pharmacy, in which every drug was mixed for the individual patient to the doctor's specifications. Pharmacy Solutions accepts many insurance plans and expects to receive the PCAB accreditation within the next year. Their website is www.pharmacysolutionsonline.com. They can be reached at ederm@pharmacysolutionsonline.com or at 734-821-8000. Kenny Walkup, owner and compounding pharmacist at Specialty Medicine Compounding Pharmacy in South Lyon, has been compounding for 12 years. He says he \"really wanted to practice pharmacy that had a true impact on each and every patient,\" and was more able to fulfill that desire with compounding than with standard pharmacy. He gave me a tour of the facility, including a sterile products lab where they can make injections, IV therapies, eye drops. and ear drops. I watched a technician making capsules in a 100-capsule batch. Another technician was making dog biscuits. Walkup says that 30-40 percent of Specialty Medicine's business comes from specialized animal medication. They have made medicine for dogs, cats, gerbils, hamsters, rabbits, ducks, fish, and birds. He says that taste is one of the most important aspects of medicine for dogs and cats who will not take the medicine if they don't like it. The pharmacy offers more than ten different flavors \"from apple to bacon to cheese; whatever the animal likes to eat.\" Another option for animals and for people is a topical gel that can be rubbed on thin skin, such as inside the wrist for a person or in the ears for a cat. Walkup described several uses for these gels, from pain management for hospice patients to nausea relief for pregnant women. He says that gels are generally very well-tolerated and have fewer side effects than pills that must be ingested; they are also easier on patients who may have trouble swallowing pills. Specialty Medicine is a full-service compounding pharmacy and offers high- quality supplements in addition to prescription drugs. Walkup is happy to provide counseling about supplements that may help counteract the depletion of nutrients by some prescription drugs. You can find out more at www.specialty-medicine.com. Mr. Walkup can be reached at 248-446-2643 or contact@specialty-medicine.com. In May of 2011, esthetician Jessica Elkins changed the name of her business, Ananeo Skin Care, to Jessica's Skin & Body Apothecary. The name change reflects a change in the business model, which will focus increasingly on Elkins' own product lines. The business, currently located in an inviting private room inside the A2 Yoga building, began by offering facials and waxing, then added mineral cosmetics. Now the Apothecary offers hand-blended body and perfume oils for a variety of purposes. This fall Elkins introduced a body oil line for winter to add to her summer line launched in May 2011. The winter oils are designed for the dryer winter season with marula and sesame oils to penetrate and balance the moisture level in skin. Essential oils are added for different aromatherapy and other benefits and make the oils smell great. For those who prefer unscented oil or like to use Elkin's perfume oil line in addition to the body oils, pure body oils such as Jojoba are available. Oils can also be custom blended for particular scents, aromatherapy, or skin benefits, and are pure, without preservatives or other additives. Elkins emphasizes that the body oils are best used right after bathing, within 3-5 minutes after toweling off, for best absorption. She also says that they are not for the face, which has a very different chemistry than the rest of the body. According to Elkins, \"aromatherapy can be therapeutic to the body or to the mind.\" One of her more innovative products is an inhaler that contains seven essential oils to clear the sinuses. She also offers \"sinus steam facials\" during the cold and flu season, which combine a cleansing facial with aromatherapy for sinus relief. Elkins says that her philosophy for skincare is \"hydration, hydration, hydration.\" She explains that many people have dry skin not from lack of water, but from an imbalance of water and oil in the skin. Even acne can be caused by or contributed to by a water/oil imbalance. Elkins says that, as an esthetician, part of her job is to help clients reestablish this moisture balance by choosing the right products. She says that the biochemistry of the products is very important. A product can contain a beneficial ingredient such as green tea, but if the product is not correctly formulated the ingredient will not be absorbed by the skin. Personalized, professional skincare recommendations are what Elkins says inspired her to name her business an \"apothecary,\" which she feels evokes the idea of trust that the esthetician is a professional who will recommend the best skincare regimen for each person. \"We're not here to sell, we're here to take care of our clients,\" she says. Jessica's Skin & Body Apothecary is currently offering a complimentary 15-minute skincare or aromatherapy consultation. If you would like to get in touch with them, you can call 734-604-5971, email contact@jessicasapothecary. com or book an appointment online at www. jessicasapothecary.com. New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses Christine Fodor, wellness practitioner and Reiki master of Sheenadwah Freespirit Enterprises, has expanded with a new look, location, and website called Transformational Health and Wellness: Body Mind Spirit Therapies and Support Services. \"I have many certifications and I have been trained in many modalities, but what has changed in the last two years is that I have focused more on doing all sessions intuitively rather than only focusing on a trained modality, which is what I prefer to do anyway. There will be a little bit of Reiki, cranial sacral therapy, past lives, angel cards, etheric surgery or whatever shows up for that person. Sometimes people are so stressed out, we really need to go into a meditation and relaxation techniques to allow for deeper healing work and emotional releases,\" said Fodor, whose business is based in Ypsilanti. Fodor was trained as a Certified Nursing Assistant in summer 2010 and is a Physical Therapy Assistant Student graduating in spring of 2012. Recently she said there has been a surge in requests for the seven session emotional and mental subconscious re-patterning therapy, which enables people to let go of things that have them stuck. \"It's like they are hitting a wall and there is something there that is keeping them from expanding more and moving forward through an issue,\" said Fodor. She explained that just clearing out some cellular energy helps people let go of those things. Fodor offers the unique Atlantean Crystal Healing Grid, a handmade copper grid made with sacred geometry that serves as a conduit for higher vibration crystal therapy. The grid connects copper handles containing crushed crystals that act as jumper cables to enhance the healing to those who lay on it. Another crystal therapy that Fodor has available is the BioMat, which is a mat that clients lie on that has far-infrared heat and negative ions, and is also filled with amethyst crystals. Both these gadgets are free to use if someone books an appointment with Fodor. Fodor, who has been running meditations for years, is very skilled and engaging as she takes people on journeys to faraway lands for healing. She is now offering a new meditation group in Ypsilanti that will focus on participants' interests. Fodor is available for different parties The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 13 Sahar Swidan of Pharmacy Solutions in Ann Arbor \"Compounding is in a way a return to the old-fashioned pharmacy, in which every drug was mixed for the individual patient to the doctor's specifications.\" - Ahab Swidan of Pharmacy Solutions in Ann Arbor Jessica Elkins of Jessica's Skin & Body Apothecary Christine Fodor of Sheenadwah Freespirit Enterprises offers the unique Atlantean Crystal Healing Grid, a handmade copper grid made with sacred geometry that serves as a conduit for higher vibration crystal therapy.Continued on page 15The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 14 Look for us in new places!

New Books by Area Authors Linda Diane Feldt, local author, holistic healthcare practitioner, herbalist, cranio-sacral therapist and long time Crazy Wisdom Community Journal contributor, is releasing three new books online in a serial format throughout 2012. Each book is being published in 52 sections, once weekly. At the end of the subscription year, the complete books will be available in print or e-book format. The first book, available for subscription beginning in October 2011, is titled Cultivate Curiosity and Anticipate Miracles: Observations of Life . Feldt describes this book as a group of short, true stories about \"life, love, death, dogs, nature, music and more,\" taken from her own life experience. She offers these stories to provide humor, insight, and inspiration. The second book is available for subscription beginning in November 2011 and is called Integrating Ethics: Resources for Integrative and Alternative Healthcare . Feldt draws on thirty years of experience in the integrative and alternative healthcare field. She hopes this book will provide a platform for thoughtful conversation about ethics among alternative healthcare practitioners and will help build bridges between traditional and alternative medicine. The third book is called Wildcrafting Recipes and will be available beginning in January 2012. A new healthy, vegetarian recipe will be sent for each week of the year with descriptions of how to obtain and use ingredients from the outdoors.

Local author Elaine K. Williams published The Sacred Work of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren in September 2011. The book addresses the many issues faced by an increasing number of families in the United States; according to Williams, 1 in 10 children is raised by a grandparent or relative other than their mother or father. Williams was inspired to write the book during a trip to Washington, DC, when she stumbled upon then-Senator Hillary Clinton addressing a crowd of hundreds of grandparents raising their grandchildren. For some of these grandparents, Hurricane Katrina had displaced their adult children; others were raising their grandchildren for a variety of other reasons. Prior to this experience, she says she had no idea that this trend was so widespread. Touched by their plight and by the kindness she witnessed in this group of grandparents, she became determined to find out more. Since that time, Williams' own sister has become a parenting grandparent. While writing the book, Williams spoke to more than 60 families in 11 states. She found that many circumstances lead to adult children being unable to parent their children, including mental health problems, alienation, drug use, criminal activity, and social and emotional issues. Grandparents were not only having to deal with \"stepping up to do something that's not in the cycle of life as we know it\" by raising their grandchildren, but were also coping with the loss of their adult children or the sorrow of their crippling problems. Williams said she was unable to find any book that addressed the psycho-social needs and problems of these grandparents and their grandchildren, and only a few resources were available online. She hopes that her book will serve as a resource to parenting grandparents, their grandchildren, and professionals who support these families, including teachers and social workers. Elaine K. Williams will be talking about her book at Crazy Wisdom on Sunday, January 8 at 2:00 p.m. The Sacred Work of Grandparents Raising Grandchildren can be purchased at the author's website, www.elainekwilliams.com. The author can be reached at 248-396-5735 or at elainekwilliams@aol.com. Carla Wilson, M.S.W., author of What if I'm Right?, will be talking about her book at Crazy Wisdom on Saturday April 21 from 2:00-4:30 p.m. What if I'm Right? was published in March of 2011. The book draws on Wilson's 20 years of experience as a correctional officer in Washtenaw County and addresses incarceration and addiction. For those with an incarcerated or addicted loved one, it is a resource in understanding what their loved one is going through and why they may act the way they do. For the incarcerated and addicted, Wilson says that it is a guide to \"recognizing their own brilliance and finding the way out of their personal storm.\" She hopes that the book will \"help break the stigma of addiction and incarceration and bring people hope.\" What if I'm Right? can be purchased at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. It is also available as an eBook for the Kindle or Nook. You can contact Carla Wilson at 734-337-2023 or cwilson@connectionprinciple.com. More information is available at www.connectionprinciple.com.

Robin Connell, M.Ed, F.H.H.C in less than 5 months GUARANTEED!go from free article available @Upcoming Events Susana Stoica is a local author and energy healer. On March 10, 2012, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom, she will offer an Introduction to Alternative Healing Methods. Stoica has been teaching this topic to medical students at the University of Michigan for three years. Trained as a computer engineer, Stoica has always had an intuitive gift for healing, which she began to use with her family. She says that when they were sick, \"I had a feeling of what I had to do to make them well.\" Then, in 1982, she experienced a dramatic spontaneous healing event: she touched a woman who was very sick and the woman was healed. This both terrified and intrigued her, and with a researcher's determination she began to study as many forms of alternative healing as she could find. At first, she was afraid to touch anyone, worrying that if she could make someone well, perhaps she could make them ill by accident! In the years following, Stoica's son was diagnosed with Cushing's disease, which is caused by a pituitary tumor. Deciding she had to help him, Stoica began trying to heal her son. His doctor found him to be much improved and he eventually recovered completely without medical intervention. The doctor was baffled; finally Stoica told him what she had done. The doctor recognized the value of her gift and began sending very sick patients to her in 1985. In 2000, Stoica fell on some ice and sustained a brain injury to her frontal lobe. She has since traveled a long and hard road to recovery, describing the time after the fall as \"garbled.\" She had difficulty communicating and stopped her healing practice for a time. Eventually, she began to attempt healing again and says that, even though the brain injury was hindering her in some ways, it had actually increased her intuition, which she says was \"working overtime.\" Because of this she was able to continue her healing practice, which she has continued to do, while also continuing to research and learn about alternative healing of all kinds. Stoica describes her upcoming seminar as \"a playful experiential presentation of different alternatives.\" Topics covered include energy healing, long-distance healing, muscle testing, allergy testing and elimination, hypnotherapy and its use in surgical recovery and healing emotional trauma, meditation, hatha yoga, qi gong, reflexology, polarity healing and more. Students will learn which therapies are useful for what desired result, how to find reputable practitioners and what to read next for more information on the different modalities. Stoica says that the seminar will be of interest to doctors, nurses, medical students, and anyone who would like to learn about alternative medicine as a supplement to traditional medicine. The seminar includes a copy of Stoica's book, Healing With a Loving Heart. For more information, visit her website at www.stoica.com. To inquire and register for the seminar, contact Ms. Stoica at 248-895-5784 or Susana@Stoica.com. Michele Bond of Yoga House will be hosting a weekend with well-known yoga star and creator of the DVD series Yoga to the Rescue Desir\u00e9e Rumbaugh on March 31-April 1, 2012. The retreat will be held at the Eagle Crest Marriot Resort in Ypsilanti, with a block of rooms available at discounted rates for participants who wish to stay for the entire event. Individuals will also be able to register for single classes. According to Bond, beginners, experienced practitioners, and instructors alike will find the weekend valuable. She says \"these classes are great for anyone who would like to learn simple yogic solutions for aches and pains, injuries, and even chronic pain.\" Rumbaugh's style is Anusara Yoga, which Bond describes as \"based on the science of biomechanics...spiritually uplifting, heart centered, fostering love and happiness.\" For updates, schedule, and registration information, visit www.yogahouseannarbor. com/html/special_events.html.

On Saturday and Sunday, April 14 and 15, from 9:00-5:00 p.m., award-winning screenwriter, writing professor and former Michigan resident Bonnie Garvin will offer a workshop for aspiring screenwriters in Ann Arbor. \"Everybody's a writer,\" Garvin says. \"We all have our own stories and our own way of telling them.\" This intensive workshop is designed to help participants begin the process of writing for the screen in a structured way with help and guidance from someone who has been through it and knows how to get the desired results. \"Nothing is worse than that blank computer screen,\" says Garvin, who mentioned many people come home after writing workshops and fail to make any progress on their projects. Her workshops get people to begin writing on the very first day, creating momentum to carry them forward. Garvin has held many writing workshops, but for the first time she will be including special instruction and exercises in adaptation. She points out that a huge percentage of successful screenplays are based on existing stories \u2014 from the writer's life, from classic tales, or from news items. She will guide participants in harvesting these ideas and weaving them into material that is fresh and new. Garvin says that her workshops can help anyone with an interest in writing \u2014 from beginners to those experienced in the process. \"You keep learning the craft the more you do it,\" she says, and adds that she is constantly learning from her students as they learn from her. She says that, of course, she can't guarantee anyone a career in the film industry, which she calls \"the most competitive thing in the world,\" but emphasizes that the first step to a career is developing \"really strong material\" and confidence in one's own work. The workshop location will be announced in January. For updates and more information, head to www.fromideatoscript.com. Bonnie Garvin can be reached by email at bonnie@ideatoscript.com or by phone at 323-656-6390. Dr. Joanne Karpinen, licensed psychologist and certified energy psychologist, will hold an esoteric healing seminar on April 26-29, 2012. This seminar is Part One in a series of workshops offered by the Integrated Network of Esoteric Healing (INEH), through which Karpinen is one of seventy certified instructors worldwide. The course is titled An Introduction to Esoteric Healing and no experience is required to attend. This four-day course will introduce students to the body's energy field and chakras and how to perceive imbalances and disruptions in the energy field that affect physical, mental, and emotional health. Karpinen explains that because of the \"non-locality of the mind,\" the energy field can be sensed and worked on without touching the body, and even at long distances (though always with the permission of the person being worked on). The INEH curriculum, according to Karpinen, is \"very practical and systematic.\" She says it describes a \"blueprint in the energy field that reflects what is happening in the tissue.\" Energy healing as taught by the INEH is used \"to unblock the energy that has become stuck or somehow out of alignment or disrupted.\" As the energy field reflects the tissues and structures of the body, the body responds to the energy and can be healed through healing the energy field. Karpinen states \"the soul is the healer of the form.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 16 What's New in the Community Continued from page 15 Dr. Joanne Karpinen On March 10, 2012, Susana Stoica is giving a seminar, Introduction to Alternative Healing Methods, for doctors, nurses, medical students, and anyone who would like to learn about alternative medicine as a supplement to traditional medicine.

Meditation, mindfulness, and intention are taught as paths toward self and planetary healing. Karpinen explains that \"the Earth is in the process of becoming a sacred planet. In healing ourselves, we are also healing the planet.\" Completing this introductory seminar will give participants tools and a treatment protocol that they can begin to use on themselves, loved ones, and even pets, immediately.

New Classes Angela Jamison is a teacher of Ashtanga Yoga who moved to Ann Arbor from Los Angeles with her husband in 2009. Her husband came for a post-doctorate position with the University of Michigan and she found herself with a position in the Sociology Department as a visiting scholar. She believed that she and her husband would want to leave Michigan for warmer climates as soon as possible, but they found themselves falling in love with Ann Arbor and decided to make it their home. Having begun practicing yoga in LA, Jamison spent the winters of 2009 and 2010 in India studying at the Ashtanga Yoga Institute in Mysore. The director, R. Sharath Jois, asked her to begin teaching the practice each morning. At first she felt torn \u2014 this would mean giving up her academic career. After some thought, Jamison says, \"In truth, I had done fifteen thousand hours of practice and two apprenticeships to train for this step, and just needed to take the leap.\" She left her job at the University and now teaches Ashtanga Yoga full-time. Jamison first became involved in yoga ten years ago, as part of her recovery from a major car accident. \"The surgeon told me to take responsibility for my own body and start taking yoga,\" she says, laughing. She says the practice she found was very different from the \"typical LA yoga scene.\" The practice is done early in the morning, in silence. In the beginning, she says she felt \"kinesthetically unintelligent, as a typical academic.\" But as she began to practice daily, she found it to be exactly what she was looking for; \"the ultimate personal practice,\" a way to care for herself physically, mentally, and spiritually. Since that time, Jamison has practiced 6 days a week continuously and considers herself \"an experiment of the method\" and a testament to what Ashtanga Yoga can do for a person physically and mentally. The practice, she says, works for every type of person. In her students she looks for sincerity and discipline. Though she teaches a beginner's class once weekly at the Phoenix Center, she accepts only one new student into her daily morning classes each month, devoting much of her teaching energy toward that person so that they can \"receive focused instruction and...enjoy the rhythmic, focused vibe of more experienced practitioners.\" Each person has a personalized practice that they memorize, so while the class silently practices together, everyone is not doing the same thing. Part of her method, Jamison explains, is to \"let [her students] learn from themselves and...do the work they need to do.\" She calls the practice \"difficult but peaceful,\" and says it is a \"fast track to developing concentration, as there is so much to focus on physically.\" In addition to the weekly beginner's class and daily morning classes, Jamison teaches 10 private sessions weekly in her home studio on the Old West Side of Ann Arbor. The beginner class is held on Thursdays from 7:00-8:15 a.m. at the Phoenix Center at 220 S. Main St. You can find out more on her website, www.ashtangaannarbor.com. She can be reached by email at annarborashtanga@gmail.com and by phone at 310-409-5108. Sandy Pierani, occupational therapist and fitness instructor, is now offering her self-designed World Dance Workout classes at the Ann Arbor Senior Center at 1320 Baldwin Rd. The classes feature live drummers and mixes West African dance with other dance movements from around the world. According to Pierani, movement in the class is nonstop and uses the whole body \"from the top of your head down to your toes,\" creating a rhythmic and energetic experience that brings mind, body, and spirit together. Participants get a great workout, but they also get to experience \"healing from the inside out.\" Pierani explains, \"when you're moving, gyrating, and shaking, you're also detoxifying, releasing lots of toxic stuff that you might not even realize, physical and emotional, down to the cellular level.\" Live drumming makes this class unique among fitness dance classes. The drummers respond to the instruction and pace of the dancing, collaborating with the instructor and the dancers for a dynamic experience. The class winds down with light strength training, abdominal work, and stretching for a complete workout. Pierani emphasizes that the workout is appropriate for \"all fitness levels, all shapes and sizes, all ethnic groups, whether you've been exercising for ten years or two weeks.\" Current attendees range in age from 18 to late 60s and each person is challenged at his or her own level. Hi, medium and low-impact movements are shown and the participant can choose which to do based on individual needs and preferences. Classes are offered in 6-week sessions and currently meet on Sundays from 6:30-7:30 p.m. Scholarships are offered for those who would otherwise not be able to attend. Pierani also teaches Zumba and will begin teaching Pilates in January through Ann Arbor Rec & Ed.

New Practitioners & Businesses Pam and Andy Krupp, husband and wife teachers and owners of Just Love, a \"mindfulness based online clothing store,\" have revamped their store's website and are working on the next phase of their business. Just Love offers t-shirts and other items such as mugs and bumper stickers featuring inspiring quotes from leaders like Gandhi, Mother Theresa, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. A portion of the proceeds from sales at Just Love support several charities. Pam Krupp says that, originally, she and her husband were considering starting their own non-profit organization, but realized that there were many charities already up and running that had missions that resonated with them. They instead decided to start a business that supported some of those organizations, while at the same time reminding people of the positive aspects of humanity. Pam says that \"the world is ready for some love.\" She says that she often hears from customers who have given their Just Love shirts away to others who admired them; \"it's not about the shirt,\" she says, \"it's about the message.\" The Krupps look for small charities whose leaders are extremely passionate about their mission. That list currently includes Cheerful Givers, Spread the Bread, Habitat for Humanity, Free the Children, and several others. Just Love primarily operates online but also stocks shirts in a few yoga studios and small stores and sells at some festivals. Pam says that their next steps include approaching more studios and stores to carry the shirts and increasing their marketing efforts. Thus far they have depended mainly on word of mouth. The website has been completely redone, and new designs are in the works for release during the first part of 2012. The Krupps' son, Joshua Wallace, is an artist who creates the shirt designs. Outside of Just Love, the Krupps teach emotional intelligence to grade schoolers. Pam says that it is important to them to make their work a part of their practice of mindfulness and love. When asked about her favorite shirt, Pam says that she likes the plain Just Love logo the best \u2014 she says it captures the message perfectly.

Eva Neuhaus, Certified Massage Therapist and M.A. in Somatic Psychology, relocated her Intuitive Coaching Practice from California to Ann Arbor in August 2011. Through a combination of bodywork, energy work, and dialogue, she collaborates with clients to help them explore patterns at work in their bodies and lives. Neuhaus specializes in working with \"highly sensitive folks\" \u2014 the estimated 20 percent of the human population whose nervous systems process information more intensely than others. Sensitivity is sometimes stigmatized and considered a weakness, but Neuhaus views it as a strength and a gift. Through her work, she helps empower highly sensitive people to thrive by learning to care for their own distinct needs as sensitivities and by embracing their creativity, intuition, and empathy to fulfill their unique purpose.

Dr. Joy Mutinda opened her part time private practice in April of 2010. A licensed psychologist, she works for the University of Michigan's Counseling and Psychological Services department counseling students in addition to working with private patients. She is \"committed to serving underrepresented populations,\" including lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual people, as well as people of different racial and ethnic groups. These groups, she says, \"may not seek out counseling as much as others,\" and she feels it is important to provide an open, welcoming, non-judgmental place for them to seek help. A woman of color herself, Mutinda describes herself as warm, friendly, and approachable. She notes that in her practice she is \"sex-positive,\" which she explains as non-judgmental of sexuality, sexual practices, and attractions that are different from the \"norm.\" One example of this is her experience working with clients who choose to be in consensually non-monogamous (polyamorous) relationships. Mutinda says that she has helped people navigate boundaries, feelings of jealousy, and other issues that may come up in these relationships without condemning people's choices to engage in them, whereas some therapists would view them as automatically problematic and pathological. Mutinda counsels from what she calls a \"feminist-oriented perspective,\" which she believes is more collaborative than traditional therapy. She states, \"they are the experts in their own life and path; I just help them navigate that path.\" Dr. Mutinda is online at www. drjoymutinda.com. She can be reached via email at drjoymutinda@gmail.com or phone at 734-353-2151. New business owner, Deb Rhizal, opened Arts of Wellness in June of 2011 and is pleased to offer wellness and family coaching and deep relaxation sessions utilizing bodywork, breath work, and visualization tools. She is also offering a new childbirth preparation class for families about to experience the birth process. Rhizal is a certified Wellness Coach through Well Coaches Incorporated, a Reiki practitioner, childbirth educator, certified birth Doula, and a student of Zero Balancing, a hands-on therapy that works with energy current at the bone level. She enjoys helping people make lifestyle changes in service of their health and wellbeing. Psychologist Joy Mutinda's private practice is committed to serving underrepresented populations, including lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual people, as well as people of different racial and ethnic groups.Neuhaus came to the healing arts through a background in dance. She eventually realized she was \"more interested in the therapeutic process than in the performance\" and went on to pursue her master's in somatic psychology, a discipline focused on the intersection of the body and mind, as well as training in massage and energy healing. According to Neuhaus, most people struggle to change by engaging the limited conscious mind. Because the body is \"a repository of the unconscious,\" tapping its intelligence enables deep and lasting transformation. She says that trauma can leave an imprint on the body and mind, and that healing modalities that include the body can be particularly effective for resolving trauma, with a more enduring effect. Neuhaus emphasizes that her practice is based on \"using intuition in a pragmatic way.\" She teaches clients to do what she calls \"spiritual detective work\" for themselves, empowering them to make more informed and authentic choices and thus improve their lives and expand their possibilities. Neuhaus works with sensitive, creative people from all walks of life, including children and teens. She offers a free 30-minute phone consultation and can be reached at 734-707-7477. You can email her at evaneuhaus18@gmail.com or visit her website at evaneuhaus.com. Carolyn James-Pytel, a veteran teacher who has been coaching teens for years, started her life coaching practice Exuberance Now at the end of 2010. James-Pytel says she was inspired to begin coaching as a teacher, observing depressed teens and their parents trying unsuccessfully to navigate obstacles in their lives without help or even traditional therapy. She says that \"we are designed to be happy\" and relies heavily on positive thinking. She feels that traditional therapy spends too much time highlighting problems when happiness can be obtained by a shift in thinking. She explains that when a person focuses on problems, they empower their negative thoughts, which then get stronger. She helps clients to \"take back their mind\" from these negative thought patterns by interrupting them and \"coming to the present moment.\" James-Pytel works with teens and adults on a variety of issues, including self- confidence, stress management, physical and mental wellness, motivation, gay and lesbian issues, goal setting, and relationship coaching. She says she can help anyone feeling stuck or dissatisfied for any reason to work toward more exuberance in their lives. James-Pytel works with individuals by appointment, over the phone and in-person; she also offers group workshops on topics ranging from general happiness, The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 18 What's New in the Community Continued from page 17 Childbirth educator and certified birth Doula Deb Rhizal will be holding a series of six-week classes meeting once per week called Birth and The First Three Months.

April 26 Kids Pick Up on EVERYTHING: How Parental Stress Is Toxic to Kids & What Parents Can Do About It We fool ourselves if we think our children don't pick up on our stress. David Code, author of the book, Kids Pick Up on EVERYTHING, says, \"Stressed parents create stressed children.\" His research and that of others is beginning to show that parental stress is the real toxin affecting children's health. Research suggests that, when parents relax more, children begin to learn better and show less anger or fear and have fewer physical and emotional problems. Code appeals to parents to relax and socialize more! Facilitator: Carole Kirby, LMSW. Carole is an Imago therapist and workshop presenter who specializes in working with couples. Panelists -- To Be Announced. February 2 Occupy Wall Street (and Ann Arbor) A Conversation about its Local and National Meaning Occupy Wall Street burst upon our consciousness, and now it's an election year. We've invited Alan Haber and Odile Hugonot Haber to help us deconstruct all that has been happening. Alan is a cabinet maker, Odile a nurse. In the 1960's, he was an initiator of SDS, and she was a participant in the May 1968 uprisings in Paris. Both have been involved in \"Occupy Ann Arbor\" from its beginning, and will come with other participants in this unfolding political action. An evening of lively discussion is intended. 7 pm in the Tea Room Free Crazy Wisdom 114 South Main Street Ann Arbor 734-665-2757 ~By John Fredericks Photos by John Fredericks This is the third in a series of articles we're doing on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses. From major corporations to small businesses, business owners all over the state have been downsizing, reorganizing, and out-and-out closing their doors in the last several years. And yet, as the economy in Michigan has steadily declined over those years, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. What follows are profiles of two interesting, newer businesses that are thriving despite the odds. Foot Solutions Mike & Dana Bell, owners Foot Solutions, 3780 Jackson Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48103; (734) 998-3668; email: annarbor@footsolutions.com; website: www.footsolutions.com/annarbor All too often we overuse, abuse, then neglect and ignore our feet, but Mike Bell of Foot Solutions reminds us, \"The foot is the foundation of the body.\" When Mike and his wife, Dana, opened their business on Jackson Road (in the shopping complex in front of the Quality 16 Theatres, just west of Wagner Road), they set out on a mission to change that pattern of abuse and neglect - as well as to restore healthy feet and strong foundations to bodies all over the Ann Arbor area. Though they live in Howell, they said they were sold on opening their business in Ann Arbor, because, \"The mindset here is one of better-educated people, who are more conscious of health issues and wellness.\"Yet it took a considerable leap of faith for Mike and Dana to get their business up and running. Mike had made a career in the insurance and financial planning world, but found that he liked numbers much less than working with human digits. Years earlier, in his \"ski-bumming twenties,\" he spent time in Colorado fitting skiing professionals with custom ski boots, and he longed to return to that kind of work. Unfortunately, the timing could not have been worse for the transition. Mike and Dana signed their lease and opened Foot Solutions in the summer of 2008, just months before the economic crash. \"There was many a nail-biting moment for us after we opened,\" said Dana, \"but somehow we made it. And we learned that our business is less dependent on economic conditions than most, probably because our market is really a unique niche that follows its own needs, rather than economic ups and downs.\" Since 2008, Mike and Dana, who are board-certified pedorthists (educated in anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and pathology), have made a science of treating the feet right. \"By stabilizing the foot, we can provide an overall significant benefit to the body,\" says Mike. They begin with a questionnaire and a series of tests to determine one's foot health, or problems. \"Through the questionnaire and talking with the individual, we want to understand the person's work, lifestyle, activities, and health,\" explains Mike. \"Then we start with the basics of measuring the foot, both weighted (standing) and un-weighted (sitting).\" He adds, \"It's amazing how many people do not know their true foot size, or shoe size, in this day and age of the self-serve shoe stores.\" Then they get to the high-tech part of the analysis. \"We use a device that incorporates a series of sensors linked to a computer, to generate static and dynamic profiles for each foot, as well as the dynamics of the person's gait or walk,\" explains Dana. Mike adds, \"You may have seen the 'Dr. Scholl's Machines' in stores but, compared to that, we're Superman!\" Intrigued, I asked to be a guinea pig and go through the testing. It really was amazing. After standing in a set position on the device and taking several walks across it, I got to see a detailed, three-dimensional representation of my feet mapped out on the computer screen. After seeing the pictures and having Mike explain the numbers, I learned - thankfully - that my feet and walk are pretty normal and healthy. But the wealth of information made me ask, \"How much do you charge for the diagnosis?\" \"The assessment we do is completely complimentary,\" said Mike. \"The more we really know about your feet, motions, and lifestyle, the better shoe or orthotic devices we can provide you.\" Dana added, \"People are amazed when we sell them shoes that really fit! They go from 'It feels like there's a lot of room' or 'That's odd' to 'Wow, I can't believe how much better my feet feel!' That's because we're fitting, and sometimes actually creating, custom footwear that is specially made to conform to their feet and the tortional stresses that their feet experience.\" \"It's amazing how many people do not know their true foot size, or shoe size, in this day and age of the self-serve shoe stores.\" - Mike Bell of Foot Solutions Mike & Dana Bell, owners of Foot Solutions Leaps of Faith: Tales of Newer Local BusinessesThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 20 Mike had made a career in the insurance and financial planning world, but found that he liked numbers much less than working with human digits.Many people think of such service providers as just for people who have chronic foot, mobility, or back problems. Mike notes, \"Indeed, if you do have a problem, many times we can tell just by watching you walk in, or looking at the assessment and saying, 'Well, you're favoring your right foot in a way that you must be having back problems in your L4-L5 (lumbar) region.' We will give you the printout from our testing, and you can give that to your doctor for further medical advice, but we're not doctors and we don't play them on TV or in the store.\" However, the proper care of the feet, and wearing shoes that are not only fitted to the feet but fitted to the tasks our feet are being asked to do, are clinically and medically proven to have health benefits. That is where Mike and Dana Bell can help everyone. \"We want to understand, structurally, what are the needs of your body,\" says Mike. Dana adds, \"And what we carry in the store is a 'fitting inventory.' If what you need isn't here, we go to the catalogues...Thirty percent of our business is special order.\" The motto of Foot Solutions is \"Rejuvenate Your Sole.\" And, one sole at a time, Mike and Dana are making great strides toward creating a healthier, happier Ann Arbor . ###We learned that our business is less dependent on economic conditions than most, probably because our market is really a unique niche that follows its own needs, rather than economic ups and downs.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 21 Column continued on page 22 RESTORE JOY AND BALANCE TO YOUR LIFE.

Main Street, Suite 201, Ann Arbor 48104; (734) 213- 7600; email: info@rubannarbor.com; website: www.rubannarbor.com The first thing that hits you when you walk into RUB is an overwhelming sense of serenity. One would not necessarily expect such calm from one of the city's newest and hottest businesses, which overlooks Ann Arbor's busy Main Street from the second-floor space over Espresso Royale. Emma Greene, one of RUB's four co-owners, says, \"That's what we wanted for our massage and yoga clients: a place that was quiet, serene, and inviting. And we invested a lot of hard work in the renovation of the space to make it that way.\"As they worked on that renovation, Emma recalls that she and her three partners struggled with the thoughts that they were undertaking the project at the wrong time and that it would never get off the ground. \"The economy, seeing businesses close all over town, and simply having a lot of competition out there made us wonder about our sanity,\" said Emma. \"But we carried on tearing out walls, laying flooring, and installing ceiling tiles - if I never handle another one of those, I'll be happy \u2014 while keeping our fingers crossed and hoping for the best.\" Despite a few signage issues, RUB opened this summer and started inviting clients into a very nice space that is making all their hard work worth it, as well as making the leap of faith pay off. RUB, an acronym for Relaxation & Ultimate Bodywork, uses their serene and tastefully under-decorated atmosphere to beckon clients to one of four private rooms and to \"create their own space.\" \"We ask clients to feel free to bring in their own music, or whatever makes them feel more at home,\" says Emma, \"to make their room their own place to escape.\" With or without such personal accoutrements, clients can feel comfortable in any of their staff member's hands. All of them have had extensive training in massage therapy, including a lot of basic anatomy and physiology study, as well as \"hands-on\" hours. But Emma notes, \"For us, it's really about making a mind-body connection with people.\"\"For many people,\" Emma continues, \"massage is considered a luxury , but I try to tell people it's a regular part of preventative care and a way to maintain true homeostasis.\" She explains that she was raised in Ann Arbor and steeped in an eclectic upbringing. For instance, she believes strongly that all minds and bodies are connected. \"A lot of people today are feeling very disconnected,\" Emma says. \"So whether someone comes in with an acute issue, chronic pain, or just to relax \u2014 if we can make that hour better, that day better, or that week better for them, it's an amazing thing, and I love it.\" In addition to regular massage therapy, co-partners Emma Greene, Brandon Baugh, and sister and brother Diane Wyatt and Ryan Wyatt, plus their seven additional massage therapists and three yoga instructors, offer a wide range of services and therapies to reconnect minds and bodies, to themselves and to \"the collective.\" \"We have several combinations of services that the other businesses in town do not have,\" says Emma, \"like herbal poultice massage, bamboo massage, hot Jade stone massage, prepartum/postpartum massage, deep tissue massage, and even 'yogassage,' where your time is split between private yoga and massage.\" In addition, RUB offers regular yoga classes, aromatherapy, and reflexology, as well as training in core strengthening and guided meditation, all at fairly reasonable prices. \"We began with the individual,\" states the RUB brochure, \"and then designed therapies that would treat the entire person. Here at RUB, we call it integrated care. By fully incorporating a wide array of wellness therapies, we treat the mind, body, and soul.\" The staff delivers on that mission daily and, after checking with several clients who have experienced RUB, we can attest that it is really working. \"They have a really unique thing going on there,\" said Ted, a client, after visiting RUB. \"Emma is truly amazing the way she works with people and, every time I see her, I feel this remarkably deep bond that reminds me what it is to be human all over again. Her energy is unique and she really gets into your head and body in way that I can't explain.\" Others must be starting to catch on, because we noted a steady stream of clients when we showed up twice to interview and take pictures at RUB. Regardless, clients went to their private rooms, and the serenity and peace returned to the space over Main Street all over again, as if to say , \"The collective is being healed \u2014 one mind, body, and soul at a time.\" Thank you, RUB. ### \"The economy, seeing businesses close all over town, and simply having a lot of competition out there made us wonder about our sanity.\" - Emma Greene, co-owner of RUB Ann Arbor Emma believes strongly that all minds and bodies are connected...[so RUB] offers a wide range of services and therapies to reconnect minds and bodies, to themselves and to \"the collective.\" \"We have several combinations of services that the other businesses in town do not have,\" says Emma... \"[including] 'yogassage,' where your time is split between private yoga and massage.\"Larry Bynum, Massage Therapist, Analea Leffenberry, Yoga Instructor, and Emma Greene, Massage Therapist and Co-Owner of RUBEmma Greenand and Analea LeffenberryThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 23 By Monica Patel Most of us in Washtenaw County have experienced the effects of global warming in the form of flooding from heavy rains and other strange weather patterns these last two years. And we're not alone. Just during October 2011, extreme weather affected millions of people across the United States, as well as those in Pakistan, Russia, Japan, Thailand, and more. As many as 10 million people a year become \"climate refugees,\" displaced from their homes due to climate-related disasters that include floods, wildfires, and tornadoes. Extreme weather in the U.S. caused over $32 billion in damages by mid-June, at which point the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2011 the most extreme weather-related disaster year on record. Here in Michigan, experts predict longer growing seasons due to climate change \u2014 but we'll also see more extreme heat, heavier and more frequent rainstorms, and dramatic influxes of climate refugees, all of which will put pressure on our incredible water resources. Untold hardship and human suffering follows these natural disasters, and it's clear that the climate change problem needs to be addressed. The question then becomes: Which small changes lead to the biggest impact? Globally, the actions of the average person emit 4.5 tons of carbon dioxide each year, but Americans go above and beyond, responsible for a whopping 20 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year. Scientists have calculated that we all need to lower our emissions to 2 tons per capita, which means that we have got to get moving! If those of us who live in resource-rich, water-abundant places start changing our ways and reducing our carbon footprint now, we can help reduce the impact of global warming, as well as heading off local ramifications. While the U.S. Climate Bill languishes in Congress and climate deniers make a mockery of science, folks on the ground are building an incredible grassroots movement. One of these people is Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org. 350.org is an international campaign to unite the world around solutions to the climate crisis. The organization is named \"350\" because scientists say that 350 ppm (parts per million) is the safe upper limit for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. When McKibben came to Ann Arbor in 2009, he shared the successes of the International Day of Climate Action, a day CNN called \"the most widespread day of political action in our planet's history.\" McKibben's inspiring visit sparked the formation of Ann Arbor 350, an Ecology Center project that promotes local action to help solve the global problem. For the past three years, Ann Arbor 350 has worked with and inspired community members to minimize their own carbon footprint. For our first action, the 10/10/10 Garden Challenge, we united to help our neighbors grow more of their own food \u2014 and to make a statement in the process. Volunteers visited local families, businesses, and organizations to help assemble raised garden beds made by the Ypsilanti-based nonprofit, Growing Hope. The food industry accounts for about 10 percent of fossil fuel use in the United States, and about 40 percent of its carbon footprint is due to packaging, processing, and transportation. To put it another way, studies estimate that processed food in the United States travels over 1,300 miles, and fresh produce travels over 1,500 miles, before being consumed. By putting food gardens into front yards, we're teaching people where their food comes from and, as a happy byproduct, we enjoy a simple, easy reduction in our own carbon footprint. We've mapped nearly 200 visible, edible \"350 Gardens\" \u2014 and added even more to front yards, schoolyards, and church grounds in the past two years. Many of these gardens have either inspired others to start their own 350 Gardens, or sparked conversation about local food or the 350 movement. Throughout the past year, we promoted the Household Energy Challenge, the Commuter Challenge, and the Mission Zero Fest \u2014 encouraging people to save energy at home, to take a low-carbon commute, and to consider visionary, clean-energy approaches for buildings. And in October, we added more gardens to the 350 Garden network to get a head start on next year's growing season.What's next? The 350 Climate Pledge. Sign up at www.aa350.org to take some simple, fun steps to reduce your personal carbon footprint. The Pledge lists a few easy household, transportation, and food-related actions that have the potential to make a huge difference. For instance, by installing a low-flow showerhead, you can save 105 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO 2) per month with no inconvenience to your lifestyle. Or you might consider washing your clothes on the cold/cold washer settings and use only 13.5 pounds of carbon dioxide per month, instead of the 200 pounds of CO 2 you waste using hot/warm water. If one person completes all of the Climate Pledge actions for a year, they will save 4.9 tons of carbon dioxide. Just pick a few actions, write them on the Climate Pledge, and send them to us. We'll check in on you to help you meet your goals, and we'll also celebrate your accomplishments. To assist in achieving these important goals, we will also make sure that we, as a community, are ready to rally together to add our voices to the roar that will be needed to get the attention of our politicians. Remember: It doesn't end with the Climate Pledge, it starts there. This journey will be more fun \u2014 and more fruitful \u2014 if we take it together.

But neither food nor weight is the true underlying problem for most compulsive eaters. We don't suffer from a paucity of diets or nutritional information. We suffer because we cycle in and out of diets ranging from macrobiotics to Weight Watchers. We practice that cycling as if we were training for an Olympic sport. And for the life of us, we can't understand why. There is an unconscious condition that hardly anybody talks about \u2014 not Oprah, Jenny Craig, or even your holistic family doctor. We'll call it \"food amnesia.\" It's the temporary loss of consciousness that overtakes us between the time our hands open the full bag of chips and when our eyes see the now-empty bottom. As we sit on the coach, stuffed and stunned, we utter a soft, agonized moan of defeat. \"Oh my god, not again. How did this happen?\" One of the primary factors contributing to food amnesia is the presence of what Francie White, master of science, registered dietitian and director of the Central Coast Intensive Outpatient Eating Disorder Program, calls the \"rebel eater .\" According to White, the rebel eater is that part our unconscious that refuses to follow food rules. In psychological terms, the rebel eater is an unconscious ego state, or part of the self. The restrictions imposed by diets, be they based on whole grains or processed foods, may trigger rebellion. As author Geneen Roth says, \"For every diet, there is an equal and opposite binge.\" Let's meet Sarah's rebel eater, for example. After a day of raw carrot sticks and dry chicken breasts, a bag of cookies stares her in the face upon arriving home from work. Sarah thinks, \"Look how fat you are. No cookies for you!\" But her rebel eater says, \"Ah, forget it! Don't tell me what to eat! I'm digging in!\" Suddenly, she's eaten the whole bag and is mystified as to what happened. The rebel eater just hijacked her body. Why does the rebel eater get triggered? We are hardwired to aggressively, sometimes violently, defend against those who would take our food. This response dates back to our cave-dwelling ancestors who, after slaughtering a mammoth, had to fend off marauding bandits intent on stealing their winter food supply. Those who were successful survived and went on to become our genetic ancestors. Those who weren't successful died off. Therefore, \"You take my food away from me, and you die\" is coded into our ancestral gene pool. Straight and simple. So while we politely ask the nutritional expert to assist us in losing weight, listen responsibly, take notes, and pay the fee, the rebel eater is perched in the quiet recesses of our mind, ready to defend our mammoth to the death. This force of nature cannot be underestimated. \"In my decades of working with women,\" says Francie White, \"one thing I've learned is, don't ever tell a woman what to eat!\" Doing so just triggers the rebel eater. Until this force of nature is addressed, progress will be slow to none. This rebel has a cause \u2014 survival of both the body and the psyche. The energetic purpose of our core self, or \"soul essence,\" according to the Bio Self-Emergence Institute (BSEI) in Southfield, Michigan, is to reserve its energy so the soul can survive and experience itself. The rebel, understood from BSEI's energetic perspective on developmental stages, is not just a psychological defense mechanism. If the core self is not energetically developed and organized, it must rebel to save itself for its energetic purpose of soul survival and experience. The \"I am me\" is the energetic core of who we are. Its purpose isn't to follow or defy rules. Its purpose is to survive and to experience itself. Psychologically , we develop our \"I am me\" muscles with our \"No!\" We define and differentiate ourselves by asserting, \"Noooo! I do not want to give you this interesting, shiny object you call a knife. Mine!\" This particular bid for self-determination \u2014 holding the knife \u2014 must be denied. But sometimes the denial goes too far . Let's say that Sarah was the child with the knife, and her \"no\" was punished. She was yelled at, given the silent treatment, or labeled \"selfish,\" \"willful,\" or \"stubborn.\" Her parents prohibited her ability to say \"no\" and controlled her verbal behavior, but they can scarcely control everything she eats. \"Aha,\" notices Sarah, \"this battle, I can win. I will eat what I want to!\" She wants to feel herself, her \"no,\" her power. Then Sarah puts on a few extra pounds. Her parents worry. They tell her, \"Don't eat that cookie. You'll gain weight.\" Sarah's \"I am me\" is threatened. The rebel eater is born. It attempts to protect the child's still fragile and growing sense of self, her essence. So what happens when Sarah grows up? She eats compulsively, desperately seeking control and weight loss. Yet she pours her energy into defying deprivation and rebelling against the professionals who advise food restrictions. With one foot on the gas and one foot on the brakes, she is going nowhere fast. If Sarah's health professionals give her even the best of nutritional advice, it will likely exacerbate her rebel's overeating. How, then, to address the problem? As one student of this non-diet approach aptly said, \"If I can eat anything I want, there's nothing to rebel against.\" With nothing to battle and no recriminations to suffer, Sarah's full energy and attention is freed up to notice just how much of that organic, whole-grain bread slathered with butter her body really desires and how much she eats out of defiance. What happens to the rebel's overeating after consistent practice of this non-diet philosophy? Let's take Rachel, for example, a diabetic who struggled with food obsession and weight issues for decades. Each day began with a vow to follow the doctor 's recommendations and ended with the rebel eater's battle cry of, \"Ah forget it!\" \u2014 followed by huge servings of pasta and, finally...dessert. Once again, Rachel feels defeated, resigned, and depressed. When Rachel began practicing mindful eating, however (noticing body sensations when we eat), she was shocked one night to discover her body wanted those fresh green beans from her garden, not pasta! She had never bothered to ask before. Skeptical, but encouraged, she began asking herself, \"How much body-hunger do I have right now?\" and \"What kind of food would satisfy that hunger right now?\" She asked, \"Will hot or cold, sweet or spicy, crunchy or smooth satisfy me now? Am I slightly hungry, so hungry I could faint, neutral, satisfied, or full right now?\" She considered vegetables, protein, fruits and carbohydrates. She committed to suspending judgment about her body size and food. The simple act of paying attention to food choices, instead of judging them, changed how she felt about herself and her measurements. Rachel began to eat much less after 10 days. After eight months, she let go of most desserts. Not because she was following the diabetic guidelines. She had always rebelled against those. It was precisely the opposite. Her rebel eater had calmed down. Why? Because there was nothing to rebel against. Food was not restricted. She had the freedom to say \"yes\" without guilt to desserts. This earned her the freedom to say \"no\" without rebellion or a feeling of deprivation. Research suggests that dieting undermines our connection to our natural mechanism for regulating food intake. This mechanism requires an internal focus on the body's hunger and satiety. We need that mechanism. Diets train us to focus on external rules: what to eat and how much. That's why retraining ourselves to recognize hunger and satiety is a prerequisite to releasing the rebel eater 's stronghold. Therein lies the hope for us to find balance and peace with food. The rebel eater is just one of the players from our unconscious that contributes to overeating. But understanding that often isn't enough. Recovery requires practicing mindful eating and releasing judgments again and again. This sounds like a lot of work, because at first it is. It often requires a non-diet support group or the guidance of a skilled professional. But the results are plentiful. We can replace the diet-rebel rollercoaster with something far more substantial: peace with ourselves and with our food. ### Abbe J.

This was often because my body didn't seem like a safe and comfortable place to be. But there was also the choice to spend time out of body, visiting the expanded world I experienced in the magical reality reached through my imagination, the more-real world that I longed to be able to make others know and see. I recall the time I watched from above as my charred diapers and the burned skin on my legs were removed after I sat on the fire. The story was that it was an accident, that I walked over and sat on the open coal fire in the kitchen that was the heat source in our home. But it has always been curious to me why I would 'sit on the fire.' How could something that was designed to be as wonderful and delicious as embodiment have become such a painful and misunderstood experience? I had never forgotten the pain when I came back into my body, just one of the sources of the night terrors that plagued my childhood well into my twenties. Now that I have reached the age of that Future Self, she who cradled this toddler in love's embrace during her out of body experience, there is a reconnection through the continuum of time-space. All the pain my action caused me and my parents is released, and the pain is done; the circle is complete. I had wanted to return to my remembered home in Faerie through the fire's portal, but the portal was blocked, and fire was not the answer. Now I choose to let what happened be indeed an 'accident' of profound design, to bring me home to myself. This is not, of course, the first time a Future Self has reconnected with a younger self, nor will it be the last. Each encounter opens me to a depth of wisdom and compassion that may have been glimpsed earlier, and can become the domain of habitation in our elder years. Now after all these years of seeking answers, I understand more of the 'voices' internal to myself. I understand the role that shame can play, embedded as aberrant chemistry even before birth. In my commitment to consciously confront the inner predator, I am able to offer maps to others in their quest for freedom. Now that I can easily visit my child's world with her, I can show her all the gifts she received and the fun she had, when previously the unhealed wounds overrode all other memory. Such is the power of pain-accompanied memoir; if we can detach the pain-imprint and restore flow to our energy system, we can remember many individual and collective experiences of feeling pleasure and contentment, and experience an unshakable sense of well-being that wells up like an eternal spring. This to me is the Fountain of Youth. Old age is not meant to be a reversion to the unmet needs of childhood, but a re-opening to the wonder and pleasure that is present in every childhood and available at deeper and deeper levels as we expand our reverence for the Gift of Life. I am confident that as our perception and perspective expand, new ways of being will emerge. Perhaps the movement we most need now is the \"Occupy Yourself\" movement, when we truly inhabit the magnificent interactive domain of nature that is for each of us the body: a world of infinite mystery and delight when we learn to parse its messages, and unlock the inner portals of profound change. And so it is.

By and large, readers were glad we were covering this important and relevant topic to the holistic community, though many thought our coverage was not comprehensive enough, and, in fact, left out local practitioners of prominence, including Connie Sundrla of The Parkway Center and Cynthia Esseichick of Ann Arbor Healing Arts, among others. We apologize for this. Our coverage did fall short. While we knew our practitioner list was not comprehensive, it was listed as if it were. We will be sensitive to such representations in the future and have learned many lessons along the way. Among them, that people are passionate about their practitioners and the wonderful work they are doing, and that acupuncture is an important topic in Ann Arbor that deserves further coverage. To that aim, we are pleased to present an interview with Cynthia Esseichick, acupuncturist, Chinese herbalist, massage therapist, founder of Ann Arbor Healing Arts, and a long-time member of the Ann Arbor holistic community. Cynthia graciously accepted our invitation to speak with her about her practice and acupuncture's coming of age in Ann Arbor. We thank you, Cynthia, for agreeing to meet with us, and we thank all the readers who responded so passionately to our acupuncture feature. This truly is a community journal and your opinions matter.) *** Interviewed by Maureen McMahonPhotography by John Fredericks I had the pleasure of meeting with Cynthia Esseichick, Dipl. OM, LAc, MSTOM, at her beautiful office on Ann Arbor's south side. While you enter what seems like a standard office complex to get to her office, the setting of her Ann Arbor Healing Arts business is stunning. Tucked into the bottom of 325 E Eisenhower, it features floor to ceiling windows overlooking beautiful trees, a pond, and a waterfall, and is filled with natural light. One is immediately aware that this is a space for healing. Cynthia is gracious, intelligent, well-spoken, and humorous. I greatly enjoyed getting to know her and learning about her background in massage, her experiences with using acupuncture to treat cancer patients on Chicago's south side, and her views on Oriental Medicine and its place in Ann Arbor. Maureen McMahon: Cynthia, you first founded Ann Arbor Healing Arts in 1990 in a different location downtown. What part of downtown were you in and why did you decide to have your business in this community? What was your focus then? Cynthia Esseichick: I was in the heart of downtown, 4 th & Washington. The openness in our community toward healing, the environment, politics, spirituality, and the supportive and generous attitude among healthcare practitioners (complementary, alternative, mainstream) made Ann Arbor a delightful place to practice. My focus then, as now, has always been to promote optimal health and wellness. I began as a shiatsu practitioner, though I've never been attached to a particular modality in and of itself. It's an art to determine what might be the way in to healing. And the way in, as I see it, is guided by the patient, and by listening, assessment, and feedback. It's situational. Am I welcome here? Is this work appropriate here, now, for this individual? Intuition and tactile conversation are helpful tools. So is versatility. Energy medicine is dynamic and personal \u2014 what is happening now, what is the response now. It requires presence, being present \u2014 that's what I love about it. Maureen McMahon: What brought about your decision to train in Oriental Medicine (OM)? Had you been exposed to acupuncture in the past? What drew you to it? Cynthia Esseichick: I wanted to deepen the scope of my holistic healthcare practice, to offer more options to my patients. Dr. Jay Sandweiss has been a mentor to me. Jay's a phenomenal practitioner who artfully combines Eastern and Western biomedicine. He encouraged me to pursue my studies, and welcomed me into the fold. Jay inspired an appreciation for the science and the art of this medicine. (For more on Dr. Jay Sandweiss, D.O., see the Crazy Wisdom Interview from Fall 2008 on our online archive.) As a teenager, in Southern California, I'd ride my bike to these little botanicas and traditional oriental pharmacies and wander in to check out the multi-drawer herb cabinets, the brightly colored boxes of tinctures, the smell of camphor, licorice, and incense. At that time, my best friend's mother was studying OM. It was mysterious and enchanting: piles of dank, smelly plant parts scattered about the kitchen table, incredibly detailed anatomical maps of meridians and acupuncture points. Like \"Hogwarts,\" though well before Harry Potter. My personal experience receiving acupuncture was profound. I saw this in others, too: amazing results. It was elegant and simple in its application, yet required complex theoretical understanding and scientific knowledge. I was drawn to the centuries of scholarship and history behind OM, to the fact that it worked, often in situations in which nothing else had. It was helpful. It was gentle. And a little bit magical. Maureen McMahon: Where did you go to college, and where did you get your acupuncture training? What did you specialize in during your training? Cynthia Esseichick: I received a Bachelor of Arts from Cornell University in Ithaca, NY , and a Master of Science in Oriental Medicine from the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (P .C.O.M.) in Chicago. During my clinical training I treated a wide variety of issues: migraine, anxiety, allergies, insomnia. I also completed several specialized internships in orthopedics (pain), oncology, and infertility. MM: Did you feel that your background as a massage therapist influenced you during your training in Chicago? Cynthia Esseichick: Absolutely. Familiarity with internal and external anatomy, and more specifically, years of hands-on experience working with the physical body meant that palpation, one of the primary diagnostic tools in OM, and the ability to sense point location for needle placement, came easily. It takes time to feel comfortable with touch and to develop what I call \"tactile vision.\" From the start of my clinical training in Chicago, I felt at ease with my patients; this was absolutely due to the cumulative experience I had working as a massage therapist. Massage is probably the best pre-medical training any aspiring healthcare practitioner could have. It would be a fantastic pre-requisite for medical school. It amazes me that many practitioners treat the physical body yet rarely touch their patients. MM: Where was your Clinical Internship and how did that impact your thoughts about access to care and the potential for acupuncture to benefit cancer patients? Cynthia Esseichick: I spent 3 years in the P .C.O.M. clinic in Lakeview; a year and a half in the Breast Care Center at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's south side; and assisted several of my professors in their private clinics, one of whom was a fertility specialist in Evanston. My experience at Mercy Hospital was profound. Our patient population was largely comprised of people who, due to socio-economic disparity, might not know about alternative medicine, or who wouldn't necessarily be able to afford Questions for Acupuncturist Cynthia Esseichick of Ann Arbor Healing Arts Massage is probably the best pre-medical training any aspiring healthcare practitioner could have. It would be a fantastic pre-requisite for medical school. It amazes me that many practitioners treat the physical body yet rarely touch their patients. It's an art to determine what might be the way in to healing. And the way in, as I see it, is guided by the patient, and by listening, assessment, and feedback. It's situational.My personal experience receiving acupuncture was profound... It was elegant and simple in its application, yet required complex theoretical understanding and scientific knowledge.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 27 it, if they had access to it. We provided acupuncture free of charge to any woman being treated for breast cancer at Mercy. It was an amazing opportunity to educate patients and physicians, to integrate acupuncture within a traditional, biomedical setting, and to offer gentle, effective care to anyone who needed it. And we got fantastic results. The oncologists and their patients loved what we were doing. MM: You have mentioned that in Eastern medicine there is a saying, \"Diagnosis as treatment; treatment as diagnosis.\" What is meant by this? Do you incorporate massage into your acupuncture treatments? Does this relate to treating the patient constitutionally? Cynthia Esseichick: In OM, techniques such as pulse reading, hara diagnosis (abdominal palpation) or scanning the channels of the body for changes in temperature, tone, or texture, all involve contact. Because of the dynamic nature of touch, the body responds. If I'm palpating a point where I intend to insert a needle, there may be a response to the pressure of my palpation, or the temperature of my fingertips, and so, in the course of diagnostic assessment, treatment begins. In instances where soft-tissue work makes sense, yes, massage may be used, as well as other accessory techniques such as guasha, cupping, or electro-stimulation. It really depends on the individual situation. In OM, patients with similar issues, such as asthma, or migraine, might receive vastly different treatments based on individual constitutional variation and the root cause of their problem. There isn't a set way to treat a specific issue; it varies from person to person, and sometimes from session to session. A frail person will receive a less vigorous treatment than someone more robust, and vice versa. This is real-time medicine: treating what is happening today, for this person, in this particular way. You can imagine why it has been so difficult to create proper clinical trials to assess the efficacy of OM. MM: What are your areas of specialization now? What are you commonly treating people for? Cynthia Esseichick: Infertility, women's health, orthopedics/pain management, digestive issues, migraine, anxiety \u2014 my work is quite varied, which I love. It's a tremendous amount of fun. MM: Do you have patients of all ages, including children? Do you treat many Chinese people and, if so, are they generally more knowledgeable about acupuncture? Cynthia Esseichick: I do. My patients include children, teenagers, adults, and seniors well into their 80's. I treat quite a few Chinese people, and yes, they are often very familiar with acupuncture and Chinese herbs, as well as the nutritional concepts important in OM. In Chinese culture there is great appreciation of the importance of food as medicine. MM: Do you treat Western medical doctors? Has anything surprised you about working with M.D.s, as patients or as referring physicians? Cynthia Esseichick: Yes. My patients include M.D.s and D.O.s, many of whom are surprised by the extent of an acupuncturist's education (P .C.O.M.'s program is 4 years, full-time, and includes a substantial number of courses in Western biomedicine). I've been pleasantly surprised by openness and recognition from M.D.s, by their willingness to refer patients, and to work collectively on certain issues. I'm even more surprised at how many come in for treatment because of what they've heard from their patients. MM: In our discussion about the similarities between acupressure and acupuncture, you mentioned a study published in Archives of Internal Medicine (May 11, 2009) in which some patients with lower back pain were given traditional acupuncture with needles, while others were given \"sham\" acupuncture, in which toothpicks were housed in needle guide tubes so participants couldn't spot the sham. Both patient groups reported significant improvement in their disabilities brought about by back pain. What conclusions do you draw from this and how has this study been misinterpreted in your opinion? Cynthia Esseichick: I love this study! One might conclude that there was no appreciable difference using acupuncture or a toothpick, and therefore, acupuncture is a sham, or certainly \"no better than a toothpick.\" In fact, the toothpicks are a brilliant demonstration of how responsive acupuncture points are to stimulation of any kind: acupressure, acupuncture, massage... Whether one received treatment via a needle or a toothpick isn't really the issue, what's important is that when the acupuncture points were stimulated, the response was \"significant improvement\" \u2014 that's wonderful! MM: When you treat people, do certain points elicit the same response on different people? If so, what would some examples be?Cynthia Esseichick: I think what you're referring to are unexpected responses, outside the intended goal of the treatment. Examples are people seeing specific colors or patterns or experiencing a fog lifting from their bodies. I find it curious because I don't set up expectations for such things, yet the reporting of these phenomena tends to be fairly consistent with certain point prescriptions. MM: Are your patients generally enthusiastic about taking herbs? Is there a fair amount of education that you have to provide them about the herbs? Cynthia Esseichick: In my experience, folks are very enthusiastic about the idea of taking hand-crafted, centuries-old herbal formulas, tailor-made just for them. Then they try one. Yes, it may have licorice or cinnamon or mint. But the truth is, Chinese herbal formulas typically taste pretty intense. I try to explain the rationale, that it may be unpleasant, but that the bitter or astringent or sour flavors are medicinal. These formulas aren't designed to taste good, they're designed to effect positive change. And they do \u2014 they work wonders. There's a Chinese saying, \"the worse the herbs taste, the more benefit they bestow.\" That's hard for some folks to swallow. MM: Do you think acupuncture has \"come of age\" in Ann Arbor? What are some of the advances you've seen and what are some of the challenges to its growth? Cynthia Esseichick: I do. I see collaboration among mainstream physicians and alternative medicine practitioners, more integrative care for patients, which is fantastic. Challenges include educating people about how acupuncture works, what kinds of things can be treated, and overcoming the fear that it's painful. Cost of care is another limiting factor. Why isn't acupuncture a covered healthcare benefit? It's effective, safe, and comparatively inexpensive. MM: What are some of your interests outside of Oriental Medicine? Cynthia Esseichick: I like to balance the quiet, intuitive, \"yin\" state of mind in which I work, with expressive, creative, or \"yang\" pursuits such as art and music. I'm a visual artist. I love opera. I spend time in nature. And I sing in the Ann Arbor-based band, Waynesboro. MM: Great, thanks, Cynthia. It's been a pleasure meeting you. ### Cynthia Esseichick, Dipl.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 28 Allowing Your Best Self to Shine Through: Marc Lerner on a Healthy Way to be Sick By Mary Runser Photo by Joni Strickfaden I was given the opportunity to interview Marc Lerner about the radio talk show he hosted called \"A Healthy Way to be Sick.\" It ended up being less an interview and more a conversation between two new friends. At 60 years of age, Marc has been living with Multiple Sclerosis for 30 years. Now a resident of Ann Arbor, he runs the non-profit Life Skills Institute, which he founded in 1982, and teaches people experiencing health crises how to live happier and healthier lives. Our conversation flowed easily and smoothly as Marc expounded on his belief in the healing and transformative power of self-trust, a positive self-image, and self-love, even when our life experiences have been less than positive. Having had several not so positive and even traumatic experiences of my own, I was fascinated by the ease with which Marc seemed to positively accept himself and his experiences. The differences his beliefs have made to him were apparent; he delights in his life. While our conversation focused on a healthier way of being sick for people dealing with chronic health issues, I realized that I could use this same approach, these very same ideas, and create a healthier way of living my own life. I'd heard everything he'd said somewhere before, but for some reason his words and his gentle nature reached into my heart, seizing on the truth that lay within. We both hope that as you read, you, too, will experience and take hold of the positive energy and acceptance that has the power to transform your thoughts and allow you to re-imagine and rebuild your life. *** Detroit native Marc Lerner is back in his home state of Michigan after decades away. \"I was born in Detroit, raised in Midland and managed to escape when I was about 20 years old. I lived in California mostly (and in some other parts of the country) for 35+ years, but came back here to the Ann Arbor area to be with my mother. Her time is short and I couldn't imagine anything more important than being with her, so I moved back here three years ago.\" Marc was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in March of 1981. \"I totally freaked out because of my sudden loss of vision and inability to walk. Loss of vision was my first symptom, and amazingly, it was worse at that time than it is now. I'm legally blind, so I don't see things like most people do. I can see, but only very blurry images.\" MS forced him to look at the beauty of life through his spiritual eyes until his mental image of himself and his difficulties wholly meshed with what he saw on a spiritual level. As a young man Marc began to seriously search, as many of us do, for that connection to his deeper spiritual part. \"Through all of my searching and meditation \u2014 and I did it from my heart \u2014 nothing took me there or taught me how to access that part of myself or allowed me to really 'be in the moment' like MS has.\" According to Marc, MS has forced him to go inside himself to find the reservoir of strength and spirituality that not only gets him through the daily coping with a chronic illness, but also allows him to thrive and enjoy a full life. For the last 28 years Marc has been working with veterans, AIDS patients, and those with physical disabilities and chronic diseases, teaching them how to use the lessons he's learned to find that spiritual connection and to live life in a way that is full and complete, without being completely dependent upon outside sources. He teaches that the strength and the answers we need are within each of us. Everybody has them; it's really a matter of some being able to access them more readily than others. \"Really, it's very simple,\" Marc said. \"The key is to breathe into silence rather than into your thoughts. We think that wisdom is in our thoughts, but really wisdom is more of a heart thing. The wisdom of the body resides in the silence beyond your thoughts.\" Breath as your focus was a concept Marc learned while taking Karate classes as a child. When you quiet the chatter within, move beyond your thoughts, and breathe into that silence, you can access the wisdom stored within your body. Marc believes that the body is a tremendous reservoir of strength, spirituality, and wisdom, and within that reservoir are the answers to everything we need physically, spiritually, and emotionally. All we have to do is learn to follow the path to that wisdom. Sounds easy, doesn't it? \"It's as easy as breathing,\" Marc said. \"The reality is that this wisdom that can help people deal daily with chronic illness is the same wisdom that's needed to be in love, to work, and to manifest the lives we desire to live. We all have those answers right here inside us, we just need to learn how to access them.\" Marc's first step was determining that he was not going to live his life with a victim mentality or look outwardly for help. That decision forced him to look inside and Marc Lerner has been living with Multiple Sclerosis for 30 years. Now a resident of Ann Arbor, he runs the non-profit Life Skills Institute. \"The reality is that this wisdom that can help people deal daily with chronic illness is the same wisdom that's needed to be in love, to work, and to manifest the lives we desire to live. We all have those answers right here inside us, we just need to learn how to access them.\" \"In a health crisis, it is important to take control of the subconscious because it affects the healing process so significantly.\" \"At this point in my life, I would rather deal with a chronic illness than not experience the quality of life I've experienced through having MS.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 29 change his inner environment, to clear the way through all the thoughts and clutter that fills the mind. \"You know, right now 'the zone' is a concept popularized through sports, but there is a zone of healing, a zone of love, a zone of everything. Being in 'the zone' allows us to tap the inner resources we need to make change. We all have them; we just don't always use them.\" The second key is learning to move beyond our thoughts and negative self-images. We've all learned to think negative self-thoughts and carry around negative self-images. Often these thoughts and images are imposed upon us by parents, teachers, ministers/religious leaders and other authority figures, until one day we simply begin to believe them, adopt them as our own, and they become so deeply ingrained within that we begin to live out those negative images in our everyday lives. On the other side, there are also positive experiences and thoughts, things that make us feel as though we can do anything, things that make us feel very good and positive about ourselves. \"We all have these, too. For some reason, though, as humans we tend to cling to the more negative things even though they're extremely self-defeating. When I'm working with individuals, I teach them to look at both of these experiences, recall how each one made them feel, and then give that feeling a name. Later, when they realize they're acting or reacting out of their negative character, they can stop and begin to consciously act out of their positive character. Just taking that moment to realize that we're acting out of a negative self-image and deciding instead to act from our positive self-image gets us immediately in 'the zone,' that space of silence beyond our thoughts. Once we are there, we can access our more positive nature, which allows us to truly be in the moment in our lives and in a particular situation where our very best self can begin to shine through and interact with the world around us in a positive and healthy way.\" The proposition is that the unconscious mind is being consciously reprogrammed to support the healing process. \"Most people try to attain wellness when they're sick through the thinking mind,\" Marc said. \"The subconscious mind has a direct influence on the healing process, where the intellect symbolically relates to that process. Life skills such as our self-image, self-trust, and the way we relate to negative thinking are significantly influenced subconsciously. These skills can enhance or limit healing based on how they are conditioned. Normally they're conditioned through our past experiences, but they can be consciously re-conditioned if we follow an experiential path and turn them into habits. We walk through life focused on thinking and because of this we ignore the wisdom of the body...In a health crisis, it is important to take control of the subconscious because it affects the healing process so significantly. The focus of my work is to consciously condition the subconscious mind on the level of life skills we learned as we grew up.\" We're creatures of habit, and creating a habit of stopping to reflect on how we're reacting or how we should react cultivates trust in ourselves, especially when the outcomes are positive. This isn't a one-stop shop technique to health and happiness, but over the course of time, through repeated practice and repeated success, we begin to trust ourselves on a deeper level. \"When we begin trusting ourselves and our positive nature that completely, it becomes so easy to move past all our thoughts into that space of silence beyond, where we can hear that voice of wisdom and knowledge in our bodies and begin to live healthier, happier lives, even when coping with chronic pain or illness. Creating this habit of self-trust helps us to become better partners with our physicians in an environment which allows us to speak openly and freely about the things we're experiencing, and then to decide together on a better or more appropriate health management path.\" Turning patients into partners with their doctors is Marc's ultimate goal for the people with whom he works. Partnering with your doctor is about openly sharing your health issues, concerns, and desires for living your life as fully, completely, and happily as possible. These are the techniques that Marc has taught on his talk radio show \"A Healthy Way to be Sick\" featured on World Talk Radio. The show is not currently being broadcast, but all the segments are available on his website at www.lifeskillsinc.com, along with numerous articles he's written on a variety of health topics and links to other health-related resources. While Marc primarily works with those who cope with chronic and often debilitating health issues, he's not solely focused on people with health crises. \"What I teach these individuals can work for anyone,\" he said, \"although sometimes it may be easier for those of us who are coping with serious health issues because we're already desperate to find something that works to help us feel less pain and help us to feel better. Desperateness can be a valuable thing. When we really want something, we have to be willing to let go of things that aren't serving us well and open up to something different. That's the point where we begin to access the wisdom of our bodies. That's where we find the purest form of love and the best of our creative abilities; that's where the quality of life comes from. One of my favorite quotes states that 'the quality of life does not depend on the health of your body, it depends on your focus,' and that is so true.\" After having practiced this technique for 30 years, Marc is able to move into 'the moment' or 'the zone' frequently and with ease. \"In a way, it's like being in a very narrow corridor which is the path that leads me beyond my thoughts into that space where the silence exists and my body's wisdom can speak what it needs.\" Marc doesn't offer this approach as a miraculous cure for the physical conditions of the body. \"Obviously, I still have MS and I have physical limitations. MS attacks and damages the nervous system, so any area of the body that has nerves, which is pretty much everything, can be affected and compromised. As I said earlier, I'm legally blind, so I can't see like other people do, but I can see. I can't walk like everyone else, but I can walk and exercise.\" Today, Marc is in a wheelchair unless he is exercising by walking up twelve flights of stairs while holding on to the rail. He cannot read or make out faces, and he admits to experiencing more pain since having brain surgery last year. \"The last year has definitely been more difficult,\" Marc said. \"It's been the first year that I've experienced pain with MS. There is a benefit to that \u2014 you have to go deeper to even cope with the pain, so when you find that depth, the pain seems to be a little bit distant. It can still hurt, but it's tolerable...Sometimes I'm still trapped by my thoughts, but if I can keep my focus on something attractive or pleasing to me, that helps distract me from thoughts about what parts of my body don't work very well and helps me with the pain in a more positive way. At this point in my life, I would rather deal with a chronic illness than not experience the quality of life I've experienced through having MS. My physical vision is bad, but it gives me an advantage in being able to practice inner reflection that many healthy individuals have difficulty with.\" Recently, Marc joined with Amy Rosenberg in a commitment ceremony. Amy was raised in Great Neck, New York, and has lived in southeastern Michigan for decades. They met at a Passover dinner. Marc saw her walking with a cane and, since he uses a wheelchair, decided they could become good friends. \"Over 20 years ago, when she was still quite young, she had a stroke which left her with some physical difficulties.\" Marc explained that it's difficult for handicapped people to date because the handicap is almost always a glaring issue, but he and Amy have never had that issue. He didn't feel bad about his handicap and she wasn't put off by it. \"When we're together, neither of us is handicapped and it's the most amazing thing. It's the most comfortable and loving connection I've ever experienced and she's the most wonderful woman I've ever known.\" \"I'll say it again. This is something anyone can do. It's simply a matter of letting go of the negative thoughts and images that don't serve you well, breathing into the silence that exists beyond your thoughts, and then listening to the wisdom of your body. It takes practice to create the habit of looking to your positive thoughts and images, but once that habit is established, it becomes easier and easier to slip into 'the moment' and hear the wisdom that's being spoken. That moment opens us up to the deeper wisdom within, allowing us to live creatively, to love purely, and allows our hearts to manifest. It's a truly beautiful gift.\" Marc Lerner is the president of the non-profit Life Skills Institute.

While this practice can lead to the creation of thangka paintings, it is also an active form of contemplation and meditation, a cultivation of awareness centered in the sublimity of the Buddha's image. Chenrezig, Lord of Compassion Buddha Shakyamuni with proportional grid, ink Buddha Shakyamuni in Robes in Pureland, inkThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 31 By Rob Davis Since its founding in 1990, the Tsogyelgar Dharma Center on West Liberty has steadily become a treasure to behold in Ann Arbor. In our May thru August 2010 issue (available on our archive at crazywisdom.net), we featured the developments that were transforming this Vajrayana Buddhist community's farm property, including the construction of amazing gardens, a mirror hut, and tantric murals. Rob Davis is the Buddhist artist who created those spectacular murals. Here he shares the conventions, artistry, and beauty of his process. In 2006, I had the great fortune to meet Traktung Rinpoche in Ann Arbor. I attended a retreat where Rinpoche taught practices of the Nyingma Lineage. These included meditation on \"deities,\" such as the image of the Buddha. In the Vajrayana lineages of Buddhism it is known that images of Buddhas, their perfect, luminous, and empty form, contain the wisdom of the teachings. They are not signs. They are living symbols, the teachings in themselves. I was inspired as an artist to serve the beauty of Traktung Rinpoche's teachings and the place of art in these practices. The principle practice of learning to paint deities according to the master thangka painter Pema Rinzin is Drawing and Inking the Buddha . I learned to draw and ink the Buddha during a three-year period of training with Mr. Rinzin in New York. At that time, Mr. Rinzin was the first Artist-in-Residence at the Rubin Museum of Art. Learning to draw and ink the Buddha is a practice given from teacher to student. It is a living lineage of artistic transmission. While this practice can lead to the creation of thangka paintings, it is also an active form of contemplation and meditation, a cultivation of awareness centered in the sublimity of the Buddha's image. What is Drawing the Buddha ? The painting traditions from the Tibetan regions are known for their use of 'grids.' These grids are guides to the proportions and contours of the Buddhas. They are largely training guides for students. Thus, the presence of the Buddha as the central proportion is the sacred origin of this art and the grid is a tool through which we understand this. Like any other tradition of conventions, the art does not achieve sacredness or beauty simply by following the grids. Conventions are limitations as much as they are useful for learning. The artist's internalization of the proportions of the Buddha is thus only the beginning of making art. The grid for Buddha Shakyamuni is based on the unit measurement of twelve. This unit is the Buddha's face proportion. All the other proportions are based in this unit. To copy Buddha, one must pay close attention to the Buddha's form within the grid. The image one copies is Buddha Shakyamuni, the image of the Buddha at the moment of enlightenment, painted by one's teacher. His right hand is in the \"earth touch mudra\" and his left holds a bowl of nectar. His eyes, deep in samadhi, express the limitless compassion and indestructible wisdom of the enlightened state. Every line in the image is essential, expressing delicacy and grace. The first image a student begins is the Buddha without robes. This initial image is a harmonious simplicity that becomes the basis of all forms in general and all male figures in particular. Tara is the basis of all female forms. After drawings are made, one is ready to ink with a brush. This is the formal basis of the thangka craft: the use of the brush. \"The mind is in the line,\" Pema Rinzin once said, and much of the unique aesthetic achievements of Tibetan art are found in its line use. Each form in a finished thangka finds its completion with expressive outlines. The cultivation of line quality is the student's main task. To make a line fine and precise, while also being free and uncontrived, is the sign of mastery. This is achieved by inking numerous Buddhas. The cultivated use of the brush in this manner is tremendously rewarding and joyful, creating a deep connection between one's perception and one's action. It is thus a practice of mindfulness. The brush teaches one to see how each moment requires complete awareness and relaxation. In inking the Buddha, one becomes aware of the interrelatedness of each element: the drawing, the ink, the brush, and the work of the hand. This observed practice thus translates to all other creative disciplines. It teaches the student to become aware of every element that is being utilized, including one's attention. It is thus universal in its application. It is a form of impersonal training and submission, which, when mastered, allows the artist to express specificity and individuality. While the subtleties and disciplines of Drawing the Buddha were given by my painting teacher Pema Rinzin, Traktung Rinpoche taught me the implication and profundity of this practice: \"To contemplate the form of the Buddha purifies negative karmas of the senses and to draw Buddha purifies similar karmas of the hands.\" According to Buddhism, Buddha Nature, the awakened state, is the natural state of every being. Thus the image of the Buddha is the image of every person's true nature. This was Buddha Shakyamuni's teaching at the moment of enlightenment: \"How amazing, how marvelous that all beings have been, since the beginning, Buddha.\" This moment is the image we draw of the Buddha. Rinpoche teaches that a human being is composed of many organs of knowledge, many centers of perception, and that contemplation of sublime forms such as Buddha, particularly through aesthetic creation, cultivates higher impressions. These impressions make integration of these 'organs' possible. The integration of organs of knowledge into a single whole, deepened as they are by aesthetic beauty, make meditation, and thus, true knowledge possible. To internalize the Buddha through this work, then, is not simply a rote task for making paintings, but a form of meditation that enriches our capacities as human beings to know ourselves. To internalize the image of the Buddha, of Tara, of Manjushri, is thus to engage one's own true nature directly and to become sensitive to the ability to know this fact. Not only do we train ourselves to make this image for others, we train ourselves in the meditative ability to become the image of our own highest aspiration: wisdom and compassion, the Buddha. In the simple practice of Drawing the Buddha , we steep our minds in an image of enlightened qualities \u2014 qualities we intuit are our actual natures. Drawing the Buddha also creates one other simple form of enjoyment easily missed in our culture of action based on fun \u2014 pleasure \u2014 the pleasure of aesthetic discipline. To find facility with the brush, making the sinuous lines of the Buddha's form, is pleasurable. I now teach this practice at venues in Ann Arbor, including the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

Manjushri, Buddha of Wisdom Prajnaparamita, \"Perfection of Wisdom,\" Mother of All BuddhasThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 32 By Karl Pohrt Photo by Susan Ayer Anya Bernstein arrived in Ann Arbor a year and a half ago. She is a cultural anthropologist and documentary filmmaker, and she teaches Anthropology and Asian Cultures at the University of Michigan. She is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the University of Michigan's Society of Fellows and a U-M Assistant Professor of Anthropology. She grew up in Russia, attended Moscow State University, received an M.A. in Visual Anthropology from the University of Manchester and a Ph.D. in Anthropology from New York University. She also holds an undergraduate degree in Linguistics from Georgetown University. She has worked and studied in Russia, England, France, India, and the U.S. while conducting multiple research trips to both North and South Asia for her fieldwork and films. Her two films have been screened at film festivals around the world. For information on her films, see www.der.org/films/in-pursuit-of-siberian-shaman.html and www.der.org/films/join-me-in-shambhala.html. This past fall she taught a course entitled \"The Anthropology of Death and the Afterlife .\" Karl Pohrt: You have made two films that explore religious behavior in the Russian Republic of Buryatia, which borders on Lake Baikal in Southern Siberia. Join Me In Shambhala (2002) is a film about Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche, a Tibetan Lama who lives in Buryatia, and his attendant Tenzin Tsering. In Pursuit of the Siberian Shaman (2006) is a documentary on Valentin Khagdaev, a Buryat Shaman. Why did you pick these subjects? Do you have a personal interest in these specific religious expressions? Anya Bernstein: As an anthropologist I have a very broad interest in the human condition and in the ways people make meaning in their lives. I've always thought religion was an interesting avenue into that. I am interested in the specific case of Buryatia and the issue of memory. Buryats are an indigenous people who have lived in southern Siberia for many centuries. They have been incorporated into various large state projects. Some of them were part of the Mongolian Empire. Later they became part of the Russian Empire and more recently the Soviet Union. For 70 years, during the Soviet era, religion and many of the traditional practices were suppressed in this region. A lot of Buryats \u2014 counter to what people might imagine now \u2014 embraced Communist values. They embraced the Communist ideology. There was a lot of social engineering done with memory. They were first told to forget their culture. Then they were told to remember certain parts of it but not others. The Soviets liked the idea of ethnic diversity. They believed cultures and peoples should have traditions, but not religions. They suppressed not just Shamanism and Buddhism, but also Russian Orthodoxy, Islam and Judaism. Everything. And when the Soviet Union fell apart, people could remember again. But was there anything to remember? I was really interested in what happened to all of these pieces of shattered ideologies. The indigenous Siberians in Buryatia are very different in northern and southern Siberia. Northern groups are closer to Inuits, while in the south there live Mongolian and Turkic groups. Buryats see themselves as part of this great Mongolian civilization. And they have been Buddhists for a few centuries, which is a source of pride. By the time I made these films they had experienced 70 years of socialism and then 10 years of capitalism. What happened to all these ideologies? Obviously, religion was resurgent. I wanted to see how it all played out. I was interested in how these people create meaning in their everyday lives, in everything from financial to existential and personal issues. Karl Pohrt: Do you see Shamanism as a world religion? It seems to me that in the West the public's interest in Shamanism is connected to our sense that something crucial is missing or broken in our relationship with the powers inherent in the natural world. The problem \u2014 or at least I see it as a problem \u2014 is that there isn't a cultural context for Shamanism in the urban West. Anya Bernstein: There are some Buryat Shamans who would like to say that Shamanism is a world religion because this advances a certain political position. Anthropologists usually don't want to claim that Shamanism is a religion, but that is a point of academic and semantic debate. Shamanism is a Siberian U-M Assistant Professor of Anthropology Anya Bernstein \"For 70 years, during the Soviet era, religion and many of the traditional practices were suppressed in this region...They believed cultures and peoples should have traditions, but not religions...And when the Soviet Union fell apart, people could remember again. But was there anything to remember?\" \"Even the highest incarnate Lamas have to recognize the local spirits. He's the highest Lama in Buryatia because he is a Tibetan incarnate Lama, but if you can't establish peaceful relationships with the local spirits you don't have legitimacy in Buryatia.\" - Anya Bernstein on Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche and the interconnectedness of Shamanism and Buddhism in Siberia Siberian Buddhism, Siberian Shamanism and the Politics of Memory \u2014 Karl Pohrt Interviews Anthropologist/ Filmmaker Anya BernsteinThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 33 phenomenon. It has its roots in Paleolithic Siberian cultures, in hunting and gathering societies, but it's such a malleable practice. It has been transformed and it's evolved with every political, social, and cultural regime that's swept through this area. Then there is Mircea Eliade's famous definition that Shamanism is an archaic technique of ecstasy. That's a very narrow definition. Shamanism is much more than that. Eliade wrote that Shamanism is characterized by flight to the spirit worlds, that magical flight is a quintessential feature of Shamanism. However, it has been shown in many cultures, including those in Buryatia, that it's the spirits that come to the people. I would prefer to define Shamanism very loosely. To me, a Shaman is a person who communicates with the supernatural to benefit the community. It's very much a community phenomenon. Right now Shamanism is embedded in the global forces of politics, tourism, the media, and indigenous rights. If Shamans in Buryatia want to represent Shamanism as a world religion, it is because it serves a very particular purpose for them. They live in the contemporary world and if they want to be recognized, they must have sacred sites. They need to form associations. It is said that in ancient times Shamans used to engage in violent spiritual warfare with each other, but now they form associations. They need to get some legal status if they want to establish their legitimacy. They don't have temples, so a lot of Shamans would say, for example, \"Look at this rock. This is our temple. We don't go into a church and desecrate it. You must help us protect this sacred rock.\" And Shamanism is also absolutely about place. This is essential. Much more than magic flying, Shamanism is about the relationship with place and with the local spirits. That's why a lot of Shamans have made such good allies with environmentalists by joining the global environmental movement. In traditional communities Shamanism is essentially a public phenomenon. It's not about self transformation. It's about using supernatural forces for practical goals, to help people. Shamans work as psychotherapists, as family counselors, and as healers among other things. I'm not really keen on arguing about definitions, but in the West what we call Shamanism is something quite different. Shamanism has become psychologized. Whatever you call this phenomenon, it is a kind of psychology that deals with self transformation. It's much more of an individualistic enterprise. It's about causing change in the self. So it's interiorized in that sense. It's not a religion, but more like a psychology. It also has a certain view of politics because it assumes that by inducing a change in the self, society will eventually be transformed. I think that is what has happened in the West. In Siberia it's more about the community and meeting its specific and particular goals. For example, local people who come to Shamanic s\u00e9ances aren't interested in the trance experience. A lot of Westerners are really interested in trance and don't come for the experience of community. However, there is this robust feedback loop. Siberian Shamans traveled to the U.S. to meet Native Americans and Western Shamans have traveled to Siberia. Michael Harner, the famous Western Shaman, went to Tuva and trained some Tuvan Shamans in the Western techniques and they enjoyed it. So there's a lot of cross-fertilization of ideas these days. It goes back and forth and there's a lot of imitation. I think that's normal. That's how culture is usually formed. Karl Pohrt: You use the anthropological phrase local object ideology in a recent essay. Could you talk about local object ideology \u2014 investing the natural world or local objects with meaning \u2014 and Shamanism? Anya Bernstein: I used the term in an article I wrote on Buryat Buddhism but it is also true for Shamanism. I was writing that Buryats have specific beliefs about sacred objects. They believe these objects have links to the intentions of previous famous Lamas. They don't just appear for no reason. Recently people have been finding sacred objects in the ground. Who knows why they appear where they do? There is no explanation except a magical one. They are always linked to famous Lamas who either lived or meditated in the place where the objects appear. Essentially this functions as a reconsecration of the landscape. The landscape was neutral but now it is Buddhist because someone found a so-called self-arisen image, a non-man-made image of a goddess or a god on a stone. It just revealed itself because this famous Lama in a past century meditated there and he actually planned it so the image would appear now.I found this process structurally very similar to what happened in Tibet with the Terma or Treasure Texts. As Don Lopez has said, when Tibetans were no longer able to travel to India, they began to discover sacred texts buried in the local soil. Donald Lopez has written about this in The Tibetan Book of the Dead: A Biography. What this means for a lot of Buryats is that Buddhism has really come back. It's found its place \u2014 like Shamanism, right? \u2014 in the land. Buryatia is not some secondary site linked to India through Mongolia through Tibet. Now it's actually the center of the Buddhist world (or so the argument goes). Buddhism is being revealed there right now. It's a process of continuous revelation. KP: In Join Me In Shambhala you show a connection between Shamanism and Buddhism.AB: Yes. Absolutely. They are very interconnected in Siberia, but especially in Buryatia. Since Buddhism was introduced to Buryatia by Tibetan and Mongolian Lamas in the late 17 th century, relations have sometimes been hostile but usually they have mutually pollinated each other. Buddhism incorporated the local deities in Buryatia. The more orthodox Buddhists incorporated them into the lower ranks of the Buddhist hierarchy. It's the same thing that happened in Tibet. The more orthodox Buddhists will tell you that they converted the local spirits and made them into protectors of Buddhism. On the other hand, the local deities are really central in the lives of most people. It's not the transcendent ones that are central. I was very interested in this when I made my first film with the Tibetan Lama in Buryatia because you could see that even the highest incarnate Lamas have to recognize the local spirits. He's the highest Lama in Buryatia because he is a Tibetan incarnate Lama, but if you can't establish peaceful relationships with the local spirits you don't have legitimacy in Buryatia. There is a ritual in the film where he makes an offering to the water spirits. They read Tibetan texts during the ritual because in Tibet they have similar spirits, but these are local Buryat spirits. They are not really trying to pacify them, but they just want to establish peaceful relations. They believe that the spirits are mischievous. These spirits can cause illness because they're not quite enlightened. They both give and take. They can cause good or bad things to happen. Some of Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche's root teachers were Buryat Buddhists, which means he has these quasi-kinship links to his Buryat predecessors, because in Tibetan Buddhism the master-disciple relationship is often stronger than that between a father and son. So some people feel that Rinpoche has a little bit of Buryat in him. This has given him a certain legitimacy. Some Buryats believe that you really have to have some kind of special connection to the place. Not just any Lama can deal with the local spirits. KP: Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche honors that special connection with the local spirits and yet at the same time \u2014 at the end of the film \u2014 he talks about Emptiness. I thought his speech is orthodox Mahayana Buddhism, straight out of the book. It is a beautiful speech. AB: Yes. It is right out of the book. I was very interested in these Buddhist texts at the time I made the film. I prompted Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche to talk about Emptiness and he used very classic Buddhist images like phantom, a dream and a flash of lightning . These metaphors come from the Buddhist Sutras. Of course, he knows all of them by heart, so it was very easy for him to speak about it. KP: At the end of the film we see Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche meditating in a field. Suddenly a train moves past, briefly interrupting our view of him. AB: I was experimenting with montage techniques and juxtaposing the two different realities. Trains always appeared during my journey. At the beginning of my fieldwork, I took the famous Trans-Siberian train from Moscow to Siberia. Yeshe Lodro Rinpoche and Tenzin Tsering were meditating on the train at the start of the film. At the time, I thought it was strange that the Lamas were meditating in their train compartment. This was because I was a newcomer in the field ten years ago. I wanted Join Me In Shambhala to have a circular structure with images of trains at the beginning and the end of the film. \"Students were fascinated that Shamans are such a vital part of everyday life and that they are part of modernity...I think it took them a while to wrap their minds around it and view Shamanism not as something exotic and scholarly, but as something real and practical and vital. I think they got it.\" - Anya Bernstein on teaching Shamans, Nomads and Commissars: Introduction to North Asia at University of Michigan Continued on page 34The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 34 KP: Recently you've written about Siberian Buddhism and necropolitics. In 2002, Buryat Buddhist monks exhumed the body of the last head Lama during the Russian Empire. According to witnesses, the Lama's body had not deteriorated and it was found sitting in a meditation position. This incident reminded me of that moment in The Brothers Karamazov when the Russian Orthodox monks speculate that Father Zosima's body would not decay after his death because he was so holy. It seems most religious cultures associate holiness with the purity of the body. The use of dead bodies to legitimate certain religious and political positions seems fairly universal. AB: Of course, Buddhism has a very peculiar relationship with death. Death is one of the four main forms of suffering in Buddhist thought, along with birth, old age and sickness; and, therefore, one should aspire to overcome death. In the specific case of that Lama there are multiple rival theories about what happened to his body after his death. There is no consensus. Some people say he did not die at all, that he conquered death. There is this motif in Buddhism that you can conquer death. You can attain to the deathless, as they say. Some people believe he achieved that. Others think that he's in some kind of deep meditation state. Yet others say no, of course he did die, but he was such an advanced practitioner that he deliberately left his incorruptible body behind to benefit future generations, to inspire faith in these difficult transition times when Buddhism is being revived in Buryatia. KP: You are a documentary filmmaker and an anthropologist. How do these very different vocations inform \u2014 or enrich \u2014 each other in your work? AB: Well, I see the two as complementary. I actually started out as a visual anthropologist. I did a special program that trained anthropologists in how to make films because I was interested in combining both mediums. I see them both as ways of transmitting anthropological knowledge. However, they are very different mediums. They are complementary but each has its advantages and disadvantages. I think the films I make have essentially the same themes as my writing, but the films are much more narrative driven. They are much more visceral. They provide a certain kind of synesthetic experience that you don't get from writing. On the other hand, films are also not without their disadvantages. While they can show some of the non-verbal dynamics that don't really come through in a text, they can also be deceptive. A text is more analytic. You can explain certain things that are taken for granted in a film. You can unpack certain ideas in a text. Finally, of course, there is the question of audience. Academic writing usually has a small readership, whereas my films have been circulated pretty widely and that is very appealing to me. The use of the camera in anthropological work has been really enriching for me. I used the camera as a point of entry in the field when I first arrived there as a student in visual anthropology. Everything I have done is contrary to the more orthodox rules of visual anthropology. I was taught that the field worker, the anthropologist, has to arrive in the field and spend many years with people, with the ethnic groups. They have to get used to you before you pull out the camera. Only then can you film. Everything I have done \u2014 and a lot of people have done this recently \u2014 has been completely the opposite. When I arrived in a community, I would pull out the camera and this drew me into a chain of social relationships immediately. When you're holding a camera you are never a passive onlooker. Immediately it drives you into a kind of reciprocity because people are interested in the film. They might be able to use the film \u2014 which I encourage \u2014 for their own purposes. KP: There is a scene in Join Me In Shambhala that you must have shot through the front window of a car. We see horsemen racing in front of you. It's a beautiful moment, filled with kinetic excitement and great poetic energy. It evoked in me a sense that human beings are simultaneously living in multiple worlds at this moment in our history. This is the 21 st century and here we are arriving in a small village of recently nomadic people. I thought this was something that couldn't be described as effectively in a narrative text. This was something a film could do much better. AB: Exactly. It was just one of these serendipitous moments that you often encounter when filming. I was riding in the car and I knew I had to film it. When the Lama arrived in a village people wanted to honor the occasion so they would send out teenagers on horseback. This is one of the traditional sources of pride. Horse riding, archery and wrestling \u2014 these are called 'the three manly sports.' It was an impromptu ritual. They would send these horsemen to greet us. When we got out of the car they would serve us a fermented milk drink that was considered sacred food. KP: You taught a course last winter at the University of Michigan called Shamans, Nomads and Commissars: Introduction to North Asia . How did your students respond to the material in the course? AB: Students were fascinated that Shamans are such a vital part of everyday life and that they are part of modernity. These people who are so remote incorporate Shamanism as part of their everyday lives. I think it took them a while to wrap their minds around it and view Shamanism not as something exotic and scholarly, but as something real and practical and vital. I think they got it. KP: You grew up in Moscow and you did graduate work in New York. What is your sense of Ann Arbor? AB: I've lived most of my life in big cosmopolitan centers. I grew up in Moscow and spent a couple of years in France and England before coming to the U.S. And I lived in India and Siberia during my fieldwork. Ann Arbor is as cosmopolitan as any of the other places I've lived, but it's much smaller and that's really interesting to me. It's very exotic in its own way. Michigan, especially Northern Michigan, looks more like Europe and Central Russia than anywhere else I've been in the U.S. I was really excited when I went to Northern Michigan to see birch trees, because Russia is all about birch trees. There are not as many of them in Ann Arbor, but here I can see trees and plants that I recognize. The only thing I knew about Ann Arbor before moving here was that it was the center of Russian dissident publishing in the seventies. The Ardis Publishers printed books by Brodsky and a lot of the exiled and dissident Russian writers. This publisher had a great impact on my parents' generation. My mother and father would read these books. Ardis Publishers and Ann Arbor were always special for them. KP: They read the Ardis books in Moscow? They didn't have trouble getting hold of these books? AB: Ardis books were smuggled back into the Soviet Union, ironically, often by Soviet diplomats. Most people read them in hand-made copies. It became part of samizdat \u2014 illegal literature. A lot of stuff was banned, but people read it anyway. It was somewhat difficult to get hold of, but illegal literature was always circulated. ### Anya Bernstein's website is at: www.cinetrance.com.

More than literally identifying with the gods and goddesses whose stories I am dancing, it is a personal connection with the divine principle.\" Recreating Ancient Indian Spiritual Dances for Modern Audiences By Sandor Slomovits Sreyashi Dey is head of Marketing and Communications at the University of Michigan's North Campus Research Complex, but she is also a highly skilled practitioner of Indian classical dance. With her dance company, Srishti Dances of India, she has performed around the area and across the country. Sandor Slomovits spoke with Sreyashi and her seventeen-year-old identical twin daughters, Kritika and Ishika \u2014 who are fine dancers in their own right \u2014 about this ancient art form and their personal connection to it. Sreyashi Dey: The dance form that we perform is called Odissi, and it's one of eight styles of Indian classical dance. This dance style is from the eastern part of India, from a state called Orissa. The origins of this style can be traced back to two thousand years ago. That's not to say that what we see today is exactly how it was two thousand years ago. It's undergone many changes. Back then, it used to be performed in the temples, by women who were dedicated to the temples, to just sing and dance for the gods. It was a form of worship, and its roots were very deep, spiritual. There were rituals associated with symbolically waking up the gods by singing, and then during the meals that were offered, then during the evening worship, and finally at night, almost like singing the gods to sleep. In parallel to this, especially during the colonial time, which was about two hundred years and ended in 1947, in that time these traditions came under a lot of negative attention, and got a bad name. In parallel there was this other tradition that came up, of young boys who dressed up as girls, and they performed this very acrobatic form of dance, outside of the temples, in a non-spiritual context. Sandor Slomovits: As performance? Sreyashi Dey: Yes, as performance.Sandor Slomovits: Did the earlier form also have a performance aspect? Did worshippers watch the dancers?Sreyashi Dey: No, it was inside the temples and it wasn't really for the public. So there were these two traditions and, after India's independence, the teachers and dancers and scholars got together and wanted to cleanse the form of all the different elements that had crept into it because of neglect, and they wanted to recreate it and reconstruct it, based on the traditional texts. So they looked at the traditional texts, they looked at the temple sculptures and at the two remaining traditions, and they recreated the dance form that you see today. Indian classical dance is very regional, which means that even though all the styles trace their origins to very ancient texts and techniques prescribed in those texts, they all have a very regional flavor and they're based on regional literature and poetry and language. Even in the body language, there is a very large variation in India from one region to another, and the regional styles are reflective of the culture of that region. Even though some of the mythology is common to all, and some of the older texts are common to all, the lyrics would be sung in a regional style of music and the movements would be reflective of the regional style. In the 1950s, dance slowly became a performance art, it came more to the proscenium stage, and it became suitable for an evening-length performance. Sandor Slomovits: Just women dancers, or women and men? Sreyashi Dey: Women and men.Sandor: Dancing together? Sreyashi: Both. Dancing together and separately. More women than men, but in the case of Odissi that is something that has changed. There are more men in recent years, which is a very good trend because it used to be very difficult for men to support themselves as performing artists only. The teachers are almost always all men, but there was less support from the audiences for men as dancers. They wanted to see more women. Now that trend is changing. It's not equal yet, but there are definitely more men now who are dancers. Initially, the whole repertoire was one long piece. In the 1950s, when it was first developed, the whole repertoire was one hour-long piece. Then, to accommodate the needs of the present times, and shorter audience attention spans, it was broken into shorter pieces, while still keeping the Continued on page 36The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 36 Sreyashi Dey, in a pure dance/rhythmic piece, Pallavi \"The origins of [the Odissi dance] style can be traced back to two thousand years ago...

One kind of dance is more rhythmic \u2014 what they call pure dance \u2014 which is based on the melody of the music, and is just reflective of the joy of movement and follows the structure of the melody, and the development of the song. The other kind is more storytelling, through facial expressions. Sandor: Is it accurate to say that Odissi still has a spiritual component? Sreyashi: Oh, definitely, because the texts that are used are still very ancient texts. One of the main texts that's used in Odissi for the storytelling pieces is from the twelfth century. The mythology is also very old. It's entirely spiritual. Sandor: How is spirituality integrated into the dances? Sreyashi: Spirituality is an essential element in Indian classical dance. Born out of spiritual impulses since ancient times, it was used as a means of worship for the gods. Elaborate temple rituals included dance as an offering to the divine. The themes used in classical dance are derived from religious and spiritual texts over the centuries. The lyrics for the songs that accompany the dances are based on spiritual literature. The narrative for the dances, the themes, the music and the movements all reflect spirituality, which can't be separated from the dance. For me dance is a prayer, a meditation and an offering to the divine spirit. More than literally identifying with the gods and goddesses whose stories I am dancing, it is a personal connection with the divine principle. After all these years of immersion in dance, I cannot separate what is technique and what is spiritual. It is all a part of a larger whole that is deeply beautiful and joyous. Sandor: You were born in India? Sreyashi: Yes. Sandor: And you learned this form as a child? Sreyashi: I started when I was seven. I actually started with another form of dance from Southern India and, when I was about seventeen, I switched over to Odissi. Then, when I was twenty-one I came over to the U.S. for grad school, but I continued studying, practicing, performing, and teaching. Sandor: What did you study in grad school? Sreyashi: I came to do my Ph.D. in economics. Sandor: Here at the UM? Sreyashi: No, it was at Purdue. I finished a master's in economics there and later I did an M.B.A. Instead of one Ph.D., I ended up with two graduate degrees. (Laughter) Sandor: Was there a history of dance in your family? Did either of your parents dance?Sreyashi: No. I grew up in Delhi, and the kind of family background I came from, and in my circle of friends and family, nobody is into dance or music as a profession. I studied dance the way girls here would study ballet. Girls would go to classes, moms would take them, and they would have recitals every year. Sandor: Did you ever have aspirations to be a dancer as your full-time work? Sreyashi: Yes, I did actually. Around the time I was starting college, I was seriously thinking about being a professional dancer. But my parents kind of talked me out of that.Sreya Shi Dey, Dancing with traDition Continued from page 35 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 37 \"One kind of dance is more rhythmic \u2014 what they call pure dance \u2014 which is based on the melody of the music, and is just reflective of the joy of movement...The other kind is more storytelling, through facial expressions.\" M E N T I O N T H I S A D T O R E C E I V E 5 0 % O F F Y O U R F I R S T T R E A T M E N T ! 708 W .

Sreyashi: No, I do have a couple of other students who perform with us on a regular basis and we've also had visiting artists from India who I've performed and toured with. Sandor: Are either of you interested in pursuing this as seriously as your mom has?Kritika: It's tough. I guess right now we want to pursue it as much as we can. We'll have to see as we go forward, though, how much school is going to get in the way, or how jobs get in the way. But as of right now, we're definitely interested in keeping up with it as much as we can. Sandor: Some twins never want to be apart, while others want as much space as possible once they grow up. ( Laughter) You see where I'm heading with this, right?Ishika: I think we're pretty close. Like any siblings, we have our moments. (Laughter) Kritika: I think we're both looking forward to college a little bit just because we'll be separated a little more than we are already. We spend a lot of time together now and we both kind of want to see what it's going to be like to not be together, like every moment. But at the same time, because we're both going to the same school, the other person is still right there. Sreyashi: They might actually end up being in the same dorm. But they won't be in the same room.Sandor: Where do you give performances these days? Sreyashi: Actually, more often outside of Ann Arbor than locally. I used to have a pretty active touring schedule, performing all over the U.S. Every year it would be about ten to fifteen cities, and then we'd also perform in India and internationally, if not every year, then every other year. The Ann Arbor community has great exposure to all kinds of art forms and the audiences here are really wonderful. Before moving to Ann Arbor, we lived in Pittsburgh and I had a more formal dance company, as a registered nonprofit organization, and it was much easier to get grants and get private foundation support and state support. That aspect pretty much went away when we moved here, because the state of Michigan is not supporting the arts anymore. Sandor: How long have you lived in Ann Arbor? Sreyashi: Since 2004. Sandor: You didn't come at a great time for Michigan. ( Laughter) Sreyashi: No. I think it's difficult for a professional arts organization in Continued on page 38 Ann Arbor. There's this two-fold aspect. The audiences are great, they're very interested, and a lot of people are very knowledgeable not just about the art form, but also about the cultural context, because they're into different religions and spirituality, and yoga. I'm not talking just about India; it's that way with other cultures as well, with similar levels of interest and exposure. The audiences are very welcoming, so that aspect is great. At the same time, there isn't enough support. Especially after having moved to Ann Arbor, I'm very glad that this is not the only thing I do. Because if I was hoping to support myself or my organization through external support like that, it would be difficult here. Lately, rather than just traditional straight-up performances, I'm doing more work with other artists, with photographers and writers, in venues that are not just large theaters, such as the UM Museum of Art and the UM Lydia Mendelssohn Theater. Sandor: You still have family in India.Sreyashi: Yes. We've gone to India, if not every year, then every other year, for sure. My daughters have also studied dance in India. There's always been that connection. Ishika: Dancing is definitely the biggest part of Indian culture we were immersed in, the biggest part of Indian culture that we've been a part of. Sandor: So if they said to you, \"We want to dance professionally,\" what would you say? (Laughter) Ishika: You would actually say the same thing your parents did. Sreyashi: Yes, I would say the same thing. ( Laughter) Kritika: But, I think if I wanted to take a year off and go to India and study and perform, you'd be OK with that. Sreyashi: I'd be very happy with that. ### Ishika and Kritika Rajan and will present the dance performance \"Language of Mudra\" as part of the U-M LSA Language theme semester at the U-M Residential College's Keene Theatre on Tuesday, January 10, 2012;it starts at 7 p.m. Admission is free.For more information, go to www.srishtidances.com.The website for the performance is:http://language.lsa.umich.edu/event/language-of-mudra/ \"...After India's independence, the teachers and dancers and scholars got together and wanted to cleanse the form of all the different elements that had crept into it because of neglect, and they wanted to recreate it and reconstruct it, based on the traditional texts.\"Sreyashi Dey in a rhythmic or pure dance piece called Pallavi.

Yet we still have survivors of the Holocaust in our midst, and it remains powerful and affecting to hear from them \u2014 to hear their stories, and imbibe their wisdom. We were approached a few months ago by Richard Gull, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, University of Michigan, because he wanted to interview Dr. Emanuel Tanay for the Crazy Wisdom Journal . Knowing Richard Gull and having heard about Emanuel Tanay, we readily agreed.) Dr. Emanuel Tanay (his nickname is Emek) was born into a middle class Jewish family in a small town in Poland in 1928. Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and the extermination of the Jews began in 1942. His father procured a birth certificate giving Emek a non-Jewish name and allowing him to enter a Catholic monastery as a novitiate. After a year, one of his teachers strongly suspected that Emek was really a Jew, so he quickly left. He helped his mother, sister, and girlfriend escape from Poland to Hungary through Nazi occupied Europe. After the liberation, he returned to his hometown in Poland. He discovered that his father had been executed for hiding a Jew by Amon Goeth, head of the Plaszov labor camp (Goeth is portrayed in Schindler's List by Ralph Fiennes). Returning to Budapest, the family then went to Munich for six years. Emek received a medical degree and the family came to America. He tells this story in Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust (2004). He then became a psychiatrist and an expert witness in murder trials. In a recent book, American Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes with an Expert Witness (2010), he discusses his work on and views of high profile cases like Ted Bundy, Sam Sheppard, Jack Ruby, and John Hinckley. In spite of his experiences in the Holocaust, Emek is optimistic about the future. He says: \"Every survivor is a hero. Every survivor needed resourcefulness and the courage to endure. These attributes made them successful after the war.\" Yet he warns of religions and ideologies that lead to hatred and genocidal killing. Why tell this story? To quote Eli Wiesel (from his book, And the Sea is Never Full): \"Long ago, over there, far from the living, we told ourselves over and over that if we were to come out alive, we would devote every moment of our lives to denouncing by word and deed the cynicism and silence of mankind toward victims past and future.\" Richard Gull: You are a survivor of the Holocaust. You tell your story in your 2004 book Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust. You have also had a long and successful career as a forensic psychiatrist and expert witness in murder trials. You tell that story in your 2010 book American Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes with an Expert Witness . You write: \"My professional life was, for the most part, devoted to the study of people who killed someone; people who wanted to kill me dominated the early part of my life.\" Dr. Emanuel Tanay: That is correct, I am a survivor of the Holocaust. And maybe one should add that I am from Poland, because Poland was the killing grounds of Nazi Germany. In Eastern Europe that's where the Germans behaved without any kind of restraints. Richard Gull: Wasn't there a greater percentage of the Jewish population wiped out in Poland than in Germany itself? Dr. Emanuel Tanay: In Germany, itself, the percentage of German Jews killed was a proportionally small fraction of what happened in Poland. First of all, Poland had the largest number of Jews in the world, i.e., three and a half million. Germany at the highest point had maybe six hundred thousand Jews in a country of 60 million. Hitler encouraged emigration, so that by 1939, when the war started, there were only 200,000 Jews in Germany. By comparison, out of thirty-some million Poles, you had three and a half million Jews, more than ten percent of the population. Richard Gull: You come from a small town in Poland named Miechow and your family was middle class. Dr. Emanuel Tanay: My father was a dentist and my mother was a physician dentist. There was a distinction in Poland. RG: September 1939 is when the Nazis came into Poland. What happened to you then? Bearing Witness - The Story of a Holocaust Survivor's Journey from Escape to Being a Forensic Psychiatrist Specializing in Homicide Emanuel Tanay, M.D., is the author of Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust and Legal Injustice: Behind the Scenes with an Expert Witnes I do not use the word \"evil\" because it contains too much religious zeal and because it interferes with having empathy, even for one's enemies, that might allow us to understand them and be ourselves survivors. It took a teenager to take risks and do certain things that an adult was not up to. I arranged through various contacts for us to escape from occupied Poland to Hungary.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 41 ET: On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland and within two weeks Poland was defeated. Most Jews attempted to flee, to go east, and my parents did, too. But the German army came from two directions. We had to return to our town. The extermination process did not begin until about late 1941. RG: How did you become separated from your parents? How old were you?ET: I was 14 years old when my mother, through an acquaintance, arranged for me to be accepted at a well-known monastery in Krakow, not as a Jew, but as a Pole. Polish Jews were not assimilated, unlike the German Jews, so it was very difficult for a Jew to pretend that he wasn't a Jew. But I came from an assimilated family, which meant that I spoke perfect Polish. It was the only language I knew at the time. I was already somewhat familiar with the Catholic practices. My father secured a birth certificate from a priest who was his patient. The birth certificate was in the name of Janek Wojcik. I entered the monastery under that name and studied for the priesthood. RG: So what was that experience like for you? ET: It was extremely difficult. I didn't know the prayers so I had to learn them. I was assigned to a choir but didn't know the songs, so I pretended by lip-syncing. Due to the constant danger of betrayal, my motivation to learn was quite high. I learned prayers in Latin, the history of the Church, and the Saints, and so on. But posing as another person was tricky. The birth certificate my father got was of a peasant boy my age who was born in a village. In Poland peasants spoke a peasant idiom, but I came from a cultured family and spoke a Polish that didn't go with my name. A good friend of mine in the monastery, about my age, was, like me, named Janek (John in English). In Poland you didn't celebrate birthdays. Instead you celebrated Name's Day, the celebration day of the saint who is your namesake. I made the mistake one time of assuming that my Name's Day was when John the Baptist's day was celebrated (my friend's namesake), whereas John Chrysostom (my namesake) is a different date. I did not know that my patron saint was John Chrysostom. This confusion nearly revealed my true identity. Ironically, I now know more about Catholicism than Judaism. RG: How did your time in the monastery end?ET: One of my teachers in the monastery, a really dedicated anti-Semite, preached often how wonderful it was that the Germans were getting rid of our Jews. After a year in the monastery (it was 1943), he approached me and asked me some questions and then corrected my pronunciation. And that was like a siren going off: he suspected, or knew, that I was a Jew. That very night I was afraid to sleep in my room, so I hid in the big bellows of the church organ. Incidentally, that whole episode was depicted in a documentary called Courage to Care, which was nominated for an Oscar. I escaped from the monastery and then lived on the run. I helped my mother, little sister, and my girlfriend, Gina (who now lives in Israel), escape from Poland. It took a teenager to take risks and do certain things that an adult was not up to. I arranged through various contacts for us to escape from occupied Poland to Hungary. RG: So your family saved you by getting you into the monastery and now you are the one helping family members and your girlfriend to escape. But in the meantime what happened to your father? ET: My father was educated in Vienna and spoke perfect German. He was placed in a labor camp located at the Nazi Air Force base. He had a dental office in the labor camp and treated not only the Poles who worked there but also the Germans. This was contrary to Nazi principles: a Jew was forbidden bodily contact with an Aryan. It was called Rassenschande, meaning race contamination. But they had no choice since they didn't have a dentist. For a Jew to be touching a German and working on his teeth was unheard of. My father had a dental assistant named Leon Storch. Leon developed typhus. A Jew who suffered typhus was \"treated\" by a bullet to the head. So my father hid Leon in his office and didn't report his illness. A Gestapo man, Amon Goeth (portrayed in Schindler's List by Ralph Fiennes), was in charge of all the Jews in the Krakow area. When Goeth discovered that Leon suffered typhus, he shot him on the spot. He then wanted to kill my father, but the head of the Air Force base, who had the rank of Major, ordered Goeth, who was a Captain, to leave my father alone. When this Major went on vacation, Amon Goeth came to the Air Force base, picked up my father, and took him to the Plaszow labor camp. He executed my father in front of the whole camp. RG: So you went with your mother, sister, and girlfriend Gina from Poland to Hungary? What was the journey like? ET: It was a real exploit. We had to cross the Tatra Mountains. As I said before, it took a teenager to function under these circumstances. At one point we had to cross a road and encountered a German patrol with dogs. Our guides, who were mountain people, escaped quickly. It seemed we had no chance of escape, but I noticed a ravine with a stream. I quickly pushed mother, sister, and Gina into the stream. Because I had read Karl May, who wrote about American Indians, I knew that walking upstream would prevent the dogs from finding us. The mountain people were conscientious enough to return the next day searching for us. To make a long story short, we made it to Hungary. That is where we were ultimately liberated in January 1945. Hungary at that time was like a paradise for Jews until March 1944 when the Germans occupied Hungary. Continued on page 42 \"Emek\" Tanay and his wife, Sandra, have been married for 41 years. I am not religious, nor were my parents religious. Even when I was in great danger, I did not turn to a higher power. Anita Rubin-Meiller, L.M.S.W. Integrative therapy for Body, Mind and Spirit Phone: 734-332-0669 Email: anita1018@sbcglobal.net 1935 Pauline Blvd.,Suite 200 Ann Arbor, MI 48103RG: After the liberation you returned to your home in Poland seeking your father. What was the journey back to Poland like? ET: Yes, I returned to my hometown. I rode on roofs of freight cars by tying myself to protrusions. I came searching for my father. I didn't know that he had been murdered until I returned. People who knew didn't tell me right away. Returning to Poland after the war was dangerous for a Jew. You have to keep in mind that in Poland there was tremendous anti-Semitism. The hatred of the Jews was so intense that it is difficult for an American to imagine. For example, when I was on false papers in Poland, a German couldn't distinguish me from a Pole. But a Pole might. When I came back to my hometown, our neighbor, Mrs. Wroblewska, begged me not to stay overnight, because they would kill me if I did. Many Jews were killed when they went back. This hatred of the Jews continued into the post-war communist era in Poland. Before the war, Jews were often accused of being communists; in the communist era, they were often accused of being capitalist sympathizers and were expelled. I resumed my false identity. I pretended not to be a Jew again. I returned to Budapest. RG: So you were liberated in Budapest. Where did you go after you were liberated? ET: I heard that in the occupied Germany there was now American zone, French zone, English zone. The American zone of Germany was the biggest. We went to Munich. It is bizarre, but we were perfectly safe in Germany and were given a place to live right away. There were displaced person camps, but my mother, sister, and I were not in one. The point is that no country wanted us. You couldn't go to United States; you couldn't go anyplace. Ironically, there was a Polish quota that was not oversubscribed. For the next six years we lived in Germany. I learned German. Eventually I attended medical school. I graduated from medical school and then we came to the United States because there was a new law passed called Displaced Persons Act allowing us to come to the United States. That's where I got my internship and psychiatric residency. RG: How did you become a well-known expert witness in murder trials?ET: While I was a psychiatric resident in Elgin State Hospital in Illinois in 1954, I had a patient named Alice, a teenager who was schizophrenic. She drowned a four-year-old boy. Because she was poor, the lawyer who defended her had no choice but to rely upon me as an expert witness. I knew very little about psychiatry at that time and my English was rudimentary. I began to study the subject and was successful in persuading the judge that she was insane. Lawyers came with other cases, even though I wasn't yet a full-fledged psychiatrist. The turning point in my forensic career came when I was asked to be an expert in the Jack Ruby case on a retrial (Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald). Then I became well known. RG: In your recent book about your career as a forensic psychiatrist and an expert witness, American Legal Injustice , you discuss the Jack Ruby case. Besides Ruby, you've been involved in a number of high profile cases like Ted Bundy, John Hinckley, Sam Sheppard, and Andrea Yates. In the case of Ted Bundy, you make the point that, unlike these others, Bundy was a psychopathic serial killer, which is rare. ET: Ted Bundy was a psychopathic serial killer who ultimately confessed to murdering 30 women. He may have killed as many as a hundred women. But these cases are very rare. Yet the more crime declines, the more people fear crime because television feeds this fear night after night. RG: Your book is in one sense a call to recognize the reality of mental illness and take it seriously in the law in a way it has not been. For example, the so-called insanity defense has virtually disappeared since the John Hinckley case, the would-be assassin of President Reagan. That Hinckley was sent to a mental institution was widely considered a failure of our justice system. But you defend the verdict in the Hinckley case. ET: There is no doubt that the verdict was fully justified. The jury did what a jury is supposed to do, namely, they applied the law. The insanity defense exists on paper, in the textbooks of law, but in reality it is nonexistent. It doesn't matter how psychotic a person may be. Andrea Yates drowned her five children and then called the police and told them that Satan told her to do it. If she was not insane, then who is? Yet the prosecution saw to it that she was declared sane. I stopped accepting insanity cases because I said it was taking money under false pretenses. The outcome, no matter how meritorious the case, no matter how effective I would be as an expert witness, would be a rejection of the insanity defense. RG: Yet many people in prison are mentally ill. ET: Not far from where we are now was Ypsilanti State Hospital where I worked for a while. It had 4,000 patients. You know what's on the grounds of the state hospital now? There is a \"correctional\" institution otherwise known as a prison. At one time, there were 600,000 psychotics in state hospitals. At this time, there are virtually no state hospitals, no mental institutions. All you have is psychiatric hospitals where a psychotic can be admitted for days, maybe weeks. It's not unusual for a psychotic to have been admitted 12, 14 times. Until he or she commits a crime and ends up in jail. Half of the prison population suffers from mental illness. So what has happened? We closed the state hospitals and replaced them by prisons. This is dreadful from a humanitarian point of view and ridiculous from a fiscal point of view. A psychotic person in prison cost $30-40,000 a year. The mental institutions were communities for the mentally ill. Patients worked there and had a setting suited to their needs. RG: Why do you think these mental institutions were done away with? They got a bad name as reflected in the 1976 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. ET: At the end of the Vietnam War, there were these idealistic liberals who, together with fiscal conservatives, got together and abolished the system. There was a lack of comprehension of what psychosis is. We have no cure for schizophrenia. The medications don't cure and don't even significantly change it. R.G.: You contributed a system of classifications of homicides to the psychiatric literature. E.T.: I proposed a classification of homicides based on personality structure. According to Freud, the anatomy of personality consists of the ego or self; The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 42 Bearing Witness - Continued from page 41 Forensic Psychiatrist Emanuel Tanay and Philosophy Professor Richard Gull. The turning point in my forensic career came when I was asked to be an expert in the Jack Ruby case on a retrial (Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald).I'm 83 years old and I have cancer. Reaching old age and dying of it is an achievement of which I am proud; it is achieved, not bestowed.the id or the unconscious; and the superego or conscience. Behavior consistent with one's personality is egosyntonic; behavior that is contrary to one's self-image is egodystonic. Behavior caused by psychosis is psychotic; a psychotic killing is motivated by delusions. A homicide (every killing of human by a human is a homicide) is egosyntonic when carried out in accordance with the conscious wishes of the actor. Examples would be a policeman killing a fleeing criminal or a soldier killing the enem y in war. An impulsive killing is usually egodystonic, contrary to the wishes of the individual. Most homicides are impulsive (or egodystonic in my terminology) and committed not by criminals but by people who know each other. R.G.: You argue in your book that Jack Ruby's killing of Oswald was impulsive. They did not know each other. Would you explain that? E.T.: There is convincing evidence that Ruby did not plan to be in the basement of the Dallas Police Department Headquarters contrary to the conspiracy theory that Ruby was part of a plot to silence Oswald. Ruby just happened along when the transfer of Oswald to the county jail was taking place. He had been running errands and had left his beloved dog Sheba in his car, which he would not have done knowing that he would be going to jail. And he always carried the concealed weapon that he used on Oswald. The famous elevator door opens and Ruby fires the fatal shot. Ruby's killing of Oswald was impulsive or egodystonic. RG: So both your early life and later life brought you into contact with killers. In your later life, you arrive at an analysis of acts of killing, like whether they are impulsive (or egodystonic) or the act of a sadistic psychopath, while in your early life you experienced first-hand another type of killing resulting from genocidal ideology. Was Amon Goeth, who murdered your father and many others, a psychopathic serial killer? E.T.: No, Amon Goeth, like most perpetrators of genocide, thought of himself as doing \"God's\" work. Genocides are always carried out in the name of a \"good\" or \"holy\" cause. Goeth's killings were egosyntonic for him. R.G.: But Goeth had the wrong God. His religion was Nazi ideology. Do you consider yourself to be a religious person? Are you a spiritual person? If one and not the other, how do you distinguish between the two in your own mind? E.T.: I am not religious, nor were my parents religious. Even when I was in great danger, I did not turn to a higher power. After the war, some orthodox Jews argued that non-orthodox Jews brought about the Holocaust. I find this perplexing. Being an amateur student of religion, I think that many bad things have been brought about by religion. Religion and ideology have inspired genocidal hatred. In 1915, in the Ottoman Empire, Armenian Christians became victims of genocide. It takes hatred to perpetrate genocide because genocide is killing people for no other reason than their identity. Nazi ideology declared that the lives of Jews are \"life unworthy of living.\" When the Israelites went to Canaan, the Canaanites did not just pick up and leave \u2014 they had to be killed. Most theologians agree that historically Christianity laid the foundations for the Holocaust starting in the 3 rd century A.D. when Christianity became the official religion of Rome. Christianity laid the foundations for the Holocaust by propagating a hatred for and persecution of the Jews. In November 1938, on Kristallnacht, Jewish shops were attacked in a pogrom in Germany and Austria and a hundred Jews were killed. It was a harbinger of things to come. The September 11 attacks may similarly be a harbinger of something larger \u2014 at worst a humanicide. But I remain an optimist, perhaps because of my experience of the Holocaust. I do not use the word \"evil\" because it contains too much religious zeal and because it interferes with having empathy, even for one's enemies, that might allow us to understand them and be ourselves survivors.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 43 If you did something to annoy me, I could express my anger directly to you and resolve the matter. But if your priest or rabbi tells you that you are not measuring up, you cannot express your anger directly because your religion cannot be the object of your anger. So this anger is suppressed and becomes rage. If rage, which must be expressed by some means, is suppressed, it comes out as hatred. Oppressed people need hated scapegoats as objects for their suppressed rage. Continued on page 44 180 Little Lake Dr. Ste. #1 / Ann Arbor off Jackson betw.

E.T.: I'm not sure what is meant by spiritual. Obviously, I am a person who pays attention to human feelings and intellectual reflections. I am interested in philosophical issues. In spite of my experience of the Holocaust, I am optimistic about the future. If you call that spiritual, then I am spiritual. R.G.: You have said that you don't like calling the perpetrators of genocides evil? What would you call that other side, that dark side, if not the force of evil? E.T.: I would call it a combination of oppression and hatred. Some religions and ideologies suppress rage and create hatred. If you are an orthodox Jew, your religion tells you which foot you are to put on the ground first when you wake up in the morning. If you are a devout Catholic, you don't engage in contraception. The most oppressive religions and ideologies control your life from A to Z. Many people willingly subject themselves to these rules because that is their religion or ideology. Yet they can never live up to the expectations. You are a sinner; you are unworthy. Or if you are a communist, you are never quite a totally good communist. If you did something to annoy me, I could express my anger directly to you and resolve the matter. But if your priest or rabbi tells you that you are not measuring up, you cannot express your anger directly because your religion cannot be the object of your anger. So this anger is suppressed and becomes rage. If rage, which must be expressed by some means, is suppressed, it comes out as hatred. Oppressed people need hated scapegoats as objects for their suppressed rage. RG: The song from South Pacific says that we have to be \"carefully taught to hate all the people our relatives hate.\" But your view is the opposite.ET: Yes, the opposite. You have to be carefully taught not to hate because you don't have to teach a child to project his or her rage. A little child runs into a table. Who does he blame? His mother. When he becomes an adult, if he hasn't really matured, he might now blame the Jews. So I say that anybody who has been an infant has the potential to be an anti-Semite, a hater. Certain religions and ideologies are breeding grounds of hate when they declare certain kinds of people to be unfit for living. Every genocide is committed in the name of a \"good\" cause. Hitler said he was protecting the Aryan race, whatever that is, from destruction by the Jews. Every genocide is presented as self-defense, because hated qualities are projected onto the groups that are its victims out of hatred. RG: As you look back on the events of 70 years ago, at the Holocaust, what are your current day thoughts and insights about that time in your life? Have there been any \"gifts\" that have emanated from that experience? ET: My friend Elie Wiesel, a well-known survivor, has said that he did nothing to survive. But I disagree with him. Every survivor is a hero. Every survivor needed resourcefulness and the courage to endure. These attributes made them successful in life after the war. It is true that we all suffered from what we now call post-traumatic stress syndrome. Another consequence of being a survivor is that I never read fiction.For myself, I have found that I have the ability to make good judgments about my family, my friends, my employees, my patients. I think my early experiences gave me an intuitive feel for people. I developed an intuitive sense of who to trust. Once, during that time, I had to entrust myself and members of my family to a Gestapo man who claimed to be a Serb in order to escape. Another gift is gratitude. Cicero said that gratitude is not only a virtue, it is the greatest of the virtues. I am grateful for all of the many people who helped me survive. Another attribute of survivors is that they are not haters. Hate was characteristic of the perpetrators, but not the survivors. My analyst thought it odd that I did not hate the Germans after the war. I explained to him that hatred would not have been useful for survival. Another consequence of being a survivor is that I never read fiction. In Germany, I once read an article in which the author wrote that my ability to empathize often fails me at the doorstep of my next-door neighbor, and yet fiction asks me to shed crocodile tears about some imaginary disasters. R.G.: Are there ironies and lessons from having worked professionally with forensic psychiatry after the murderous insanity that you witnessed first-hand on a societal scale? E.T.: I discovered studying homicides that they are perpetrated either by criminals or by people acting impulsively. There is a vast difference between the two groups. The people who were out to kill me were, they thought, acting in a noble cause. Most people are basically good, but one wouldn't know that by watching crimes enacted on television or in the movies. I believe in the goodness of human beings in spite of the fact of our history of slavery, genocide, and so on. The fact is that the civilization we have is based on cooperation. We all cooperate with each other. We focus on the \"evil\" deeds, but we would not be where we are without helpfulness, cooperativeness, call it love or anything you want. So there is this struggle between those two forces. I believe that the force of cooperation we observe in the animal kingdom has been perfected in homo sapiens and our civilization is based upon it. People who claim that some invisible hand of the market will make everything right are mistaken. It takes people who get together and form a community and a government, who are people of good will, for society to survive. R.G.: You came of age in a cruel, inhuman, and dark world. What is your view of Ann Arbor, where you now live? E.T: I was in Ann Arbor in the 50s in a post-graduate program while I worked at Ypsilanti State Hospital. I loved Ann Arbor then. So, when I retired 10 years ago, I decided to come back. I call it a mini-New York. It has some of the advantages of New York without many of the disadvantages. There are so many young people here who are enthusiastic. It is so encouraging to walk the streets and see the energy, the interest, and the future of this country. I inherited my optimism from my parents. My optimism, I believe, was necessary for my survival. And it is necessary for our survival as a civilization. I'm 83 years old and I have cancer. Reaching old age and dying of it is an achievement of which I am proud; it is achieved, not bestowed. In spite of the early misery inflicted on me, I have had a good life. I have had three children and have six grandchildren. My children are successful and optimistic, and I like to think I've passed that on to them. I've been happily married to my wife Sandra for 41 years. She was raised in Traverse City and had a rather strict Lutheran upbringing. She has, however, mastered the art of Jewish cooking.

And we've also asked Laz, Lori, and Eric to reflect on collaborating with Jeanne Mackey and what it means to \"come home.\" Lori Fithian, by Rachael WaringBy Jeanne Mackey This is how it feels when worlds collide. I'm in Oxford, Ohio, my hometown, rolling down High Street in a minivan with my life partner, Pattie, my 91-year-old mother, Marge, and three intrepid Ann Arbor musicians \u2014 Laz Slomovits, Lori Fithian, and her brother Eric. We picked up Mom from the assisted living apartment where she has lived since Dad died in 2002 and are headed for dinner at Kona's, the only restaurant in town that serves fresh, local cuisine. Mom's in the front seat chatting with Pattie, her walker stashed in the back of the van. During dinner Marge is uncharacteristically quiet. Her aging brain, slowed by the progression of dementia, can't track the lively conversation. Afterward, she confides to Pattie about the band \u2014 \"I don't know who those people are, but they're really nice.\" Pattie gently reminds her that we're all in town for my performance the next day. We pick up a copy of The Oxford Press to see their write-up of the show. Oxford Press articles from years past flash through my mind. Me with my brownie troop roasting a marshmallow over a fake campfire. Mom on the front page as Citizen of the Year. Brother Dave marching in the high school band. My toothy smile when I sold enough newspaper subscriptions to win a transistor radio. Actually, Mom sold most of the subs, secretly hoping that owning a radio would make me appear to be a normal teen. *** I decided a few years ago that I needed to create a performance piece to usher me through the threshold of turning 60 in 2010. I've got a good track record for dreaming up events and making them happen \u2014 benefit concerts, rites of passage ceremonies, creative play days, workshops. This 60th birthday big idea was a little riskier than most, however, because I had declared to friends and family that it would be a performance of all-original songs and stories. In the 50+ years I'd been playing music, I had written maybe two songs that I'd ever want to hear again. When I tried to write, I'd just hear snippets of other people's songs and would quickly get disgusted with myself and give up. The songwriting block is just a variation on a lifelong theme. I'm prone to lose touch with my own true impulses and ideas. I got the message early on that it was safer to let the grown-ups tell me how I should be feeling and acting. It was the 50s, after all. I really wanted to be a good girl \u2014 it felt like a matter of survival. And I had a primal yearning to be true to myself. My unsuccessful efforts to do both resulted in an awkward, tense, and timid demeanor in social settings. When I look at photos of my mom around the same age, she looks pretty gawky and shy herself \u2014 which is probably what made her so determined to have a socially successful daughter. But her efforts tended to backfire. I felt her lack of confidence in me (and herself) long before I could put it into words.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 46 Bringing It All Back Home An Ann Arbor Songwriter, Musician, and Community-Builder Returns to the Small Town of Her Youth to Sing Her Life Song In Stacie's What's the Story workshop, she managed to shake something loose by challenging me to go off and \"write a bad song.\" I came back with a doozy and shared it with the story circle \u2014 a process that somehow opened my secret passageway to songwriting. Photo by Rachael WaringAfterward, people line up to hug and congratulate me and the band. Mom comes wheeling up from behind. \"I'm so proud of you!\" she says. \"You made me laugh and cry. That was just terrific!\" She delivers the punch line with a grin: \"I didn't know you had it in you.\" So quintessentially Marge, with a level of honesty made possible only by her current level of dementia. \"I know you didn't, Mom.\" I feel her fragility as we embrace. The old lady is loath to get sentimental, but there's a catch in her voice as she tells me, \"I'm glad I lived to see this. I had to leave home to find my own way. And when I did, it was in the context of the social justice movements of the 60s and 70s. My friends and I were the good guys, fighting the evil establishment. It was glorious! Mom took it even harder than Dad when I revealed my disdain for their basic values. I tried to engage her in principled debates, but she was crafty when threatened. If I started to win the argument, she'd inevitably burst into tears, and that was the end of the conversation. But I was wrong about my parents' values. Turns out they cared more about staying connected than being right. Both raised as conservative Republicans, they were willing to re-examine their beliefs, given half a chance. My dad, a Miami University professor, became an advocate for affirmative action and women's equality on campus. Mom joined Planned Parenthood and began speaking in college dorms, gleefully passing around multi-colored birth control devices (she has always enjoyed shocking people). An avid miniaturist, she coped with her kids' lifestyle choices by creating a tiny hippie pad, complete with bongs, a waterbed, beaded curtains, and Nixon's picture on the little toilet seat. Her resilience was impressive \u2014 and she would need it even more in a few years when I started seeing a psychotherapist and decided that all my insecurities were Mom's fault. When she found out I was a lesbian, she told me tearfully, \"If you have decided that you hate men, I don't even want to hear it!\" But I hadn't. And in 1990 when I married Pattie, my soul mate, Mom and Dad wholeheartedly welcomed her into the family. *** After dinner, we drop Mom off at her apartment and prepare to rehearse for the next evening's show at the Oxford Community Arts Center. I have successfully created a performance piece of original songs and stories, expertly coached throughout the process by my old friend Stacie Chaiken, an actor, playwright, and teacher who lived in a feminist group house with me back in college. In Stacie's What's the Story workshop, she managed to shake something loose by challenging me to go off and \"write a bad song.\" I came back with a doozy and shared it with the story circle \u2014 a process that somehow opened my secret passageway to songwriting. The song arrangements blossomed in collaboration with Laz, Lori, and Eric. I recorded most of the tunes in Eric's Electric Farm Studio in Dexter (complete with crowing rooster on the final track) and released a CD. After we premiered the show in Ann Arbor last November, I knew the next stop would be the old hometown. But now that the show is only a day away, I'm feeling queasy. \"You'll pull it off just fine,\" Pattie reassures me. \"You've never been one to sabotage yourself.\" But she didn't know me when I lived in this town. The many times I backed myself into a corner. The social situations where I tried to converse with somebody who intimidated me \u2014 which included almost everyone \u2014 and watched their facial expression morph from confusion to disinterest. I know myself to be capable of clutching on stage. That evening, I peek from behind the curtains as the audience members come into the theatre and take their seats: Jan, my best friend from high school; the Trumps, our across-the-street neighbors of fifty years; another friend of the family whom I last saw at one of my parents' bridge parties in the 70s. Mom rolls in with her walker, accompanied by my brother, sister-in-law, niece, and nephew. The lights go down, Pattie introduces me, and I walk out on stage. My frightened 14-year-old self is whispering frantically, \"You can't do this; you don't know how!\" But I know something that she, frozen in time, will never learn. I've grown up! I have the chops, the will, the heart, and the inner resources to deliver the goods, to put the show across and make it sing. And I do: \"There's no time to hesitate, contemplate, meditate. Tell my tale, it's getting late!\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 47 Drop the Knife Once a young woman asked the 14th century Sufi mystic and poet, Hafiz, \"What is the sign of someone knowing God?\" Hafiz remained silent for a few moments and looked deep into the young person's eyes, then said, \"Dear, they have dropped the knife. They have dropped the cruel knife so often used upon their tender self and others.\"Photo by Rachael Waring \"But I was wrong about my parents' values.

As you've been working with Jeanne on \"Drop the Knife,\" what's been stirred up for you? Laz Slomovits: There is a story in \"Drop the Knife\" where Jeanne tells of burying a hatchet on her ancestral land in Ireland, as a way of lifting a curse and making peace in her family. This is something she actually did a number of years ago, and she told me about it just before I was about to take a trip to my ancestral home in Hungary. I found the image very powerful, and though I did not use that specific way of resolving old issues in my ancestry, it helped me find my own way. In general, I've long admired Jeanne's courage in looking to find a way to live a meaningful, conscious life \u2014 and \"Drop the Knife,\" and the insights into her life which she talks about in her essay, feel like she's reached a new high point in honesty, clarity, and self-acceptance. Working with her on the performance piece has inspired me to continue going deeper in my understanding of my own life. Where were you raised? Did you like being raised in that town or city? Do you remember your childhood fondly? Do you ever go back to that place? Laz Slomovits: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, to parents who had both been through the Holocaust, had lost many family members, met after the war and tried to start a new life. When my twin brother and I were eight years old, we left Hungary with our parents during the 1956 Revolution. This was just 11 years after World War II, and they saw more of the same coming. I have mostly pleasant memories of growing up in Budapest, and even the Revolution, terrifying to my parents, seemed like some kind of war game to my brother and me. What was not pleasant was the day a Russian official came into our 2 nd grade classroom and asked the teacher \"Who are those monkeys with the beanies?\" (My brother and I wore yarmulkes, skull caps, to school \u2014 our father was a Cantor in several Budapest synagogues.) The teacher answered, \"They are among my best students.\" The official responded, \"Flunk them.\" (To her credit, our teacher did not do that \u2014 she gave us B's and tearfully told our mother that she was very sorry she had to do that.) In addition to this, my father saw not only his livelihood, but his whole way of life threatened once again, and so our family left with two suitcases. Looking back, and how my life has been able to unfold in America, I feel that was a bargain. My brother and I didn't go back to Budapest until both our parents had passed away, just a few years ago, more than 50 years after we left Hungary. We found the apartment complex where we'd lived as children, went to the synagogues where our father had sung (one of them, the Doh\u00e1ny Templom, is the largest synagogue in Europe, where we remember playing in the organ loft while our father sang below), visited some of my mother's favorite places (she'd grown up in Budapest, and the week before we left, she took us to these places saying, \"I want you to remember these because we may not be back for a long time.\"), the cemeteries where my mother's parents were buried, and the small town where my father lived with his first family before the war . It was obviously a very emotional visit on many levels \u2014 I wanted to find a way to connect to my family roots, but also to make peace within myself with the Hungarians who had stood by or actively helped the Nazis during the war . This is where having the image and ritual of Jeanne \"burying the hatchet\" was very helpful. I knew my way would have something to do with music, but I didn't know how.My brother and I had made our hotel reservation based on two factors: that it'd be near the heart of Budapest (so we wouldn't have to spend a lot of time traveling to visit sites important to our family) and that it'd be very af fordable. Later we realized that the hotel we were staying in was in the old Jewish Quarter of the city, which had been turned into the Jewish ghetto during the war. Part way into our visit, looking at maps of the city as it had been during the war, we realized we were within a few blocks, on the same street, where our mother had been held in the ghetto before being deported to Ravensbruck, the concentration camp where she spent the rest of the war. In fact, that street marked the edge of the ghetto \u2014 barricaded, with signs saying that no one could enter or leave on pain of death. I stood on this street and thought about my mother held captive in that building, while across the street people were free to come and go as they pleased. I tasted the bitterness of that in my mouth \u2014 and knew that I did not want to hold on to that any longer \u2014 not for myself, not for my mother, not for anyone on either side of that street, living or dead. The only instrument I had brought with me on the trip was a small wooden flute, a Hungarian furulya. On the day before we were to return from Budapest, I stood in a corner of the building, with traffic flowing by me on the street and on the sidewalk, and started to play a tune that I made up as I went along. I tried to allow all the feelings that were welling up to come into the melody \u2014 the terror, the rage, the hatred, the grief \u2014 and to ask that they be transformed into forgiveness and peace. I can't explain what happened as I played, but I knew as I started to cry that somehow, somewhere, this tiny offering was being heard and accepted. My father saw not only his livelihood, but his whole way of life threatened once again, and so our family left with two suitcases. Looking back, and how my life has been able to unfold in America, I feel that was a bargain. We realized we were within a few blocks, on the same street, where our mother had been held in the ghetto before being deported to Ravensbruck, the concentration camp where she spent the rest of the war.Photo by Rachael WaringI have since found that what happened in those few minutes was a beginning. I am still learning to release old grievances and fears. But it was a beginning. And I'm committed to continuing. Do you go to high school r eunions? How have they been for you? Have you been surprised in any way by encountering your past? If you haven't gone, why not? Laz Slomovits: After we left Hungary in early 1957, we lived in Israel for three years before we moved to the United States. I grew up in Kingston, New York, went to school at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, met Helen who was to become my wife when I was a senior, and a year later we moved to Ann Arbor so Helen could go to graduate school here. We thought we'd be here a year or two \u2014 and have never left. In a very real sense, I feel like my life started when I met Helen and I found home and community when we moved to Ann Arbor. So, this may seem like a long preamble to answering the question, but no, I have not been to either high school or college reunions. Although I had a few good friends in both high school and college, I feel like I did not really start waking up and living the life I felt was mine until I after I left those places \u2014 and the connections to the old friendships did not feel possible to maintain in any deep way. Are you at all in touch with people from the part of your childhood that you spent in the United States, and if so, do you like that sense of connection with your roots? Laz Slomovits: I have some wonderful memories and a great deal of gratitude for some of my teachers and coaches, both in high school and in college, almost all of whom have passed away, as have most of the members of my childhood family. There is one quite elderly Hungarian couple who still lives in Kingston who became my parents' best friends when we arrived in this country. They were very helpful and kind to us then, and we've maintained a sweet phone connection on a regular basis. In a sense, they are my only link to my \"old life\" and I enjoy talking to them as I might to the grandparents I never knew. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 49 What does it mean to you to \"come home\"? Laz Slomovits: I am very grateful to Ann Arbor \u2014 the various communities I am part of, and everything the city has to offer. This has been home for most of my adult life, where I've been supported, nourished, and stimulated in my work and in my spiritual seeking. I have a dear wife and son that I cherish, a brother with whom I've played music all these years and still consider my best friend, his wife and daughter who I feel closer to than I felt to my blood family growing up \u2014 I couldn't possibly ask for more from a family . I have some wonderful friends, especially in music (like Jeanne, Lori, and Eric) that I feel close to. To me, all of this adds up to \"coming home.\" And yet, in a very real sense, all of this means \"home\" because of what I started to glimpse in my early twenties \u2014 that there was a \"home\" that was within me \u2014 and everything else on the \"outside\" followed from that. I am still learning what it means to come home \u2014 but I know more and more that for me it happens on the inside, and then is reflected in the place where I live, the people I connect to, the work that I do. And while it's not always easy \u2014 the distractions and wanderings are many \u2014 I can come back to this true home any time, all the time. I can't explain what happened as I played, but I knew as I started to cry that somehow, somewhere, this tiny offering was being heard and accepted.

I have more a sense of connection with the \"place,\" not so much the people. I suppose if I was on Facebook I might know more about all those high school people. What does it mean to you to \"come home\"? Lori Fithian: I think I feel most like I've \"come home\" when I'm with my chosen and original family, when we have reunions, just being in that \"nest\" of people who love me. It doesn't really matter where we are. It seems pretty different from most of the folks I know, who've left their hometowns and still have a place to go back to, like Jeanne.Three Ann Arbor Musicians \u2014 Laz Slomovits, Lori Fithian, and Eric Fithian \u2014 on Collaborating with Jeanne Mackey and What It Means to \"Come Home\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 50 Drummer Lori Fithian As a collaborating musician on Jeanne Mackey's performance piece \"Drop the Knife,\" you've had to consider what it means to \"come home.\" What speaks to you in this piece and in Jeanne Mackey's \"Bringing It All Back Home\" essay? As you've been working with Jeanne on \"Drop the Knife,\" what's been stirred up for you? Lori Fithian: I'm really impressed with Jeanne's creativity. The songs are just amazing \u2014 I keep wanting to ask her \"how did you come up with that tune?\" Her clever lyrics and the amazing storytelling really make for a wonderful musical evening \u2014 a deep personal journey woven together with great music that's fun to play. It's been great to see and hear the audience reacting. The process of shaping the raw songs with \"the band\" was also lots of fun, and a good challenge. I thought it would be like painting on somebody else's painting, but Jeanne welcomed our ideas, suggestions, and changes, and it was truly a collaborative process with all four of us contributing. I think it's stirred up a little more creative juice in me \u2014 she is very inspiring! Where were you raised? Did you like being raised in that town? Do you remember your childhood fondly? Do you ever go back to that place? Lori Fithian: I was actually born here in A2, in what's now called the North Ingalls Building \u2014 it 's the old \"St. Joe's\" hospital, so I'm definitely a native and a townie. Ann Arbor is a great place to grow up, and, yes, I have lots of fond memories. We lived on the edge of Thurston Pond, on the north end of town, and we often go over there to take a walk in the woods, see how the pond has changed, peer over the fence at the pool where we spent most of our summer days, and swing in the old swing set at the school. Do you go to high school reunions? If you haven't gone, why not?Lori Fithian: Haven't been to any of those. I'm pretty out of touch with anyone from high school, even though I was pretty involved in the band/ orchestra community. I was actually pretty shy and awkward back then, probably a bit like Jeanne. Are you at all in touch with people from your childhood \u2014 your childhood friends, your close relatives, neighbors, teachers, coaches \u2014 and if so, do you like that sense of connection with your roots \u2014 your childhood and young adulthood? Lori Fithian: Well, since I live here, I do run into folks from the old neighborhood, especially during art fair. But I wouldn't say I'm close to anyone from back then. My one friend who goes back to 2 nd grade, Vera, lives out in Oregon now, and I keep in touch with her over email and visit with her I thought it would be like painting on somebody else's painting, but Jeanne welcomed our ideas, suggestions, and changes - Lori Fithian on contributing to \"Drop the Knife\" I think I feel most like I've \"come home\" when I'm with my chosen and original family, when we have reunions, just being in that \"nest\" of people who love me.It's been great to see and hear the audience reacting.

As a collaborating musician on Jeanne Mackey's performance piece \"Drop the Knife,\" you've had to consider what it means to \"come home.\" What speaks to you in this piece and in Jeanne Mackey's \"Bringing It All Back Home\" essay? As you've been working with Jeanne on \"Drop the Knife,\" what's been stirred up for you? Eric Fithian: I ha ve only known Jeanne for the past few years, having been introduced at one of my sister Lori's house jams. In that time I have come to really admire her for her talent and determination in doing all this. It's one thing to write a couple of songs about some personal history, but this show! This show really takes the audience (including the band members!) on an amazing trip through life as seen through Jeanne's eyes and heart. What speaks to me, in particular, is Jeanne's writing: very literal verses and choruses, put together, not simply poetically for the sake of the song, but also in a way that really explains things clearly. The story pieces are particularly engaging. While the band is working on the \"mood\" and setting the scenes with music, she sets a visual scene in the imagination. Having worked with Jeanne on the CD production, learning how to get the best from each other, good days and not so good, pulling and pushing for just the right sound and mood, we got to know each other better and were able to really work together creatively to put these wonderful show pieces into an arrangement that could be enjoyed whenever, not just on the stage. What was \"stirred up\" is a realization that life can be so much more than we usually make it. Sometimes getting caught up in day-to-day survival, we lose some perspective. Jeanne's words and music about her searches for who she is reminds us that it is a big world out there, full of answers to our questions of who we are individually, historically, socially, and so on. Her stories tell us to get out there and find them. Where were you raised? Did you like being raised in that town? Do you remember your childhood fondly? Do you ever go back to that place? Eric Fithian: My f amily finally settled in 1964 at the northeast corner of Ann Arbor, in a newly developed subdivision. I could not have imagined a better childhood for anyone! We had free rein of the whole area; things seemed so safe and free. A big pond with tons of frogs, turtles, and fish, with a large wooded area right in our back yard! And, of course , many new construction sites to go to and get into trouble with our friends. I go back and visit \"the woods\" when I can, venturing around the pond, trying to remember our trails and landmarks from 40+ years ago! A lot has evolved since that simple time. Do you go to high school reunions? How have they been for you? If you have gone, what has been most meaningful for you about being there? What has been hardest? Have you been surprised in any way by encountering your past? If you haven't gone, why not? Eric Fithian: I w ent to the 20, 25 and 30th Huron High School class reunions for the Class of '78. Had a blast, laughed a lot, caught up a bit, then went home. There are some special friends I like to see at the events, but we don't really stay in contact. What was most meaningful was seeing people that I did not really hang with back in high school and being able to strike up new connections, reminiscing, getting little bits of gossip here and there, but mostly just enjoying them as peers, not worrying about cliques or other factors that used to block me from engaging socially. Seeing those that seemed to have it all back then now struggling with serious issues like addiction, illnesses, and so on, is the hardest part of going. I'm not so surprised at encountering my past, but I enjoy the surprise of how many people from that past remember me so well!

Eric Fithian: A ctually, not so much. I often think about my friends growing up on Bluett Road, or former band mates and musician friends, but have never really tried to get together or really communicate. Maybe sometime, when the 'day-to-day' slows down a bit! What does it mean to you to \"come home\"?Eric Fithian: I think just what Jeanne said, to bring your accomplishments and successes, struggles, trials and tribulations, back to the place and people who knew you \"when.\" Maybe they had an idea of who you were, what you could do. Maybe they thought you couldn't, who knows? But you bring it back to show 'em: \"You had it in you.\" Know what I mean , Jeanne?!! What speaks to me, in particular, is Jeanne's writing: very literal verses and choruses, put together, not simply poetically for the sake of the song, but also in a way that really explains things clearly. The story pieces are particularly engaging.

Photo by Rachael WaringThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 52 What would you think if your doctor said you should be eating \"People Chow\"? The doctor explained that People Chow was a complete and balanced food, with all the nutrients you or any person needed. And it was cheaper and more convenient than real food! People Chow should be eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You shouldn't eat anything else, and if you did, it might cause a problem. You probably would not follow this advice. What we choose to eat can reflect our nutritional, environmental, and other personal values. How and what we eat is also based on our available time, interests, and resources. We also choose food based on cravings. When we feel like we \"need\" an orange or ice cream, we can eat an orange or some ice cream. We like food and want to enjoy the tastes and textures of different foods. We know that fresh food is better than processed food. We know that every meal we eat is not perfectly balanced, but hope that overall we will come close to having a balanced diet. We may also take supplements to ensure we are getting everything we need. So how do we make food decisions for our dogs and other pets? Most people simply reach for a bag of dog kibble off the grocery store shelf. We have been programmed to believe that \"dog food\" is not just the best thing for our pets to eat; it's the only thing they should eat. Variety and \"people food\" are not simply unnecessary; they are \"bad\" and possibly dangerous. Because we love our dogs and want to do what is best for them, we follow this advice. Until relatively recently, dogs ate only \"people food,\" or what is generally known simply as food! After World War II, companies realized they could make use of waste products from the human food industry to make commercial pet food. Grain dealers found a market for moldy, contaminated products. Slaughterhouses were able to sell their \"4-D\" animals: those that are dead, dying, diseased, or disabled, and other animals unacceptable for human consumption. Many of these animals had been given drugs, including antibiotics, hormones, and even euthanasia solution. These raw materials were just the starting point. In much of commercial pet food production, high temperatures required for rendering, baking, and other processing denatures and depletes most of any whole food nutrients initially present, while, unfortunately, many drugs and other toxins can survive these conditions. Synthetic vitamins and minerals are then added to make the diet complete. Manufacturers acknowledged that fresh, real food was better for dogs, but had shown dogs would eat and could live on commercial food. The advantages of these new commercial foods were touted as cost and convenience. A perfect storm of rapid growth in the agribusiness, food processing, and advertising industries following WWII contributed to the pet food industry gaining control of how we thought about our pet's nutritional needs. Originally sold as cheap and convenient, we were now told this was the best and healthiest way to feed our dogs. There is little question that dogs can survive eating only dried kibble. But these dogs probably do not have great energy, healthy coats, good disease resistance, and low incidence of chronic diseases, such as allergies, recurrent ear infections, immune mediated diseases, and cancer. Many people accept these as the \"normal\" condition of today's pets, and bring out the antibiotics and steroids when there is a flare up. Still, many others have seen for themselves the huge difference that better nutrition makes, seeing changes such as renewed vigor, better breath, and even natural resistance to fleas. All pet foods are not created equal. While you can be pretty sure cheap food will be of poor quality, you cannot be sure that expensive foods are of higher quality. \"Premium\" and \"natural\" are marketing slogans and bear no relation to the product's contents. Healthy-sounding names or pictures of fruits and vegetables on the package reflect marketing, not nutrition. Some very recognizable, high priced so-called \"premium brands\" are anything but. Fortunately, there are a number of good brands that use human quality raw ingredients. You'll find that the best foods come from companies you've never heard of; companies that do not advertise in mainstream media and are not found in grocery or big box stores. Beware of anyone who tells you what the \"best\" food is, because what may work best for one dog is not necessarily the best for another. Smaller independent pet stores or specialty health food stores are a good resource for information. Go online. Add some canned food, which is less heavily processed. Consider using dehydrated foods, which are dried at lower temperatures and preserve more whole nutrients. You might also try feeding some fresh vegetables \u2014 a lot of dogs love carrots! Or, you might use a combination of high quality pet food and fresh, whole foods. Switch up the commercial food, brands, and flavors. Variety is good for nutrition and makes our pets' lives more interesting. You may want to add a supplement, preferably one that is whole food based. Use common sense. Remember that dogs should not be fed grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, caffeine or chocolate. Dark, higher quality European chocolate is most dangerous. Many people have decided to prepare their own dog food. If you do decide to be responsible for more of your dog's diet, do a little research (I would not recommend making food for a puppy unless you are willing to do a lot of research). Remember that while every meal does not need to be balanced, the overall diet does. Use a good supplement. There are many books and websites dedicated to canine nutrition. I recommend starting with Dr. Susan Wynn (susanwynn.com) and Dr. Richard Pitcairn (drpitcairn.com). Adding variety and fresh foods to your dog's diet will bring better health to them and much joy to both of you.

Kovach, Ph.D. A mother and her toddler began their journey through the market around the same time as I did. I was immediately impressed at the mother's ability to negotiate the competing needs of her toddler's wish for attention and the task of shopping as they walked up and down the aisles. The mother talked to her toddler, pointing out the various labels and reading the ingredients in such a compelling way that I found myself interested in what she was reading. What seemed like a wonderful solution was the beginning of an interaction we have all seen or taken part in. Nearing the third or fourth aisle, the toddler's interest in the boxes began to oscillate rapidly between disinterest and a desire to hold the objects. \"Have that?\" was a frequent refrain to which the mother answered, \"No, we don't need that.\" The mother, beginning to look a little frazzled, offered her child a toy and some snacks, redirecting the toddler's attention to what they had with them. For a time, the offers of toys and snacks contained the emotional overload, and mother and child marshaled on. As I continued my shopping, I occasionally heard the mother directing her child to notice something on one of the shelves by inquiring if her toddler could find the red can or the blue box. As luck would have it, they completed their journey around the same time as I did. It was at the checkout that the now fatigued mother and child began an easily recognizable interaction. The toddler wanted candy and, by this point, had become loud and insistent that her demands be met. Leaning toward the candy counter, she was able to snag one of the chocolate bars, and so took matters into her own hands. She wanted something and at that moment the something she wanted looked like candy. The toddler could no longer look at all the shelves of colorful items without taking action. The mother, looking more frazzled and slightly embarrassed, asked the toddler to give up the candy, reminding her they have candy at home and snacks with them. Holding tight to the candy, the toddler insisted that she found what she wanted and became even more distraught when her mother put the candy back. In retrospect, it appears the mother's desire to complete her own task left her vulnerable to forgetting that her method would set up a desire in the toddler to have what she saw. It is easy in shopping centers or groceries for both adults and children to become overwhelmed and feel needy because everything in the store is set up to entice. Although the mother read the labels with enthusiasm to entertain her child, it likely increased the toddler's desire to have what was outside of the cart. Then in the checkout line, when the toddler asserted an independent and creative solution to wanting something outside of what she and her mother could supply, the mother was unable to empathize with her daughter's solution. I also wondered if the toddler wanted to shop and put things in the basket, as mommy had. Watching the interaction, I was reminded of news articles I have read debating if grocery stores should remove candy from the checkout counters or place the candy at a level not visible to a child in a shopping cart. While these can be valuable solutions that take into consideration how difficult it is for children to see something and not touch, it is also worth considering what the child and mother are really in need of, desiring, and what has led up to it. We can all identify with a parent who wants a few more minutes to finish a task. A parent's competing desires can result in an over estimation of what can be emotionally tolerated by a child at any age. In this, and similar instances, remembering the child's capacity to wait, the stimulation of a grocery store, particularly a store that sells items other than groceries, and the number of invitations to reach out and explore are important considerations to keep in mind when embarking on the adventure. Remembering that toddlers and even older children enjoy exploring their world through tactile means, as well as moving about freely and being part of the excitement, can help us consider ways to make shopping adventures remain fun. Remembering how it felt when you were little can help bring the focus back to what you want to offer your child and what works for both of you. Sometimes taking a few minutes to play with a familiar toy or redirecting the child's attention to his or her own pretty clothes or something they share with you can help decrease the external stimulation. Asking the toddler to help you place items in the basket keeps them engaged while satisfying the need to touch. Taking a few moments to rest or ending the trip before you would like can also be a good enough solution. It may also be in the best interest of both mother and child for mother to take a shopping trip alone. This gives both mother and child a time to do something different and come back together with renewed enthusiasm. Even with planning, it is at times impossible to predict how your child might react on any given day. A child's capacity to self-soothe or be soothed depends on many factors related to the child's changing developmental capacities and your own emotional state and awareness. The parent's ability to maintain a sense of calm and use a child's actions as a form of communication is influenced and complicated by how the parent was parented. Recalling how our parents handled these situations is part of remembering what led up to our solutions and our automatic responses. Some parents are also more prone to becoming anxious or angry when they feel helpless or incapable of helping their child. Talking with friends, being involved with toddler groups and caring preschools, or seeking an outside consultation can assist parents in becoming more aware and accepting of the constitutional and historical factors that will help make the adventures of parenting sweeter for everyone.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 57 Music and Parenting: Somewhat Like A Symphony By Gari Stein Photos by Susan AyerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 58 By Gari Stein Photos by Susan Ayer Music For Little Folks, founded in 1993, is a community music school, based in traditional music, for children birth through 5 years old and the grown-ups who love them. Working at a local pre-school, I saw the power of music go way beyond the fun factor. With a wish and a prayer, I ventured out on my own to take music into early childhood settings throughout Washtenaw County. Branching out to provide family classes, I observed much more happening when singing and dancing than the music. Not just with the children, but with the grown-ups, too. Big toes were tapping next to little toes. Folks were smiling and relaxing. Alongside the music making, I found myself conducting a symphony of parenting. Class time aside, articles are shared and impromptu discussions spring up. Space is always found for newcomers who are welcomed with open arms. Resources to introduce them to the community are gladly provided. My little music school became a safe, warm environment, inviting friendships and playgroups to form. Support and networking play a big role in our time together. Folks return with 2 nd, 3rd and even more siblings. When the time comes to move on, there are tears and heartfelt sadness from the children and the adults. \"An important event of community,\" \"Our time together reminds me that there is still peace and calm in the world\" - I love the sound of these comments from two moms. Families from many backgrounds arrive with their own style of parenting. Some folks hover and fret. Introverts are coaxed out, while extroverts are reigned in. Some folks are laid back, giving children space, letting them be. Often adults label their child as shy, while I prefer slow to warm up. Some folks seem less secure in their parenting roles, having high expectations of behavior or performance. Some are just simply uncomfortable with the idea of movement.Music and Parenting: Somewhat Like A Symphony \"Music can be your best friend. A simple song can help slow things down, bring everyone together, and give your children a gift of lifelong memories.\" Gari Stein of Music For Little Folks \"With parents being their child's first and favorite toy, making music together is a time to be fully enjoyed\"\"Accepting children where they are developmentally and not comparing them to other children will go a long way.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 59 The first rule is to always be prepared for the unexpected. First timers are given a handout of helpful hints and tips to enable the flow of the class. I instill a sense of silence in between activities. This gives the children time to process what they have just heard and make the transitions calm and productive. Children come away confident, with new musical and social skills \u2014 turn taking, being part of a group, and having a safe vehicle for self-expression. Participation is a hot topic. Most children are kinesthetic learners. Some learn by doing, some by watching. I have to remind the adults that observation is a valid form of participation. Often parents want to see results with the child doing, doing, doing. I find the child that sits and just watches, taking it all in, may get more out of the program than the child that is doing, doing, doing. Children should be able to join in when they are ready. I gently encourage but never push. Accepting children where they are developmentally and not comparing them to other children will go a long way. As a young parent, I realized I had to accept my children for what they were not, as much as for what they were. This breakthrough, while they were still young, saved us all a lot of therapy. As an educator and grandmother, I have a lot of opinions on parenting. With parents being their child's first and favorite toy, making music together is a time to be fully enjoyed. I ask my families, for 60 minutes a week, to leave their expectations at the back door, to let their children be and experience the music in their own way and on their own time frame. Sounds simple, but this can be difficult, especially with so much pressure and hype from the media to make our children smarter and faster. It helps to remember that these children are only 1-2-3-4-5 years old. Shouldn't childhood be a journey, not a race? What's the hurry? Over the years, folks have thanked me for lightening their load by giving them some easy and effective parenting tools.If I see an adult struggling, I will take them aside and offer some suggestions to make the time together more enjoyable. I emphasize that they are the parent, but this is my experience and perhaps they might give it a try. Some are able, some simply cannot, and the beat goes on. Often there are cultural mores that affect the way the parent interacts. What is the main goal of the program? Fun, of course, but this is serious music making. The fun can't happen if the adults are chit chatting with each other. The children can't listen to me or to the music if their adult is talking to them. To help with this listening process, we put on our listening ears, and zip zip zip our lips. Listening skills are critical for learning and even the babies learn to listen. Our society has become very visually oriented, with babies being put in front of computers younger and younger. Research tells us this is not good for brain or visual development. Making music requires no expense and can transform cranky to calm in an instant, helping parents get through challenging situations. Everyone is busy. Music can be your best friend. A simple song can help slow things down, bring everyone together, and give your children a gift of lifelong memories. So, when all else fails, try singing and dancing. It really works! Put on a waltz and bring out the scarves. Share laughter, hugs and more. ### Gari Stein is the founder and director of Music For Little Folks (little-folks- music.com) in Ann Arbor and has 30 years of experience with early childhood education.

Betsy says, \"She is still riveting for my kids!\" When she's playing the music, Betsy has a front-row view of the performance and the audience's reactions to Laura's storytelling. She describes how Laura \"has a dynamic range and a variety of different voices. She also uses her body with great success.\" Whether Laura is a bumbling bear or a fairy princess, it is not just her voice, but also her body, that transforms. The co-artistic director of the Wild Swan Theater, Sandy Ryder, has known Laura for approximately 20 years. Sandy says, \"Laura is an amazing person and an incredible storyteller. She can bring puppets to life in a way that no one else can.\" Sandy adds that Laura \"gets inside the story with her voice, with her smile, with her presence,\" which keeps the audience hooked. Rohit Setty and his seven-year-old daughter, Shalini, started attending Laura's Storytimes when Shalini was 18 months old. He says, \"Both Shalini and I are still captivated by each and every story that Laura tells and the way she tells them.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 60 By Karen Foulke Larson It is 10:45 on a Wednesday morning, and kids and their grown-ups are streaming into the downtown branch of the Ann Arbor District Library. Some children arrive in strollers or in their mothers' arms. Others are walking, and a few are even running toward the cheerful story corner of the youth department. By 11:00 a.m. the crowd of toddlers, infants, parents, grandparents, and daycare providers has grown to over 60 people who are eagerly anticipating Preschool Storytime. Laura welcomes the crowd with her smile, friendly greetings, and the warmth in her voice. Some of them are visiting for the first time, but most are return visitors, with high expectations for the stories and songs. The enthusiasm is visible in their faces as children and adults greet \"Miss Laura.\" Miss Laura is Laura Pershin Raynor, a nationally known storyteller and a youth librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library. Storytime begins and a roomful of children and grown-ups become the rain (\"pitta-patta, pitta-patta\") and the wind (following Laura's arm movements). They sew with words and movements (\"snip, snip, snip\" and \"stitch, stitch, stitch\") following Laura's melodic voice. For this session, Laura leads all the songs and the dances, and gives kids the opportunity to move around in between the stories. Other days, Storytime includes the accompaniment of professional musicians.Storyteller Laura Pershin Raynor ~ A Gift to the Community Laura says that, after being in school all day, the kids wanted to play and not sit still. So she had them act out stories, put on finger plays, and even repeat silly back-and-forth rhymes. Years after Ann Arbor's young people have outgrown Storytime, they still remember Laura...One young man in a Pioneer High School letter jacket saw her and shouted, \"Story Lady!\" Laura laughs, \"For a second, he forgets that he is cool, and the wall comes down. Then he looks around, embarrassed.\" Laura Pershin Raynor Laura Pershin Raynor performs at storytelling festivals across the country, but her biggest impact may be in Ann Arbor where she has been a positive literary influence on thousands of Ann Arbor youth with her work as a librarian.Storyteller and librarian Laura Pershin Raynor has a talent for captivating audiences of all ages. Photo by Ken RaynorThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 61 Inspiring Family Tradition Storytelling has always been part of Laura's family traditions. Starting as a young girl, she attentively listened to her Grandma Dinah tell stories about coming to the United States from Russia at the age of 17. Laura says, \"Her stories were my fairy tales.\" Another favorite part of Laura's childhood was the weekly trips to the library with her dad. One of Laura's earliest memories of her dad is when he was telling stories at a family gathering, surrounded by his male cousins. \"I truly believed that every family was filled with storytelling moments,\" Laura says. She didn't realize until she was in college that her friends didn't know their families' pasts like she knew her own. Library OutreachAs an undergraduate student at Michigan State University, Laura discovered a little public library on Abbot Road in East Lansing, Michigan. She made it a habit to go once a week and was struck by the variety of ages there, which made it like a community. Parents were coming in with tots for story time, while elders were spending hours reading every newspaper in the library. \"I saw the children's librarian taking the kids on a little musical parade around the circulation desk. The children had shakers they had made out of paper plates and beans,\" Laura remembers. Her visits to that library helped her decide that she wanted to be a children's librarian. She graduated from Michigan State in 1976 with a bachelor of arts and an A.M.L.S. degree (master of arts in library science) and a K-12 teaching certificate. In 1975, Laura worked part-time doing outreach for the Ann Arbor Public Library. Her job included visiting Peace Neighborhood Center after school. Laura says that, after being in school all day, the kids wanted to play and not sit still. So she had them act out stories, put on finger plays, and even repeat silly back-and-forth rhymes. She recalls that it was such a \"joyous\" time, incorporating stories and play into learning. Laura also began telling stories for adults as well as children, and searching for places to do it. A National PastimeIn 1980, Laura and her husband moved to Boston, where he started a graphic design studio. Boston provided many professional opportunities for Laura. She got a job as an outreach librarian, at the library that her successor in Ann Arbor had left!It was at that library that Laura found a co-worker and friend who shared her passion for storytelling, Ellen Block. Laura recounts, \"I was fortunate that a storytelling revival was occurring in New England and around the country. Ellen and I traveled through Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire together, telling stories at schools, libraries, and festivals.\" They also began teaching workshops for teachers and at library conferences and elder hostels. During their years in Boston, Laura's daughters, Molly and Emma, were born. A decade later, Laura and her family moved back to Ann Arbor. Laura returned to working at what is now called the Ann Arbor District Library. Laura is part of a team of librarians who, she says, \"are amazing. We all have different styles, and we learn from each other.\" She also appreciates how \"Ann Arbor parents understand the importance of imagination and are not afraid to be silly,\" and adds, \"Ann Arbor spoils me rotten!\" What's Your Story? Laura got permission from her family members to fictionalize their tales in order to make them universal, and recorded them on two CDs for young adults and adults. Both \"All Dressed Up\" and \"A Well- Kept Secret\" (which won a Parents' Choice Award from the Parents' Choice Foundation) include Laura's sense of humor. Laura's storytelling takes her across the country to perform. For 15 years, she has been a storyteller at the Celebration of Light Festival in Midland, Texas. Laura performed at the National Storytelling Festival in 2004; then in 2005, she was part of the Teller-in-Residence Program, both in Jonesborough, Tennessee. She has also performed at festivals in Utah, California, and Virginia. In 2009, Laura and her husband, Ken, spent a week with professional storyteller Donald Davis on North Carolina's Ocracoke Island. They were part of a group of 14 people from across the country who took a workshop with Davis on finding and telling their unique stories. PBS aired a television series called \"What's Your Story?\" with footage from that week, and a DVD of the series will be released in 2012. Laura with her daughters Storytelling is a family tradition for Laura Pershin Raynor (center) and her daughters Emma (left), a photographer, and Molly (right), a poet.Whether Laura is a bumbling bear or a fairy princess, it is not just her voice, but also her body, that transforms.

For more info, be in touch with bill@crazywisdom.net The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 62 Award-Winning Talent Laura's talents have been widely recognized. The Creative Arts Institute of America honored Laura as National Storyteller of the Year in 1997. In 2006, she received the Michigan Library Association's Children's Services Award of Merit, which is granted to a librarian who has made an outstanding contribution to library service to children and young people in Michigan. In 2011, the Ann Arbor Book Festival honored Laura as a Leader in the Literary Arts. The festival's program director, Jeff Kass, teaches creative writing at Pioneer High School and is the creative arts director at The Neutral Zone, a teen center in Ann Arbor. In Jeff's introduction of Laura at the awards ceremony, he mentioned the thousands of children whom Laura has influenced over the last 20 years and that, for a lot of kids in Ann Arbor, Laura is their introduction to literature. Jeff uses his own kids as an example of Laura's influence. Even as toddlers, they learned to sit and \"pay very close attention\" to Laura's stories. \"She makes stories really come alive,\" says Jeff. Erin Helmrich, teen services librarian at the Ann Arbor District Library, has worked with Laura for eight years. Erin says, \"Laura is a completely positive, open, and giving person whose lightness and positivity are contagious, and the parents and kids respond to that. Not to mention that so many of them are genuinely entertained by her amazing storytelling talent.\" Lasting Impact With over 20 years of working with Ann Arbor's youth, Laura has enjoyed the opportunity to \"meet them as beginning readers, moving from red dot [books] to green dot\" - and again as teens, when they still trust her to recommend books in the teen room.Years after Ann Arbor's young people have outgrown Storytime, they still remember Laura. She tells a story about waiting in line behind a bunch of teenagers at a bagel shop on Main Street. Suddenly, one young man in a Pioneer High School letter jacket saw her and shouted, \"Story Lady!\" Laura laughs, \"For a second, he forgets that he is cool, and the wall comes down. Then he looks around, embarrassed.\" Laura's favorite part of her job is the sense of community created by parents, grandparents, caregivers, and kids all \"meeting in a magical place for a few minutes.\" As the hands of the clock in the youth department move toward 11:30 a.m., the crowd is still in a magical place and the young audience is oblivious of time. There are whispers of delight as Laura takes out the limberjack toys (wooden dolls with moveable limbs) that always dance with her last song. Once Storytime ends, the crowd disperses to various parts of the youth section to browse the shelves, find a couch and read a stack of books, then take their selections to the self-check-out. The 30-minute Storytime has ended for the day, but parents like Betsy Beckerman, Rohit Setty, and Jeff Kass can tell you that the impact is ongoing. Laura Pershin Raynor's storytelling inspires children and adults to love the art of storytelling, to love books, and to love visiting the library. As Sandy Ryder says, \"Ann Arbor is so lucky to have Laura as a storyteller and as a person. She is a real gift to the community.\" Visit the Ann Arbor District Library's website at aadl.org to see the list of Storytimes.

Katy and her husband Woody have a gregarious 14-year-old son, Oscar, and Katy works as a consultant, teaching people of all ages about the benefits of movement. She is devoted to her family and passionate about learning and teaching. Katy is a Licensed Brain Gym Instructor/Consultant and a Sanctioned Bal-A-Vis-X Instructor/Consultant. Her business is called Learning from the Heart, which seems appropriate for a mom who has spent the last fourteen years finding information to benefit her son Oscar, and, in the process, has helped children, parents, teachers, and health care professionals.InspirationOscar was born in 1997, and, although the Helds actively sought answers and help for their baby boy, it took eight months of doctor appointments and tests before it was confirmed that Oscar had experienced a significant stroke as a newborn that affected his right side. Katy says the news of the stroke was \"pretty devastating\" but it \"started me on my quest\" for helping Oscar. Online support groups provided valuable information. Katy first learned about Brain Gym from a posting by another mother. Brain Gym is a system of movements that reduce stress naturally and quickly enhance brain function. It is suitable for all ages. The program has existed for more than 30 years and it's estimated to be used by well over 10,000 schools in 88 countries around the world. The Power of Movement Katy Held's quest to help her son inspired her to teach body and brain integration programs that reduce stress while enhancing brain function. Photo by Dwight CendrowskiThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 64 In 2001, Katy signed up for her first Brain Gym class. It was a four-day Brain Gym 101 for Special Education in Farmington Hills. She says that class was \"one of the most life changing experiences I ever had.\" The class was taught by Cecilia Koester, who has become both a friend and mentor to Katy. Ten years later, Katy can still describe in great detail the immediate benefits of Brain Gym for the kids who participated in the class. One boy, who initially had trouble even holding his pencil, wrote clearly after his Brain Gym exercises, and then proudly showed his work to the group. Katy says, \"I still get goose bumps every time I tell that story.\" Katy's response to the Brain Gym class was, \"That's what I'm meant to do!\" That feeling was reinforced when she saw how these exercises benefitted Oscar. During that class, Cecilia also provided Katy's introduction to Bal-A-Vis-X (BAVX), a brain integration program that integrates the senses of BALance, Auditory and VISion using rhythmic eXercises done with beanbags or racquetballs. Katy laughs as she recalls being \"so bad\" at her first attempts at BAVX. She says she was over-focused and bouncing the balls at her partners' feet. Three years later, in 2004, Bill Hubert, the man who developed BAVX, taught a workshop in Westland, Michigan. Since many of the exercises require two hands, Katy wasn't sure how well they would work for Oscar, whose right hand still wasn't very functional. After reading Bill's book, she decided to sign up for the class and asked Bill if he would be willing to work one-on-one with Oscar. Oscar was a happy seven year old, but he did have some physical issues, attention issues, and difficulty holding his head still and tracking with his eyes. After ten to fifteen minutes of bouncing balls and Oscar rocking on a balance board, there was a dramatic difference in Oscar's ability to track with his eyes! The Teacher It only takes a few minutes of talking to Katy to understand why she teaches. She is passionate about what she does and she loves helping people. Katy has logged over 1,300 hours of coursework. She says, \"The more I learn, the more I want to learn. I never get bored.\" Melissa Gallagher's son Carson does Rhythmic Movement Therapy with Katy. Melissa says, \"Katy is wonderful! She explains things very clearly and has always been very friendly, patient, and easily approachable.\" Sue Bresky describes Katy as \"really incredible\" and says her daughters, Lauren and Ella, love Katy and ask to do BAVX. Using a combination of approaches including BAVX, Brain Gym, and Rhythm Movement Therapy, Katy has helped improve their attention, motor planning, and visual tracking. Sue says, \"As a parent, I can't ask for anything more.\" Sue adds that last summer Lauren and Ella did BAVX before their tennis lessons and their grandma, Eleanor Bresky, was amazed at the improvement in their rhythm, hand-eye coordination, and fluidity in their overall movements. Eleanor now uses some of the same exercises before she goes golfing. Sue works as an Occupational Therapist in a K-8 school and in an outpatient office treating adults with acquired mild traumatic brain injuries. She has seen BAVX help both groups. Sue says, \"The students show improved focus and better behavior... and my patients with brain injuries also benefit from improved attention and awareness of timing.\" Sue adds, \"Both groups also demonstrate improved ocular motor skills for tracking/reading, etc. Better yet - both kids and adults enjoy BAVX.\" Pat Hansel teaches in a cross- categorical classroom in Canton that includes students with emotional impairments and cognitive impairments. She uses BAVX with her students daily. Pat says, \"Katy is my hero because she has changed the way I evaluate my students' needs and then the way I approach teaching. She has shown me how important movement is in a child's ability to learn, especially the struggling learner. I have seen wonderful results now that I look at children's foundational skills first \u2014 their auditory, visual, motor, and sensory skills. Katy has shown me techniques to use to improve those foundational skills so that I can see improvement in their formal learning: reading, writing, and math.\" Pat describes Katy as \"selfless\" because of her positive, caring teaching style. She says Katy is a \"great teacher\" because of \"Katy's knowledge of the brain and the body and the importance of them to be fully integrated and her passion to share it in understandable terms.\" Katy has taught these programs at Detroit Country Day, Oakland County ISD, Children's Hospital, University of Michigan Hospital, as well as in the Chelsea, Dexter, Whitmore Lake, Ann Arbor, Brighton, Livonia, Novi, Farmington Hills, Rochester and Northville school districts. Her sessions usually include occupational therapists, physical therapists, social workers, teachers, and parents. Karen Koets, a first grade teacher in Gull Lake, Michigan, heard about BAVX and Katy Held from a colleague. When she saw that Katy was teaching BAVX as part of an early childhood seminar in the fall of 2010, she signed up just to take Katy's session. She says the training was interesting and informative and adds, \"Katy has a way of bringing what you need to make it easy to take back to our classrooms.\" Koets includes Bal-A-Vis-X as part of a \"Read and Ride\" summer camp, which includes children reading to therapy dogs and therapeutic horseback riding. She says, after only one week of camp, there is a dramatic increase in their reading scores, which she attributes to BAVX. Life in Balance Katy finds that helping parents also benefits their kids. She knows that when parents are doing BAVX and Brain Gym and reducing their stress, their kids benefit. After a child has taken a few sessions, she offers a free session to either parent. Katy says, \"I don't charge much. I'd rather be accessible.\" She speaks from the experience of a mom who tried so many types of therapy (some at great cost) to help Oscar. Even her website includes a list of mainstream and alternative therapies that she is \"glad to share any information about to interested parents.\" As a student in one of Katy Held's classes, it is hard to picture the stressed, over- focused mom that Katy describes herself to have been back when Oscar was little. She has positive energy, a friendly manner, and a sense of humor that puts everyone at ease. Koets says Katy's sessions are \"relaxed and comfortable.\" \" As the parent of a child with physical and learning challenges, I know the stress that other parents feel, and how that transfers to their children.\" - Katy Held Katy attributes the delay in finding out that Oscar had a stroke to the fact that, \"So many doctors don't know that kids can have strokes.\" According to the Children's Hemiplegia and Stroke Association, strokes occur in infants who are younger than 1 month old in approximately 1 in 4,000 live births. For children 1 to 18 years old, strokes occur in 11 out of 100,000 children. Photo by Dwight CendrowskiPhoto by Dwight Cendrowski\"Through our movement sessions, be it Brain Gym, Bal-A-Vis-X, reflex integration movements, or some combination of these, we create a space for higher functioning to occur naturally.\" - K aty HeldKaty Held's Tips to Maximize Brain Function By Katy Held 1. Hydrate. Our brain is 75-85% water. Water is an element of our body. One of the best things you can do for your brain is to sip water constantly throughout the day. Encourage your children to sip water often. Get them their own \"brain juice\" bottle. Drink extra water when you are under stress. For every cup of coffee, which is a diuretic, drink an extra glass of water. For every glass of alcohol, drink two extra glasses of water. 2. Limit flat screen time. Flat screens include TV, computers, Gameboys or Nintendo DS, cell phones, and so on. Flat screens are two-dimensional, but our eyes are made for looking at three-dimensional objects. Too much flat screen time weakens eye muscles and tracking issues can result. For every 30 minutes of flat screen time, balance it with playing outside whenever possible or just take a flat screen break. Look away from the computer screen every 10-15 minutes to give your eyes a chance to refocus in 3D. 3. Do some cross-lateral movement every day. Walking is great for the brain, especially when your arms swing. Moving your left arm activates your brain's right hemisphere and moving your right leg activates your brain's left hemisphere. So, when you swing your arms as you walk, you activate both hemispheres simultaneously, which makes it easier to think. If you walk and don't swing your arms, you are only activating one hemisphere at a time. 4. Practice Cross Crawls. If you're a parent of a child at least 5-years-old, see if they can do this movement pattern easily: Touch one hand to their opposite knee, then touch their other hand to the opposite knee. The child can start out seated, but ideally they should be able to do this standing. If they have trouble reaching across to their opposite knee, or naturally touch the knee on the same side, you can put a sticker on the R hand and L knee (or vice versa) and have them match the stickers. When your child can effortlessly cross the midline \u2014 which in Brain Gym is called the Cross Crawl \u2014 for about a minute every day, life will be easier, as they will now be able to access both hemispheres at the same time. Just before it's time to do homework, put on some fun music and do some Cross Crawls for at least a minute. Homework should be easier afterwards. 5. Get up, stand up. Nature designed us to be moving, not sitting still at desks or on couches. After we sit for 15 minutes, the blood starts pooling in our legs and our brains get sluggish. So a good rule of thumb is to get up and move every 15 minutes, even if it's only to do a big stretch. It will keep our brains more active if we move our bodies. 6. Exercise your eye muscles. Eye tracking is critical for reading. If your child struggles with reading, check their eye tracking. Simple things like playing catch or bouncing a ball back and forth are excellent for exercising eye muscles, which will help with eye tracking. If a child can't track an object through space easily, reading will likely be a challenge. It may also be difficult to pay attention in school if eye tracking is poor. To quote Bill Hubert: \"Where the eyes go, attention follows.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 65 It is easy to see how much she loves what she does. Katy says, \"I feel grateful. I can't imagine anything I can do [that would be] more fulfilling. It is complete satisfaction and joy to see kids say, 'I can do this now,' and parents say, 'look what they can do.'\" After years of learning BAVX and Brain Gym, Oscar assists his mom with Bal-A-Vis-X trainings. He is very proud of being \"whole-brained\" and like his mom constantly has a smile on his face and a friendly, helpful attitude. Katy Held's journey to help others began with her own son Oscar, but what she has learned has now benefitted so many other people. She says, \"My intention for working with children and adults is to create a safe place for them, where they come to feel honored just as they are. Through our movement sessions, be it Brain Gym, Bal-A-Vis-X, reflex integration movements, or some combination of these, we create a space for higher functioning to occur naturally. As the parent of a child with physical and learning challenges, I know the stress that other parents feel, and how that transfers to their children. I come to this practice from my heart, to help children and their parents lower their stress levels, grow closer and be the best they can be.\" Find out more about Bal-A-Vis-X\u00ae, Brain Gym\u00ae, and other services provided by Katy Held at the Learning from the Heart website: www.learningheart.com. \"I have seen wonderful results now that I look at children's foundational skills first \u2014 their auditory, visual, motor, and sensory skills.

Photo by Doug Russell Photo by Doug Russell The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 66 Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky Photos by Joni Strickfaden Barb Christensen was the first woman in her karate school to reach black belt and one of the first women in the entire style to do so. She helped found the National Women's Martial Arts Federation and was one of the first women to run a local martial arts studio here in Ann Arbor. She is the head instructor at the Okinawan Karate Club of Ann Arbor and a 7 th-degree black belt in Shorin Ryu karate. I sat down with her at her sunny and well cared for home on the west side of Ann Arbor, and she talked about her path to becoming a female karate instructor, the emphases of her karate program for kids, and the rewards of being a martial artist. Bill Zirinsky: Barb, where were you raised, and how long have you lived in the Ann Arbor area? Barb Christensen: I grew up in the Toledo area and I have spent my adult life in Ann Arbor. Bill Zirinsky: When did you begin in martial arts? And what drew you in, initially?Barb Christensen: When I was a freshman in college, I took a self-defense course. After it ended, some of us began attending Tae Kwon Do classes with the instructor. The self-defense class wasn't real interesting, but I loved the athleticism of the martial arts classes. We were taught and pushed to do a lot of new things. That made it both interesting intellectually and challenging physically. Bill Zirinsky: You practice Shorin Ryu karate, is that correct? Have you been doing that since the beginning and, if not, what caused you to change to that style of karate? Barb Christensen: I started out in Tae Kwon Do, which is a Korean form with the same roots as karate. After a few years, I migrated to Shorin Ryu because I liked the completeness of the style. In addition to the empty hand aspects, the Shorin Ryu school also taught five weapons, which was unusual at the time. BZ: When did you get your black belt? And what level are you at now? Barb: I earned 1st-degree black belt in 1978 and I now hold the rank of 7th- degree black belt.BZ: When you started, were there lots of girls and women in the martial arts? What was it like back then for females? Barb: I was the first female at my dojo [school] to reach black belt and I believe the third in the entire style of Grandmaster Shimabukuro. There were not many women in the martial arts at all. But, the seventies were a very energetic and enthusiastic time for young women to try \"men's\" activities. We were pushing against all kinds of barriers in sports and in the work world. So young women were becoming interested in martial arts and were joining area clubs. That met with some interesting dynamics, as virtually all of the instructors and top students were male, and women wanted to take their place in the programs.BZ: Are there a lot of women now at the higher levels in karate, and what about years ago? Barb: There were very few women black belts then. The martial arts in general were much younger here in the states and for women - we were just getting started. Now, there are many high-ranking women. In my style, one woman has a 9th-degree black belt, which is as high as anyone can go, other than the Grandmaster. BZ: You were one of the founders of the National Women's Martial Arts Federation. What were its origins? How big was it originally, and how big is it today? Barb: In the seventies and eighties, a lot of female martial artists were getting together for conferences and trainings in order to share expertise, support each other, and socialize. There were many very talented women who were training around the U.S. and in Canada, and we eventually created a formal organization that still exists today. There is a five-day training every summer that is attended by women from all over the U.S. and also from Canada and Europe. The trainings are smaller now, but the skill level of the instructors is very high and there is great camaraderie and exchange of ideas and training methods. BZ: Where is Shorin Ryu based? Can you briefly tell us the story of its roots, and also trace its emigration to the U.S.? Barb: Shorin Ryu is a popular style with three main branches, all coming from Okinawa, Japan. Our organization is headed by Grandmaster Eizo Shimabukuro, tenth dan [rank]. In general, Chinese fighting arts mixed with indigenous arts in Okinawa to create systems of karate. Shotokan is a very well-known Japanese style that came from Shorin Ryu, and Tae Kwon Do is Barb Christensen, Breaking Barriers (and Boards) in Karate How one of the first female black belts in Shimabukuro karate went on to lead her own club in Ann Arbor Barb Christensen is the founder and long-time head instructor of the Okinawan Karate Club of Ann Arbor. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 67 a well-known Korean style that also came from Shorin Ryu. After World War II, there were a lot of military bases on Okinawa and Americans stationed there studied with local masters. When they returned to the U.S., some of them began teaching karate. Karate has spread and grown over the decades, with Americans continuing to travel to Okinawa and Japan for training, and Masters from there coming here. BZ: Approximately how many Shorin Ryu martial arts clubs are there now in the U.S.? Barb: I don't know. Way too many to count and many different branches. BZ: And are they all associated with the same Grandmaster? If so, is it a close association, or more varied? Are others of the clubs led by women? Barb: There are several Shorin Ryu Grandmasters and quite a few associations here of various sizes. Some schools are independent and others are closely associated with their roots. There are many schools and clubs that are headed by women, or headed by women in partnership with men. BZ: Overall, can you describe the changes in the atmosphere for women in martial arts over these 35 years? Barb: The changes are so drastic it is hard to describe. I would never have imagined the success that women have had in the martial arts. When I was training in the seventies, there was a fair amount of open hostility towards women. We were pushing for acceptance and respect and, as a result, many of us were booted out of the schools we attended. There was a serious glass ceiling and, in fact, Judo had a formal policy that women could only go as high as 5th degree, while men could go to 10th. BZ: You said to me that, on a local level, you knew everybody here in town in the martial arts 25 years ago. Tell us about the \"scene\" then, and about the \"scene\" now? Barb: Martial arts in the U.S. has grown tremendously and is now a very popular activity for children as well as adults. Previously, in Ann Arbor, many of the clubs were associated with the University on some level. At that time, anyone could use the U of M gyms. So there were formal student clubs as well as clubs for a combination of students and community members. We used to train at the Intramural Building and at the old Waterman Gym. Now most of the schools are commercial or clubs associated with the Y or Rec and Ed. Our club rents space and meets a few times a week. I know many of the long-time instructors here, but there are a lot that I don't know at all now. Ann Arbor is a popular place to locate a school. BZ: You said to me that you're \"very earthbound, very grounded\" and that you want to talk about concrete things, that you're perhaps less inclined to talk about martial arts philosophy than instructors in other schools. Can you say more (or less) about that? Barb: Well, activities lend themselves to personalities that mesh with their philosophy. I think there is a perception that martial arts people sit and meditate for hours and read people's minds. There are some people who emphasize that, but most of us are very ordinary people with ordinary families and lives. Karate has low stances and is grounded and stable. It also has a lot of sharp, staccato movements. We start on time and end on time and don't spend much time philosophizing about it. We just do it. BZ: Tell us about your program...how many kids and how many adults, what do you focus on, what are the strengths of your program?Barb: At this point, I am the head instructor overall. But I handle the children's program and my student, Missy Siudara, handles the adult program. Some of the adults have children that joined and then the parents followed. Likewise, the adults have enrolled their children in the kids' classes and many of them help teach. We have about thirty kids from age four to 14. We focus on traditional karate technique and personal development in the area of leadership. The students who continue in the program receive instruction in teaching and leading classes and exercises. The school is small enough that everyone is my student and I teach all of the classes at this point. BZ: I know that different martial arts studios have varying emphases: self- defense, character and self-esteem, competition, etc. Where does your studio fit on that continuum? Barb: Everyone who teaches imparts some of their values through whatever they are teaching. For some kids, it is very hard to manage their behavior to be the kind of example to younger kids that we want them to be. For others, it is hard to get up in front and speak up and demonstrate with confidence. So along with physical karate technique, this is what I work with the students on. It is great for adults as well as kids. If you can teach a class, you can run a meeting. It is very useful training. BZ: You told me you focus on \"leadership.\" Please elaborate. Barb: A few years ago, I started a program for intermediate/advanced students called the Black Belt Club. It is a leadership group that I work with in teaching and leading exercises. I teach them about the history and tradition of karate and the nuts and bolts of teaching. They work on using a commanding voice, keeping a steady pace, and thinking on their feet. The kids lead warm-up exercises, model techniques, and help the lower-ranking students. They eventually work their way up to teaching a class on their own when they are black belts. In the high schools in Ann Arbor, there are many opportunities for leadership in the different after-school activities. This program helps prepare kids to be ready to take their place in high school, college, and the workplace. BZ: When did you begin your program for Little Dragons?Barb: We started Little Dragons about eight years ago. The idea is to give a separate environment for the under-seven-year-old group, as their needs are much different than the nine-, ten-, and 11-year-olds. It has been a wonderful and fun program and I have had several students who started in Little Dragons and stayed to earn their black belt. BZ: You told me that in your program, every kid gets her/his turn, everybody wins...please explain. Barb: Yes, my class is not based on competition. There are many competitive sports available and I wanted a more inclusive atmosphere for kids. I was a very good athlete, but I always enjoyed the practices more than the games. The stress of competing was a de-motivator for me. I love the athleticism and focus on improvement in the martial arts, and I try to create an environment where there are unlimited opportunities to expand, improve, and grow. Every student participates fully in the classes and advances through the belt system. Class attendance is the most important factor. BZ: How long does it take to get a black belt in your program?Barb: For an adult, four to five years. For a child, five or six years. BZ: You said that karate has been called \"moving zen.\" Why?Barb: There is nothing like the feeling one has after a great practice. The mind is calm and happy, as well as the body.BZ: Can you get kids to do \"moving zen\"? Kids are pretty active, aren't they? \"I loved the athleticism of the martial arts classes. We were taught and pushed to do a lot of new things. That made it both interesting intellectually and challenging physically.\" \"My class is not based on competition. There are many competitive sports available and I wanted a more inclusive atmosphere for kids...\" Continued on page 68 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 68 Barb: Yes, well that varies. We have fairly rowdy times and we have quiet and focused times. Of course, the older and more advanced students are better about this than the young ones. But, many parents are surprised by the focus the kids have in class. BZ: How might parents best determine the right martial arts school for their child? Barb: The best thing to do is go watch or even have their child participate in a class. See how comfortable it feels. The students have to enjoy it or they won't continue long enough to benefit. Some places are very structured, others more flexible. Some are competitive and attend tournaments. There is a lot of variety and many different arts and styles. BZ: You said to me that karate is great for brain development. Please tell us about the ways that skills are built, and what martial arts activities in your program enhance overall development.Barb: Karate is very challenging intellectually and this is what attracts a lot of people. Many sports are focused on winning, so they only work on strategies that will help them win. But, we have a huge variety of material that we cover. There is a lot of memorization, and also a lot of patterns and sequencing. But, unlike [academic] school, everything we do is in the context of practice and perfecting and moving up \u2014 trying to get it right. Since the students want to earn the next belt, they are very willing to do the work. Physically, we practice a wide variety of motor skills, more than any sport I have ever seen. So, the brain is working to get the body to be able to perform the tasks stronger, faster, and more accurately. The physical is in the context of learning and memorizing exercises, so many brain functions are working at the same time. Schools seem to be standardizing and narrowing the kinds of learning they emphasize and there seems to be a lot of memorization taken out of context. So, it is important to participate in activities that cover a broader range of kinds of learning. BZ: Do you have kids in your programs with learning issues or attention issues, and how does your program help them? Barb: We have a whole range of students and our program helps all of them. There are about 30 students at any one time, and many of them stay for years, so the instructors know the kids pretty well. We focus on helping each student move forward. There is no one absolute standard that everyone has to meet. It is flexible. BZ: As a woman martial arts instructor, you can be an important role model for girls. Can you speak to that? Barb: Obviously, the world is wide open to both girls and boys today. There are unlimited opportunities for both. This is a generalization, but my observation is that around age eight or nine, boys become more outgoing and confident and girls start pulling back. I think that boys' culture is more hierarchical and focused on moving up and being better than someone else. Girls tend to work on perfecting their own skills but are not necessarily driven to beat someone else. For instance, in sparring, a boy may be trying to win, while a girl may be trying to survive. Also, boys tend to be willing to lead, even when they are not totally confident that they know what they are doing. Girls want to make sure they are doing things correctly before they will get up in front. So I try to be mindful of this and provide settings for girls to gain confidence in ways that they are comfortable. Today, parents want their girls to be prepared to take leadership positions just as much as their \"The seventies were a very energetic and enthusiastic time for young women to try \"men's\" activities. We were pushing against all kinds of barriers in sports and in the work world.\" \"[Karate is great for brain development because] we have a huge variety of material that we cover. There is a lot of memorization, and also a lot of patterns and sequencing... Physically, we practice a wide variety of motor skills, more than any sport I have ever seen.

I don't think it is as much role modeling as that atmosphere. The trick is to help all students meet challenges without feeling defeated. It is a hard balance to achieve. There are many boys who are also not confident. I never criticize or embarrass anyone who gets up in front. I simply thank them and give corrections at another time. BZ: You mentioned to me that you \"look out for your girls.\" And that karate is confrontational, that girls quit in environments where they're overpowered. Would you explain these issues for our readers, and also talk about \"boy culture\" versus \"girl culture\"? Barb: I think it is cooler for a boy to know karate than it is for a girl. So there are more rewards [for boys], because being tough is a lot more important in boy culture than it is in girl culture. But, parents want their daughters to be very competent and confident, so they really want them in activities like martial arts. The challenge is to provide a great atmosphere for everyone. We practice everything from rolling and falling to board breaking and sparring. I talk about that and remind students that there will be parts that are easy and comfortable, and there will be parts that are difficult and make them feel incompetent. The variety is a big strength of Shorin Ryu. I have seen many females quit martial arts throughout the years because they feel beat up physically and emotionally. Sparring is always optional and sometimes the girls opt out and practice something else or they might want to just spar with other girls their size. This can also be true for boys. Mostly kids really challenge themselves and get out there and practice and improve. BZ: You said to me that moms and dads want their girls to be able to have a combination of emotional and physical safety. Please elaborate. Barb: Obviously physical safety is a huge concern for parents of girls. I do not teach \"self defense\" and it is not my focus. However, the principles of karate are self-protection. Surprisingly, awareness, eye contact, and confidence can be more important than how hard someone can hit. BZ: You have two daughters. What ages are they and what are they into? Did they study martial arts and, if so, did they like it? Barb: I have two daughters, both in high school. They both trained in my class and earned black belts. They are very busy with school and sports activities, so they don't participate regularly in the club at this point. Do they like karate? Good question. I think they had a lot of fun and enjoyed it, but at the same time it was the obligatory \"piano lessons\" of our household. The educational foundation at The Rudolf Steiner School of Ann Arbor is built on the premise that knowledge is more than facts. The school\u00d5s thoughtfully constructed curriculum is designed to support children through all stages of development.

What is your background outside of the martial arts, and what have been your other occupations? Barb: It is possible to make a living teaching martial arts today, because of the popularity with children. But, I never wanted my hobby to be my job. It is a labor of love for me and if I had to bring in students to pay the rent, I always thought the enjoyment would be gone. I am trained as an electrician and I worked in that trade in construction and in management at the U of M for many years. At this point, I am self-employed as a rental property owner and manager. BZ: Over these many years of being into the martial arts, what's been most challenging about it for you? And what have you liked least about it, as a martial artist, and as a teacher of the martial arts? Barb: The hard part is to balance teaching and learning. There is a saying that when you teach, you become a very good green belt. That means that we keep teaching the same basic material over and over and have little time to get our own training or to develop the advanced material. I have had the good fortune of always having students who are there to learn from me. Who can say no when there are 20 kids lining up and staring at you? It is very inspiring and energizing. I love teaching kids. It doesn't seem like work. I am always thinking about the next class, the next test, the next activity to introduce. I don't have the constraints of school; everyone is there because they want to be, and I have a great group of adult assistants. So there is not much that I don't like. BZ: What have you most loved about being a karate practitioner, and what have you loved most about being a karate instructor? Barb: What I like about the martial arts is the unlimitedness of it. There is always more to learn, more people to train with, more ways to practice. It is a wide-open sport. ### Classes for adults and children at the Okinawan Karate Club of Ann Arbor are held at the Dakota Building at 1785 W. Stadium, inside the Mind, Body, Spirit Academy.

Her practice utilizes an approach to chiropractic called Bio Geometric Integration (BMI), which emphasizes light touch and breath work to release tension from all parts of the body. The gentleness of BGI makes it a great choice for children, says Babalas. Although children often have trouble remaining still, she says that work can still be done on them. Additionally, the treatment is not loud, scary, or painful. BGI deals with alignment, like traditional chiropractic, but also looks at the whole body, to take input from all tissues to help a patient relax. Behind the practice of Bio Geometric Integration is a philosophy that our bodies are intelligent and know how to heal themselves. Symptoms of stress arise as a signal that we are unable to integrate and release stress from the body. The more stress accumulates, the more we have symptoms. Stress can be physical, chemical, or emotional in nature, says Babalas, and indicators of problems include physical symptoms. She has treated children The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 70 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the CommunityNew, Fun, and Just Plain Cool Dr. Diane Babalas and AbbyBy Karen L. Totten If you'd like to be considered for inclusion in the next Crazy Wisdom Kids column, please contact our columnist at: cwkidscolumn@crazywisdom.net. The deadline for submissions for the May thru August 2012 issue is March 1, 2012. The Progressive Education Consortium (PEC) is a Washtenaw County group of individuals interested in alternative/progressive forms of education, who come together on a monthly basis to discuss how better to represent the schools they serve. The consortium, which had its initial meeting in March of 2011, is a collaboration among local learning communities and alternative schools, including Clonlara School, New Point Learning Center, Ann Arbor Academy, Little Lake Learning Community, and Rudolf Steiner School. The consortium formed as a result of networking between two of the current members during an education conference early in 2010. One problem for alternative school personnel is finding like-minded individuals with whom to troubleshoot, discuss problems and issues, and share ideas for finding those populations of school children who are a good fit for alternative programs. In the consortium, members can serve as resources for each other and as sounding boards. As Martha Rhodes, Campus Coordinator at Clonlara Campus School and PEC member, says, \"If a student is not a good fit for Clonlara, I can recommend them to one or several of the other schools that I know might better suit his or her needs.\" Another major function of the consortium is reaching out to the public through lecture series and other public events that showcase alternative approaches to education. Two lectures will be forthcoming in 2012: One at the Ann Arbor Academy (topic TBA) in January and another in March at Clonlara School. Additionally, the PEC is hosting a screening of the film Play Again, about the importance for children to have outdoor play and engage with nature. The movie explores the changing balance between \"virtual\" and \"natural\" worlds of six teenagers who, like the average American child, spend 5 to 15 hours a day behind screens (TV, computer, and otherwise). The film asks, \"What are the consequences of childhood removed from nature?\" Showtime is March 1, 2012, at 6:30 p.m. at Clonlara School. Donations will be used to help send students from the various PEC schools to a three-day April conference of the National Coalition of Alternative and Community Schools at The Farm in Tennessee. While the consortium began as a vehicle for school administrators, Rhodes notes that participation is no longer confined to members exclusively One problem for alternative school personnel is finding like-minded individuals with whom to troubleshoot, discuss problems and issues, and share ideas for finding those populations of school children who are a good fit for alternative programs. At Little Lake, children are free to learn what they like, though not to do so without direction. \"It's not in a child's nature to do nothing,\" says Palma. She finds that students are eager to learn when adults provide the opportunities and support, and step out of the way to let it happen. Skill sharing is very valued by the program and an effort is made to welcome adults to bring their talents into the program. Palma's, mother, for instance, comes in on a weekly basis for physical education. In addition, Little Lake students go out into the larger community to explore, via weekly Wednesday field trips to various locations around the area. In recent months, the group visited the Arb; traveled to the Heidelberg Project and the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Belle Isle in Detroit; drew pictures at the University of Michigan Art Museum, explored the Hands-On Museum, and made use of local public libraries. Palma says, \"If you are riding a public bus in Ann Arbor on a Wednesday and see a gaggle of kids, it's probably us!\"with gait problems and those injured in falls, and well as cases of torticollis (inability to straighten the neck). Signs that a child might be suffering chemical stresses include frequent illnesses, allergies and asthma, ADD, and seizures. She has had great results with children suffering from epilepsy staying seizure-free after several adjustments. One of those miracles Babalas referred to involves a girl who at six months old was a lively child but whose neck was stuck to one side (torticollis). Her parents were considering surgery, but Dr. Babalas was able to relieve the neck spasm causing the misalignment of the bones, and thus the little girl was able to move her neck freely without requiring surgery. Babalas found her way to chiropractic after years of performance in clarinet during undergraduate school led her to suffer a serious case of tendonitis. She couldn't wash her hair or brush her teeth due to the condition. After some time spent in the \"medical model\" of care, Babalas found chiropractic. Since it helped her so much, she decided to use her biology minor to pursue a four-year program in chiropractic school. She has been in practice in Ann Arbor for 11 years and using BGI for the last 10 years. You can learn more about Dr. Babalas, her practice, and BGI at her website, gatewaychiropracticbgi.com, or by calling 734-239-6060. Her practice is located at 210 Collingwood, Suite 100, Ann Arbor, 48103. Directed by Melissa Palma, the Little Lake Learning Community of Ann Arbor is a green-based democratic education environment for children. The program opened in 2010 and now hosts 14 students ages 4-13. Little Lake Learning Community is child oriented; a place where a child can explore his/her passions and interests, be they trains, sharks, art, or fort building. As Palma says, the role of the advisor (teacher) is to support each child on his or her educational, emotional, physical, and social journey. The program takes on a theme area of study each semester. In fall 2011, the theme was water. Students explored the subject in their own ways, brainstorming to come up with sub-topics of interest and ways to approach them. The underlying assumption is that advisors don't have all the answers; and in this way co-learning can take place, with all participants engaged in discovery of the subjects. \"When students are motivated by passion or interest, then they learn more efficiently and authentically,\" says Palma. This is, in effect, the guiding principle of democratically based educational programs. There are no grade levels at LLLC. The children are grouped loosely according to age: 4- to 7-year-olds and 8- to 13-year-olds. The groups work both independently and in concert, sharing group activities such as art or science projects, then breaking apart for other age-oriented studies. On the day I visited, a more structured period of English and math for 4- to 7-year-olds was followed by a group art activity for all the students, where they created holiday ornaments to sell at a school fundraiser. \"When students are motivated by passion or interest, then they learn more efficiently and authentically,\" says Melissa Palma.

The gentleness of BGI makes it a great choice for children, says Diane Babalas. Not only does the system lead to fewer tantrums from frustrated children, but there are other benefits as well. According to Moore, research in the field supports the idea that babies who are taught symbolic language tend to have more developed vocabularies as they age. In addition, the interaction between parent and child develops their relationship and enhances bonding. Moore's own interest in baby signing began after adopting an infant son in 2010 whose biological brother was most likely autistic. She wanted to ensure that her son was equipped with every communication tool at his disposal. The baby signing program was developed by a singer/musician whose 12-month-old daughter was discovered to be deaf. He wrote the songs used in Baby Signing to help teach ASL to others, so that the world would be more accessible to his daughter. Because the signs in the program are ASL-based, once children or adults learn them, they can be used for children of all ages and abilities to interact. Moore is not a newcomer to the wonders of music. She grew up playing eight instruments and studied in the University of Michigan's music school. She was headed for a degree in opera at Northwestern when she changed direction and began to explore other options. For the last 15 years, Moore has been a teacher of private instruction in voice and piano. Her Dynamic Expressions Studio teaches voice and piano to individuals ages five to adult, including special needs and hearing/speech-impaired students. She loves working with children. \"They spark my creativity,\" she says, adding, \"The energy of children brings an ability to communicate joy in all sorts of eclectic ways.\" For more information about Baby Signing classes, contact Stephannie Moore at Dynamic Expressions Studio. The phone number is 734-417-0760 or you can e-mail her at stephannie@dynamicexpressionsstudio.com. You can also visit the website at www.dynamicexpressionsstudio.com. ###There are rules to follow, as with any environment, but the community of Little Lake has a strong commitment to a group-based approach to governance. Children, parents, and advisors are welcome to attend the weekly All-School Meeting, where the agenda is open to anyone who would like to add a topic of discussion. Everyone has an equal vote and equal say in determining the community's rules. When a change is proposed, consensus is used to make decisions. This spirit of community extends to conflict resolution as well. Tensions that arise are handled by non-violent communication and peer mediation. Time is spent helping children learn to solve their problems with each other, rather than being told what to do. Palma says, \"The role of the community is to help all members address their emotions in a healthy way, which leads to healthier people.\" Little Lake Learning Community is open for additional enrollment. \"We want to stay small,\" says Palma, \"but we have room for about 30 [total].\" To contact the school, call Palma at 734-218-4877or visit their website are littlelakelearningcommunity.org. The school is located at The Episcopal Church of Incarnation, 3257 Lohr Road, Ann Arbor, 48104. Imagine being able to communicate with your pre-verbal toddler without resorting to guessing games. That's what Stephannie Moore helps parents and children accomplish through a program called Baby Signing Time, an interactive method that teaches American Sign Language through song and play. Designed for hearing babies between 6 months and 36 months, the program teaches children basic signs for everyday events and emotions. \"Children are able to sign much earlier than they can speak,\" says Moore. She leads them to make signs for key things like hunger, for example, and focuses on nouns and verbs, not the syntax or grammar of ASL.

This is in part why we work on recognizing that a birth can have long lasting effects both negative and positive. With the Birth Story Nights we create a safe space for a mother to express her feelings about her birth the way she experiences them. There are times that a mother just needs the space to be angry about her experience and is not looking for someone to help her feel better. The feelings that women have about their stories will sometimes evolve over time, too, and women might attend more than one Birth Story Night and share how time has changed her feelings about what has happened to her. Birth Story Nights are not only for women who have a traumatic or negative story to tell. We also hold the space for mothers who want to tell their positive stories. Women who have an empowering, happy birth can feel bad about sharing their stories in a community where a lot of women have very different histories. Women with positive experiences also need space to share without feeling guilty; the Birth Story Nights allow for that, encouraging them to speak up and contribute to a rich and varied history. Together, our stories empower us, offering hope, healing, and community. Kate Stroud, C.D. (DONA), C.C.E., M.T., is a mother of two. Along with her massage therapy practice, she teaches DONA Birth Doula Trainings, private childbirth education classes, and facilitates a Personal Renewal Group for Mothers once a month at her office in Ypsilanti. The next Birth Story Night will be held on Thursday, March 15, from 7:00-9:00 p.m. at Trillium Collective, 300 N. Huron, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197. For more information, call 734-395-6900 or email info@katestroud.com. By Kate Stroud The women sit in a circle. The lights are low. The energy in the room is that of calm, loving acceptance of all that will be shared within these four walls. Sometimes the room is filled with tears and sometimes there are fits of laughter. As the stories are shared throughout the evening, we all cannot help but be affected by them and see threads of other women's stories in our own experiences. Birth Story Nights are a place that mothers \u2014 all mothers \u2014 can come and share their journey through birth. We are open to listening to women recount all paths that they have had to walk to get where they are. Sometimes the stories are joyful and triumphant and sometimes the stories are filled with grief and disappointment. In this space we do not judge or try to solve; we listen and hold the space for a mother to speak and be heard. Our default is to hear difficult stories without comment because too often women face a sort of inquisition when they tell the stories of difficult births. Often they are asked: Did you try this? Why did you go to the hospital so early? Why did you let them induce you so early? Why didn't you keep trying? Why didn't you pick a different provider? Still other times, women come to the Birth Story Night hungry for feedback and validation and we will give it when asked. Often some of the greatest healing can come after telling a horrible story and hearing someone across the room speak quietly and say, \"I remember when I felt like that\" or \"I am so sorry. Nobody deserves that.\" We honor all experiences from all mothers, young and old, single or partnered, lesbian or straight, of all classes and races, and all different ways of birthing. The evenings are set up with guidelines shared at the beginning of the night, among them a request that the storyteller's privacy be respected and that the stories shared that night stay in the room and don't travel out into the greater community. These evenings can be very helpful to women by creating a safe place for them to share as much or as little as they choose of their birth in a non-judgmental space. Women can also hear the journeys other women have had into motherhood, which is often beneficial to the listener in processing her own birth or planning future births. We learn from these evenings of sharing that we should never make assumptions regarding how a mother emotionally processes her birth. A very straightforward, uncomplicated vaginal delivery, which the mother had wanted, still has the potential to be a traumatic experience. Maybe it didn't match her original expectations, was far more painful than she expected, or she felt lost, confused, or out of control. Conversely, a long labor with many interventions that ends in a caesarean section has the potential to be a positive experience for the mother, especially if she felt she was part of the decision making process and felt heard and respected through her birth. Each woman has her own way of experiencing and processing the events around her birth. It is important that others respect her experience and that she feels heard when speaking. Often these words are spoken: \"You and your baby are healthy and that is what is important.\" This empathetic comment is well intentioned but it can also make it seem as if simply coming out of the experience alive is a good outcome. Any mother who feels disappointed or traumatized by her birth or Birth Story Nights: Honoring All Experiences from All Mothers We honor all experiences from all mothers, young and old, single or partnered, lesbian or straight, of all classes and races, and all different ways of birthing.

Call 996-1772; birena@umich.edu.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 86You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality. Is it your decision to do so? You recognize from your own experience that what you see in dreams you think is real while you are asleep. Yet the instant you waken you realize that everything that seemed to happen in the dream did not happen at all. You do not think this strange, even though all the laws of what you awaken to were violated while you slept. Is it not possible that you merely shifted from one dream to another, without really waking? (T-10.I.2:1-6) The choice is not between which dreams to keep, but only if you want to live in dreams or to awaken from them (T-29.IV .1:5). Notice the above comment that we do not think nighttime dreams are strange. This is because we see them as normal. Likewise, we see our so-called waking lives as normal, when in reality they are as ephemeral as our dreams at night. God made us with all the creative powers of Himself, and we have free will to do whatever we want with that creativity. Because our imaginations are so creative and powerful, we made this incredible world with its array of fascinating delights and horrors. If we want to keep dreaming of exile, we can do that. If we want to wake up and realize our true nature, we can do that as well. There Is No Death Death is the central dream from which all illusions stem. Is it not madness to think of life as being born, aging, losing vitality, and dying in the end? Without the idea of death there is no world. All dreams will end with this one (M-27.1:1-2; 6:3-4). It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes. Certainly war provokes terror , as fear of death and bodily destruction are at their peak. Soldiers pray for safety and loved ones at home pray for their safe return. Impending death brings to many a sense of aloneness and panic. However, we can connect with a power of love greater than us, which allows us to find our way to peace. Feeling this connection has brought peace to many in the midst of war. There is a sense of gentle calm that things are okay no matter what happens. One of my clients, John, found peace during the Vietnam War by carrying the Prayer of St. Joseph with him. He carries it with him to this day , grateful for how it helped him. John describes an intriguing incident when his buddy Dan was severely wounded by shrapnel in his leg. Dan went into shock and asked John if the bees were still around. Puzzled, John said, \"Bees, what bees?\" \"The bees that stung my leg,\" Dan replied. John saw shrapnel holes, while Dan saw bee stings. John was awed by the power of the mind to trick itself. As he read The Disappearance of the Universe , he kept recalling Dan's illusory bee stings. This helped John understand how we fool ourselves by believing our dreams. Whether the problem is war or something seemingly less serious, the answer is the same. When we remember our oneness with God, the problem will no longer be a problem. When we remember it is a dream, we can no longer be upset with it. The more we remember that we are at home in heaven now, the more we will experience serenity. Lorri Coburn, M.S.W., worked as a psychotherapist for 25 years and is now an interfaith minister who has been writing and teaching on A Course in Miracles for six years. Her book, Breaking Free: How Forgiveness and A Course in Miracles Can Set You Free, published in August 2011, is available through her website: www.lorricoburn.com. She can be reached at 734-646-6585 or Excerpt from Lorri Coburn's Breaking Free: How Forgivenessand A Course in Miracles Can Set You Free Local interfaith minister, psychotherapist and spiritual teacher Lorri Coburn, M.S.W., released her new book Breaking Free in August of 2011. For the past six years, Lorri has been writing and teaching on the popular metaphysical text A Course in Miracles that first found a wide audience when it was published in the 1970s. In Breaking Free , she explores the main ideas of A Course in Miracles and relates its lessons of forgiveness to her life and the stories she has encountered in her practice. Chapter Three: The Dream There is no world! This is the central thought the Course attempts to teach (W-p.I.132.6:2-3). I was at a coffee shop with my sixteen-year-old niece Catherine. One of Catherine's friends died of cancer at age fifteen, and Catherine's reaction was, \"I hate God!\" Catherine suffers terribly from migraines, and she has had a constant headache for over a year. She has missed a lot of school, as she is unable to get up in the morning because of her excruciating pain. She was hospitalized for several weeks in a head pain clinic, but she still did not improve. She cannot understand why God allows her to suffer so. I explained the concept that this world is a dream, but that we still seem to suffer within the dream. She surprised me by saying that she and her boyfriend had just been discussing the dream idea. She said, \"What if we just think we're living this life, but we're really only having a dream? Wouldn't that be weird?\" I complimented her for thinking outside the box and told her that her inner wisdom was revealing the truth to her. While the dream concept may seem foreign to many Westerners, the idea has been around a long time in the East. The Hindus call this world \"Maya,\" which means \"illusion.\" The Gnostics and many early Christians also believed that the world was a dream. Buddhism perceives this world as an illusion as well. When I first heard the idea that this world is an illusion, it was in a book about Hinduism. The author was asking God why people have to suffer, and God's answer was to not worry about it since it was only a dream. This author implied that God created this earth, and placed us here to experience the dream. This angered me. I hollered at God, \"I don't care if it's simply a dream; I'm still here and I don't like where You put me!\" This issue of whether God created this world and sent us here is the question A Course in Miracles answers clearly. God neither created this earth, nor did He put us here. We are not really here; we are just imagining that we are. We are asleep, dreaming this world, but our experience is that it is real. In order to change the experience, we need to awaken from the dream. The first step in awakening is to allow the idea that this is a dream, and not resist this concept. We have a choice about whether to wake up, and we need to make a decision to do so for awakening to occur. The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not create it . . . (C-4.1:1-2). My client Gary is a passionate musician, full of life, emotional, and charismatic. Gary raises an objection to the term \"illusion.\" He makes a good point that simply calling this life an illusion seems to invalidate our experiences. He recently met a woman who appears to be his soul mate. They met at a music festival far from their respective homes, and the energy, love, and acceptance between them is mesmerizing. How could this not be real? Gary's right \u2014 it is real. In fact, love is the only thing that is real and never dies. It is their separate physical bodies that aren't real. Physical bodies always decay and die, but the spiritual love between them remains. That's why this love feels so profound, so otherworldly, because it is a symbol of the oneness we have with God. It is the belief in separation, the belief that love can possibly die, that is the illusion. We are asleep, dreaming this world, but our experience is that it is real. In order to change the experience, we need to awaken from the dream.Lorri Coburn will talk about her new book, and answer questions, at the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room on Tuesday, April 24 th, at 7pm, as part of our winter/spring Local Authors' Nights.

We hear about them and see them in health food stores all over. Many of us have had a massage or aromatherapy treatment and can recall experiencing their pleasant smells, but we may not know what essential oils are, how they work, or why it is important that we use only therapeutic grade oils. So what does it mean for an oil to be essential? According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word essential means \"in the absolute or highest sense; thorough, complete; of or pertaining to a thing's essence.\" In Essential Oils Desk Reference, 5 th ed., modern day master oil blender Gary Young, N.D., defines it this way: \"An essential oil is that aromatic, volatile liquid that is in many shrubs, flowers, trees, roots, bushes and seeds and that is usually extracted by steam distillation.\" Because of this steam distillation process, these oils are very concentrated and thus more potent than dried herbs. He adds, \"It requires a large amount of plant material to produce small amounts of a distilled essential oil.\" I have heard this same researcher say that, in a very real sense, the plants give up their lives for us so we can have the medicine we need. It has long been understood that essential oils contain many healing properties (vibrational energies) that invigorate the mind, soul, and physical bodies. Most of us have read about these oils in various ancient writings, including the Judeo-Christian Bible. W ords like \"anointing\" or \"the anointed one\" are often found, as well as actual names of oils used in daily life. Some of these are: cistus, cinnamon, cedar, clove, hyssop, spikenard, frankincense and myrrh. These ancient oils are being distilled again today for their medicinal qualities. There were early pharmacists that dealt directly with essential oils and used them to treat illness. When these oils were steam distilled with great care, they became very potent \u2014 more powerful even than the excellent herbs that these same early scientists had used medicinally . Today, alternative healing practitioners commonly use essential oils as complementary medical treatments that help the body to help itself and heal on a cellular level. Essential oil benefits are many. Depending on the essential oil, these may include properties that are anti-septic, anti-in fl ammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-viral. They are also great detoxifiers, and can help in clearing emotions and restoring hormonal balance. These oil vibrations stimulate glandular function as well as generally oxygenating all cells and systems. Many of these oils have the unique advantage of being able to cross the blood brain barrier . This allows treatment to be given to areas not available using pharmaceuticals. Some essential oils, like frankincense, have anti-tumoral properties and have been known to eliminate aggressive tumors. With so many potential benefits, thousands of people consult the Essential Oils Desk Reference and use the oils at home to treat themselves, their families and their pets. Still, not all essential oils are created equally. Recently, questions have arisen about the quality of \"essential\" oils and their actual therapeutic bene fi ts. Some smell so good, no matter who makes them or how they are made, that one might ask, \"Who cares? If it smells this good, it's good enough for me!\" Lavender is a common scent that frequently meets with this kind of questioning. For centuries, lavender has been known for its skin healing properties. Many of us keep it in the kitchen for first aid. I have experienced immediate relief from the pain of a burn and complete healing of it within 24 hours when using real, therapeutic grade lavender. Some well meaning people experience the disappointment of reaching for their lavender, using it, and discovering that not only does it not help, but it can turn a 1st degree burn into a 2nd degree burn! How is this possible? The oil that harms can hardly be called therapeutic. It has to be an essential, or therapeutic grade, lavender oil to heal the burn. Why is it that not all oils on the market today can be considered \"essential\"? Going back to the process of steam distillation, it has been discovered that each plant/bark/seed needs a special temperature, pressure and time for optimal production of a truly essential (therapeutic grade) oil. If we are interested in perfume grade oil, this careful process need not be followed. When the same plant material is used two or three times for distillation, the resulting oils do not have all the properties of a therapeutic grade oil. In fact, often when a distilled oil is not up to the highest standards, it is sold to the perfume industry or to an \"essential oil\" distributor with lower standards. There is also a growing practice of using chemical solvents to engineer or \"extend\" the oils. The resulting product is an adulterated oil. These oils are not medicinal in quality and will not give healing results when used.The chemistry of essential oils is complex. It takes years of study to understand all of the parts in the oils. There can be from 80-300 different constituents in one oil alone. We can use complete, therapeutic oils without extensive study; however, the more practitioners educate themselves, the better we serve others and the safer they are in our hands. So, to understand the term \"therapeutic grade\" when applied to oils, I decided to study . I learned about the skills involved in carefully studied and practiced steam distillation. I found a source of oils from people who did just that. I learned some chemistry of essential oils. I learned techniques of applying the oils therapeutically and safely . After using these highest quality oils available, I began to experience that my olfactory senses were developing in such a way that I could tell when an oil was \"missing\" something. I also grew to depend on them for my own health. Years ago a young pioneer in the field of essential oils coined the term \"therapeutic grade.\" This was the result of his studies of steam distillation with the European masters in Turkey and France, Egypt and Oman. He understood there was a difference in distillation practices and in the resulting oil quality. Others dismissed the term \"therapeutic\" as foreign and unnecessary. Gradually, though, everyone began to use this term, hoping to make themselves credible in the field of essential oils. They did not change their process or practice, just adopted the term. This has caused much confusion. To avoid continued confusion, one company has trademarked a new label. Whenever we see the trademark Y.L.T.G. (Young Living Therapeutic Grade) on a bottle of oil, we know that the most careful, consistent and up-to-date distillation processes are being used. We also know that the plants, preparation, purity and potency of the oils are guaranteed. All of this knowledge has led me to understand the true meaning of an essential, therapeutic grade oil. I have made a conscious choice to use only the Y.L.T.G. oils to give my clients the best treatments available. If I am paying more money for this privilege, then I am doing it willingly. I deserve it and so do my clients. As my father said, \"You get what you pay for.\" This has never been truer than now, with the opportunity to use Y.L.T.G. essential oils. Nancy Harknett is the proprietor of Hand In Hand Healing, LLC, in Ann Arbor. She gives various essential oil treatments using Y.L.T.G. oils, and is a student in the Certied Clinical Aromatherapy Program through the Institute for Spiritual Healing and Aromatherapy.

I also grew to depend on them for my own health. In a very real sense, the plants give up their lives for us.

Sacred Marching Orders is her explanation of why now is the time for women to step into their power, remain standing in their power, and march forth together as powerful women in service to the planet. What follows are some small sections from her book. What is the Stronghold of the Lunar Feminine? Under the 5,000-year period of patriarchal reign, the lunar has been the only face of the feminine available to us. It is human nature to seek safety and survival. But, these are unprecedented times. The safety and survival of the entire planet is at risk. The lunar is beautiful. She holds tremendous power, the power of Mother Earth, and the Divine Mother. But Mother Earth also demonstrates for us other powers: crashing thunder, bolts of lightning, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes. Mother Earth is more than gentle, receptive, nurturing. We don't know the full extent of how we have affected the weather with our violation of her, but we do know that there is a force of Mother Nature that is not exclusively lunar. The lunar has been around for thousands of years. We've learned how to adapt to survive in the machinery of the patriarchy. This includes engaging in countless ways of relinquishing, denying, and hiding our power \u2014 even from ourselves. We are so acclimated to it, we don't even know we're doing it, or how to do otherwise. As women in a patriarchal world, our function has been to serve others and to subjugate ourselves. In many ways, it's all we know how to do. There are lots of games we play with ourselves; all the while quietly and obediently squelching our voices, compromising, nurturing and serving. What I've discovered is that we have become so acclimated to this \u2014 and so debilitated by it \u2014 that we cling to this familiarity because we've developed deficits in functioning. We don't know how to access our power in a way that allows us to function fearlessly in the world. The solar feminine carries the powerful energy that is our birthright as women, but we're reluctant to access it because the familiar is so inviting and seems so safe. We remain safe and insulated in our circles, in our homes, relying on men to take care of us financially and emotionally. The Emergence of the Solar Feminine The new energies of the solar feminine came onto the planet in 2005, in the 11th hour of any hope to reclaim our power and our planet. It's up to us to decide whether we will set aside our denial, defensiveness, and comfort with the familiar , to access the energy that is now available to us to accomplish this important mission.Now is the time for us to step into our power, remain standing in our power, and march forth together as powerful women in service to the planet. Power is a maligned word. We tend to automatically connect the word power with \"abuse of power.\" Under the patriarchal paradigm, the dominator model of society, this is a common association. But wielding power over others is a violation, not true power, and we are now living through a shift in how power is held. Women's power is key. Feminine power is not a power over, but power with. Collaboration is the basis of the new expression of power, resulting in a feminine leadership style that acknowledges vulnerability and offers support and deep reciprocal listening. This style leads to a feeling of connection, rather than competition, which moves us closer to Oneness and community. The power of connectedness is the kind of power that is necessary now. More individual power at cross-purposes will only make the crises on the planet more extreme. Now is the time to access feminine power on a planetary scale. Our survival as a species is being threatened. We must tend and befriend each other worldwide to buttress this evolutionary leap. Women as a Force of Nature Throughout the writing process of this book, I remained committed to conveying a sense of urgency without eliciting fear. As you read further, I invite you to hear this message with the vehement urgency with which it is written. Let me highlight the most crucial elements of these extraordinary times. As energetic beings living in a universe of energy, there are numerous methods for recharging. One of the most concrete, valuable, and tangible ways to refuel is to focus on beauty. And the beauty of nature is definitely the most powerful source of renewal. Plugging ourselves into the beauty and energy field of the natural world nourishes us and raises our vibration \u2014 simple, clear, concrete, something we can consciously choose. This exercise reestablishes our deep powerful knowing of the sacredness of all life, restoring our severed roots, for ourselves and for all life. As we women reclaim our sacred connection with Mother Earth and all life, we reclaim our power and with the force of Mother Nature say, \"enough is enough!\" It is up to us women now \u2014 who carry the memories of the forces that quieted us \u2014 to reclaim our power with a fierceness that demonstrates the capacity to reverse this trajectory of death prevailing over the sacredness of life. Only we can do this, because we women are a force of nature as we restore our roots and reclaim the sacredness of the natural world.

An Excerpt from Pat Fero's Sacred Marching Orders: Imagining the Solar Feminine at the Dawn of a New Age We've learned how to adapt to survive in the machinery of the patriarchy. This includes engaging in countless ways of relinquishing, denying, and hiding our power \u2014 even from ourselves. Collaboration is the basis of the new expression of power, resulting in a feminine leadership style that acknowledges vulnerability and offers support and deep reciprocal listening. Pat Fero's third book, Sacred Marching Orders, was recently published. Crazy Wisdom has invited her to discuss her new book on Tuesday, March 27th, at 7 pm, and engage with those attending, as part of our winter/spring Local Authors' Nights.

Instrument Exploration Staff Development Conce rts and Assemblies Pre-K-2rd GradeThe More We Get Together Nurturing Relationships Through Music, Play, Books & Art A Resource & Activity GuideSince 1990 $30 DiscountFor New Families An Excerpt from Lorna Brown's Dragonfly Dialogues: Memories of an Awakening Spirit Local author Lorna Brown released her spiritual memoir last summer. Lorna grew up in a traditional Christian church, and in 1972, at age 32, was introduced to the ideas of Jos\u00e9 Silva, among other New Thought philosophers, pr ompting her to create her own belief system and delve deeply into her spiritual growth. Lorna is now a minister, ordained as a Melchizedek Priestess, and has been teaching workshops on topics such as Munay-Ki and Sacred Geometry for the past 18 years. Her book, which is written as a dialogue between herself and Spirit, as r epre- sented by a dragonfly, recounts this journey and encourages readers to listen to their higher self and review how their life has set them up perfectly for their own spiritual awakening. The following excerpt, which concludes the book, tells the powerful story of how Lorna' s decision to follow her intuition changed her ap-proach to treating cancer and to healing herself. One More Opportunity for Growth Dragonfly made his presence known once again when one day he appeared and asked: \"Are you now ready to add that last chapter to your story?\" Somewhat reluctantly I replied: \"I guess I'm now ready.\" A few months ago, after I had written the previous chapter in this narrative, I thought that my story was complete. However, once again I was faced with a situation that was to offer another profound opportunity for growth, and that there was one more chapter to this story. \"Can you share why you are adding another chapter to what you had consid - ered complete?\" he asked. \"Once again life has had a way of interjecting the unexpected. And once again I have had to recall, examine, and mentally and emotionally try to make sense of what has occurred.\" \"Now you know you are piquing our curiosity...\" \"Yes, I'm afraid there is another opportunity for yet another lesson to be shared. It all began several months ago when I discovered what appeared to be a lump in my breast. At first I tried to deny it and ignore it, but after a couple of weeks of vacillating from 'could-it-be' to 'it-can't-be' I decided to have it checked out.\" \"It doesn't sound like you were in a panic about it.\" \"No, I was pretty calm considering the possibility. After going through the standard medical process the ultimate conclusion was Stage II breast cancer . During the days that I went through the process of diagnosis and medical recom - mendations I naturally confronted the usual questions of 'why, why me, why now, how did this happen, who or what can I blame, I am really angry about this, maybe it is my time to die, maybe my work is complete, maybe my work is not complete.'\" \"Given all of the possible answers you might have received to your questions, how did you process this information?\" \"As is my fashion, I truly did explore all of the above questions I had for myself. I especially questioned the fact that I have spent more than 35 years of my life on my active spiritual path, have a good understanding of the mind/body relationship and don't hold grudges or dwell in the past, and I don't abuse my body, and wondered how this could happen to me.\" \"Have you been able to resolve any of your major questions and how did you proceed?\" \"Given my many years of thinking and acting outside of the proverbial box, on my first visit to the Oncology Department I informed the doctor that I was not his typical patient and my desire was to work with and explore all of the alternative methods, ideas and therapies that I knew about, given my extensive network of resources, practitioners and friends.\" \"How did he react to your decision?\" \"He replied that his preference was to be able to use procedures from which he would get a certain expected result, but that if I wanted to do this my way he would order the necessary diagnostic tests that may be required.\" \"How did that work out?\" \"I did proceed with various tests to determine that the rest of my body was clear and I told him I needed some time to process the information in order to formulate my game plan, to which he agreed.\" \"And how did you formulate your game plan?\" \"Well, there were extensive alternate therapies, ideas and books that were sug-gested to me and I intuitively looked into a number of therapies \u2014 some of which I rejected and some of which I pursued. I also obtained a number of books \u2014 some of which I rejected and some of which I pursued. \"I also availed myself of services and modalities offered by many of my friends who are active in the field of alternative energy healing and I was placed on many prayer lists.\" \"It sound like you went about formulating a plan, so what does that plan look like?\" \"Someone referred to my process as 'circling my metaphysical wagons' and I actually looked at my process from a physical, mental and spiritual perspec - tive. These areas have long held an interest for me and this seemed like the way I wanted to proceed. \"I have long advocated the idea of naturally supporting the body with supple - ments and essential oils, so from the physical perspective I followed a program that included natural supplements that support my healing process, along with some supplements that act as cleansing and detoxing agents. \"Many of the books I read also used these modalities along with a strong em - phasis on eating a very clean, healthy and supporting diet.\" \"So, did you have to eliminate all of your favorite foods?\" Dragonfly continued. \"I have not eliminated all of my favorite foods, but I have made some adjust - ments. It is apparent that the standard Western diet has lead to or exacerbated many of our current health problems, including cancer, so I have become very strict about what I put into my body. Since I have rejected the standard medical model I have taken this on as my model for healing my body.Lorna Brown will be a guest speaker at Crazy Wisdom on Tuesday, April 3 rd, at 7pm, to talk about her new book and interact with the audience, as part of our winter/spring Local Authors' Nights. She is a well-regarded spiritual teacher in the region.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 106 \"I eat primarily a vegetarian diet with lots of greens and other or ganic veg- etables, no white sugar, no white flour and no processed foods. I also eat only fruit with a lower sugar content, lots of seeds and dark skins such as blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. At this time that does mean no cakes, no pies, and no ice cream.\" \"Has this been difficult to do?\" \"Sometimes it is not as much fun, but it is really not difficult. It is just something that is necessary at this time, and since I have rejected the standard medical model I have taken this on as my model for healing my body.\" \"How do you feel following this regimen?\" \"I feel great, am never hungry and have also lost a few pounds. I've moved back into my old size 8's.\" \"How do you think the mental perspective has come into play?\" \"I think this has been a crucial component in my journey. Since I have long known about and advocated the concept of the mind/body connection, I also read or re-read many of the books related to healing. \"Since it is apparent to me that sickness and disease can be created or encour - aged by the mind, it is also obvious that healing and curing have a mental compo - nent.\" \"How did you work with this idea?\" \"Of course I had to think about how or why I was in this situation. Was it be- cause I had harbored the wrong thoughts, internalized my emotions, exposed my body to toxic chemicals, ate the wrong food, or just lived on a planet where some toxins cannot be avoided.\" \"Were you able to isolate one culprit?\" \"As much as I tried to point my finger at one specific area, I finally had to con - clude that all of my life may have contributed to my situation, and it was probably a combination of issues and situations.\" \"Do you see a bigger perspective also present?\" \"I had to ask myself, what opportunities may lie in this seeming challenge? Although I am not afraid to die, I think my soul still has work for me to do here. I am not finished. I don't think my life has brought me to this point with what I feel is unfinished business. This could be at a soul level and it could also be at a planetary level. As humans we are about to make a great leap forward in consciousness and I just don't think my job is done. \"Since I do not think my job here is finished and I feel like there is still more for me to do here, I have not collapsed myself into victimhood or taken on a negative attitude regarding my situation. Rather, I have regarded it as presenting me with an opportunity to explore how an illness that some would regard as life-threatening can instead be a vehicle for growth and change. \"How can I work with this to become a person who lives life from a higher perspective, and perhaps even be able to encourage and share ideas with others who may be facing life challenges? I believe we have to acknowledge that situations come to us that are beyond our reasoning mind and we have to accept that therein is contained the element of grace. \"I feel like this is something in my body that has gotten my attention and even before the 'diagnosis' I was being prompted to listen to my intuition.\" \"How does intuition figure into this picture?\" \"This is a part of my story that I have found most interesting. Among other things, the time leading up to the diagnosis was filled with a number of issues with my car. Nancy Tappe, one of my teachers/mentors, has created a whole concept around car issues and what they are trying to tell us, based on the fact that our car is such an integral part of our life style.\" \"That sounds different, but pretty interesting.\" \"My car had issues with heavy wheel vibration, two brake repairs and a flat tire. Within Nancy's concept all of these things were telling me I was out of balance, losing energy and needed to slow down and readjust my priorities. At the same time my writings were encouraging me to listen and pay attention to my intuition, which I did in having some medical tests, which resulted in the diagnosis. \"But the clincher for the intuition came in a very dramatic way .\" \"OK - give us the story...\" \"It was a drizzly day when I made my first visit to the oncologist, after the vari - ous tests had been completed. As already stated, he shared with me his observations and recommendations for treatment, which included the standard 'slash and burn.' Since I had told him I was not his typical patient and wanted to think about it and also look into some alternatives, he agreed. \"As I left the office and went to my car in the parking lot I found that someone had smashed my driver's side window and stolen my GPS.\" \"That's quite a shock, so what was your reaction?\" \"My first reaction was to be angry and 'pissed.' Why did this happen, etc., etc., etc.? I made a police report, cleaned up the glass as best I could, found a towel in my trunk to partially cover the window and keep out the rain and headed toward home. \"A bit later, in assessing the situation from a metaphysical perspective and us-ing the information I had about automobiles in our life, I was able to formulate a message. \"Through journaling and listening to my intuition I concluded that this incident was the way for my Soul to get my attention in a manner I could not ignore. My as-sessment is the following: \"The left window was broken because there was something I was not seeing clearly in the outside world and left side is right brain or intuitive. The GPS is an automated system for navigation and it was stolen so that I could not rely on an automated system, but should listen to and follow my own intuition. Since this happened outside of the Oncology Department, I was not to follow the automated system for my treatment, but was to follow my own navigational system. This was a very significant and powerful message to me. It also acted as a confirma-tion of what I was already considering.\" \"Did those close to you agree with your decisions?\" \"Not totally, but in the end it is my life and my decision, so they are all sup-portive.\" \"How does the oncologist feel about this?\" \"When I went back for a follow-up visit to reas-sess my options and decisions, he said, 'what you are doing is not the way I would proceed, but keep doing what you are doing. You could live like this for 30 years.' I took that as a positive statement. I have subsequently received other positive feedback and continue to experience good health. \"So, right now I'll keep doing what I'm doing. I will continue to eat a very clean and supportive diet, I will continue to support my body with natural supple - ments and alternative therapies, and I will continue to maintain a positive attitude regarding my body, knowing that I will be here on planet Earth for as long as my Higher Self wants me here, in order to further serve the growth of my Soul, and possibly also continue to be of service to humanity in ways I am not now even aware of.\" The Gift \"Given all that has transpired within this opportunity, how would you summarize the gift?\" asked Dragonfly. \"Life may not unfold in the way that our minds think it will, but it will unfold according to the plans of our soul. Life always provides new opportunities for growth if we are willing to be open to the broader perspective. I know that my life is not yet finished, so as the old saying goes: when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.\" Lorna Brown has been a spiritual teacher and workshop leader for over 35 years, covering a wide variety of metaphysical subjects.

Postscript to the final chapter ~The Book of Wisdom: Opportunity By Lorna Brown As you sit here on this beautiful sum- mer day listening to the many birds that fly and chatter around you, with a soft breeze stirring the leaves and grasses, you can observe that all of life speaks with the energy of creation. Life is here and life is everywhere. Nothing is ever lost or destroyed. Your time here on the planet will continue for you have a message to share and a spark to ignite. The time in which you now live is an auspicious time of opportunity for change and growth. You also listen to your intuition, for it is in this way that your Soul or Higher Self communicates with you, if you will but listen. Sometimes the message can be very dramatic and sometimes it is in a small whisper, but the key is to listen from your heart. Life is still one breath at a time, one step at a time, one day at a time. So live your life as though every moment is a gift, both to yourself and to the world. Think of ways in which you can truly live your life with meaning and purpose. You didn't grow yourself up to who and where you are today to ignore this gift, so live life fully for yourself and for the world, in whatever way that may take shape for you. As humans we are about to make a great leap forward in consciousness and I just don't think my job is done.This incident was the way for my Soul to get my attention in a manner I could not ignore.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 107 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2012 Page 108 Business Card DirectoryAcupuncture the Arts/Dance/ Music/Writing Childbirth Energy Healing Essential Oils S u p p o r t f o r a l l t h e w a y s y o u r b e i n g m o v e s Caroline Charlesworth CO N S C I O U S BO D Y W O R K M a s s a g e E n e r g y Wo r k G r a d u a t e , B a r b a r a B r e n n a n S c h o o l o f H e a l i n g 734.485.8485 Kathleen Moore singer, songwriter, voice teacher, certified music therapist, & certified teacher of the Alexander Technique(734) 668-8146 kathy@kathymoorevoice.com www.kathymoorevoice.com Gym Giovino Specialist, trained by SMSBODY BALANCE Hellerwork and Structural Medicine 708 W.
