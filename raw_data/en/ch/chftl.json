(If you can't stand watching the embedded video of the segment, the transcript is [here](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0904/03/lkl.01.html).) Fortunately for me (and, I hope, you), a \"friend\" of mine has written a [comprehensive takedown](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445) of not just the nonsense spewed by Jenny and Jim, but of a new \"study\" released by Generation Rescue purporting to show that nations with low numbers of mandatory vaccines have low levels of autism. Of course, it shows nothing of the sort. Find out why at [Science-Based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445). Given that there was so much misinformation packed into a ten minute segment that there was no way for a single post to cover it all, feel free to help out by picking your favorite bit of nonsense and deconstructing it in the comments below. Also check out these glorious additional deconstructions of J.B. Handley's nonsense: [One Handley Turd I Left Out](http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2009/04/one-handley-turd-i-left-out.html)(this latter one rips apart Handley's claims about autism epidemiology in Sweden, Finland, and Norway) [Log in](/user/login?destination=/insolence/2009/04/06/the-jenny-and-jim-show-on-larry-king-liv%23comment-form)to post comments "}
