The COVID-19 global pandemic was triggered by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2). The first outbreak was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but then rapidly spread throughout the world.1 In Canada, the pandemic was declared in March 2020, leading to federal and provincial public health regulations aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. As of August 8, 2022, Canada has had more than four million reported cases, with 171 million cases worldwide.2 Since vaccination for COVID-19 and the widespread use of home testing kits, many positive cases are not being reported, so the number of cases is likely much higher. The Canadian government reports 43,505 deaths due to COVID-19, with a national average death rate of 114 persons per 100,000.2 As of August 8, 2022,3 the World Health Organization Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard has identified 594,367,247 reported cases and 6,541,016 COVID-19 deaths worldwide. Again, these numbers only represent reported statistics and are changing daily. As a snapshot of the situation in Canada, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario was 10,655 for the week of August 7 to August 13, 2022.2 COVID-19 continues to mutate and create variants of concern, and it is unlikely that this pandemic will be over anytime soon.
