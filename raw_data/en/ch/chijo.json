YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT Acupuncture In the Initial Eval + Acupuncture treatment (80min), your acupuncturist will conduct a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) exam and medical intake as well as a review of your health history. This will be followed by acupuncture and adjunctive therapies as needed and for what time allows: cupping, gua sha, moxibustion, and more depending on your . We may incorporate herbs, nutrition, lifestyle counseling, and a flower essence consult if indicated for emotional, homeopathic support. A written report will also be emailed to you afterwards which will include a TCM diagnosis, supplement & nutrition recommendations, and frequency of visits needed to see results. This type of appointment is recommended most to those with little to no experience with acupuncture, or if you've had acupuncture in the past but wanting to start treatment for a new condition/concern. If you've had acupuncture multiple times before and you are coming in for a continuation of treatment from your last acupuncturist, you may opt for the Initial Acupuncture for Acu Pros (50min) visit instead. This session is also a great fit for first time visits for young adults or children 10 years old and above who might not need as much time on the treatment table. This treatment is also recommended for past Source Healing patients that haven't been treated in 3 years or more. Bodywork + Massage Therapeutic massage is recommended for general stress and tension, as well as chronic pain conditions that have lasted days, weeks, even months. Asian Bodywork includes a combination of therapies based on time allowance: Zen Shiatsu, Acupressure/Tui Na, Thai bodywork and stretching. Craniosacral Therapy is a gentle and relaxing form of bodywork that focuses on flow of cerebral spinal fluid and movement of fascia around the neck, spinal column, and sacrum which can ultimately have a healing effect on the entire body. Your practitioner will also include guided meditation and breath-work. *Tips are included in all massage services rates. Tips are NOT our clinic's standard, but if you are pleased with your service, we welcome you to leave a review. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Consult (Online or In-Person) Not sure where to start, or perhaps you're curious on how acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can help your specific condition? In an In-Person or Online Consultation, one of our acupuncturists will conduct a TCM exam and intake as well as review your health history and get to know you as an individual. Your tongue may also be observed, which is a traditional method to diagnose internal imbalances and offers observable, objective information about the state of blood circulation, hydration, digestion, energy levels, and so much more. Recommendation on a treatment plan moving forward will be provided, and may include other recommendations such as supplements, Chinese herbs, lifestyle adjustments, Eastern nutrition, homeopathic remedies, or more when applicable. After your consultation, book a Follow-Up (50min or 25min) for your next in-person visit. If your session is online, being on camera is optional, however you may be asked to turn on your camera for a brief examination of your tongue, as lined out in the paragraph above. After your consultation, book a Follow-Up (50min or 25min) for your next in-person visit. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Except for payment and filled out online intake forms, you do not need to bring anything on your treatment day. Most medical information will be addressed in our personal health intake form. If you are coming in for a specific injury or pain management issue, you can bring any medical records pertaining to that injury if you have it, but it is not necessary. *Tips are included in all massage services rates. Tips are NOT our clinic's standard, but if you are pleased with your service, we welcome you to leave a review. For acupuncture, no special clothing is required on the day of your treatment. For a standard acupuncture session, wear comfortable loose-fitting clothes. For a massage session, please arrive wearing clothes that are comfortable to move and stretch in. Depending on the area of focus on your body, you may be required to remove some articles of clothing to allow for more direct contact. Before + after treatment Before all in-person services, it is wise to have something light to eat and to be hydrated. After acupuncture, it is normal to feel relaxed or light-headed immediately following treatment. Most people go about their normal work day after a treatment, but we recommend giving yourself some extra time to relax and ease into the remainder of your day, especially if this is your first time experiencing acupuncture.
