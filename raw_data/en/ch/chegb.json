This bill should pass and if it does not I'll be actively opting out of Maine's workforce. It is an absolute assault on our freedom and I'm afraid that if we go ahead with this tyranny our world will look like that imagined by Orwell. Those in favor of enacting draconian vaccine mandates in the name of \"health and public safety\" are either fooled by the media (who is on the payroll of the pharmaceutical industry) or themselves on the payroll of big pharma. Instead of relying on dangerous and unproven vaccines (did you know Pfizer unblinded the control group before the safety trials were finished??), we could be giving free vitamin d to everyone instead of trying to censor the efficacy of a VITAMIN. If you are interested in hearing more about the vitamin d discussion by two evidence based scientists, google vitamin d and dark horse podcast. Vitamin D censorship is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the censorship of effective treatments. An expert testimony to Congress on alternative treatments for COVID was banned from YouTube. If science can't be challenged, it's propaganda people!!! Anyways, I've never been more appalled than when someone who smokes cigarettes and is overweight lectured me on receiving the vaccine to keep him and my community safe. Do you know what I do, and many people who are choosing not to get this experimental gene therapy do? We exercise, meditate, eat healthy vegetables from our garden, we limit sugar, avoid smoking and alcohol, take vitamins and supplements and herbs grown in our backyards. When on the rare occasion that we do get sick, we self isolate and rest and get better and then our adaptive immune system does its job and we are stronger for it. It would be one thing if we were facing something like polio or smallpox, but the vast majority of people who get COVID recover. And those who don't had a pre-existing condition that desperately needed to be addressed before COVID. Let's stop acting the victim and take our health into our own hands instead of putting it in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry, who time and time again has proven they don't have our best interest in mind-because let's face it, our best interest, health, is not how they make money. They make money off of the sick "}
