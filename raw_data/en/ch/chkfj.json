Students requesting an exemption for medical reasons will be required to submit a statement from a doctor or advanced practice nurse explaining the medical contraindication and the time period for which the exemption is being requested. Medical exemptions are reviewed annually. Please note: For those granted exemptions, on-campus participation is not guaranteed, and is dependent on the overall course of the pandemic, the rate and efficacy of vaccination, and the student's academic program.

There will be several remote course offerings, but these will be offered for single courses rather than entire programs. It is important for students to understand that face-to-face, remote, and online course offerings will vary according to their course of study and confirmed through their course planning module. Some courses may be offered in a hybrid fashion, a mix of online and face-to-face class meetings. - - Some academic units at Rutgers offer fully online degree-granting programs, and students are encouraged to pursue those opportunities if these align with their interests. - - As stated in a university [update](https://global.rutgers.edu/all-alerts)issued May 28, 2021, for international students outside of the United States who cannot receive a [U.S. FDA EUA-authorized vaccine](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Femergency-preparedness-and-response%2Fcoronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19%2Fcovid-19-vaccines&data=04%7C01%7Cmeagher%40oq.rutgers.edu%7C0f6d921f79ae46e1532708d9252d3001%7Cb92d2b234d35447093ff69aca6632ffe%7C1%7C0%7C637581698266554222%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=ILMdOSpdfCvDrIRUM%2BYdx%2FgMpHdQUYECISbjbO6cLoc%3D&reserved=0)(currently Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Janssen-J&J), and who have been vaccinated in their home country, Rutgers will now accept proof of vaccination by a [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines)authorized vaccine (e.g., AstraZeneca, SinoPharm BIBP).

For additional information for international students, read [Rutgers Global's COVID-19-related FAQ](https://global.rutgers.edu/covid-19-international-student-faqs). - - The FDA has approved the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and continues to authorize other vaccines for emergency use in the United States; these vaccines also have been recommended for use by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Since announcing a vaccination requirement for students in March 2021, Rutgers has stated that its position on vaccines is consistent with the legal authority supporting this policy, which has been thoroughly reviewed by our Office of General Counsel. - - COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters are readily available at pharmacies, clinics, and physician offices. There are many other vaccine locations throughout the State of New Jersey. See the [State's vaccine hub](https://covid19.nj.gov/pages/covid-19-vaccine-locations)for a list of vaccine locations in New Jersey. - - No. The State Department of Health has made clear that no one will have to pay for the vaccine. There is no out-of-pocket cost to get a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of location. If you have health insurance your insurance company may be billed, but costs will not be passed on to you.

COVID-19 Vaccine for Rutgers Employees - - Yes, Rutgers is requiring all university employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, regardless of your unit at Rutgers or whether you work remotely. All employees are required to upload proof of full vaccination to the [Rutgers Vaccination Portal](https://rtr.ipo.rutgers.edu/vaccines/). Any employee seeking a religious exemption for the required Covid-19 vaccination, regardless of covered individual status, may access exemption request information under [University Policy 60.1.35](https://policies.rutgers.edu/file/3711/download?token=ATQr3JxK). As of May 16, 2023, booster doses will no longer be required unless an individual falls within the definition of a \"Covered Individual\" set forth in [University Policy 100.3.1](https://policies.rutgers.edu/10031-currentpdf). Vaccines and boosters are readily available at pharmacies, clinics, and physician offices. - - Failure to provide proof of full vaccination and booster (if required) or receive a university-approved exemption, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. - - Yes. All Rutgers employees, including PTLs, Type 4 employees, and other part-time workers, are subject to the vaccination and booster (if required) mandates. - - On September 9, 2021, President Joe Biden signed [Executive Order 14042](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-adequate-covid-safety-protocols-for-federal-contractors/)requiring vaccination against COVID-19 for many employees of federal contractors and others. Subsequently, the Federal Worker Safety Task Force issued guidance clarifying the vaccination mandate, and it is now clear that Rutgers University must comply with the Executive Order because the university is both a federal contractor and, in many instances, a federal subcontractor. We hold hundreds of direct federal contracts and are involved through many relationships in countless subcontracts, which we anticipate will include vaccination requirements pursuant to the Executive Order. Additionally, vaccination will help protect the health and safety of all members of the university community and the people with whom they interact. Therefore, to ensure compliance with the Executive Order and Task Force guidance and to protect the health and safety of the university community, all Rutgers employees are required to be vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. Medical and religious exemptions are the only permissible exceptions. - - Exemptions for medical and religious reasons are the only permissible exceptions. Any employee seeking a medical or religious exemption for the required COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of covered individual status, may access exemption request information under [University Policy 60.1.35.](https://policies.rutgers.edu/file/3711/download?token=ATQr3JxK) - - No, Covered Individuals, including health care and public safety personnel (see [Policy 100.3.1](https://policies.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/100-3-1-current.pdf)), who received an exemption from COVID-19 vaccination from Rutgers, do not need to apply again. - - As of May 16, 2023, the university's COVID-19 testing program and requirement ended. - - Yes.

General COVID-19 Vaccine Questions - - A vaccine is a product that stimulates a person's immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body's natural defenses\u2014the immune system\u2014to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. If the body is exposed to those disease-causing germs later, the body is immediately ready to destroy them, preventing illness. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks to decrease mortality. Vaccines currently prevent millions of deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, and influenza. - - Prevention of infection is key. Public health officials and medical experts believe vaccination is an important step in helping to prevent or lessen the effects of this illness and its potentially devastating consequences. COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) can be a mild illness in some or lead to severe disease or even death in previously healthy people. Additionally, long-term complications of COVID-19 remain unknown. Many treatments and medications are being studied, but there is currently no cure. - - Every vaccine must be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it is made available to the American public. The CDC currently [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)1 dose of a bivalent vaccine to all over the age of 6 months, regardless of past vaccination. - - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for making sure that, just like any medications, any FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. - - Please review [CDC guidance regarding booster shot eligibility](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html). The CDC currently [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)1 dose of a bivalent vaccine to all over the age of 6 months, regardless of past vaccination. - - [According to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html)you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit. - - If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend discussing with your physician whether you should get the vaccine. - - If you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have scheduled an appointment to receive the vaccine and are not feeling well on the day of vaccination, it is best to reschedule your vaccine appointment. If you have symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection, evaluation and testing as is appropriate from health care resources in your community is recommended. - - The most common side effects are headache, cough, and muscle pain. These are more common after the second dose and are usually of short duration, lasting for less than 24 hours. There is also a potential for injection site reactions (redness, swelling, and pain, which are common and more severe after the second dose), as well as fatigue, chills, fever, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. These are common adverse reactions seen with other vaccines. There may be other reactions that are not currently known. If you experience common side effects from the vaccine it is still necessary to receive the second dose for the vaccine to be effective. If you have experienced a very severe allergic reaction in the past requiring emergency care, you should consult your primary care provider before receiving the vaccine. - - If you experience an adverse reaction to the vaccine you should call your primary care physician. - - You should contact your primary care physician or other provider to discuss your concerns.
