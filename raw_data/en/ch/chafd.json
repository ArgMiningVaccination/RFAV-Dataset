As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. Please read my [disclosure](/privacypolicy/). Are you looking for the healthiest children's vitamins on the market today? This post (which I update monthly) will help you find the best one for your child! Note: If you are looking vitamins for adults I've got you covered with my updated [best adult vitamins](https://pickyeaterblog.com/best-daily-adult-vitamins-help-boost-immunity/) article. Kids Vitamins can be confusing. There are so many questions: Is there a such thing as an \"unhealthy\" kids vitamin? Do you need a vitamin with iron? Which vitamins are the best? Do kids even need vitamins at all? A lot of these questions can be really overwhelming because there is so much information out there! So I did a bunch of research and found the healthiest kids vitamins out there today. This is your guide for the best multivitamins for kids: what to buy, what not to buy, and what to look out for! First of all, do kids even need vitamins to begin with? Most pediatricians will tell you that it's not necessary for most healthy children who are growing normally ( [source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/multivitamins/faq-20058310)). For kids who eat well and eat a variety of food, they can get all of the nutrients they need from whole foods. But many kids are very picky, or don't eat a lot of food, or aren't growing well, and that makes a lot of parents worried that they aren't getting the nutrients they need! In those cases, I'd recommend talking to your pediatrician, and if they suggest giving your child a multivitamin then definitely do so. When buying a multivitamin, what should you look for? [Kids multivitamins](https://pickyeaterblog.com/hiya-vitamins-review/) generally come in two groups: 1) With Iron and 2) Without Iron. You should buy a multivitamin that doesn't exceed 100% daily value of most of the vitamins for your child's age group - primarily Vitamins A, E and K (that will be indicated by the label on the back). The exception here is for Vitamin C and other water-soluble vitamins. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin but is ok to have at more than 100% of the daily value because most people are deficient (including kids) and Vitamin D isn't toxic unless it's in exceptionally high doses which wouldn't be in a daily vitamin. If the vitamin does have more than 100% of A, E and K then I would just give your child half the dose on the bottle.

What's the healthiest children's vitamin out there? Luckily there are tons of options! Below is a list of my favorites: they all are made with natural ingredients, have no weird preservatives or any of the ingredients above added, and a few even derive the vitamins from [organic food](https://pickyeaterblog.com/when-should-you-buy-organic-foods/) sources which I absolutely love because they are better absorbed by the body that way. Most of these will have a tiny bit of cane sugar or fructose added, but as long as it's less than 4g per serving it's not a huge issue.

I generally recommend supplementing with iron if your child has been tested and is iron-deficient (otherwise supplementing with iron is not necessary for most kids). The two best iron-only supplements are: [Best Nest Liquid Iron For Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Nest-Supplement-Chocolate-Wellness/dp/B01MU3B9WT?maas=maas_adg_3EF51E35EFFCA149908F69958BB589A0_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas): Formulated for kids aged 1+ (check dosing with your pediatrician), tastes great, easily absorbed.

[Gaia Herbs](https://rstyle.me/+XQLpujfBnwKMkVgwRm3sUw): Use for older children (or with pediatrician's approval for babies), non GMO The Healthiest Children's Omega 3 Supplements The primary Omega 3 supplement I'd recommend for kids is [Nordic Naturals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T7DYOO/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=ktgBWNKlNC3j4aYViEdVUA&slotNum=30&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004T7DYOO&linkCode=w61&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=c240baad59c34201ec5b4d543b3b348c).

[Children's Best Gummy DHA](https://www.evitamins.com/essential-dha-childrens-best-349430?affref=14616) is the best gummy Omega 3 supplement I've found, and [ChildLife Cod Liver Oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009LHZD0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0009LHZD0&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=53ac41ca3175bdf42d2dedc9250caf2f) is also a good option for kids starting at 6 months of age! The Healthiest Children's Vitamin D Supplement If you're looking for a gummy Vitamin D supplement for kids, I love [these Vitamin D gummies from Llama Naturals](https://www.llamanaturals.com/products/vitamin-d3?ghref=4443%3A38935) (and as a bonus, adults can use them too!). If you're looking for a liquid Vitamin D supplement for babies, toddlers, and older kids, I love these [Vitamin D Drops from Raise them Well](https://raisethemwell.com/products/baby-vitamin-d-and-k-drops-for-ultimate-bone-and-teeth-health-controlled-dropper-tip-for-precise-1-drop-dosing-400-ius-of-vitamin-d3-per-drop-365-servings-0-36-fl-oz10-ml?afmc=5t). There is literally nothing added to them (no flavors, colors, etc.). They are liquid and you only need one drop in your child's milk per day. They're marketed for infants, but you can use them for any age. Super easy, tasteless and pure. For two other great options, [BabyD Drops](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CT36NE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003CT36NE&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=22c0d7870a090bf285d35d9c6a14bfa1) and [UpSpring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X4DJ3YY/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=ktgBWNKlNC3j4aYViEdVUA&slotNum=35&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00X4DJ3YY&linkCode=w61&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=c0887835946d90445811ad3f18c4a050) makes a pure liquid Vitamin D supplement as well. The Best Vitamin C For Kids Many of you have asked me for my thoughts around Vitamin C supplements for kids. Here are my picks for the healthiest, best Vitamin C for kids. If you're looking for a chewable vitamin, I recommend [Raise Them Well Children's Immunity Chewable](https://raisethemwell.com/collections/vitamins-and-supplements/products/childrens-immunity-chewable-with-all-natural-colors-flavors-and-sweeteners?afmc=74) with Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin K and Zinc. If you're looking for a gummy, I recommend [Llama Naturals Vitamin C with Elderberry added](https://www.llamanaturals.com/products/kids-elderberry-immunity-gummies?ghref=4443%3A38935), or [Children's Best Organic Immune Gummy (with Elderberry)](https://www.evitamins.com/immune-support-plus-childrens-best-360762?affref=14616). Other good gummy options include [Olly Kids Immunity](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F7VS6T8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01F7VS6T8&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=48b3907f074b5c5d9d9cebaed482b249&th=1) or [WellVites](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NQR229Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07NQR229Y&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=d42d96919830c228d886129d45635917). If you're looking for a liquid vitamin, I like [Mary Ruth's Liquid Vitamin C](https://rstyle.me/+XwBVbYn9elJmz4txJs2LdQ) or [ChildLife Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H9R1KA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006H9R1KA&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=d51d0a6ef9db7b825fd03f0e1b6b35d7). And if you're looking for a gummy for older kids/adults, I like [Mary Ruth's Vitamin C Gummies](https://rstyle.me/+Wq1tfxHNbti8ghwU6UI99Q). Lastly, if you're looking for the best elderberry supplement for kids, I like [Gaia Herbs Elderberry](https://rstyle.me/+9rSuOJlIemQFBLJyP4xBiQ), and for an all-natural, sugar-free immune booster for kids using Beta Glucan, I love [Beta Kids Gummies](https://betakids.com/products/beta-kids-immune-support-gummies?rfsn=6117311.166b8eb&utm_source=refersion&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=6117311.166b8eb)! The Healthiest Probiotics Supplements For Kids I love [Garden of Life's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H9O4VG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004H9O4VG&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=a846ea8d18e5fee23184313910ae0a4e) line of probiotics - they are shipped cold and their [powdered kids probiotic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H9O4VG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004H9O4VG&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=a846ea8d18e5fee23184313910ae0a4e) can be added to your child's drink (milk, water, etc.). They also have a [kids' chewable probiotic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074JLL5KS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B074JLL5KS&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=8161b4b68045e878f82196adaaba44a1) if you need an option that doesn't require refrigeration (but it does have maltodextrin). If you're looking for an organic gummy probiotic, I like [Children's Best](https://www.evitamins.com/probiotic-gummies-childrens-best-360403?affref=14616). If you're looking for a liquid probiotic, I recommend [this organic liquid probiotic from Go Healthy Natural](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RRYX98K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07RRYX98K&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=a2815a8393ba9382e7bdb16fd26f279a). Four other probiotic options that I like Probiotic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXXZKCW/ref=as_li_tl?imprToken=ktgBWNKlNC3j4aYViEdVUA&slotNum=41&ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MXXZKCW&linkCode=w61&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=9c5368d8d06c6370d3e5dd3c3d9009f7) (the only caveat with Dr. MK's is that it's sweetened with sorbitol which is a sugar alcohol). The Healthiest Prebiotic Supplement for Kids There is only [one prebiotic](https://www.beginhealth.com/products/growing-up-prebiotics?ref=gwtmo367fyk_) I've found that's safe for toddlers and kids, and has super high quality ingredients and no stabilizers or artificial flavors/colors added. I recommend [BeginHealth](https://www.beginhealth.com/products/growing-up-prebiotics?ref=gwtmo367fyk_) if you are looking to supplement with a prebiotic for your child. It contains only three ingredients: 2'FL HMO (Human Milk Oligosaccharide) - with a Molecular structure identical to the one found in breast milk, Oligofructose (Chicory root fiber), and avocado oil. It's super clean and really effective! Learn more about the [best probiotics for kids](https://pickyeaterblog.com/the-5-best-probiotics-for-kids/) in my article where I answer all your questions about the topic. What Ingredients Should Be Avoided In Kids Vitamins? It's also important to look for the ingredients that are added to the tablet that aren't vitamins. Ingredients like: Sorbitol, carrageenan, artificial colors and flavors (like Red #40), aspartame, sucralose, to name a few! You definitely don't want to be dosing your child with these ingredients on a daily basis along with their multivitamin. So let's start with what not to buy: The answer here is most of the commercially available, leading brands of multivitamins. The biggest offender of which is Flinstones Chewable Vitamins. What's crazy is that on the label, Flinstones calls out that they are \"Pediatrician's #1 Choice.\" And most people do buy Flinstones vitamins! I even remember eating them when I was a kid. They tasted so good! It was like a treat every morning. And if you are giving your kids Flinstones vitamins right now, don't feel bad! You are not alone, and thanks to all of the deceptive marketing out there, there's no way you'd know that Flinstones isn't the best choice for any child. Before doing all of this research I didn't realize how problematic they were, and why it's important to switch away from them. The reason they are problematic, is because there are a ridiculous number of offensive ingredients in Flinstones Vitamins that truly, should not be there at all, and are not necessary. Take a look at two of their best sellers (I've highlighted in bold all of the ingredients to avoid): #1 | Flavors, Microcrystalline Cellulose), Sucralose, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Acetate, Zinc Oxide. Why are these ingredients bad? Let's take them one by one: - Sorbitol and Mannitol are sugar alcohols. Some sugar alcohols can cause digestive issues and discomfort in some people because they can't be digested properly by the body. Mannitol is typically better tolerated than sorbitol, so in choosing between the two, I would avoid sorbitol over mannitol. - Carrageenan is an emulsifier that thickens products, but it has been linked to high levels of inflammation in the body, digestive issues, etc. - Maltodextrin: this is an indicator that the food is highly processed. It's used as a thickener, filler, or preservative in many processed foods, and it can cause spikes in your blood sugar because it has a high glycemic index. - Natural and Artificial Colors - Red #40, Blue #2, Yellow #6. What are these doing in a kids vitamin? These are so problematic and have been [linked to all kinds of health problems](https://www.eatingwell.com/food_news_origins/food_news/the_hidden_health_risks_of_food_dyes)including allergies, hyperactivity, learning impairment, irritability and aggressiveness. - Artificial flavors - also highly processed and unnecessary in a kids vitamin. - Aspartame and Sucralose - this is what diet sodas are sweetened with, and are highly controversial. Research hasn't proven one way or the other whether they lead to long term health issues, but it has been proven that they cause an insulin-response by the body (because your body thinks you are eating sugar when you are not - [source](https://www.prevention.com/food/healthy-eating-tips/health-risks-sucralose)). If you wouldn't give your child a diet coke, you shouldn't give them a vitamin with this in it! - Mono- and Diglycerides is one of the most widely used emulsifers to keep oil and fat from separating. It's just an indicator that the food is processed. - Oh, and gelatin. While this isn't a harmful ingredient, it kind of sucks for any vegetarians or vegans out there who are giving their kids this vitamin without knowing that it's not actually veggie-friendly. Runner Ups / Children's Supplements That Are Borderline [Solgar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TN4EO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0001TN4EO&linkCode=as2&tag=thepiceat01-20&linkId=a0e9b2a3ee8793fdb3ef9586b1f2a06d). This is one I'd get only if you can't find any of the other ones on the list above, because while most of the ingredients are good, it does have carrageenan which - as I mentioned - it's better to avoid.

It's also good for kids with MTHFR mutations. But I am waiting for a response from the company on the prop 65 warning on its label, so I've moved them down here for now!)
