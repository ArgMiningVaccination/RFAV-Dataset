What is acupuncture, and how does it work? Acupuncture comes from the Latin term meaning \"needle prick\". It refers to the act of placing needles in specific points of the body to manipulate electrical and nerve pathways responsible for pain. In ancient Chinese medical philosophy, disease is the result of an energy imbalance in the body. Acupuncture is believed to balance this energy through needle pricks, assisting the body to heal disease. Today, acupuncture stimulates nerves, increases blood circulation, relieves muscle spasms, and releases hormones, such as endorphins. This triggers physiological changes that can help treat a wide range of ailments. What is acupuncture used to treat? Most commonly, acupuncture is used to treat chronic pain conditions or restore normal function to a disturbed organ. In dogs, this may include hip dysplasia, back pain, osteoarthritis, panosteitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In cats, this may include asthma, megaesophagus, and renal failure. Of course, the duration and number of treatments needed does vary based on the type of ailment or how long it has occurred. Certain acute injuries can be treated with one session, while more chronic issues may require ongoing treatment. Is it safe? Yes! As a general rule, acupuncture is relatively painless. Some animals may feel slight pain upon initial needle insertion, but there should be no pain once the needles are in place. While side effects of acupuncture are rare, they do exist. In some animals, it may cause the ailment to become worse for up to 48 hours after treatment. Other animals may become lethargic or sleepy for 24 hours following a session. However, these side effects indicate that physiological changes are developing, and they are often followed by an improvement in the animal's condition. All in all, acupuncture is one of the safest forms of medical treatment for animals when it is administered by a properly trained veterinarian. Fortunately, our own Dr. Emily Bartlett is certified and properly trained in the practice, offering the highest quality care for dogs and cats alike.
