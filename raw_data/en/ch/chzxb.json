You can always find a reason to be offended by anyone, the trick is to teach yourself to listen to or read criticism of your pet idea without reacting (emotionally or verbally) as if they were calling your baby ugly. Look for and respond to the underlying message, not the meaningless fluff surrounding it, however offensive, abusive, etc., you find that fluff. Besides, people who regularly throw intentionally provoking verbage out are usually trying to gain an advantage therby and most times are nonplussed when you give their gambit no response. This is really hard to do sometimes, but it is an important skill to learn. | 5) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Jul 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I went to that last concert and remember being shocked and saddened to learn of his death.

Breaking the law is, by definition, wrong. This means that illegal immigration is wrong. End of lesson. What is a good or a bad idea? What is legal or illegal? What is right or wrong? What is good and what is a sin? Illegal = wrong? Sorry, I do not think so. Many examples could be discussed. The legal drinking age in the USA was 18. Now it's 21. So, was it wrong for all those 18-20 year olds to be drinking before the age was raised? It sounds to me it was more about legislating over good and bad ideas, not what's right and wrong. There are people who are 21, 30, 50 and so on who still cannot handle alcohol well. Are there people who handle it well? Could any of those people be 18? Even 16? Not that I'd want to find out. I've seen enough people who cannot handle it that it seems like a bad idea to let someone 16 or 18 drink alcohol. So, now it's a law: no alcohol for people in the USA before 21. But does it make it wrong if someone drinks it before 21? Nope. It's illegal and worse it could be a very bad idea for that person. No Sarge, you are comnpletely wrong in concept. If you have a problem with a law, there is a simple procedure to follow to correct the problem. All you have to do is get the law repealed or changed to fit your view of what is right. Breaking the law is always wrong. You may object to the law, in which case you are welcome to enter the political arena and get the law changed or repealed whichever suits you. But breaking the law is wrong. A foreigner entering the US without permission from the US is breaking the law and that is wrong, because that foreigner is breaking the law, which is wrong. If you wish to change the law, contact your Senator and/or Congressman and suggest that they support changing the law so that the law agrees with your view, then a foreigner entering the country without permission would be legal and not wrong. Or you could run for the Senate or Congressional seat from your locality and submit the legislation your self so that a foreigner entering the US without US government permission is legal and not wrong. Please note that no country in the world allows this and, possibly, do some research as to why that is the case. | 10) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 15 Jun 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: It is now proverbial in Washington to remark that there is no proof linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, and this is certainly true. But, by the very same token, there is also no proof in the public domain anywhere that adds up to a case against Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. This statement is incorrect on two counts: - There is documentary proof from the documents of the Hussein government which describe contact with and support provided to al Qaeda. - Osama Bin Laden and his attendant cowards have bragged repeatedly in print and on video tape about how al Qaeda has bravely flown planes into buildings, cut the head off of reporters and murdered children & women. These documents and videos are \"in the public domain\", so if you do not believe anyone else, believe the words of the horses ass himself, Osama Bin Laden. | 11) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Jun 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: To immigrate illegally is, by definition, to break the law.

James Hansen, NASA's top official on climate change, said: ...\"He seemed unaware that 170 nations agreed that climate change is a serious problem with enormous repercussions, and that many people will suffer if it is not addressed.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Dr. Griffin and Dr. Hansen disagree, which makes NASA a microcosm of the subject in the wider scientific community. Dr. Griffin's statements were to the point and said, in essence, \"Prove it!\" Dr. Hansen's position suffered a significant hit when he was not able to refute Dr. Griffin's position on a factual basis, even by reference. He was forced to fall back on the ineffectual and weak consensus argument of the Global Warming religious cant. Dr. Hansen was also disingenuous in his \"He seemed unaware...\" comment, considering that Dr. Griffin is the chief administrator at NASA and Dr. Hansen is obliged to appraise Dr. Griffin of the status of his research regularly. Dr. Hansen's publications on climate change, such as his 2000 Global Warming in the 21st Century: An Alternative Scenario, describe effects of various greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone (O3), but the paper, and indeed the rest of his publications, are curiously silent or dismissive on the most prevalent greenhouse gas, H2O. Mention of water vapor is entirely absent in the Alternative Scenario paper. Ignoring water vapor in a paper which purports to define the Global Warming subject is akin to writing a paper about 20th Century Transportation which does not mention the internal combustion engine. I'm afraid I have to award Dr. Griffin the exchange on both style and content. | 14) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 1 Jun 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Jeffery, I asked a few questions of old friends back east and, weird thing, your name is known.

Its goals are to (a) unmask Islam and show that it is an imperialistic ideology akin to Nazism but disguised as religion and (b) to help Muslims leave it, end this culture of hate caused by their \"us\" vs. \"them\" ethos and embrace the human race in amity. We strive for the unity of Mankind through the elimination of Islam, the most insidious doctrine of hate. Islam can't be reformed, but it can be eradicated. It can't be molded, but it can be smashed. It is rigid but brittle. That is why Muslims do not tolerate criticism of it. To eradicate Islam, all we have to do is tell the truth. It's that simple. The truth about Islam is out. It's all here in this site. Now it is up to you to spread it. With truth, the decent Muslims will leave Islam and with each Muslim that leaves, we gain a new soldier in our fight against terrorism. We are growing exponentially. The days of Islam are numbered and world peace is around the corner. Many of us will see that day. We might have to go through very tough times meanwhile. The storm is approaching. Does anyone else see the irony? Yes... The truth about Islam is out there... And it's free: Here: [The of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a common word between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (God), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take one another as lords besides Allah (God).\" Then, if they turn away, say: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have submitted to the will of Allah (God)).\" ~Qur'an 3:64 Say : \"Oh you that reject Faith (The Disbelievers)! I worship not that which you worship, Nor will you worship that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping, Nor will you worship that which I worship. To you be your religion, and to me my religion.\" ~Qur'an 109:1-6 This war is about 'ethnic cleansing'... plain and simple... Discuss? ;) I know similar arguments from German boards... These ignorant people confuse normal Muslims with those zealots who are terrorizing others. I read the Qur'an myself, and find it much less aggressive than some people want us to believe. They forget that Jihad means not only fight with weapons, but also the fight against one's own bad habits and each struggle to improve one's own life. According to all definitions I read it just means \"Holy Struggle\". When I go to work and attend evening classes after that in my spare-time, it's a Jihad, because I have to fight my laziness and tiredness to get good notes. And it IS a fight. When you work all day and enjoy to sleep long at weekends it is a struggle to get up early to go to church each Sunday morning. When you wish to go to Church to learn from the preachings and to meet others who believe in the same like you, and you have to struggle, to fight with yourself to reach this, you're on a Jihad. Alliterate people who learn to read and write are on a Jihad. People who use drugs and struggle to come over it are on a Jihad, according to the Qu'ran. But these ignorant people read \"Jihad = fight\" and yell how evil the Qu'ran is, and that all Muslims shall become ex-Muslims asap. Otherwise, they forget, that Allah is just the Arabic translation of \"The One and Only God\" and even the Christians and Jews in Arabic speaking countries call God Allah, and that Jesus (\"Isa ben Maryam\") is appreciated as a prophet in the Qu'ran. Actually, the problem is that most normal Muslims are not declaring against \"those zealots who are terrorizing others\" (I will just call them those murderers from now on), leading most of the rest of us non-Muslims to believe that thay agree with the those murderers.

If one is atheist (a- \"without\" + theos \"a god\"), rather than anti-religionist, elements of religious rites are matters of supreme indifference. I agree. But that wasn't my point. <y point was that if a candidate proclaimed publicly that he/she was an Atheist, the biggest thing that you would hear in political ads would be the phrase \" The other candidate doesn't even BELIEVE IN GOD!!! Do you really want this person to be running your country?? \" And half the country ( regardless of the candidate's qualifications ) would shudder and gasp and say \" Oh my goodness NO!!!!! We can't have someone who doesn't believe in God running this country!!! \" Even in Germany, which is IMHO more secular than the USA, there was an outcry in several media when Schr\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6der became Chancellor, and spoke his Oath of Office without the finishing sentence \"So help me God\"... Not that this sentence were compulsory, but I think a person in charge should respect the beliefs of others even though he/she does not share them. Even atheists do say \"Oh my God!\" or \"Thank God ...\" So why not just saying (or better: quoting) \"So help me God\"? Does this phrase, quoted by an atheist, make him/her unreliable? An atheist would not care. If he is a true atheist, they are just empty words and simple politeness dictates that the empty words be spoken because they are important to those listening. Even if you do not believe in the religious trappings of the rite of office, it is still poite to following the form of the rite as an earnest of intent to follow the spirit of the Oath of Office. So Chancellor Schr\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6der was being rather rude to his hosts (the German people), not a major thing. And in my direct experience, when bad things are happening (i.e. bullets, grenades, explosions, fires, etc.), atheists were asking God's help along with the rest of us. | 25) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 26 May 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Sure.

It seems to have worked when Reagan did it and when this president Bush did it. The theory is that the economy booms, and even at lower tax rates, the amount of money paid in taxes goes up. For many fiscally conservative Republicans, this appeals to their constituents who enjoy paying a lower tax rate and benefit from an expanding economy. Those Republican politicians whose supporters like tax cuts will fight any tax increase.

The performance of these vehicles will be similar or the same as gasoline power, but you would reduce fuel consumprion between 30% and 50% for the same power output (but much much better torque). An additional benefit would be a considerably cleaner exhaust emmission then catalysed gasoline can give (NOx and particles are dealt with by EGR and particle traps). Second: move to the production and use of 100% biodiesel from rape and soya crops. Current diesel engines, from the old Comet Pre-chambered ones to the modern high pressuer 2,000 bar common rail diesels can burn diesel in any percentage from 100% mineral diesel, from crude, to 100% biodiesel without ill effects. I know as I am running my SUV on 100% biodiesel, and have for the last year. The benefit is lower carbon dioxide output, a renewable energy source, and a fuel price (all fuel and sales tax paid) that is currently 22% lower than the pump price where I live!

It may be because ethanol production on an industrial scale is a proven process, calling for ethanol pleases the Ag lobby and therefore it is a safe thing to propose. Butanol has many superior properties as an alternative fuel when compared to ethanol. These include: - Higher energy content (110,000 Btu\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s per gallon for butanol vs. 84,000 Btu per gallon for ethanol). Gasoline contains about 115,000 Btu\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s per gallon. MPG is about 30% less with ethanol than with gasoline or butanol. - Butanol is six times less \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"evaporative\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 than ethanol and 13.5 times less evaporative than gasoline, making it safer to use as an oxygenate in Arizona, California and other states, thereby eliminating the need for very special blends(MTBE added) during the summer and winter months. - Butanol can be shipped through existing fuel pipelines where ethanol must be transported via rail, barge or truck. - Butanol can be used as a replacement for gasoline gallon for gallon e.g. 100%, or any other percentage. Ethanol can only be used as an additive to gasoline up to about 85% and then only after significant modifications to the engine. Butanol will run even in your '57 Chevy without fuel system or engine modification. Worldwide 10% ethanol blends predominate. - The same biomass used to make ethanol is also used to make butanol. A quick google shows that the process is similar to that of ethanol and what I could skim quickly implies that the process cost per unit volume is similar to that of ethanol. There isn't any downside I can find.

Don't worry, you can make up a reason that does not in any way address the concerns someone has raised. Yeah, I can see where that will head. Telling someone to leave is very different from expressing your opinion about someone's decision to leave. The problems here are: 1) How closely are they looking at what the person has to say?

Importing the sugar-based variety from Brazil makes more sense. By Colin A. Carter and Henry I. Miller, COLIN A. CARTER is a professor of agricultural and resource economics at UC Davis. HENRY I. MILLER, a physician and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, was an FDA official from 1979 to 1994; his most May 17, 2007 POLICYMAKERS and legislators often fail to consider the law of unintended consequences. The latest example is their attempt to reduce the United States' dependence on imported oil by shifting a big share of the nation's largest crop, corn, to the production of ethanol for fueling automobiles. Good goal, bad policy. In fact, ethanol will do little to reduce the large percentage of our fuel that is imported (more than 60%), and the ethanol policy will have widespread and profound ripple effects on other markets. Corn farmers and ethanol refiners are ecstatic about the ethanol boom and are enjoying the windfall of artificially enhanced demand. But it will be an expensive and dangerous experiment for the rest of us. On Capitol Hill, the Senate is debating legislation that would further expand corn ethanol production. A 2005 law already mandates production of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012, about 5% of the projected gasoline use at that time. These biofuel goals are propped up by a generous federal subsidy of 51 cents a gallon for blending ethanol into gasoline, and a tariff of 54 cents a gallon on most imported ethanol to help keep out cheap imports from Brazil. The proposed legislation is a prime example of throwing good money after a bad idea. President Bush has set a target of replacing 15% of domestic gasoline use with biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) over the next 10 years, which would require almost a fivefold increase in mandatory biofuel use, to about 35 billion gallons. With current technology, almost all of this biofuel would have to come from corn because there is no feasible alternative. However, achieving the 15% goal would require the entire current U.S. corn crop, which represents a whopping 40% of the world's corn supply. This would do more than create mere market distortions; the irresistible pressure to divert corn from food to fuel would create unprecedented turmoil. Thus, it is no surprise that the price of corn has doubled in the last year \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac from $2 to $4 a bushel. We are already seeing upward pressure on food prices as the demand for ethanol boosts the demand for corn. Until the recent ethanol boom, more than 60% of the annual U.S. corn harvest was fed domestically to cattle, hogs and chickens or used in food or beverages. Thousands of food items contain corn or corn byproducts. In Mexico, where corn is a staple food, the price of tortillas has skyrocketed because U.S. corn has been diverted to ethanol production. And any sort of shock to corn yields, such as drought, unseasonably hot weather, pests or disease could send food prices into the stratosphere. Such concerns are more than theoretical. In 1970, a widespread outbreak of a fungus called southern corn leaf blight destroyed 15% of the U.S. corn crop. Politicians like to say that ethanol is environmentally friendly, but these claims must be put into perspective. Although corn is a renewable resource, it has a far lower yield relative to the energy used to produce it than either biodiesel (such as soybean oil) or ethanol from other plants. Moreover, ethanol yields about 30% less energy per gallon than gasoline, so mileage drops off significantly. Finally, adding ethanol raises the price of blended fuel because it is more expensive to transport and handle. Lower-cost biomass ethanol \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac for example, from rice straw (a byproduct of harvesting rice) or switchgrass \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac would make far more economic sense, but large volumes of ethanol from biomass will not be commercially viable for many years. (And production will be delayed by government policies that specifically encourage corn-based ethanol by employing subsidies.) American legislators and policymakers seem oblivious to the scientific and economic realities of ethanol production. Brazil and other major sugar cane-producing nations enjoy significant advantages over the U.S. in producing ethanol, including ample agricultural land, warm climates amenable to vast plantations and on-site distilleries that can process cane immediately after harvest. Thus, in the absence of cost-effective, domestically available sources for producing ethanol, rather than using corn, it would make far more sense to import ethanol from Brazil and other countries that can produce it efficiently \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac and also to remove the 54-cents-per-gallon tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports. Our politicians may be drunk with the prospect of corn-derived ethanol, but if we don't adopt policies based on science and sound economics, it is consumers around the world who will suffer the hangover. | 44) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : - Goodbye](forum_thread.php?id=39429) [Message 569749](forum_thread.php?id=39429&postid=569749)) Posted 17 May 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Keith / Kevin / Kyle Whatever.

The Brookings Institution is absolutely not a right leaning organization and is not (and has never been) the lapdog of a conservative administration. The information is accurate, supported by documentary exidence and much to the point. As to Jeffery, I do not know what his major malfunction is, but my current theory is that his biggest problem with the information in the IRAQ INDEX is that he is a member of (or sympathizer with) a radical Islamic congregation and the information is at odds with the world as he wishes it to be. Not really his fault, simply a pity that he was raised not to think for himself. | 50) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 15 May 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: The American Thinker May 14, 2007 The Missing Context in Media Reporting on Iraq By Gerd Schroeder The US mainstream media are failing to provide the public the context it needs to accurately understand both the successes of our progress in Iraq. They do this either purposely or through incompetence and/or lack of intellect. I know many members of the media, and none of them lack intellect or are incompetent. I came to this harsh conclusion after studying the ongoing Brookings Institution Report titled [\"IRAQ INDEX Tracking Reconstruction and Security in Post-Saddam Iraq\"](http://www.brookings.edu/iraqindex) for several months. The Brookings Institution is a left-of-center think tank, led by Bill Clinton's close friend Strobe Talbott. But its information in the Iraq Index is generally accurate and reliable. The information mainly comes from the US Military and other US governmental agencies' official statistics. It is updated at least weekly to provide in one place the most up to date information on the war that I have been able to find. Two small examples will suffice to show how neglect of context creates a misleading public impression. ISF Casualties The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) includes military, police, special police, Iraqi National Guard, and border police. From early-2005 to mid-2006 the hot topic for marking progress in the war was how many ISF were being trained and employed. However, in mid-2006 this media reporting trend almost wholly dried up, and the biggest critic of ISF training progress in Congress, Senator Biden, stopped beating the drum. Why? Look at the data on page 32 of the Index. In July-August 2006, the number of deployed ISF jumped from 269,600 up to 298,000. The previous months had experienced much smaller growth, but July/August 2006 experienced a 10.6% jump in ISF. The numbers jumped again in September by almost 10,000 to 307,800. October rose 4000, and November rose almost 11,000. In essence, the critics of the war lost their talking point, and shifted instead toward troop withdrawal as the idea to be pushed. There is more ISF good news. For almost 3 years we have heard the critics of the war talk about the high ISF deaths. The information is just raw data; close analysis of the average numbers killed month to month as a percentage of total ISF force strength shows a consistent downward trend. Up to January 2005, records of the number of ISF killed to total force strength are hard to find because of the lack of accurate numbers killed month to month. But, since January 2005 the ratios are clear. In January 2005, 0.86 died per 1000 ISF. In June and July 2005 the ratio jumped to 1.75 per 1000 ISF, a high water mark for ISF deaths. However, from July 2005 until January 2007, the ratio of ISF killed per 1000 has steadily dropped to a low of 0.28 killed per 1000 ISF. There is a current up-trend from that 0.28/1000 ratio to 0. 9/1000 in April 2007. The average from January 2005 to April 2007 is 0.79 killed per 1000 ISF. To put the ISF deaths into a clearer perspective [The FBI reported](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/killed/2005) that in 2005, 67 police officers were killed by accident while on duty and 55 by hostile acts in 2005, for a total of 132 police officers out of 673,146 law enforcement officers in the United States in 2005. After dividing 132 officers killed by 12 months (to make the comparison on the same basis), 0.016 police officers died in America per month per 1000 police in 2005. Granted 0.79 ISF killed compared to 0.016 US police officers killed is a wide margin; it is roughly 50 times more dangerous to be serving in the ISF than in an average American police department, including all the rural and suburban areas with comparatively low police casualties. This is an honest, fair comparison that you will not see from the media in their war reporting. Further, the downward trend of the ratio puts the situation in Iraq in a whole new light. The overall trend is good news. Electrical development, production, and distribution On this subject I have a little inside information because of my service as the US Liaison to the Musiab Power Station in Iraq in 2004. The background of the power situation in Iraq must be discussed to understand the analysis. Critics of Iraqi reconstruction like to point to the lack of sufficient power supply in Iraq as a failing of reconstruction. But it is not a simple matter of just megawatts produced post-Saddam compared to before the r\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9gime changed. Hang with me, it will be worth it. Before 2003, one of Saddam's mechanisms for controlling the government and population was the power supply. While the power grid in Baghdad may have appeared to be distributed fairly, this was not the case. Almost every day in May 2003, patrols in Baghdad would find several people dead, lying under power transformers. These hapless souls died attempting to hook insufficient high gauge wire directly into the transformers, and from there into their homes. Driving through the neighborhoods one could see literally thousands of these types of wires hung over the roads, going into homes. Critics of the war would have us believe that everyone in Baghdad had power, 24 hours a day in the pre-war days. This was not the case. While Iraq had the capacity to power all of Baghdad, Saddam did not allow this. Saddam gave power only to those loyal to him. There is no clear evidence to show how many people of the 6+ million in Baghdad had power, but from my experience I estimate that less than 1 million people had power in their homes. Of course this doesn't include government buildings and industry. Another dirty little secret is that in Iraq the Sunnis had the electrical power, but the rest of the country, in the Kurdish north and the Shiite south, had very little electricity at all. Iraqi Ministry of Power officials told me that outside of Baghdad, electricity was scarce in pre-war Iraq. This was due to Saddam's control measures and lack of capacity to produce or distribute power to the countryside. Before the war, Iraq had less than 50% of the needed capacity. The 6 million people in Baghdad received 63% of the power. That means that out of 25 million people in Iraq 24% of the population got 63% of the power, even though Saddam did not allow all 6 million people in Baghdad to have power. Adjusted to my estimate that only a million or so favored residences received reliable power, the percentage changes to 4% of the population consuming 63% of the power. The 19 million Iraqis living outside Baghdad shared only 37% of the power capacity. Capacity is a misleading benchmark. A country may have the capacity, but what they actually produce is the true indicator of welfare. Actual distribution of power is the real benchmark. While capacity pre-war was 3958 megawatts (Page 37), this was the case only if the power plants operated at 100%. No power plant operates at 100% anywhere, due to required maintenance. At any one time only 50% of the power capacity is being generated and distributed. Given those facts, pre-war Iraq only produced about 2400 megawatts of power at any one time. This less than half of what it needed pre-war or what is now needed. How much power does Iraq need? 1 Megawatt is sufficient to power 400 homes in a developing country like Iraq. If we assume that each household has 10 people (which is very high) that means that there are at least 2.5 million households in Iraq. So Iraq needs to produce 6250 megawatts of power, 24/7 for just residential use. Factor in government and industry one could easily increase that estimate by 25%, for a total need of 7812 megawatts. Pre-war Iraq had 4 large power plants. Each plant could produce 1200 megawatts of power at 100%. That is a pre-war capacity total of 4800 megawatts at 100%. Operating at 50% of that number, the output is reduced to 2400 megawatts. So at the time of the war, Iraq could only reliably distribute 30% of the total needed power. That 30% number is very close to the percentage of the Sunni minority in Iraq. Once one adds in the government and industrial needs, it is easy to see why the Kurds and the southern Shiites got very little power. I don't think that is a coincidence. How do I know these numbers? I saw the records. The records showed that the power plant at Musiab only produced an average of 550 megawatts of power per day in any given month. If all four major power plants in Iraq averaged the same numbers, then the output in pre-war Iraq was only 2200 megawatts distributed. The Coalition goal is to get generated distributed power to 6000 megawatts (MW) by July 2007. That is well short of the estimated need of 7812 megawatts but still far closer than the 2400 megawatts that Saddam produced pre-war. Currently, Iraq distributes 4000 MW. When compared to the 2400 MW that Saddam distributed, that is a 67% increase in distribution, in less than 5 years. A 67% increase in power distribution is impressive by any measure. While it is still 2000 MW short of the intended goal of 6000 MW it is still an impressive feat. Yet, oddly this progress is not reported on. In fact, the numbers do not seem to be analyzed by the media at all. Is this a simple oversight or a deliberate misleading by the media and war critics? These are two examples our many of how the available information is not analyzed and reported. There are many more. Things like water treatment, sewer, potable water, schools, free press, communications, bridges, economy, and farming are some of the other good news progress that is not reported. There are certainly some other examples that would show disappointing trends or lack of progress, but the media has been doing a good job of reporting on those negative aspects. I just thought that since the media was only doing half of the fair and accurate part I would pick up their slack in a very small way to show that there is significant, unreported good news. The Military's and Government's responsibilities If the media are not going to fairly and accurately report the news coming out of Iraq, then the military and government have to step up to the plate somehow. But because the media controls most of our information outlets, it is difficult. Conservative talk radio, satellite TV, and the Internet are three ways to bypass the media. War blogs and conservative news sites can go a long way in getting the good new out. The Pentagon has a news channel, called The Pentagon Channel. In theory, satellite and cable providers could carry it, though of course critics would cry foul. Yet the military has decided to crackdown on the very war blogs that get good information to the public. While operational security is the #1 priority in our information operations, the military needs to ensure that good news continues to flow through outlets that are supportive of our war rather then squelching them with, what may be, well-intentioned, but very damaging limits on accurate information flowing to the public. Commanders need to ensure that they maintain operational security while not inhibiting the critical information that war bloggers send out, getting real information about the war to the public. The President Lastly, whenever the President campaigns to gain support for the war and explains the facts to the public, support for the war goes up. He should do much more of this. I am not talking about one or two speeches, I am talking about three and four week campaigns, with speeches made several times a day, across the whole country. A campaign that is as well thought-out, and as vigorously executed as any political campaign for elected office. Our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan are putting in 18-hour days, seven days a week, for 15 months. No vacations, no holidays, no weekends off. I think that the President owes them his full effort in doing his part to proclaim the real progress that is being achieved. Vague statements of progress are not sufficient. An information campaign is what is needed. It is time to cowboy up. Accurate, meaningful information that spans the full spectrum of subjects, including good news as well as bad, is critical to the American people getting a true picture of the war. If the information is slanted too far one way as it is now, the consequence will not just be defeat of the US, but could lead to mass murder and instability throughout the Middle East, Africa and the world at large. That does not mean that it will happen, but an American defeat would have a chilling effect on our allies and embolden our enemies. The flip side of that argument is that only good news reporting will inevitably lead to laziness and complacency that would cause America to not see the mistakes that have been made in the war; and so, not pursue any correction for the mistakes. It is a balance that will not be reached via unbiased reporting. It is reached by the left and right pulling against each other to reach equilibrium. The moderates accomplish nothing; they sit and watch. We need the left to motivate the right to make progress as much as the left needs us to motivate them in the same way. The problem lies not with the media's left of center standing. The problem lies with the lack of effort on the part of the right of center people to counter the left. This is how balance is found. The right needs to cowboy up and counter the media. Gerd Schroeder is a Major in the US Army. He has served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He does not speak for the US Army or the Department of Defense. | 51) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Know what seperates us?

I believe you have a right to choose what to do with your mind, body, and spirit whereas you deny me that right. Other than that you and I agree on a lot! Um... where have I denied your right to exist? to live your life? to choose what to do? I only denied the necessity of capitalism, of exploitation, of inequality in chances and incomes and living standards. I denied that being egoistic is an acceptable way of thinking as good as being altruistic. That separates us. For you, the individual is the non-plus-ultra - for me, the individual is also a part of the society and has to accept duties to serve the society he/she is a part of, as well as the society has the duty to serve its individual citizens, so that the community can grow to much more than just a lot of individuals who are occasionally living side by side, some starving, some almost bursting from fat. My ideal is a real togetherness and mutuality. No exploitation, no power over people, no privileges over others. Equality, fraternity, freedom - but also freedom from poverty, from exploitation, from egoism, from injustice. Yours seems to be total individuality. \"Do what thou wilst shall be the whole of the law\" seems to be your stand hereby. Yes, but the only problem with your denial of the necessity of capitolism is that you appear to substitute the necessity of socialism/communism in it's place. The only problem with that is that the socialistic/communistic systems have been failures in the long run wherever and whenever they have been tried. The philosophy is seductive, but it only works if every member of the society is totally selfless. This will never happen and, worse yet, it ignores the reality of human nature as it is and has been throughout recorded history and as it was passed down in legends and tales from prehistory. In my studies of historic and present day cultures, I have found that, over time, a communistic style system invariably ends up as a classic dictatorship. Indeed, most of them start that way. In a socialistic system, over the long haul, it is an even bet for either a dictatorship or the eventual breakdown of aspects of the society. And in both, the culture is fragile and crumbles if stressed. | 52) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Google it you j@ck@$$.

Back in the 60's, during the last energy crunch, a big hubbub was made of solar, wind, geothermal, and other alternative energey sources. Then the price of oil cooled down, and another year or two was spent pursuing the alternative sources. Then all was forgotten until now, when gas goes above $3.00 a frickin' gallon again. If our government had pursued all the alternatives with gusto since the last kick in the butt, we would have better choices online by now. But instead, we have the oil sponsored administration in power, laughing at the rest of us. Yes allegedly there would be hell to pay if gas prices hit $3/gal. So 4 bucks isn't going to do anything either. Sh*t no, not with the current, oil powered administration in place. Look at the last round of oil company profits. It made big news on CNN and everywhere else. Biggest corporate profits in history. On our backs. And the voting public.....well let's just say they got that in the bag, 'cuz they are mostly just lemmings. Which means they are just following the mainstream media slant. More big money. Money breeds money. Have's and wannabe's. And we are not even wannabes. We are in a lower tier than that. The can't havabees. Don't forget the government gets it fair share of the oil profits in taxes! What do you think I am talking about when I say big oil is in their pockets????? The average oil company profit on gasoline is in the neighborhood of $0.059 per dollar of sales, [ as shown here](http://www.conocophillips.com/newsroom/other_resources/energyanswers/oil_profits.htm). The profit margin (calculated by dividing net income by total sales) is about 9.1%. This is below that of other major industries (computers, chemicals, electrical equipment, beverage & tobacco) and far less than the pharmaceutical industry's margin of 21%. As shown [here](http://www.gaspricewatch.com/usgastaxes.asp), The Federal government profit, in the form of tax, is $0.184/gal and the New Mexico State government profit, again in the form of tax, is $0.18/gal ($0.17/gal. plus a $0.01/gal \"loading fee\", whatever the heck that is). So, the combined Federal and State government profit is twice the oil company profit (assuming an average of $3.00/gal.). The reason that you see record absolute profit amounts from oil companies is that our worldwide civilization is fueled by petroleum. The gigantic profit numbers are a result of volume, not excessive profits. | 56) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Benjamin Franklin: The moral and religious system which Jesus Christ transmitted to us is the best the world has ever seen, or can see.

Wade was an early victory in the struggle for legal recognition of women's right to reproductive health care. It gave strength to a global movement that is in full force today. It is therefore ironic that the U.S. Supreme Court's recent retreat from its long-standing protection of women's health should come at a time when countries worldwide are recognizing that reproductive health, including abortion, is a matter of fundamental human rights. The US Supreme Court upheld the law banning [\"partial birth\"](http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/) abortion. The reason this is important is that a partial birth abortion is performed to prevent the baby from completely exiting the birth canal, resulting in a birth and making killing the baby a murder. Most partial birth abortions were performed in the fifth and sixth months. Please note that after the fifth month premature labor usually results in live birth and most fifth month premature babies not only survive, they are generally healthy and normal after catching up on their growth. Even if you buy the \"non-viable tissue mass\" line, babies which need to undergo the partial birth procedure are most certainly viable. Which makes the procedure murder, plain and simple. So if you want to kill your baby, do it before it can live outside the womb with only normal pediatric care. | 71) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : kenzieB wrote: It remains true, now and forever: the four things that Lawyers, Religious Leaders, Journalists and Politicians have in common: They are the only people that we pay to lie to us.

No faith whatsoever is contained in my personal philosophy. You believe that your personal philosophy is sufficient to meet all tests of life. While this may be true, it is certainly not proven and, therefore, reliance on the philosophy is a simple act of faith. Wrong in its entirety. Anything 'real' that you allude to above is just another aspect of reality and anything real in that sense is part of that metaphysic by definition. Quite true, but an aspect of reality which is not accepted as an aspect of reality due to a failure of understanding is still a rejected aspect of reality. I do not quibble with the concept, I simply believe that when taken as a rigid requirement this position leads to automatic rejection of phenomena which are entirely real but which you cannot fit into your current understanding of objective reality. Mostly true. A rational man uses logic and reason to acquire knowledge. If 'feelings' or 'divine revelations' are valid how is one to discriminate one person's feelings or divine revelations from another's? Logic and reason have a common bond within all of our humanity. It doesn't have a competitor unlike the 5,000 plus religions of this world. 'Internal reality' ? This is confusing to me. Perhaps you mean some sort of introspection which is , I submit, something that can be best done by the rational faculty. Defining \"self knowledge\" as \"some sort of introspection\" is akin to defining \"anthracite\" as \"some kind of rock\". Certainly rational faculty can lead to a detailed understanding of your own core motivations and principles. But in many cases the basic data required for rational analysis cannot be arrived at by direct rational means. The id is often tangled, even in the best of us, and resists direct snooping. Mysticism, as you define it, can be a valuable tool when delving into oneself. Of course, if you are independently wealthy you can hire a psychologist and devote the time to having the psychologist get the information for you. Speak for yourself. And if you don't believe you are one of the many 'rationalizers' in the world I'd say that is a fairly pessimistic underestimation of your neighbors. You're selling them short on their potential. When I said that none of us escape rationalization as a means of justification, if only to ourselves, for actions which are not entirely in accord with total rationality, I was not exempting myself. I believe that Man can aspire to be a rational being. Most of us do, the best of us do. But, again, rational thought is a learned skill. So we should neglect reason so that we think differently even if that means believing in false things, dangerous idealogies, or what? Of course not, that was not, as you well know, the meaning or intent of my objection. Nonsense. Of course we all have different conceptual abilities and experiences. The point you addressed is a straw man. It's what man qua man chooses to use his mind for that matters... I disagree. The ability to reason is central to the point. Were that not so, philosophers such as Aristotle, Rand, etc., would never have been recognized as any other than people with obvious points. Their ability to reason and explain their resasoning process is what sets them apart from the ordinary run of humanity. If somehow this 'objective reality' you're speaking of is something 'otherwise' please go publish yourself. The rest of the philosophic/intellectual world has been waiting for that refutation for eons. How you somehow then segueway into aspersions with reference to a cannibalistic Jeffrey Dahmer persona escapes me. I do hope that is not your view of what a proper, reasoned, and rationally self interested man is. My use of Dahmer was deliberate. If you read the transcripts of numerous interviews with the man, you will find that in terms of his gestalt, he was acting in a \"proper, reasoned, and rationally self interested\" manner. The fact that the rest of us saw him as a horrifying monster is not the central point. The point is that he is an extreme case of a faulty ability to reason leading to unethical behavior. I reject the premise that rationality is a basic virtue. Rationality, the ability to reason, is a learned skill and a conscious choice. This is PRECISELY why rationality is a virtue. It is how human beings exist, survive, create civilizations, and achieve happiness. I see where I misunderstood your statement. I was understanding \"basic virtue\" to mean \"inalienable characteristic\" Never in the history of man has anyone ever given an explanation of why altruism is rational. Not once. Trust me. Again, if your view of one of the attributes of a rational man is to not give a damn about his family, partner, or small fuzzy animals I should need to remind you that its opposite ethic of altruism, throughout history and without question has led to more slaughter and debasement of all that is good than is possible to imagine. I submit virtualy the entire history of humanity as evidence and exhibit A through ad infinitum. Wherever that individualism, free thought, free action, rationality, science, art, architecture, productivity, benevolence, pride, strength, and even love have flourished there was a concomitant existence of this thing called egoism (enlightened self interest). I actually suspect you may not really understand the definition or historical significance of the word 'altruism'. The definition that I use is, \"the principle or practice of unselfish concern for or devotion to the welfare of others\". That an egoist would defing placing the needs of family above or ahead of self interest as, indeed, following that self interest is immaterial to the fact that such behavior is altruistic behavior in its most common definition. This last one is so horribly innaccurate as to be almost laughable. Look up the word, 'objectivism'. In most places it is defined as a particular aspect of the branch of philosophy known as ethics that holds that there are rational, absolute moral standards and values. It holds that there is no such thing as 'situational ethics'. I didn't indict the philosophy, just the description. I have known those who, citing a description of the meaning of ethical behavior very similar to that which you present in your profile, conclude that any action taken in self interest is an ethical and proper behavior. Their contention is that behavior is ethical only if it serves the self interest based upon the immediate situation. I realize that this is a pervision of the concept you are attempting to present. That is my point. | 84) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2007 [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Wanna join my team? ;) You aren't in a team Jeffery. | 85) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: [ ](http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v330/setiweb/videos/?action=view\u00a4t=SNL-RobertDeNiro.flv) He looks like Robert De Niro It is, he was doing an SNL skit. | 86) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 29 Apr 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Reminds me of something I saw in a movie or tv (Seinfeld maybe?) where these couple of people just wandered into some protest or another and started changing their chants to nonsense slogans...very funny. Also interesting and funny is joining a picket line with a blank sign. Mr. Hyland. I must be mistaken because that has been all that I have read into their sloganeering over recent history. ====Again. Invite to our team on BOINC. I am afraid that I cannot, as I take serious issue with some of the tenets (basic principles) of your faith, as explained in your profile. Let me explain. In reference to the description of Objectivist Metaphysics, to paraphrase Hamlet, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy. To reject any belief in the supernatural (as defined in Dictionary.com Unabridged, V1.1, definition number 1) is to reject any belief that is unexplainable by natural law or phenomena as you understand it. Fine for a working stance, but when taken as a rigid requirement this position leads to automatic rejection of phenomena which are entirely real but which you cannot fit into your current understanding of objective reality. In reference to the description of Objectivist Epistemology, as I understand the definition, Objectivists reject mysticism as a means of acquiring objective knowledge (data describing objective, external reality). The trap in such rejection is that it slips all too easily into a rejection of mysticism as a means of obtaining knowledge about objective internal reality. Mysticism as a means of self knowledge is an entirely valid method. In reference to the Objectivist description of Human Nature, I take issue with this because, to my experience, Man is, in general, a rationalizing being. Many aspire to be rational, but none of us escape rationalization as a means of justification, if only to ourselves, for actions which are not entirely in accord with total rationality. This is not an indictment or slur on such behavior. Quite the contrary, because reliance on total rationality tends to lead to total rigidity of thought. My greatest difficulty is with the description of Objectivist Ethics. Reason as a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"proper judge of values\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 is entirely dependent upon the ability to reason. This Objectivist definition is valid only if all can reason with equal facility, have an identical knowledge set and have an identical experience set. If objective reality is otherwise, and it is, faulty reasoning can easily lead to actions which are entirely reasonable and ethical to you, but monstrous to others. As a vivid example of this point, look up the interviews between the Court appointed psychologist and Jeffery Dahmer. I reject the premise that rationality is a basic virtue. Rationality, the ability to reason, is a learned skill and a conscious choice. As to the Objectivist rejection of altruism, this is simply irrational. To employ this philosophy fully is to reject the bonds of familial relationships. Unless you are (and remain) single you will need, at some time or another, to place the welfare of your family ahead of your own, which invalidates the Objectivist definition. To my view, the entire Objectivist definition of ethics lends itself well to the rationalization of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"situational ethics\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, which I reject. I believe that there are some moral absolutes. | 87) |[Message 28 Apr 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I agree with everything he said.

The greatest challenge facing mankind is the challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda. Perceiving the truth has always been a challenge to mankind, but in the information age (or as I think of it, the disinformation age) it takes on a special urgency and importance. We must daily decide whether the threats we face are real, whether the solutions we are offered will do any good, whether the problems we're told exist are in fact real problems, or non-problems. Every one of us has a sense of the world, and we all know that this sense is in part given to us by what other people and society tell us; in part generated by our emotional state, which we project outward; and in part by our genuine perceptions of reality. In short, our struggle to determine what is true is the struggle to decide which of our perceptions are genuine, and which are false because they are handed down, or sold to us, or generated by our own hopes and fears. As an example of this challenge, I want to talk today about environmentalism. And in order not to be misunderstood, I want it perfectly clear that I believe it is incumbent on us to conduct our lives in a way that takes into account all the consequences of our actions, including the consequences to other people, and the consequences to the environment. I believe it is important to act in ways that are sympathetic to the environment, and I believe this will always be a need, carrying into the future. I believe the world has genuine problems and I believe it can and should be improved. But I also think that deciding what constitutes responsible action is immensely difficult, and the consequences of our actions are often difficult to know in advance. I think our past record of environmental action is discouraging, to put it mildly, because even our best intended efforts often go awry. But I think we do not recognize our past failures, and face them squarely. And I think I know why. I studied anthropology in college, and one of the things I learned was that certain human social structures always reappear. They can't be eliminated from society. One of those structures is religion. Today it is said we live in a secular society in which many people---the best people, the most enlightened people---do not believe in any religion. But I think that you cannot eliminate religion from the psyche of mankind. If you suppress it in one form, it merely re-emerges in another form. You can not believe in God, but you still have to believe in something that gives meaning to your life, and shapes your sense of the world. Such a belief is religious. Today, one of the most powerful religions in the Western World is environmentalism. Environmentalism seems to be the religion of choice for urban atheists. Why do I say it's a religion? Well, just look at the beliefs. If you look carefully, you see that environmentalism is in fact a perfect 21st century remapping of traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and myths. There's an initial Eden, a paradise, a state of grace and unity with nature, there's a fall from grace into a state of pollution as a result of eating from the tree of knowledge, and as a result of our actions there is a judgment day coming for us all. We are all energy sinners, doomed to die, unless we seek salvation, which is now called sustainability. Sustainability is salvation in the church of the environment. Just as organic food is its communion, that pesticide-free wafer that the right people with the right beliefs, imbibe. Eden, the fall of man, the loss of grace, the coming doomsday---these are deeply held mythic structures. They are profoundly conservative beliefs. They may even be hard-wired in the brain, for all I know. I certainly don't want to talk anybody out of them, as I don't want to talk anybody out of a belief that Jesus Christ is the son of God who rose from the dead. But the reason I don't want to talk anybody out of these beliefs is that I know that I can't talk anybody out of them. These are not facts that can be argued. These are issues of faith. And so it is, sadly, with environmentalism. Increasingly it seems facts aren't necessary, because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief. It's about whether you are going to be a sinner, or saved. Whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation, or on the side of doom. Whether you are going to be one of us, or one of them. Am I exaggerating to make a point? I am afraid not. Because we know a lot more about the world than we did forty or fifty years ago. And what we know now is not so supportive of certain core environmental myths, yet the myths do not die. Let's examine some of those beliefs. There is no Eden. There never was. What was that Eden of the wonderful mythic past? Is it the time when infant mortality was 80%, when four children in five died of disease before the age of five? When one woman in six died in childbirth? When the average lifespan was 40, as it was in America a century ago. When plagues swept across the planet, killing millions in a stroke. Was it when millions starved to death? Is that when it was Eden? And what about indigenous peoples, living in a state of harmony with the Eden-like environment? Well, they never did. On this continent, the newly arrived people who crossed the land bridge almost immediately set about wiping out hundreds of species of large animals, and they did this several thousand years before the white man showed up, to accelerate the process. And what was the condition of life? Loving, peaceful, harmonious? Hardly: the early peoples of the New World lived in a state of constant warfare. Generations of hatred, tribal hatreds, constant battles. The warlike tribes of this continent are famous: the Comanche, Sioux, Apache, Mohawk, Aztecs, Toltec, Incas. Some of them practiced infanticide, and human sacrifice. And those tribes that were not fiercely warlike were exterminated, or learned to build their villages high in the cliffs to attain some measure of safety. How about the human condition in the rest of the world? The Maori of New Zealand committed massacres regularly. The dyaks of Borneo were headhunters. The Polynesians, living in an environment as close to paradise as one can imagine, fought constantly, and created a society so hideously restrictive that you could lose your life if you stepped in the footprint of a chief. It was the Polynesians who gave us the very concept of taboo, as well as the word itself. The noble savage is a fantasy, and it was never true. That anyone still believes it, 200 years after Rousseau, shows the tenacity of religious myths, their ability to hang on in the face of centuries of factual contradiction. There was even an academic movement, during the latter 20th century, that claimed that cannibalism was a white man's invention to demonize the indigenous peoples. (Only academics could fight such a battle.) It was some thirty years before professors finally agreed that yes, cannibalism does indeed occur among human beings. Meanwhile, all during this time New Guinea highlanders in the 20th century continued to eat the brains of their enemies until they were finally made to understand that they risked kuru, a fatal neurological disease, when they did so. More recently still the gentle Tasaday of the Philippines turned out to be a publicity stunt, a nonexistent tribe. And African pygmies have one of the highest murder rates on the planet. In short, the romantic view of the natural world as a blissful Eden is only held by people who have no actual experience of nature. People who live in nature are not romantic about it at all. They may hold spiritual beliefs about the world around them, they may have a sense of the unity of nature or the aliveness of all things, but they still kill the animals and uproot the plants in order to eat, to live. If they don't, they will die. And if you, even now, put yourself in nature even for a matter of days, you will quickly be disabused of all your romantic fantasies. Take a trek through the jungles of Borneo, and in short order you will have festering sores on your skin, you'll have bugs all over your body, biting in your hair, crawling up your nose and into your ears, you'll have infections and sickness and if you're not with somebody who knows what they're doing, you'll quickly starve to death. But chances are that even in the jungles of Borneo you won't experience nature so directly, because you will have covered your entire body with DEET and you will be doing everything you can to keep those bugs off you. The truth is, almost nobody wants to experience real nature. What people want is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods, with screens on the windows. They want a simplified life for a while, without all their stuff. Or a nice river rafting trip for a few days, with somebody else doing the cooking. Nobody wants to go back to nature in any real way, and nobody does. It's all talk-and as the years go on, and the world population grows increasingly urban, it's uninformed talk. Farmers know what they're talking about. City people don't. It's all fantasy. One way to measure the prevalence of fantasy is to note the number of people who die because they haven't the least knowledge of how nature really is. They stand beside wild animals, like buffalo, for a picture and get trampled to death; they climb a mountain in dicey weather without proper gear, and freeze to death. They drown in the surf on holiday because they can't conceive the real power of what we blithely call \"the force of nature.\" They have seen the ocean. But they haven't been in it. The television generation expects nature to act the way they want it to be. They think all life experiences can be tivo-ed. The notion that the natural world obeys its own rules and doesn't give a damn about your expectations comes as a massive shock. Well-to-do, educated people in an urban environment experience the ability to fashion their daily lives as they wish. They buy clothes that suit their taste, and decorate their apartments as they wish. Within limits, they can contrive a daily urban world that pleases them. But the natural world is not so malleable. On the contrary, it will demand that you adapt to it-and if you don't, you die. It is a harsh, powerful, and unforgiving world, that most urban westerners have never experienced. Many years ago I was trekking in the Karakorum mountains of northern Pakistan, when my group came to a river that we had to cross. It was a glacial river, freezing cold, and it was running very fast, but it wasn't deep---maybe three feet at most. My guide set out ropes for people to hold as they crossed the river, and everybody proceeded, one at a time, with extreme care. I asked the guide what was the big deal about crossing a three-foot river. He said, well, supposing you fell and suffered a compound fracture. We were now four days trek from the last big town, where there was a radio. Even if the guide went back double time to get help, it'd still be at least three days before he could return with a helicopter. If a helicopter were available at all. And in three days, I'd probably be dead from my injuries. So that was why everybody was crossing carefully. Because out in nature a little slip could be deadly. But let's return to religion. If Eden is a fantasy that never existed, and mankind wasn't ever noble and kind and loving, if we didn't fall from grace, then what about the rest of the religious tenets? What about salvation, sustainability, and judgment day? What about the coming environmental doom from fossil fuels and global warming, if we all don't get down on our knees and conserve every day? Well, it's interesting. You may have noticed that something has been left off the doomsday list, lately. Although the preachers of environmentalism have been yelling about population for fifty years, over the last decade world population seems to be taking an unexpected turn. Fertility rates are falling almost everywhere. As a result, over the course of my lifetime the thoughtful predictions for total world population have gone from a high of 20 billion, to 15 billion, to 11 billion (which was the UN estimate around 1990) to now 9 billion, and soon, perhaps less. There are some who think that world population will peak in 2050 and then start to decline. There are some who predict we will have fewer people in 2100 than we do today. Is this a reason to rejoice, to say halleluiah? Certainly not. Without a pause, we now hear about the coming crisis of world economy from a shrinking population. We hear about the impending crisis of an aging population. Nobody anywhere will say that the core fears expressed for most of my life have turned out not to be true. As we have moved into the future, these doomsday visions vanished, like a mirage in the desert. They were never there---though they still appear, in the future. As mirages do. Okay, so, the preachers made a mistake. They got one prediction wrong; they're human. So what. Unfortunately, it's not just one prediction. It's a whole slew of them. We are running out of oil. We are running out of all natural resources. Paul Ehrlich: 60 million Americans will die of starvation in the 1980s. Forty thousand species become extinct every year. Half of all species on the planet will be extinct by 2000. And on and on and on. With so many past failures, you might think that environmental predictions would become more cautious. But not if it's a religion. Remember, the nut on the sidewalk carrying the placard that predicts the end of the world doesn't quit when the world doesn't end on the day he expects. He just changes his placard, sets a new doomsday date, and goes back to walking the streets. One of the defining features of religion is that your beliefs are not troubled by facts, because they have nothing to do with facts. So I can tell you some facts. I know you haven't read any of what I am about to tell you in the newspaper, because newspapers literally don't report them. I can tell you that DDT is not a carcinogen and did not cause birds to die and should never have been banned. I can tell you that the people who banned it knew that it wasn't carcinogenic and banned it anyway. I can tell you that the DDT ban has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attributable to a callous, technologically advanced western society that promoted the new cause of environmentalism by pushing a fantasy about a pesticide, and thus irrevocably harmed the third world. Banning DDT is one of the most disgraceful episodes in the twentieth century history of America. We knew better, and we did it anyway, and we let people around the world die and didn't give a damn. I can tell you that second hand smoke is not a health hazard to anyone and never was, and the EPA has always known it. I can tell you that the evidence for global warming is far weaker than its proponents would ever admit. I can tell you the percentage the US land area that is taken by urbanization, including cities and roads, is 5%. I can tell you that the Sahara desert is shrinking, and the total ice of Antarctica is increasing. I can tell you that a blue-ribbon panel in Science magazine concluded that there is no known technology that will enable us to halt the rise of carbon dioxide in the 21st century. Not wind, not solar, not even nuclear. The panel concluded a totally new technology-like nuclear fusion-was necessary, otherwise nothing could be done and in the meantime all efforts would be a waste of time. They said that when the UN IPCC reports stated alternative technologies existed that could control greenhouse gases, the UN was wrong. I can, with a lot of time, give you the factual basis for these views, and I can cite the appropriate journal articles not in whacko magazines, but in the most prestigious science journals, such as Science and Nature. But such references probably won't impact more than a handful of you, because the beliefs of a religion are not dependent on facts, but rather are matters of faith. Unshakeable belief. Most of us have had some experience interacting with religious fundamentalists, and we understand that one of the problems with fundamentalists is that they have no perspective on themselves. They never recognize that their way of thinking is just one of many other possible ways of thinking, which may be equally useful or good. On the contrary, they believe their way is the right way, everyone else is wrong; they are in the business of salvation, and they want to help you to see things the right way. They want to help you be saved. They are totally rigid and totally uninterested in opposing points of view. In our modern complex world, fundamentalism is dangerous because of its rigidity and its imperviousness to other ideas. I want to argue that it is now time for us to make a major shift in our thinking about the environment, similar to the shift that occurred around the first Earth Day in 1970, when this awareness was first heightened. But this time around, we need to get environmentalism out of the sphere of religion. We need to stop the mythic fantasies, and we need to stop the doomsday predictions. We need to start doing hard science instead. There are two reasons why I think we all need to get rid of the religion of environmentalism. First, we need an environmental movement, and such a movement is not very effective if it is conducted as a religion. We know from history that religions tend to kill people, and environmentalism has already killed somewhere between 10-30 million people since the 1970s. It's not a good record. Environmentalism needs to be absolutely based in objective and verifiable science, it needs to be rational, and it needs to be flexible. And it needs to be apolitical. To mix environmental concerns with the frantic fantasies that people have about one political party or another is to miss the cold truth---that there is very little difference between the parties, except a difference in pandering rhetoric. The effort to promote effective legislation for the environment is not helped by thinking that the Democrats will save us and the Republicans won't. Political history is more complicated than that. Never forget which president started the EPA: Richard Nixon. And never forget which president sold federal oil leases, allowing oil drilling in Santa Barbara: Lyndon Johnson. So get politics out of your thinking about the environment. The second reason to abandon environmental religion is more pressing. Religions think they know it all, but the unhappy truth of the environment is that we are dealing with incredibly complex, evolving systems, and we usually are not certain how best to proceed. Those who are certain are demonstrating their personality type, or their belief system, not the state of their knowledge. Our record in the past, for example managing national parks, is humiliating. Our fifty-year effort at forest-fire suppression is a well-intentioned disaster from which our forests will never recover. We need to be humble, deeply humble, in the face of what we are trying to accomplish. We need to be trying various methods of accomplishing things. We need to be open-minded about assessing results of our efforts, and we need to be flexible about balancing needs. Religions are good at none of these things. How will we manage to get environmentalism out of the clutches of religion, and back to a scientific discipline? There's a simple answer: we must institute far more stringent requirements for what constitutes knowledge in the environmental realm. I am thoroughly sick of politicized so-called facts that simply aren't true. It isn't that these \"facts\" are exaggerations of an underlying truth. Nor is it that certain organizations are spinning their case to present it in the strongest way. Not at all---what more and more groups are doing is putting out is lies, pure and simple. Falsehoods that they know to be false. This trend began with the DDT campaign, and it persists to this day. At this moment, the EPA is hopelessly politicized. In the wake of Carol Browner, it is probably better to shut it down and start over. What we need is a new organization much closer to the FDA. We need an organization that will be ruthless about acquiring verifiable results, that will fund identical research projects to more than one group, and that will make everybody in this field get honest fast. Because in the end, science offers us the only way out of politics. And if we allow science to become politicized, then we are lost. We will enter the Internet version of the dark ages, an era of shifting fears and wild prejudices, transmitted to people who don't know any better. That's not a good future for the human race. That's our past. So it's time to abandon the religion of environmentalism, and return to the science of environmentalism, and base our public policy decisions firmly on that.

The first person to calculate the rise of the Earth's temperature if CO2 doubled was a Japanese meteorologist, Dr. Syukuro Manabe, in the 1960s. Since then, there has been a gradual rise in the awareness of global warming as a catastrophic problem. At that time, however, very little was known about it, and there were many controversies about cause and effect, including theories that oceans absorbed greenhouse gases emitted by humans and that the impact of volcanic eruptions and the solar cycle was greater than that of human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was launched in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Since then, reports on global warming have been written and peer reviewed by more than 1,000 scientists. The IPCC reports are the distillation of the wisdom of scientists around the world. The reports have concluded that global warming is an indisputable fact, and that greenhouse gases produced by humans are the primary cause. We have now put a period to a long dispute over global warming, and a firm step towards the future was taken by the Kyoto Protocol. Global-warming prevention has become a universal concern, and I think we are taking an absolutely remarkable step, because human beings, who in the past have been capable of taking action only after the occurrence of disasters, have now stood up for our future, looking 100 years ahead. However I still don't think the Kyoto Protocol is sufficient. Its requirement of greenhouse-gas reductions by 6 to 8 percent from 1990 levels is not enough. It has been reported that we must reduce emissions by two thirds or three quarters in order to keep the average temperature from increasing by 2?degreeC. If the global temperature increases by just a few degrees, the climate will become unstable, and we'll experience conditions such as large scale typhoons, or unusually hot or cold weather. It is also believed that the consequences of a global temperature increase of more than 2 degreeC are not only climate change, but also further acceleration of global warming due to the melting of polar ice, and the spread of infectious diseases through the increased proliferation of mosquitoes. I think that the Kyoto Protocol is an insufficient solution to global warming prevention because, aside from the insufficiency of its reduction targets, the United States and China are outside the framework, despite being, respectively, the top two producers of greenhouse-gas emissions, followed by Russia and Japan. I think that the U.S. and China, and all the other nations, must take collaborative actions on global warming, or our Earth will face catastrophic consequences. Tullio I disagree. | 105) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, \"Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain.\" So God granted him what he requested.

So why not saying: every music should be public property, like a kind of GPL: That no company should be allowed to make their profit of music. Okay, maybe of the concerts, but I think, music should be managed and given away only by non-profit organisations, the albums and concert tickets sold to a price just covering their costs. If I were ruling, I would decide so. Your tune would change, I think, if you had a piece of intellectual property, say a novel or a patent on a new invention. Music is just as valuable as that invention or novel. The only method yet discovered of ensuring that creative arts and sciences are kept to the barest minimum is to take all meaningful reward away from the creators. | 114) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Kaffir Boy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 reached the top of many best-seller lists, and it earned the 1987 Christopher Award for literature, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"affirming the highest values of the human spirit.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The book is on the American Library Association's list of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Outstanding Books for the College Bound.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 But it is also No. 31 on the ALA list of the 100 most frequently banned or challenged books.

NOVAK THE CHICAGO SUN-TIMES April 2, 2007 In just three weeks, Fred Thompson has improbably transformed the contest for the Republican presidential nomination. It is not merely that he has come from nowhere to double digits in national polls. He is the talk of GOP political circles, because he is filling the conservative void in the Republican field of candidates. Republican activists have complained for months that none of the big-three contenders \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Mitt Romney \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac fits the model of a conservative leader for a conservative party. The party faithful have been waiting for another Ronald Reagan. But in conversations with them the past year, nobody mentioned Thompson as the messiah until he appeared March 11 on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 His statement to Wallace that he was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"giving some thought\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 to a presidential run generated a reaction that surprised Thompson. In the first Gallup poll that listed Thompson (March 23-25), he scored 12 percent \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac amazing for someone out of public life for more than four years who has not campaigned. More important than the polling data is his backing within the political community. Buyer's remorse is expressed by several House members who had endorsed former Massachusetts Gov. Romney. Thompson's popularity reflects weakness among announced Republican candidates, as reflected in the Gallup survey. Sen. McCain, no longer an insurgent but still not accepted by conservatives, is stuck in the 20 percent to 25 percent range. Former New York City Mayor Giuliani has dropped precipitously from 44 percent to 31 percent, amid attacks on his ideology and personal life. Most startling, despite a well-financed, well-organized campaign, Romney has fallen to 3 percent. Sophisticated social conservative activists tell me they cannot vote for Giuliani under any conditions and have no rapport with McCain or Romney. They do not view Sen. Sam Brownback, representing the social right, as a viable candidate. They are coming to see Thompson as the only conservative who can be nominated. Their appreciation of him stems not from his eight years as a U.S. senator from Tennessee but his actor's role as district attorney of Manhattan on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Law and Order.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 That part was molded to Thompson's specifications as a tough prosecutor, lending him political star power. Thompson's political origin as a protege of Sen. Howard Baker, leader of the Tennessee GOP's more liberal wing, prompted hard-line Senate conservatives to consider him a little too liberal. Actually, his lifetime Senate voting record as measured by the American Conservative Union was 86 percent. It would have been close to 100 percent except for his repeated votes supporting McCain's campaign finance reform. None of the big-three Republicans has been so consistently conservative as Thompson on tax policy, national security and abortion. The principal complaint about Thompson concerns not his ideology but his work ethic. The rap is that he does not burn the midnight oil \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac the identical criticism of Reagan, before and during his presidency. That carping may betray resentment that Thompson has emerged as a full-blown candidate without backbreaking campaign travel and tedious fund-raising. Thompson's critics assert that, bored with his lucrative career as an actor, he has enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame created by a chance TV interview and will not really run. But he privately assures friends that this is for real. His performance on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Fox News Sunday\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 was no accident. He went on the program for the purpose of unveiling his possible candidacy. Thompson did not leave public policy when he left the Senate. He has served on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. He hardly knew \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Scooter\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Libby but felt he was getting a raw deal, appeared in his courtroom and helped raise money for his defense fund. Friends bet Thompson will run. He clearly wants to try, and his wife, Jeri, is all for it. Seeking the best timing, he wants to avoid the pitfalls encountered by Democrat Barack Obama, who may have damaged himself by starting his campaign too quickly. I met Thompson in 1974 as Howard Baker's 31-year-old minority counsel on the Watergate investigation. I considered him cool, careful and conservative. He still is, and that is how he would run for president, which appears in the offing. We can do far worse for a conservative candidate. And Mitt Romney's record as Governor in MA is strongly conservative. I wouldn't mind seeing both of them on a ticket. | 128) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 3 Apr 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: That would be true except for the fact that there are certain reports filed about this moderator abusing it's power.

In a study of data from 331 stations across California from 1950 through 2000, researchers found that temperature changes in seven distinct climate zones were not uniform. Areas with fast-growing urban zones saw the biggest increases. The region that includes Riverside and San Bernardino counties was up the most: 2.6 degrees. The Southern California coastal zone, which includes San Diego, showed an increase of 2.3 degrees. The extreme northeastern part of the state, a slow-growing, rural area on the eastern side of the Sierra, was the lone region to show a decrease. Average temperatures there were down 1.1 degrees. Steve LaDochy, a climatologist and meteorology professor at Cal State Los Angeles and an author of the study, said the report brings climate change down to the microclimate level. He said most of the increases can be attributed to land-use changes. Bill Patzert, a research oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and another author of the study, said heat-trapping greenhouse gases have contributed to higher temperatures, but they have been only a small part of California's climate-change equation. Population growth, with its accompanying asphalt and rooftops, has been a bigger factor. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"When we talk about a warming world, we're already in it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We're talking about what's been going on the last 100 years where people live \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac in the cities.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Tim Barnett, a climate researcher at UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography's Climate Research Division, said the study broke no new ground. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The facts are well-known,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Barnett said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It's another paper that says temperatures are up in California. That's old news.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Patzert said earlier studies have reached similar conclusions, but this study, published in the journal Climate Research, was one of the most comprehensive because it examined climate data from such a large number of stations. Cal State seems to be a bit behind the times here. The fact that it is warmer in and immediately around large cities has been known since before the global cooling craze 35 years ago. | 134) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Consumers 'ripped off' by drug shortages Article from: The Daily Telegraph ...

Wrong. Access to elective health care is, as anywhere else in the world, difficult for the \"less well off\". But your contention that health care required for emergency (which, by the way uses a very relaxed definition) is simply wrong. Any hospital in America is required by law to provide emergency health care to anyone who walks in the door, regardless of ability to pay, their social status, race, creed, show size or any other reason. The hospital can, if it is a private hospital, transport the patient to a public hospital after the patient has been stabilized. But understand, the hospital that does not treat a patient that dies because of a medical condition will pay for that serious error in judgement in fines, loss of medical licences for attending physicians and jail time for administrators. So you are completely wrong. Access to required health care only requires spending time to go to the Emergency Room of any hospital in America. | 138) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: .....While some of the continuing violence is sectarian (Shi'a vs Sun'ni), the majority is from foreigners entering Iraq. These cowardly pigs are intent on killing as a means to destabilize the country but overall they are having about the same success as the leftover SS insurgents did in Germany after the end of WWII. I don't think that the resistance that we're encountering in Iraq from domestic and foreign fighters should be compared with the resistance that we encountered from German groups in post-WW II Germany. The damage that's been caused by fighters in Iraq is much more significant to what German resistance groups accomplished in post-WW II Germany. The Bush administration used this arguement to compare the two. Both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have tried to use the example of the Werewolves group in post-war Germany to make this comparison. The achievements of that group were either nonexistent or trivial in military terms. There's a 2003 article from Slate on the comparison the Bush administration was/is making: [Sorry, Dr. Rice, postwar Germany was nothing like Iraq](http://www.slate.com/id/2087768/) There is a commonality between the two groups in that the achievements of the guerillas in Iraq are trivial in military terms.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. The public panicked at what they thought were radio reports from the front of an ongoing attack by aliens. Radio was still a relatively new item and home radio sets were only just becoming widespread. The voice on the radio was given the kind of simple minded trust that a later generation gave to TV news anchors. The public today has been exposed to the idea of alien civilization via TV and movie, news about SETI@Home and other, similar projects, even PBS programs such as Cosmos with the sainted Dr. Segan. I do not believe for an instant that the simple discovery of the existence of an alien civilization would not cause even minor panic. I could accept that it would cause some panic in politicians because politicians in positions of real authority are generally older, poorly versed in science, have rather narrow and somewhat brittle world views and lack imagination. That lack of imagination would lead them to assume that public response to such knowledge would erode their authority or power base, which most career politicians could never countenance. | 141) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Posted 23 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: This is very odd behavior from the project.

People in place in Iraq are telling me a different story from what we all see in the US media. For one thing, the people who live there are very happy with the US, UK and other military presence because they do not have to fear them as they did Saddam's military. While some of the continuing violence is sectarian (Shi'a vs Sun'ni), the majority is from foreigners entering Iraq. These cowardly pigs are intent on killing as a means to destabilize the country but overall they are having about the same success as the leftover SS insurgents did in Germany after the end of WWII. A note about nomenclature here: The foreign murderers entering Iraq are not insurgents as the dictionary defines the word. By definition, an insurgent is a local fighting in opposition to the local authority. The foreign cowardly murderers of non-combatant women and children are guerrillas. | 143) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [why do we assume technologically advanced societies are inherently peaceful?](forum_thread.php?id=38420) ( [Message 534952](forum_thread.php?id=38420&postid=534952)) Posted 22 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Consider that almost all of the major technological advances in history were made in direct response to either the threat or the actuality of armed conflict. | 144) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Fun with Global Warming - Part Deux!](forum_thread.php?id=37423) ( 534948](forum_thread.php?id=37423&postid=534948)) Posted 22 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: [GORE REFUSES TO TAKE PERSONAL ENERGY ETHICS PLEDGE](http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=7616011f-802a-23ad-435e-887baa7069ca) Why is this a surprise?

One of the things that makes the U.S. Soldier so effective today is their ability to think in terms of the goal and in terms of their situational awareness so yes you are correct however I don't think it's a \"common liberal mistake\" to speak the obvious in regards to the current erosion of civil liberties. Likewise (to play devils advocate) it could be said that it's a common conservative mistake to believe that U.S. soldier will stand idly by and let the government take the liberties of the people against the constitution which they swore to protect against all enemies foreign and domestic. I see our current administrations political agenda to blame for the current erosion of our civil liberties. It was once said that \"When the people fear their government there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.\" That of course was said by Thomas Jefferson no less. It seems that people today are loosing touch with real patriotism not this false bravado of \"you're either with us or against us\" or \"bring it on\" or \"support the troops\" or the many other statements that though less well known have been said by the current administration. True patriotism is being able to put your life on the line for the foundation of what makes this country so great. Only 12%-13% of the population can say they have stepped up to that task. Myself being one of them I can firmly state that I would defend to the death your right to voice you opinions as protected \"for now\" under the constitution, right or wrong. That's just my two cents. Don't get conned into this idea that liberals are \"godless\" as some in the far right wing would like you to believe. For that matter don't believe that all conservatives are \"god fearing\". In fact many liberals are very religious, but realize that organized religion has been b******ized into a form of thought control over the centuries, and many of them just don't conform to the far rights touted moral superiority. Furthermore there have been countless occasions where a conservative has been found to be less then moral and far less then religious. Too many people wear religion like a cloak that they can put on and take off when it serves them. It is for this very reason that this nations founding fathers wrote into the constitution of this nation a separation between religion (church) and politics (state) because if you combine them together you get a theocracy similar to Iran or a cult leader similar to N. Korea who are both far more dangerous then two bit military dictator named Sadam. You do not confuse the issue at all. Jeffery's contention is that the US military \"act and behave like robots\".

This is all starting to remind me of the Spanish Inquisition and the Salem Witch Hunts. Franz Franz, this is just a wake up call to everybody to consider the ultimate question; How much is it worth to society to restrain CO2 emissions --- will that guarantee protection against global warming? How much are we prepared to 'combat' global warming, only to find it's a waste of money and resources which should have been spent on mitigating the effects of global warming? How sure are the scientists and what is the consequences of following their conclusions? We often see a picture of a child, the future generation we have to protect. But what if we spend so much on CO2 reducing schemes, when that money should have been spent, for example, on relocating schools and hospitals away from the coastal areas, where nothing we could have been done would have stopped the inevitable coastal flooding? Perhaps we need to do this and reduce CO2. But whatever is a 'perhaps' should be considered, and not tossed aside as a 'non-believer' idea. The thing that really burns me is that even the most rabid GW fanatics acknowledge that even complete compliance with that useless Kyoto accord, costing a significant percentage of the gross world product, will have less than 1 DegC of effect on world temperatures. | 151) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 15 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: offended by God. Isn't that an oxymoron? I mean, how can someone be so offended by something they believe doesn't exit... ;) Actually Jeffrey it is not that at all...it is more the part of being forced to swear to something some people do not believe in. If I tell you Jeffrey...\"swear on this Koran, or something you do not believe in, that you will move your feet every day\". Do you do it? Of course not...you are a God fearing/loving/devout Christian that believes in God! Your beliefs are yours and you are entitled to them. People have gone to War to protect those rights, for you and others. America was founded on the belief that you can believe what you wish to believe in and I can do the same, just so long as we do not antagonize each other. Well sometimes that happens, and things get changed. Courtrooms no longer have the words \"so help you God\", because some people did not like them. Classrooms do not have the Pledge of Allegiance because some people are offeneded. Prayer is no longer allowed in schools because some people are offended. You can do whatever you like, so long as it doesn't offend others. The same goes for me! Free speach is not TOTALLY free, people have the right to say what they like, just not ANYWHERE they like. For instance you CANNOT yell FIRE in a public area, unless there actually is one. Offending others is not part of the Free Speech clause of the Constitution. That is a recent perversion based on the liberal \"politicallly correct\" concept. The test is whether your speech injures another. Your example of yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater is a case where the prohibition is due to the very serious potential for injury due to panic. New Mexico still has the Pledge of Allegiance in grade school. My little girl had the opportunity to lead the Pledge for the school yesterday. And the Pledge continues to have the phrase, \"One nation, under God, with Liberty and Justice for all.\" For anyone who is interested, here is a short history of the [Pledge of Allegiance](http://www.homeofheroes.com/hallofheroes/1st_floor/flag/1bfc_pledge.html) with a very concise explanation of its meaning. | 152) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Last two letters begin the next word - Part 2 CLOSED CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=38082) ( [Message 531628](forum_thread.php?id=38082&postid=531628)) Posted 15 Mar german umbrage Album YMail (Thanks Ice)illogical [Gonzales defends removal of prosecutors, won't resign](http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070314/news_1n14atty.html) No need for him to either defend or resign because there was no impropriety.

Who shall read all this? Bill & Jeffrey: Please correct me if I'm wrong - but: isn't there a contradiction between \"James 5:12 But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation.\" and the usual \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\" at court? Thought consequently, each Christian's answer on \"Do you swear...?\" can't be otherwise than \"No, I don't swear!\" In the end, there should be no need for even the thought about swearing if every Christian would live their faith consequently enough. (And: there would not be so many frauds and stuff, but this is another topic) Let me correct you, because you are wrong. The injunction is not to swear by heaven or by earth or with any other other oath. In this injunction the word translated as oath carries the definition, \"An irreverent or blasphemous use of the name of God or anything sacred.\". So let's break the oath taken in court, in this case oath defined as, \"A solemn appeal to a deity, or to some revered person or thing, to witness one's determination to speak the truth, to keep a promise, etc.\", down:\" Do you swear (swear meaning to affirm, assert, or say with solemn earnestness.) to tell the truth, (meaning that you are affirming that you will not lie) the whole truth (meaning that you are affirming that you will not lie by ommission) and nothing but the truth? (meaning that you are affirming that you will not lie by misdirection or mislead by adding extraneous statements) Note that you are not asked to swear (take your oath) by or on God, the holy Book you are presumably resting your hand on or anything else. Notice that you are also not asked to utter any statement irreverent or blasphemous or to use the name of God or anything sacred. As I stated before, you are asked to rest your left hand upon the holy Book (be it Bible, Koran or any other) strictly as a reminder that the oath you take is also witnessed by God. These is a form and structure to taking an oath. Part of this is that to be swearing by something or on something, you must make an explicit statement to that effect. Examples of this are, \"I swear, by God, that I will...\", and, \"I swear on my mother's grave...\". This form of oath taking was particularly prevalent in the era when the book of James was written. | 159) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 11 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Your point is empty because no such thing is done.

But hey... We're a 'christian' nation... right? The person is not asked to swear on or by the holy book, whether Bible, Koran or what have you. The question asked is, \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\". In this context, \"swear\" means \"take an oath\".

But if you bankrupt the entire organization you throw away all of the good along with the bad. And though some do not wish to acknowledge this, there has been far, far more good than bad done by that church. | 166) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Fun with Global Warming - Part Deux!](forum_thread.php?id=37423) ( [Message 527532](forum_thread.php?id=37423&postid=527532)) Posted 7 Mar 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: This just in from National Geographic...

The problem with that is that when you follow the money that states received from those settlements, money that was supposed to go to anti-smoking programs, research and similar wonderful causes, you find that much of it is swirling down the toilet of general fund expenditures, waste and outright fraud. Don't get me wrong, I do not smoke and think it is a vile habit.

I will take them in order and attempt to inject a Global Warming note into my answers: Q: And why should I vote? A: Because if you do not vote those you disagree with are assured a victory without opposition and will assume a mandate to do whatever they darn well wish to do. This will leave you and your income at the mercy of the loudest voices they hear, such as the environmental wackos that want you to fund vast projects without any attempt at proper risk/benefit analysis. Q: They have no reason to furfill their promises to US! Why should they? A: If you do not vote they shouldn't because for all they know everyone agrees with them. If they do run with opposition: 1. The opponent you more closely agree with may win or, 2. They at least know that a substantial portion of their constituents strongly disagree with them and they will moderate their actions for fear of not being re-elected and, 3. Either 1 or 2 will give them pause when considering signing on to a gigantic con game like Kyoto. Q: You gonna vote them out? A: If you campaign for the candidate of your choice and can offer clear and consistent reasons to vote for your candidate, you and the people you bring with you can \"vote them out\". It's been done and will be done again and again on both sides of the argument. Of course, if you do not campaign or vote, you will do absolutely nothing, will remain a victim all of your life and, fund Kyoto and pay for every cock-n-bull scheme that the likes of Al Gore comes up with. | 179) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Last two letters next word - CLOSED CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=37753) ( [Message 523281](forum_thread.php?id=37753&postid=523281)) 25 Feb 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: they said pagans worshipped idols and I asked why we were praying to a statue of Mary The blind leading the blind... ;) So are you saying you are a Pagan?

Do hot chicks like Pagans or Christians? I could change.... Depends on the region and if you are looking for a permanent partner or a throw away. You want to date hot chicks in rural areas then spend a few Sundays finding a church with lots of hot chicks, join the church with the most and, after going regularly for about 3 months, start asking them out. Polite persistence within the church setting and a good job will go far in making your case. This is the best way to go and the best thing is that you get to stay with her until you stop working on the relationship. But remember that women, unlike most men, talk with each other. If you are doing this just for a throw away the well will dry up after the first or second broken heart. If you are looking for throw aways then just go to local bars, drink enough that looks don't matter and at closing time take the last (either very ugly or very bad mojo) woman there home.

Think about it...although at the time America was one of the main importers of Rain forest beef. Europe just didn't eat that many burgers back then.

How do you figure that? In 2006 the US was the main buyer of industrialized cattle beef from Brazil, at $165 million (97,000 tons), but that is a vanishingly small percentage of the total US beef industry for the year (about 0.2%). By all current indications, that percentage is holding true for 2007. More to the point, the US has been significantly absent in consumption of Brazilian beef exports and, indeed, European markets (including Great Britan) are the largest importers of Brazilian beef, both grass fed and industrialized (feedlot grown). By the way, the vast majority off Brazilian beef is grass fed. So, more accurately, huge swathes of the Amazon rain forest were cut down to feed the large cattle herds needed to keep Europe in beef. Yes..Europe also imports a lot of Brazilian beef..but the US is still one of the main importers of beef from there. Here is an interesting article about the Amazon and it's relation to global warming (it's a couple of years old though..but still interesting). Note that the threat to the forest is changing now from beef to Soya since the problems with foot and mouth they had there!! So I guess now I'll have to boycott soya too. :-) [Amazon deforestation slows in Brazil for 2005](http://news.mongabay.com/2005/1205-amazon.html) What ? The USA IMPORTS beef ? BEEF ! us ? We have a Kazillion cows (by actual count). We can't eat'um ALL ! Do we ? Do we import wheat and corn ? We suck Yes, the US imports a relatively small amount of beef products from Brazil and Argentina, mostly as tinned beef and hides. But as I said above, this amounts to about 0.2% of the total US beef market. Brazil actually has the largest commercial herd at about 165 million, compared to the US herd of 97 million. Out of the roughly 7 million metric tons of beef produced by Brazil in 2006, the US consumed 97,000 metric tons, or 1.4%. Let's compare this to Japan (740,000 tons or 10.6%), Russia (730,000 tons or 10.4%), and the European Union (625,000 tons or 8.9%). Es, you are simply wrong.

How do you figure that? In 2006 the US was the main buyer of industrialized cattle beef from Brazil, at $165 million (97,000 tons), but that is a vanishingly small percentage of the total US beef industry for the year (about 0.2%). By all current indications, that percentage is holding true for 2007. More to the point, the US has been significantly absent in consumption of Brazilian beef exports and, indeed, European markets (including Great Britan) are the largest importers of Brazilian beef, both grass fed and industrialized (feedlot grown).

Isn't turning tap water into Holy Water magic ? Walking on water ? ...or bread and wine into flesh and blood. I'll need to check that one out with our resident Voodoo queen. Transubstantiation, changing the substance of the bread and wine (or water, depending on your denomination) into the body and blood of Christ is speaking of a deeply symbolic change, not a magical transformation. Look up transubstantiation in Wikipedia for a very good discussion on the subject. In the Roman Catholic tradition, Holy Water is water which has been blessed (infused with holiness) and set apart for baptism. The small vessels (stoups) in the front of the Roman Catholic and other churches are there for worshipers to use as a reminder of the covenants they made with God when they were baptised. You can't distinguish Holy Water from any other water and, once again, the act is highly symbolic of the intent for which the water is to be used. Sorry, no magic there either. And the walking on water thing? If you read the scripture closely you will find that this was an act of faith. Because Christ believed that he could walk on the water with absolute conviction, he was able to do so. I believe that anyone could do this if they could only have that perfect conviction. Not that I have that kind of faith, would that it were so. But it was the old \"mind over matter\" bromide made real.

Why? Because it gives my family and I a far better life than otherwise would be the case. I have a relationship with God that that I believe gives me tangible benefits. Among those benefits are the health benefits related to prayer I have mentioned previously and a much increased ability to retain equanimity under adverse conditions. I associate with people who are committed to the welfare of my family and vice versa. Indeed, the family is considered sacred in the LDS community. Should I lose my job or become disabled, I am assured that my family will never lack for the necessities. My daughter has a far better chance of living within a traditional family than otherwise. The divorce rate among those who have married with the LSD church is between 6% and 13%, depending on your source, but in any case far lower than that of the general population. This holds true for converts or those born into the LDS church. I could go on, but that is a good start. | 228) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 17 Feb 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: A self evident statement.

Surely...seeing as religious folks are the ones that invented the idea, they should be the ones doing the proving. ...so go on then. Convince me. Straight up I am a non believer! BUT from the multitudes of people that have tried to convince me the bottom line is \"you gotta believe\". There is no \"proof\" one way or the other that can convince anyone that doesn't wish to be convinced. There is no God that is going to come down and say \"believe or die\", and then enforce it. Likewise there is no Devil coming up and saying whatever and then enforcing that. Either you \"believe\" in God or you don't. Which is exactly why the phrase is \"religious faith\". Faith is widely defined as a belief that is not based on proof. In my religion, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, we have 13 Articles of Faith that describe what our core beliefs are: 1. We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. 2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression. 3. We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. 5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof. 6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth. 7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth. 8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. 9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God. 10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory. 11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may. 12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law. 13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acWe believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. That is the LDS faith, my faith, in a nutshell. And I find it endlessly fascinating to explore our similarities and differencies with other religious faiths. | 232) by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Q: Why are there so few Buddhist rhythm and blues bands?

Well, thanks to the Jewish calendar, we know that it was around our Easter time when Jesus died: what became known as the Lord's Supper simply was the meal starting the Passah (Passover[?]) fest. So you can say that Jesus died around Easter. And to subject of prayer: For those who are prayed for and believe in them, prayers work the same way as if the doc of your trust gave you some sugar pills telling you they are the fitting medicine. You trust your doc enough to believe that these pills do work, that's why they will work as if they were real medicine. Or like these homeopathic solutions like one drop of medicine solved in a bathtub full of water: nonetheless they work, because the patients believe that these solutions do work. It's all the same. You believe that prayer helps for you to get healthy again, and - with enough faith - you will get healthy again. Like that woman in the gospel (St. Matthew, chapter 9, verses 20-22) who suffered on some blood disease, and said to herself: If I only touch the clothes of Jesus, \"I shall be whole\". And like so often, it was not just Jesus alone, but the faith of the sick in Him which healed them: \"thy faith hath made thee whole\". And the disease left her like expected by her. But - on the other way around: If you have just little faith (or none at all) and you are sick, and hear that somebody prays for you, you may fear and believe that your disease is worse than thought, and your body will react as if your disease were worse, so your fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. It's all in the mind. If it makes you optimistic you become better, if it makes you pessimistic you become worse. Sorry that I can't explain it better - English still is a foreign language for me. :-D On the contrary, an excellent explanation.

Thank you for your input, nobody, but I would like to know people's opinions, not only about Mohnhaupt, but about crime and punishment in general. Can a person be freed after many years in prison, even that person has been sentenced more than one lifetime sentence for his/her crimes? Could we, as society, as a world society, accept war criminals, who have many many lives on their conscience, to be freed after having served many years in prison? Could we, if e.g. a person like Saddam Hussein hadn't been executed, release him after some years, because he was considered as not dangerous anymore? Should the people who were sentenced in N\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcrnberg and hanged right after have had a prison sentence instead, they would have been freed by now? Is prison for the individual to be corrected or is it retaliation? I believe that, at the least, she should never be set free. The point of her imprisonment was not that she was a danger to society, though she was. The point is not that she is no danger any more, though she may not be. The point is that she is a serial murderer, regardless of the justifications she offered for her killing. She should have been put to death, but she was imprisoned for the rest of her life as partial resititution for her heinous string of murders. To let her free for any reason whatsoever is a vast miscarriage of justice aimed squarely at the families of those she murdered. | 256) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Feb 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I have nothing to do with it.

Why should Matthew want to include a fictional story into Jesus's life, if that is what it is? I believe there are other similar stories in other religions of divine babies being born. I believe Krishna was supposed to have been born in some kind of stable amidst poverty. ???? Actually, there are two of the four Canonical Gospels that mention the birth of Jesus. Matthew (in chapter 1) and and Luke (in chapter 2). And you are missing the point in the accounts of the Crucifixion. The death of Jesus is not the important part, the important art, the part that is celebrated is the resurrection that came about a few days later. | 265) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 8 Feb 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I read the thread.

A small detail, but Christianity is largely based on the resurrection of Jesus. The celebration of his birth was, as you said, an afterthought started somewhere around the 3rd century Anno Domni. The anthropologist Sir James George Frazer writes about religions throughout the world and history. There are recurrent themes throughout. The pagan festivals took place at Easter (fertility and rebirth) the summer solstice, Halloween (the Celtic New Year) and the Winter solstice (Christmas). The Early Christian church found that they could not stop people celebrating these so the incorporated them into Christianity to help obtain converts. The 'Virgin' Mary is all that remains of the old pagan Goddess worship. The death of Jesus is reminiscent of the old sacrifices of the one year king to bring rebirth to the land in the spring and of course Christmas is the old Winter solstice festival. Churches throughout Europe have carvings in them of the old pagan gods and goddesses including the Green Man and the Sheela Na Gig. Jesus was not born at Christmas and it is unlikely that he died at Easter. I have read that the actual date was somewhere around April. But the date of death, due to it's proximity to Passover and the dates of the procuratorship of Pilate, is quite firmly set in early April. | 266) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 8 Feb 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Please remember that minced words are inediable...like split hairs.

The snow, which is expected to fall for several hours, could be 2cm to 5cm deep in south-east England and up to 15cm in hilly areas of Wales and the Midlands. The Met Office has issued an early warning of severe weather. The Highways Agency has warned of poor driving conditions on Thursday morning, and rail travellers can also expect disruption in some parts of the UK. The BBC Weather Centre says snow will begin falling at about midnight or in the early hours of the morning in Wales and south-west England.

You have to feel bad if you drive a car. So you will be not so negative if the txes are rising. Nobody is talking about that Mercedes was able to produce water based cars. Nobody was interested. In 1983 Renault builds the first electric car. No one bought it. There are a few technics to build cars with no CO2 but it should take around 20 years if you can buy it. Then the gas prices are at $5 a gallon or more because you feel dirty. In the US, GM introduced an electric car several years ago, but there were serious problems with it. The most important of the problems was that the car was hideously expensive, so expensive that GM only allowed customers to lease not purchase. Range per charge for the car was about half that of a similar conventional car and there were few recharge points available. And the car was under powered, which was a sticking point for many US drivers. The US government will never get the majority of drivers to feel bad for driving a car. Outside of large urban areas, distances are just too great to consider driving or owning automobiles as any other than a necessity.

The dictionary definitions of the words proven, identified, probable, potential, ultimately recoverable and unconventional are quite different, as are the definitions of the words as used by the oil industry. Let's see if we can't find definitions, either direct or taken from context, for these terms in the article itself... The article states, \"By definition, a proven reserve is one that can be developed economically. But many oil reserves fall somewhat below a standard index of affordability and are therefore not counted.\" And again from the article, \"According to a US Geological Survey report quietly published in 2000, there is more oil outside the Middle East than inside the region. Certainly two thirds is not at all accurate -- It's 54 percent of identified reserves, possibly 40 percent of ultimately recoverable reserves, and possibly 30 percent or less if you include unconventional heavy oil fields. Here is another quote from the article, \"In 1984, geologists estimated a five percent probability of another 199 billion barrels remaining to be added in the Gulf region. In five years those reserves had already been added. (Adelman, 1993).\" The article quotes Daniel Yergin, \"Advances in the technology for handling the oil sand deposits in the province of Alberta have, by cutting production costs almost in half, moved this enormous volume of potential supply into the economically recoverable \"proven reserves\" column. ( Iraq does not hold the key to world oil equation, syndicated April 6, 2003.) Finally, from the article, \"Unconventional resources, such as extra heavy oils, tar sands, gas in tight sands, and coal bed methane...\" So, you see, the meaning of the terms are present either by direct definition or taken from context. But only if you actually read the article rather than skim. You can rarely poke holes in an argument if you have not done your proper research. | 288) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Fun with Global Warming - Part Deux!](forum_thread.php?id=37423) ( [Message 511118](forum_thread.php?id=37423&postid=511118)) Posted 31 Jan 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: If not, we all go down the Climate Change plug together.

What is a matter for debate is what effects the changing climate will have and what to do to mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change. As Rush has said ad infinitum, any and every solution will be required to be, and to be precieved as, economically feasable. For the government to choose options that negatively affect their citizens without an unarguable positive return would be dereliction of duty. For that same government to throw vast sums of money toward a mitigation scheme, Kyoto, that will not and cannot bring benefit to their citizens would be criminal. Some of the current research suggests that the current climate change trand will cause the ocean levels to rise dramatically within a couple of decades. Other research suggests that fresh water melt into the Atlantic Ocean will disrupt the Gulf Stream and cause ice age conditions in the northern hemisphere. What does this mean in terms of response to these conditions? What is to be done if the world ocean level rises 10 meters, 20 meters, 30 meters? In the case of the Gulf Stream stopping, will the Ice Age conditions stop the ocean level rise? Will the ice age conditions cause dramatically increased glaciation and a consequent ocean level drop? How will either warming or ice age conditions affect the major staple crop growing regions? The responses to these suggested outcomes are, in many cases, mutually exclusive. Additional research needs to target not only the fact of climate change but also the required responses to climate change. This research will allow for a 'library' of contingency plans to be built, shorten the planning cycle and if the information is in the public arena will allow governments to properly justify needed changes to their citizenry. | 297) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: [Practice what you preach?](http://www.klas-tv.com/Global/story.asp?S=5997093) Priests are people, subject to the same frailties as every other one else.

I mean really harvest the ditches of Iowa. Seriously take a look at how much cellulose is produced in a corn field compared to the volume of corn and then the production value and it becomes evident that you wouldn't have to change or disrupt the production of the corn crop to see a gain in ethanol. Farmers could also harvest cellulose as a secondary cash crop. As I stated below, the reason that corn will, at least initially, be the major source of ethanol is that the technology is in place and familiar. Companies like Iogen show promise for the high returns you talk about above, but any major investment will still involve risks that need to be justified. As Rush says, it's all about the economics. One important reason why corn cellulose is not goig to kick off as a big thing in the drier (outside of Iowa and Indiana) high volume corn producton areas is that the plant material remaining after harvest is plowed back into the soil as one of the important strategies that maximize soil water retention. But that is secondary to main point, which is that there is no monolithic single solution. Any solution will need to be carefully planned to minimize economic disruption and will definitely need to be able to justify the outlay of capitol required for implementation by private enterprise. I do not know how it would work in the United Kingdom, but in the US, any scheme put forward without incentive for private investment will ultimately fail because political climates change over time. | 299) |[Message by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Former BOTDs are used to the attention.

But to be clear, your further information doesn't counter my point--which was that everything you want people to do, they would do almost automatically and without thinking if it made economic sense to them. You just wrote a paragraph about the increased use of ethanol. The increased use of ethanol has severe problems also. The source for ethanol is corn, which though renewable, is a finite resource just like every other resource in the world. Increased demand for ethanol is already starting to raise the price for corn. This is leading to increased prices for product ranging from tortillas to Fritos. And with the President calling for US Government vehicles to use ethanol blends, the dramatically increased demand for corn will cause the price to skyrocket. Because of the increased demand, farmers will start getting better returns on yield for corn. This will lead to farmers planting corn rather than soybeans, wheat or other crops, leading to lower production of those other crops. Less wheat and soybeans means higher prices on products ranging from bread to tofurkeys. Corn requires far more water than wheat or soybeans and because farmers will be planting more corn in locations where there is not sufficient rainfall to grow the crop, the strain on water resources will grow. And who can blame poor third world farmers for wanting to make a better living? This is only considering the costs associated with current 15% to 20% gasoline-ethanol blends. If an alternative fuel such as E85, with 80% ethanol, is brought into the picture then the previous points are greatly increased and have to include the costs of converting existing gasoling engines over to E85 use and increased vehicle costs related to massive retooling of automotive production lines. Ah the single minded approach...well ethanol can come from many things including but not limited to sugar, corn, various grains, and cellulose which has proven to give the best return yet. Basically if you can ferment it then you can use it....oh and by the way soybeans and corn are grown in rotation on the same land receiving the same average rain fall...so supply of water not an issue unless you are trying to grow them in an arid location which would be less suited there as a cash crop thus less likely to be an issue. Arid is a relative term when talking about corn production. In the US the areas that get enough annual rainfall for non-irrigated corn production center on Iowa and Indiana, but not much farther. Because corn gives, by far, the greatest yield per acre, corn production extends well beyond that area and an extensive body of research is available on how to maximize corn yield with limited water resources. Soybeans need less water than corn and are more drought resistant, but do not give the high yields and are therefore the less desireable crop. A farmer raising corn for ethanol production need not concern himself with any \"organic\" issues. This means that if corn prices rise high enough it becomes economically feasible for the farmer to use fertilizer and not concern himself with strict crop rotation. The reason that corn will, at least initially, be the major source of ethanol is that the technology is in place and familiar. Companies like Iogen show promise for the high returns you talk about above, but any major investment will still involve risks that need to be justified. As Rush says, it's all about the economics. My approach is not single minded, but my point was focused on ethanol production/use and was intended to illustrate that ethanol use has as many disadvantages as advantages and cannot be considered in isolation due to far ranging effects of resource reallocation related to increased demand and use. | 303) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) You are 15% chav!

These thoughts are based on notes I took quite some time back on a programme about the Middle East conflict. I hope they are still relevant and reasonably accurate. A major part of the battle ground in this century will be over water in the Middle East. It is one of the most arid parts of the world. Israel, however, leads the world in dry land irrigation technology, transforming parts of the desert into agricultural land where fruit is grown for export, i.e. avocados, melons, grapes, etc. Israel uses nearly 80% of its water on agriculture. Most of the water comes from underground lakes called 'Aquefas' and competition for this is fierce. The West Bank aquefa runs from East to West and one third of Israel's water derives from this source. Israel built settlements here to maintain control of this water supply as well as the land. As a result, Israel has not only modern irrigation but running water in homes. By contrast, many Palestinian farmers must rely on primitive irrigation and many Palestinian towns rely on water tankers in the streets for their water supply. Whether some of these circumstances have changed now I do not know. Also as we already know, Israel has recently given up some of her territories; not that this has made life any easier, it seems, for Israeli citizens. Whatever the problems over water supply, it seems likely to me that water will be one of the major causes for conflict in the 21st century, particularly since fresh water is supposed to become more scarce in the future for people throughout the world. As a result, I cannot see things getting any better for the Israelis. Only worse. There are three main sources of fresh water in Israel: Lake Kinneret, the Coastal Aquifer and the Mountain (Yarkon-Taninim) Aquifer. Lake Kinneret is above ground, the others are the standard layers of earth, gravel and porous stone that make up an aquifer. These resources can provide 600 to 800 million cubic meters of fresh water per year, which is used almost exclusively for non-agricultural consumption. The vast majority of agricultural water is derived from \"grey water\" sources, which are basically recycled sewage and the like. The lake and costal aquifer have some problems with salinity, sometimes to the point that water from those sources doesn't meet drinking water standards, making the mountain aquifer their most important water resource. The Mountain (Yarkon-Taninim) Aquifer is the largest bone of contention due to its proximity to Palestine. The aquifer extends east of the Costal Aquifer from the slopes of Mt. Carmel to Beersheba, and from the crests of mountain ridges in Judea and Samaria to the coastal plain. What this means is that if Israel moves out of these areas and if Palestine were to allow sewage or industrial waste (or deliberate introduction of poison) to occur on the western slopes of Judea and Samaria, it would contaminate, probably permanently, the key source of drinking water for Israel's major urban centers and environs. Israel has reached the maximum population size sustainable by the three main sources, but they are building water treatment plants as backup for Lake Kinnet and the Costal Aquifer. What they worry about most is deliberate sabatoge designed to deprive them of potable water. | 310) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 22 Jan 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: its amazing how close we came to never existing temp of 100 degrees to hot or cold no astroed for the dinosoures 1 gene thats all it would take What? by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: i am not fileing taxes this year i want to help get us out of debt not in more If you made an income, good luck with that not filing thing.

That is how my Mother's family got to Windham, Connetticut, in the 1760's. I will never accept illegal immigrants, just as the United Kingdom does not accept illegal immigrants. And I used the US as a readily verified example. I would never dream of pressuring you or any one else to leave their comfort zone, but that is part of my point. | 313) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe International! | Posted 21 Jan 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I get paid the same as everyone else that does my job who has the experience and qualifications I have.

I use a wireless network while I am in class. Obviously, when I search for wireless networks, I can see the WAPs that the school set up around the building. However, I cannot see the other computers that other individuals are using. I have a sneaking suspicion that a guy in a couple of my classes has used the wireless functionality we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re all using to peek at the files on my computer. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m pretty sure that twice now I have seen my work on his computer screen, but it has been fleeting. A) is that even possible? B) Could I do the same thing to him to check if he has? C) How would I know if he has? D) Would he have to have installed something on my machine? E) Can I prevent it in the future? Any thoughts, places to look, references, et cetera would be greatly appreciated. Definitely possible. If you have weak passwords or guest accounts enable or perhaps not all (of the many in the case of XP) security patches installed. But to keep everyone out (including MS and others) may i suggest a firewall (personal) suitable for Windows 2K or XP. Examples would include Black Ice Defender or Tiny Personal Firewall. These usually block all incoming requests by default; however you will need to probably setup stricter outgoing rules (you may already have a trojan on your system). These tools log and alert on unusual incoming requests and potential threats etc (basic intrusion detection if you will). You will know if someone on the local LAN is having a go at your machine, and then you can 'see' who it is.... Enigma.

I don't know why Saudi Arabia isn't on that chart, I thought that the US imports from the Saudis, though maybe that's recently changed. Even if the United States imports from these countries, Mike, it's a global world. The price of oil is internationally affected by what happens in Iraq: supply and demand. The United States is just another purchaser, even with their high volume of orders, they're not going to get that much of a price break from any of these suppliers. The price moves depending on all manner of real and perceived shortages of supply. And the oil producers are not the ones that have the most effect on prices. It is the oil brokers that cause the largest jumps in the proce of uncommitted production. | 318) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Posted 17 Jan 2007 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: An article on Greenland ice melting in the online edition of the NYTimes is really scary.

In today's Corriere della Sera, the Milan newspaper, the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection states that an Euro 4 diesel car (of the most recent and advanced type) pollutes more than an Euro 1 car powered by a gasoline engine.

They will all laugh you out of the building. They all take on interns. They all use temps. They all hire outside contractors (which is what keeps me in a job). And not a single one of them \"use\" temps, interns or outside contractors for research and development. Skilled and experienced temps are hired and used for very specific purposes and never given full access to the corporate infrastructure due to very real security concerns. Interns (inexperienced college graduates) need to be trained extensively before thay can make significant contributions to a design effort in any technical field. There is no short cut that will compensate for experience. There are a very few highly talented individuals who, at a relatively young age, have insights into facets of their chosen field. These rare individuals have been known to get sweetheart deals but those sweetheart deals are risky and sucessful ones are rarer yet. And \"fixtures\" that do not bring a return on the company investment (their salary and benefits) do not last long. No company can support such a drain on resources for long. I would be willing to bet that the \"fixtures\" you are talking about are upper or upper middle management.

It is my belief, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that the current climate change is well within the boundries of established planetary cycles involving solar energy input, the factors mentioned in the Milankovich Theory and the effects of volcanic activity. It is everyones right to put their head in the sand when it comes it this issue. For people who do this, all I can say to them is.....we can't go spewing stuff into the atmosphere for over 100 years without something going wrong. We've seen already what happens when we spew stuff into waterways, it just takes longer to see an apparent change with the atmosphere as it is soo much bigger. Carbon dioxide is at levels that the earth has not seen in over 600,000 years! With it increasing significantly above a rolling average in the past century. Surely you can't sit there and tell me that we can spew stuff into the atmosphere at increasing amounts with no adverse reactions taking place! Aside from that, in Australia, the hottest 10 years on record have all occurred in the last 15 years. Areas of Australia have been in sustained drought now for 5 years. The city of Melbourne which had a dam built to make it drought proof is now in stage 3 water restrictions with overall water storages at 38% and falling at approx 1% per week. There is no long term forecast rains sufficient to increase storages to the point of easing water restrictions. Some parts of the state of Victoria have no water in their dams and all water has to be trucked in. The longest river in Australia, the Murray River, has been estimated to stop flowing for the first time ever this summer. We are seeing leaf drop on trees, due to stress, that makes the place look like autumn and it's only part way into summer. I have never seen this. On Christmas day Melbourne had it's coldest maximum temperature for a Christmas day ever recorded. Two weeks prior to that we had 40C! Globally we are seeing weather extremes (which is a manifestation of global warming). This means that places that use to get their rain over periods of time now get it in large downpours. Therefore overall the average rainfall for an area may not change, it just comes all at once and doesn't get the chance to soak in causing increased flooding. We are seeing hurricanes/cyclones forming earlier every year and getting more intense. We are seeing spring come earlier and earlier every year. The ad hoc evidence should really be enough for people to start altering their behaviour now! I could go on and on...but I have work to do and someone to interview for a job. Live long and BOINC. Let me reiterate: It is my belief, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that the current climate change is well within the boundries of established planetary cycles involving solar energy input, the factors mentioned in the Milankovich Theory and the effects of volcanic activity. I do not dispute your evidence of climate change or the necessity to address the effects of same.

A listing of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"threatened\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 means the polar bear population is not immediately facing extinction. If that were so, the bears would be listed as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"endangered.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 After much resistance, despite growing scientific consensus, the White House is again acknowledging the global warming threat. At this point, this is a safe political move. The polar bear population, believed to be between 20,000 and 25,000 in five countries, has been shrinking. The population of one widely studied group \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac there are 19 in all \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac is said to have suffered a 22 percent decline. The bear populations in Alaska are reportedly doing much better. In announcing the listing earlier this week, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said the polar bear population was steadily declining because of the rapid thinning of Arctic sea ice. The bears use the ice as a platform to travel and to hunt seals. When the ice disappears, the bears are stuck on land where they have trouble finding food. They lose weight, and their cubs' survival rate declines. Unfortunately, the Bush administration acted only after a federal court ordered it to do so. The Interior Department was given until this week to make a determination on listing. Still, the listing has been made, and the Interior Department's U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service now have a year to decide what should be done. Kempthorne made a point this week that it is beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act to address global warming. But the polar bear population decline won't be slowed without directly addressing global warming. There seems to be some controversy with this one too. Here is a link to an article that appears to dispute the ruling. [Polar bear worries unproven, expert says](http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2006/05/15/polar-bears.html) I have also heard unsubstantiated stastics that while some polar bear populations are declining, they are still larger that 30 years ago.

The U.S. extended $4.34 billion in credit in 1945, allowing Britain to stave off bankruptcy after devoting almost all its resources to the war for half a decade. Since 1950, Britain has made payments on the debt at the end of every year except six. At the time it was granted, the loan strained trans-Atlantic relations. British politicians expected a gift in recognition of their contribution to the war effort, especially for the lives lost before the United States entered the war after Pearl Harbor. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The U.S. didn't seem to realize that Britain was bankrupt,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Alan Sked, a historian at the London School of Economics. The loan was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"denounced in the House of Lords, but in the end, the country had no choice.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The loan was double the size of the British economy at the time. As far as I know, East Germany had paid all Germany's WWII debts to the former Soviet Union until the end of the '80s (OK the Soviets took it out of that country year by year, including interests), while West Germany not only never had to pay WWII debts to the USA but was given big money from them with the Marshall plan. No wonder that East Germany was financially broke then while West Germany became prosperous. The difference in economic position was more an effect of Communist economic policy than otherwise. The Marshall Plan provided seed money to rebuild infrastructure, not total economic support. This probably halved the recovery time for West Germany, but everything after that came from the effort and genius of the German people. | 363) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [SADDAM HUSSEIN -- GOOD 494848](forum_thread.php?id=36772&postid=494848)) Posted 31 Dec 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: How exactly is a nation like Israel supposed to 'deal' with their neighbors like Iran that have openly pledged to kill every Israeli man, woman, and child?

If they will lose morethan they would gain by tangling with you and in fact have things to gain by dealing with you, you win and they win. The best of both worlds!

You forget...Israel has THE BOMB and has threatened to us it before. The US also has THE BOMB and HAS used it before! Negotiating from a position of strength is an easy negotiation. Please study up on the effects of atomic weapons. You cannot threaten with nuclear weapons. You either use them as a truly ultimate last means of survival or you let your country be destroyed. If a nuclear weapon were used anywhere in the region there is a very high probability that fallout would poison Israel also. A Pyrrhic victory is still suicide. The only possible negotiating postion is the MAD (Mutually Assured Destrucion) stance. Unfortunately, this requires a sane negotiating opponent. I am sorry, but fanatics of any stripe do not qualify as sane by any measure. And fanatics that believe that if they can force you into a position where you must use such means for survival they win are on that razor thin edge between fanatic and psychotic. If you have a problem believing that anyone that leads a country could be such a borderline psychotic, then read transcripts of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speaches in Iran and other Muslim countries. Don't bother with the US media because they sanitize his statements for a variety of reasons. Read translations from Al Jazzera or similar sources. You cannot \"negotiate\" at weapons point as your sole negotiating strategy.

Everyone who bought \"Deutsche Telekom\" stocks thought they were Low Risk but lost most of their investigations. The bad thing on Stock Trading is that it's not predictable in the long run, that it's only for the short-term turn-over. If I had enough money to invest, I'd rather spend it for a lower but sure and predictable long-term win, than for a higher but risky short-term win which I can not predict. Low Risk doesn't mean you can't lose money, it means you don't lose your entire savings, your kid's college fund, your house and your car if the stock falls. You start with an initial investment and no matter how high the stock climbs, you can never fall below zero. I realize that's an overly simplified explanation, but it seems you don't understand how the market works anyway. Well, it's your opinion that I don't know what I'm talking about - only because my statements are opposed to yours. It's not an opinion, it's a fact and you verified it yet again with your comments about the stock market. Well - I just saw a mistake of mine: I wrote investigation instead of investment. But okay, you read the right meaning out of the context. No, I learned enough about the stock market, and this market economy in general during the last 17 years to quite know how it works. That brokers listen to insider informations and even rumors to decide whether to buy or to sell. And that the prices are falling and rising due to supply & demand: more demand -> higher prices, lower demand -> lower prices. I know that. But I - for my own morals - can not agree with that. For me, any thing with a certain value, which is not perishable, should cost the same no matter if a few or many people want to buy it. But this is my own view on this matter, and the way I would handle things if I were in business. I can't agree with this antisocial market economy. This is in total opposite to my moral values. You cannot ignore the actual working of the world because you do not agree with nature. The law of supply & demand has been ignored by people and governments, but only at their peril. The USSR eventually paid that price and the Chinese government is attempting to work pseudo-capitalistic (supply & demand) principles into it's operating lexicon in an attempt to avoid the pressures that broke the USSR apart. We will all see if they are sucessful. To the case in point: Whenever an item, be it a stock issue, a mineral, a metal, a foodstuff or whatever, is desired by more than one person there will be competition to aquire the item. The amount of effort required to obtain the item is the price of the item. As the item becomes harder to obtain due to increased demand or rarity the amount of effort required to obtain it will increase and vice versa. You see this in nature from the micro scale to the macro. For instance, the competition for prey in the African Serengeti plains. In modern human terms, we use money to represent, store and accumulate excess effort. Since you cannot remove the inalienable need to compete for resources, the only way to materially affect this is to provide increased supply of the item or to redirect the competition by substituting a different item. The latter is the foundation of the advertising industry. The whole picture, in human terms, is complicated by con men like Kenneth Lay, former head of Enron in the US. These types can manage to skew the marketplace by short-circuiting the fundamental operation of the market. The same type of market alteration can occur when government over-taxes. In both cases, the pool of accumulated effort (money) is reduced. This has the effect of making aquisition of any item require more effort, thus producing an artificial scarcity. The point I am aiming at is that rather than ignore the law of supply & demand, which leads to frustration and ruin, focus on methods of increasing supply for all, thus reducing the burden for all. To my view, capitolism does this most effectively. | 372) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 28 Dec 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Es, can you direct me to the research data that supports your claims made above?

Actually it was before that. In 1975 there was a doomsday article in Newsweek about Global Cooling. Well there was problem with Global Dimming which has masked the greenhouse effect. The other pollutants that we used to pump out (heavier particulates) helped block the sun's rays. It caused the monsoons to move north and thereby caused the famine in Ethiopia back in the 80s. The West have since cleaned up those pollutants which were helping to protect us from some of effects of global warming...which is why in the past we saw a smaller increase in global temperature than expected. Of course there is the other extreme effect of global warming where the Gulf stream will be switched off due to decreased salination levels from the melting of the ice caps. That will plunge the Northern Hemisphere into an ice age. So basically, the weather system is not linear. One small change can have dramatic consequences and push the whole system into a totally different equilibrium. Probably at huge cost to human life (eg..the famine in Ethiopia). For example..a pencil balanced on it's tip...one tiny push in any direction has a drastic effect on it's state. Global Warming is generally considered a misnomer.

It depends on the definition of 'religion' I guess. If it involves worshiping a god and feeling blackmailed into going to hell if you do bad, ... That all depends on which medieval monk defined the rules, or tweaked them around to suite what they wanted, and also on which preacher is trying to define what the Holy spirit is. Excuse me for being totally naive but why should I believe anything some old men conjured up hundreds and thousands of years ago, or claim what someone said 2000 years ago, a record of it recorded third hand even if not made up. What I do know is what the Christian Churches say today. Which is contrary to Darwinism. Contrary to the fact that dinosaurs existed. And generally contrary to any rational understanding. I can see your point. Darwinism is contrary to what some of the churches still preach. But that doesn't prevent me to have belief in a God. For me, Darwinism is just a theory (even one based on scientific observations); and who tells that the world as we know it hasn't developed (made?) out of the ruins of another one, that one where the dinosaurs have existed? In my own view there is no inconsistence. But may be it's because I knew the Darwinist point before I began to believe... I think this anti darwinism is only in the US. We have our own pope's. And they vote Actually, as a Jesuit priest told me once, the only way that there can be a conflict between religion and Darwinism is if you insist that God is limited to doing things in ways that cannot be understood.

Ironically, Madison was the one who frequently advocated \"total separation of church and state\", but it was Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association which has been misused by activist judges to found the myth that the US Constitution contains this point.

Walt Disney World resort gave an ultimatum to a Santa lookalike who was visiting the park Sunday, warning him to ditch his festive gear or get out. J.D. Worley, 60, is used to being mistaken for Santa Claus. But it had always been something that brought him joy, until a recent visit to Disney World. Worley, who has a long white beard and bears a striking resemblance to St. Nick, was followed around by many an awed youngster during his recent visit to the park. \"Adults and children alike came up to me and asked to take pictures with me. I even had my picture taken with groups of cast members and store managers,\" Worley said. Several of the tiny tots asked if he was Santa Claus, to which he responded, 'yes, I am.' But is Worley really Kris Kringle? He admits he is not. \"Christmas is supposed to be about kids, and how do you tell a kid that comes up to you and grabs your leg and calls you 'Santa,' how do I say, 'get away from me kid, I'm not Santa?'\" said Worley. Worley does, however, have some experience as Santa Claus. \"J.D. has been playing Santa for a long time,\" says his wife, Darlene. \"He plays Santa and I play Mrs. Claus. We do it for charity, and we march in parades. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve done it for the troops in our local National Guard, and for disabled vets at the local VA hospital.\" Disney, however, would prefer that the park's official Santa Claus remain the one and only. \"They told me I either needed to alter my appearance or I needed to leave the park because I was impersonating Santa Claus. They told us that Santa was considered a Disney character,' said Worley. Darlene thinks the park was overreacting. \"Almost everyone there wears Santa hats and dresses in red and green during the holidays. The kids thought it was wonderful that Santa was actually a real person in the park,\" Darlene said. Jacob DiPietre, a spokesman for Walt Disney World, said Worley was never banned from the park, only asked to stop impersonating the jolly man. \"We're very committed to protecting the magic of Santa Claus for all our guests, especially children. We asked him to stop presenting himself as Santa Claus and he agreed,\" said DiPietre. Darlene says Christmas has lost some of its luster this year, in part, thanks to what happened at Disney World. But Worley is working to keep his spirit alive. \"I'm still angry with Disney, I'm still hurt,\" said Worley, \"but I'm not going to let it ruin my Christmas. I'm not going to let it stop me from going to Disney, if they let me in. I still look like Santa, and I'm not going to shave my beard off.\" [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,236796,00.html](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,236796,00.html) [Video](http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=1781505&version=5&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=VSTY&pageId=3.1.1) That rumbling noise in California is Walt spinning in his grave! | 390) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Carolers told to stop singing at ice rink ASSOCIATED PRESS December 15, 2006 Taking Christianity out of Christmas By Linda Chavez; a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"An Unlikely Conservative: The Transformation of an Ex-Liberal.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 December 15, 2006 I could understand this BS in countries claiming themselves as atheistic, like the late Soviet Union, or old East Germany - and even there Christian holidays were celebrated because of tradition (though they were not free days, except Christmas). What happens there in the US is not only in opposite to their First Amendmend (freedom of religion), but also an insult against the vast majority of US-Americans, against their traditions, beliefs and feelings. Which is why the mostly very liberal people who are waging this war on religion are attempting to do it via the courts. Which is why they are continually attempting (with some degree of success) to intimidate people and organizations by threatening lawsuits. They know that if they can get their case adjudicated before a judge that agrees with their point of view the can get the judge to pass a ruling favorable to their cause. Judges that attempt social engineering via decisions which do not follow accepted precedent or which bypass the US Constitution are known as \"activist judges\". Activist judges are generally attempting to create law from the bench, because the causes that activist judges support are not supported by the majority of US citizens. This is rule by fiat and is inimical to the very concept of our nations' Constitution, as the only people authorized by the US Constitution to make law are the elected representatives (Senators and Congressmen). The people who are using the judiciary to wage war on Christmas are only concerned with their own idiology and could care less what the majority of US citizens want. The only difference between them, the KKK, tin horn dictators from Korea or Iran and the fanatic Islamofaschists is the details of their idiology.

But: According to the ethic rules of the party they were in, and of which I learned in school and in the youth organization, there was most of the Commandments (just without anything quoting god) So: honesty against anybody and against the country were the main principles I learned in past.

The problem with leaving out the divine is that children do not learn that they will need to account for their entire lives to someone who cannot be lied to, cannot be fooled, cannot be distracted. In my experience, this precept provides a powerful moderating influence on people for the same reason that children do not misbehave when an adult is present. The problem with this line of thought ( in my opinion ) is that if the parent's don't believe in being accountable to that being, then teaching their children that THEY should believe it would seem hyppocritical to the child once he/she gets a little older. It's kinda the same thing as a parent telling a child not to smoke, and then lighting up right after the lecture about it. The kids I knew who were not taught this lesson while growing up tended to get into trouble because they were able to rationalize and convince themselves that doing {whatever this wrong thing was} would be OK because nobody would ever find out. For kids, especially adolescent boys, the lesson seems to be \"I'ts OK if you don't get caught!\" not \"Don't do it bacause it's wrong!\" That is simply a failure on the part of the parents to instill the proper values in the child with or without God being in the equation. * author's note * These are simply opinions/ideas put forth. They should in no way be construed as what I truly do or do not believe in The issue is that absent belief in what has been called \"a higher power\" parents have a far harder chore instilling proper moral principles in their children's character. Not to say it can't be done. Not even to say that most arrive on the moral high ground on their own merits. But I am saying that belief in a higher power provides an essential ballast to the ship of moral action. On average, people with strong faith are shielded from the worst of lifes buffets by that faith. They are not as susceptible to depression or despair. They are generally happier and claim a higher level of satisfaction with their lives. | 392) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Paratrooper wins posthumous Victoria Cross Last Updated: December 2006, 06:49 GMT For valour: Corporal Budd's body was found surrounded by three dead Taliban The Victoria Cross has been awarded to a paratrooper who died after single-handedly rushing a Taliban position under heavy gunfire. Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, of the 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, stormed a Taliban position in southern Afghanistan on 20 August. It is the first time the VC - Britain's highest award for bravery in the face of enemy attack - has been awarded posthumously for a quarter of a century. Corporal Mark Wright, from the same battalion, has been posthumously awarded the George Cross, the UK's other highest bravery award, for leading a dramatic rescue operation from a minefield in Afghanistan on 6 September. The pair head a list of more than 130 servicemen and women being honoured for bravery around the world, primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan. At an emotional ceremony at the Ministry of Defence Cpl Budd's widow Lorena and Cpl Wright's fiancee Gillian held back tears as the citations to the two awards were read out, graphically detailing the acts of courage which cost their loved-ones' lives. Cpl Budd, of Ripon, North Yorkshire, twice led audacious assaults into the heart of enemy gunfire in Sangin District. On 27 July this year he spearheaded an attack on two gunmen on the roof of a building to allow a wounded colleague to be evacuated for life-saving treatment. During an engagement on 20 August, with \"withering'' fire forcing his comrades to take cover, Cpl Budd continued the assault alone, continuing to rush the Taliban position despite his own wounds. His body was later found surrounded by those of three Taliban fighters. His wife Lorena paid tribute to a \"proud and passionate Parachute Regiment soldier'' who was also a loving husband and father. \"He did it doing the job he loved with his comrades and friends in the regiment he loved,'' she said. Cpl Budd leaves two daughters, two-year-old Isabelle and Imogen, who was born in September shortly after her father's death. Cpl Wright, 27, from Edinburgh, was honoured for his courage, continuing to command the minefield rescue operation despite being mortally wounded himself. He was one of seven casualties that day including three who lost limbs. \"Despite this horrific situation and the serious injuries he had himself sustained, Cpl Wright continued to command and control the incident,'' the citation to his award reads. \"He remained conscious for the majority of the time, continually shouting encouragement to those around, maintaining morale and calm amongst the many wounded men.'' General Sir Richard Dannatt, the head of the army, said the awards conjured up feelings of both pride and sorrow. \"What they did was genuinely humbling,'' he said. \"When the citation for Cpl Wright in the minefield was read out I didn't see any dry eyes in the hall.'' \u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors My condolences go out to their families.

The point i was making was that our society is not geared towards ethics (it is easier to cheat/steal to get ahead in some societies where you are 'ranked' for want of a better word by the stuff you have collected) and that organised religion today is not sufficient to instil sound ethics. You are quite right about that. Religion alone has never been sufficient. These concepts need to be instilled in the home when the little skulls full of mush are first filling with knowledge of the world. Learning why you should be honest need not occur simultaneously with learning that you should be honest. That path is truly a school of hard knocks for most of us. This applies for other ethical concepts as well. Also, children should be able to observe adults applying ethical lessons on a day to day basis, most importantly the child's parents. | 400) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: [US coins carry more value in metal than money](http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061214/news_1n14coins.html) You know, I would have thought that the existing laws that prohibit defacing American currency would have covered that. | 401) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: You're right, BillHyland.

In 2005 the US government foreign aid was more than $18 billion and the US private sector foreign aid exceeded $62 billion. This figure has already been topped in the year to date figures for 2006, without considering the enhanced private sector givin that occurs during the Christmas season. The next closest country, Japan, gave less than half of that total. Do not attempt to tell me that the US has not shown strength on \"welfare or other levels\". I know about the private sector foreign aid (like CARE etc.) But wouldn't it been better if the US government were known as a peaceful one than as a war government? I mean there were only a few Presidents who had no war during their time of duty. Mostly to \"protect democracy\" what ever it was in the view of the actual President, to be the \"world's sheriff\" - and this is why the other countries refuse to join in. IMHO the States are too much relying on their own strength no matter what others are saying. The citizens themselves are much more aware of the real needs of the poor than the government, so there are much more spendings by the private than by the government. And - those 18 billion $ of government aid - how much is it compared to the costs for military purposes? 10%? 5%? Less? To look only on the total amount does not say a thing if you don't compare it with other factors. Japan for example has much less inhabitants than the US, so this total sum is naturally less. But seeing it in comparison to the number of citizens (or to the GNP) could this \"less than half of that total\" be probably even more than the USA had spent. Like the [\"two mites\" of the widow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_of_the_widow%27s_mite) in the Bible, which was for her \"all that she had\", while the others had spend just a part of their abundance. (see St. Mark 12:41-44) The \"percentage\" argument is specious. No \"other factors\" mitigate the fact that the total amount from the US is far greater in absolute terms than any other country. Especially in the realm of private sector charity and especially when immediate relief from disaster is needed. Whenever a disaster occurs, wherever it occurs, the US is expected to be there to help. And we are always there. If one of your friends had received emergency aid from you and said, \"You give me more than any three others, but I want more because the others are giving me a higher percentage of their money.\", what would you think?

We need to remain, as has been said, \"in the world, not of it\". It is every persons duty to strive to be a better person and to protect those who cannot protect themselves from the evil people of the world. Evil and good are just human constructs. People are controlled by their desires and emotions and (today) garbage advertising which is thrown your face 20 times a day telling you how you should look, what you should eat, what car you should drive, the house you should own, 'forcing' people to work jobs that they hate so they can buy crap that they don't need. Is this an \"evil force\"?. Certainly it has some effect on peoples behavior. Would this possibly make people steal, cheat to get ahead? And surely every person even those of most devout faith have these qualities of \"being better\" and to \"protect\". Perhaps there should be some guidline of \"good human behavoir\" How is \"modern the \"evil of old\"? Enigma, \"modern evil\" is not at all different from the \"evil of old\". This is why all major religions in the world have analogues to the Judeo-Christian \"10 Commandments\" concept. There are your guidlines for \"good human behavior\". The choice you make as to if you are controlled by your desires and emotions or you control your response to those desires and emotions are what determines what kind of person you are. I call this acting like an adult. Many Christians describe it as the triumph of the spiritual man over the natural man. Other religions say the same thing using other words. You choose to whether or not you steal or hurt to get ahead. No one else makes this choice for you, no one else controls your actions.

I have personally viewed photographs, originals with accompanying negatives, taken at Auschwitz just after the liberating units arrived. One photo shows emaciated bodies of men and women stacked into a mass grave the size of a football field. The hole was about 3 or 4 meters deep and nearly full. How many bodies of starved people does it take to fill that hole? Another photo, from Birkenau, shows a mound of teeth containing dental gold which looks to be approximately 2 cubic meters. There are generally only two or three teeth in any single mouth with gold fillings, but even if whole mouths full of teeth were pulled from the bodies, how many people are needed to make that mound of teeth? I have talked with two people, parents of a good friend in the Navy, with the serial number tattoos. They speak of losing every single known relative (more than 100 people) at Auschwitz-Birkenau. This damnable conference in Tehran is being hosted by Ahmadinejad as simple Big Lie to lessen the people whom he has promised to \"erase from the face of the Earth\". Ahmadinejad knows that the Holocaust happened. Ahmadinejad is lying to further his own political aims and inflame fanatics.

The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action [2], and explicitly endorsed the IPCC consensus.\" I would be more than happy to support their position, but only if: - I can have access to their raw data, - Their analysis methodology, - The calculations they used to arrive at their position, and, - My check of their science leads me to the same conclusion. Otherwise, it is just another unsupported claim of doom & despair.

There was a time in the past when science and religion enjoyed a much closer relationship than they seem to today. In fact even the word 'scientist' wasn't even coined until the 19th century. Before that they were generally called 'philosophers' and they often mixed 'science' in with theology or religious belief. In 1831 the world's first science 'road show' was started. It called itself, 'The British Association for the Advancement of Science.' This was basically a group of wealthy Oxford dons. In those days science was not a paid professional career, so the gents had to have money and pay for their own research. Also at that time physics was called 'natural philosophy,' but they wished to dispense with that term. Christian astronomers, zoologists, chemists, geologists and botanists wished to unite under a more inclusive term. A certain don by the name of the Rev. William Whewell came up with the right word; he was the one who coined the term 'scientist.' So the word 'scientist' is a fairly modern invention, meaning, one who studies material nature. The thing about treating science and faith as diametric opposites is that to do so requires that you dictate methods to God. (OK, God, I'll accept that You created the universe, but only if you did it the way I think it needed to be done!) I am continually amazed at the colossal arrogance required to take such a position! | 429) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) S.F. loses Navy's warship ceremony SAN FRANCISCO \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac The Navy has rejected plans to commission its newest and most powerful warship in San Francisco because of concerns that the city doesn't support the military. Navy Secretary Donald Winter vetoed plans last week for a commissioning ceremony for the Makin Island in San Francisco, said retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. J. Michael Myatt. Instead, San Diego will host the ceremony. Navy leaders were concerned about San Francisco's refusal to offer a home port for the retired battleship Iowa, which would be turned into a museum, as well as the school board's decision to abolish junior ROTC training at city high schools, Myatt said.

So when Ninjadwarf talks about conservatives, he could be talking about some of our moderate Democrats. This makes him think that most of the USA main stream news sources are center or even conservative. Just my observations! Europe is more social-democratic than the USA, but also more right-wing. Socialistic doesn't fit really. So, IMHO what is called liberal in Germany (i.e. FDP) can be compared with the Democrats and what's called conservative (i.e. CDU/CSU) can be compared with the Republicans. Means, the Social-Democratic Party (SPD), and the parties further left are not \"covered\" by any influent party in the States (that's why I said that the left-winged have no influence) - but the further right-winged parties (like the German \"Republicans\" or NPD, which gained up to 15 percent in some counties) also have (fortunately) no influence there. And I know that there are some extremely right-wing organizations over there. So when I talk about conservatives I mean the Republicans or those Democrats who can be confused as Republicans due to their talking. I have not read or heard much about Mr. Murdoch,other than that he is the owner of Fox and made the decision to have the network cover both sides of the American political spectrum. This was a sound business decision that did not necessarily have anything to do with his political positions.

Is it reasonable to have a law that punishes people for acting in dire straits? Or to interpret a law as covering actions made in dire straits and for fear of one's own life? Let's suppose there was an automatic death penalty if those men were convicted of murder. (In fact, I think that was the case during 17th Century England. I'll have to check.) I can't let you support your position on the basis that, if convicted of murder, the sentences would be lenient. If you as a judge were giving instructions to that jury about the law of homicide, would you instruct them that killing another person while in dire straits, fearing reasonably for their own deaths unless they did so, nonetheless constituted murder, ie unjustifiable homicide? I think understand your point Beethoven. British soldiers were sentenced to death and were shot dead by firing squad for desertion in WW1, when over 300 of them were recently posthumously pardoned because it has been shown that they suffered from shell shock and were not in control of them selves when they ran away. They didn't kill anyone, but it just shows how difficult it is to apply the law - \"in some cases\". The law in our society is clear - if you willfully and unlawfully kill someone you are guilty of murder. If there are circumstance that might allow a judge to apply a less lenient sentence - then that is what judges are there for. To be specific, if the two of us are about to die, and I think you are more dead than me, and we are both dead in 20 minutes anyway. If I think by killing you and eating you I can live - ie, instead of both of us dieing, at least I can live. Would I be guilty of murder if I killed you in my 'dire' circumstance? My answer is Yes. If the answer is No, then I woke up in the wrong world. Beam me up Scotty. There is not only the question of murder in the lifeboat question. Cannibalism is also on the table. My personal feeling is that not only is the murder morally wrong, the eating of the one murdered is at least as morally repugnant, if not more so. That the people who performed the acts were in dire straits does not in any way excuse their actions. Once again, you have a reason for the act, not an excuse for the act. Now, if the cabin boy was irrational and threatening to capsize the lifeboat, killing the cabin boy could be excused on the grounds that the safety of the other passengers was directly threatened. But even under the most stringent of circumstances, to partake of human flesh is to give up one's claim to humanity. I am sure that the legal precedent is against me on this, and I do not think that the death penalty proper for those who did not kill but did eat. | 451) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 27 Nov 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: My Niece, ready for her end of school leavers dinner.

Suppose they had all agreed and drawn straws, with the short straw to be killed? Does your objection still hold, in those circumstances? Is it really your position that all should die, instead of only one? There is no justification for murder. As human beings we cannot condone it under any circumstances. If we die, we die as non-barbaric law abiding human beings. In this case a rescue ship turned up 4 days after the murder. They would all have probably survived. If the ship didn't turn up, then they would have met their makers with knowledge that they acted as rational law-abiding human beings. Once you agree to compromise and make crime legitimate, then you may as well give up all government and law and do as you anarchically please or can get away with. In this case their brains were scrambled and they were not necessarily rational. They committed a crime but a judge can always look at the extenuating circumstances, on the basis that they are guilty of murder. I think you answered your own dilemna though, their brains were scrambled and they wanted what in the end we all want, to live. In their scrambled brains they thought of it as a justified way for the rest to live. For us to sit here in our comfy chairs and make rational decisons based upon their scambled brains thought, is not going to solve anything. We can agree that had their brains not been scrambled it was not a good idea and was probably murder. Had the person already been dead it would be another matter entirely. To eat another human being for dinner is a disguting thought, to me. But I have read and heard of stories where people have done it to survive. If I had been in their situation would I eat someone else to survive, probably.

The puzzle is that a heck of a lot of CO2 got locked up in rocks, oil, shell deposits etc over a vast amount of time. But now most of it is being released in the atmosphere suddenly (since the start of the Industrial Revolution to today - a very short moment in Earth's history). When I look at the raw data I can find, it seems to show that all but a minute fraction of the temperature rise over the last century, measurable but insignificant, can be attributed to a parallel increase in solar output. Considering that one good volcanic eruption can release as much CO2 and other greenhouse gasses as the US, China, India and Mexico do in a year, I have to go with the people that conclude that an increase in the primary power source for climate, solar energy, is the major cause of global warming. As I have said many times before, I also find it telling that the most vocal proponents of Global Warming do not release their raw data and analysis methodology. Let's wait for the report that the AP headlined with \"Scientist Promises Strong Evidence for Global Warming in Report\" and just see if you can get the raw data and analysis methodology from the authors of the report.

Yeah, I come in here every once in a while (I am the originator of this thread, after all). As I understand the complaint here, the lawyer had an admission from his client that he committed murder, and the lawyer did nothing to defend his client after that admission. If there was no viable course of action that the lawyer could take within the bounds of ethics (lawyers cannot perpetrate a fraud on the court, for example), then the lawyer did nothing wrong in just sitting by his client during the proceedings to make sure that the trial was conducted properly. So, even though it looked like the lawyer was doing nothing, he was still there to supply his client with the protection afforded all criminal defendants by the Constitution. If, after informing his client that in his professional opinion the client had no viable defenses, the client should then have been given the option to allow the attorney to withdraw and a court would determine if withdrawal of the attorney would be appropriate. All of this is a long way of saying that the mere fact that an attorney doesn't appear to be doing anything does not necessarily mean the attorney is doing anything wrong. Tom, the lawyer had an admission from his client that he committed premeditated murder, and the lawyer still did everything in his power to get his client off. All good and legal, and I understand that he violated the attorney-client relationship to tell me what he did. My beef with him is that, after hearing an admission of guilt from his client he still worked to get him off the hook. Most lawyers, I believe, would not have done that. I think that most lawyers would have done as you suggested.

Here's another suprise: I don't 'think' anyhthing as being right. I look at the evidence and draw logical conclusions. There's no 'belief' in it. I guesstimate that Sarge put a link to that article about SETI being a religion (HA!) to raise his own credibility. But I do have one question for anyone who 'believes' in a 'god' : where is your evidence? One other question: which believer would like to answer what Dr. Sagan had to say in that below quote from \"The Edge of Forever\"? Chuck, what part of the several definitions of \"faith\" are you having trouble with? Please consider, the word has definitions which describe both religious belief systems and science based belief systems with equal accuracy. You have faith that your interpretation of information you have is correct. I have faith thay my belief in God and Jesus Christ is correct. Considering the tone and tenor of your postings, I dare say that at the end of the day my faith has richer rewards. To put it baldly, you seem bitter, angry and desperately unhappy. What a shame, when you need not feel that way with such regularity. I am not. Most religious people are not. We have a better quality of life than the bitter, angry, unhappy people in the world. | 508) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Death penalty for Saddam 453905](forum_thread.php?id=35250&postid=453905)) Posted 9 Nov 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Saddam Hussein has urged Iraqis to seek reconciliation, two days after being sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity. \"I call on all Iraqis, Arabs and Kurds, to forgive, reconcile and shake hands,\" the former president told the court in a separate trial for genocide.

I mean it's not one of the most hated countries in the world for no reason you know. (No offence to the US citizens..I'm sure you are all lovely as individuals) In the first place, Esme, the US didn't cause terrorism. As you well know, the US (among several other regions in the world) was an Islamofascist terrorism target for more than 20 years, most of that time without an aggressive foreign policy. The war on terror was initiated only after the World Trade Center was destroyed in the second attack on the complex. The funny thing about that \"most hated country\" thing is that the US is quite popular in Iraq except, of course, for the Ba'thists. I am told that when the death penalty was handed down for Saddam the worst problem you had was getting past the people dancing in the streets, celebrating in relief that soon they will not have to worry about him getting to power again. Now, almost all of the terrorism in Iraq is perpetrated by non-Iraqi murderers. These murderers are being caught these days by Iraqi police, with backup from the US only at need. Iraq has been a lightning rod for these murderers and thugs, thus making other regions (including the US, which is the main point from the US perspective) safer. It is this whole \"makes the US safer\" thing which leads many of us to care not a whit what others think of the US. Esme, my personal perspective of the war on terror is that my 5 year old daughter does not have to fear Achmed blowing a bomb up in her school. This is because a US soldier has killed Achmed in Iraq, where he was helping to protect the Iraqi citizenry as they began the march to democracy. | 515) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Nov 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Great minds discuss ideas.

In other words, in 20 years time some countries will be much better off because 'the west' has paid for it.

Once again, we have a Global Warming pundit making pronouncements without, in this case, even a pretense of basing the conclusions of the report on Climate Reasearch. This is understandable in that actually citing the research which supports the base assumptions of the report would embroil Sir Nicholas in the need to provide the research data and methods for peer review. There is a direct correlation between the nature of the conclusions of such research and the availability of data and methods for review such that, the more catastrophic the conclusions of a Global Warming proponent's research, the more resistance to calls for making raw data and analysis methods available.

How convenient that 'God' has taken a form that mirrors ourselves. Or rather, that we mirror his. But it allows us, with our limited minds, to try to grasp and believe in the concept of something that we otherwise could not comprehend. I have come to believe that this power is 'out there' in whatever form it exists, and has power and control over all that exists, including the insignificant bits of matter that constitute ourselves. The true hope is that when we leave this life, we may become part of that greater power, and I think that all of science strives to find the answers to the mystery of that power. For the sake of this point, please assume that God does exist. Given that, the fact that humans comprehend God as being similar to themselves is not far fetched.

Science means there has to be proof of something. Without proof, you can't have a definitive answer. If you don't have a definitive answer, and can NEVER get your definitive answer, how can you call it science? You can't. So you call it faith, because it rests solely on your conviction that it is true. So you do understand! You just want to proselytize to us and convert us to your religion. I understand now, but no thank you Chuck, I am comfortable with my faith and although I can agree with many of the facts you share, I do not agree with your conclusions. Have a good day though. Science is not a religion Bill, for the simple reason that a scientist bases his/her ideas on evidence, reason and logic. They do not stick with a ridiculous idea once it has been shown to be incorrect. There is no faith involved. Religious people come up with ideas and explanations based on little more than wishful thinking and superstitious constructs based on coincidence (see the idea of the Parking Space God). You are trying to compare chalk and cheese just to make yourself feel better. Es, I maintain that science is a de facto religion for some people because those people replace the God or Gods of their ancestors with a particular Scientist or pantheon of Scientists as their authority and the final arbiter of their world. For these people, anyone questioning their Scientist god's word, in however reasonable or reasoned an argument is blaspheming and said blasphemer is attacked. And the attacke are just as vicious, hate filled and unreasoning as any from the good old days of Torquemada, Cotton Mather or todays Islamofascist groups. As evidence in the US, I give you the emotion charged arguments surrounding the fetal stem cell issue. Despite the fact that there is not a shred of useful results from fetal stem cell research in more than two decades, a few scientists and (worse yet) political pundits have claimed that fetal stem cell research promises results tomorrow if only you award me the next grant (elect my political candidate). These pronouncements are believed with the same faith and fervor as any formal religious dogma and with less reason. As an aside, adult stem cell reasearch has produced useful results, with dozens of treatments in use today. Back to the point. There are those who profess to believe that science is the be all and and end all for any problem, condition or issue in this world. Chuck comes to mind. These people continually, and in many cases knowingly, ignore the fact that, for most fields, the science of today is the superstitious cant of tomorrow. Most people do not have the time or the knowledge base to judge if one scientist or another of diametrically opposed opinion about any given subject is correct. They then do exactly what any self respecting religious person does and decide upon whose opinion they will place their faith. As an illustration of this point, todays understanding of the workings of the human brain is severely limited. But there have been enough pundits prouncing that they can cure almost any condition that the term \"pop psychology\" was coined to describe the endless flow. From Papa Freud to Timothy Leary, they have promised that they can cure or enhace or illuminate your understanding. And many have achieved results in greater or lesser measure, but they have achieved their results by trial and error. Yes, even Freud. Researchers all over the world are making discoveries almost daily that expand the body of knowledge and even invalidate long held theories about brain function, memory storage, endocrine activity and any number of other subjects dealing with the brain. I have even watched a television show in which a well respected scientist was apparently able to briefly induce savant-like abilities in normal subjects. At one time, cocaine was hailed as one of the most beneficial drugs ever discovered. Thalidomide was thought to be a safe sedative for pregnant women. Western doctors viewed accupuncture as superstitious hornswaggle and low carbohydrate diets were viewed as almost certain death. Those making the pronouncements on these subjects sometimes availed themselves of the scientific method, as they understood it; other times, as in the low carbohydrate diet pronouncements from the AMA, they didn't. Their pronouncements were believed with the same faith as any religious pronouncement ex cathedra or otherwise. And their positions were protected with faith, passion and perseverence. Just like any other religions' scripture. | 535) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [.

Military service, especially the US Navy, is another option where you can get trade or technical schooling and receive post service benefits for college.

Help with those skills is available, and jobs are available, especially if you are willing to go where the work is. Don't limit yourself by insisting on remaining in the old familiar area. Unemployment benefits do not and were never intended to replace your wages for longer that a short period. I have heard that the average is about one week per $10K of gross wages desired (assuming a skill set that is equal to the desired wages). My own experience agrees with that rule of thumb. So 6 months (26 weeks) is more than generous and using up those 6 months implies a certain lack of application in searching for employment.

And Jeffery, please do not, ever, mistake forbearance for weakness or tolerance for acceptance. The vast majority of Americans will forbear to respond to un-American or even near treasonous utterances (and even actions), but do not mistake this for an inability to respond more strongly. The lack of response is firmly rooted in a conviction that personal freedom is sacred. Similarly, in the US the vast majority of people tolerate differences of opinion in religion, political outlook, etc. This is one of the core American behaviors and is codified in our Constitution. That tolerance does not, however, indicate that this vast majority in any way agrees with you, your opinions or your desires. My son now serves in the United States Army because he believes that it is his responsibility to join in the protection of the United States as a means of earning the rights and privileges that a US citizen receives.

Money can, does and must get added to (and deleted from) the total money supply on an ongoing basis. Inflation only occurs when the total value of the currency in circulation does not match the total productivity of the economy. When worker productivity rises (please note that the US has the most productive workforce in the world) the money supply is expanded to prevent deflation and, of course, the reverse condition applies. The current view is that a small amount of inflation is healthy, but I am not sure I buy that. | 615) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [North Korea Says Nuclear Test [Message 434068](forum_thread.php?id=34351&postid=434068)) Posted 10 Oct 2006 by South Korea reports a 3.58 magnitue quake regisitering.

NO Washing / Cookin' - NOTHING will cleanse the Spinach of the E. Coli(.) Thank You (Respectfully Submitted) . . . rwljr From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The following is advice for consumers about this outbreak: - Currently, the FDA has advised to not eat any fresh spinach or salad blends containing fresh spinach that are consumed raw. - E. coli O157:H7 in spinach can be killed by cooking at 160 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. (Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.) If spinach is cooked in a frying pan, and all parts do not reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit, all bacteria may not be killed. If consumers choose to cook the spinach, they should avoid cross-contamination of the fresh spinach with other foods and food contact surfaces, and wash hands, utensils, and surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling the spinach. - Persons who develop diarrhea after consuming fresh spinach or salad blends containing fresh spinach are urged to contact their health care provider and ask that their stool specimen be tested for E. coli O157. - Persons who ate fresh spinach or salad blends and feel well do not need to see a health-care provider.

Acceleration and gravity are similar inside a closed frame. Feeling this pull to the right you would normally shoot to the left of the driver to account for the pull to the right of the fake gravity (acceleration).

I don't really have a faith. Yet my inablity to perceive a God might be more to do with my own limited perception and understanding. I have heard of mystics who spent many years in contemplative prayer in order to discipline the mind. These practitioners have reported remarkable experiences. They often say they can experience another level of god-centred reality which appears to be just as real to them as perhaps my experience of colour is to me. I believe St John of the Cross was one such mystic? This seems to me that IF there is a God of some sort, he can only be experienced, not defined by language or proved by orthodox science. Just because I cannot define a colour or a scent - or my subjective thoughts and experiences, doesn't mean they are not there. Logic seems to dictate that they are. I will continue to keep an open mind on the subject because it is so interesting to me. I will probably need to do a bit more reading on it as well, but whatever God is, it/he might exist where we can't find him/it. Regards, Susan. Susan: I do not and will not attempt to prove the existance of God. As I understand it, the human brain is wired to experience the mystic experiences you spoke about, but it is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. Monks of various flavors (Buddhist, Vaishnava and others) train their minds for years to get to the point where they can enter the altered state at will. The difficulty of this training is the primary reason that many of these orders of monks train their bodies in martial arts. Extended periods of meditation require a strong, healthy body to sustain. On the western side of the world, prayer & privation used to be the most common method of achieving the same end. Robert: If you can grant that the human brain appears to be wired to enjoy (or not)the mystical experience, I posit that the trait enhances the chance of survival on the personal level. Otherwise the trait would not be so common. | 648) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 9 Sep 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: So time must be \"flying\" in the vast weightlessness of space.

How does this comment relate to Hezballah and Lebanese civilian deaths in a combat zone? Of course not. Neither of us operate like the Hezballah cowards do. This comment is off point and meaningless. Oh sorry you didn't understand that I was referring to yet another episode of friendly fire. Much like the one that has just happened. Guess who bombed who?! Go on - guess!

I waste no sympathy for idiots that violate their own standing orders. Then you deserve no sympathy at all yourself. Your attitude is the same as 'they deserved to die'. You should be shot by your own side for being in area you were ordered into anyway then. I hope that friendly fire you were in wounded you greviously. You deserve it for being in the wrong area at the wrong time. Not the same as as 'they deserved to die' at all. This was not a \"fog of war\" situation. The UN observers chose to remain in a hotly contested battle zone in direct defiance of their standing orders. They died because their field commander was stupid. It is elitist to turn around and even ask the question in which service did you serve your country when you are trying to make a case about the realities of combat. Don't bullshit the people in here - your question has nothing to do with serving a country you or I was born in - it has to do with your trying to gain superiority in claiming your military service vs my never serving in the military making your argument the stronger one. Erroneous thinking. The question was an aside. I was establishing some of the antecedents of your point of view. Here is where a working knowledge of militart tactical doctrine would come in handy, Chuck. The IDF did not ignore the UN observation team. Really? So over a dozen calls requesting that the bombing NOT wipe out people on your own side, were, what? Taken under consideration then?? What did they do, flip a coin and say \"shit - guess we keep bombing, even though we don't want to!\" BULLSHIT. The calls were ignored and four men were MURDERED. You go on to say 'tough titty' for them, then you should be ordered into a trench and have your own bombs dropped on you. You deserve it far more than those four UN men. Although I was not listening in, I am certain that the calls were considered and requests rejected due to the nature of the situation. I am also certain that the calls were not one sided and that the UN observers were warned of their imminent peril. Once again, the UN observers died because their field commander was stupid. I do not say 'tough titty' for the subordinates, I pity them. And I do not accept the UN observers as being \"on their own side\". The very nature of their mission placed them ostentatiously not on anyone's side.

BULLSHIT. A critical question is directable at any thing at any time. That's science. NOT 'chucky's particular view of the world'. You must have no clue what science really is about. For religios people to be critical in their questions, they have to direct critical questions anywhere - even at their own religion, and ESPECIALLY at the tenents that uphold it. Science does exactly that - because that is the definition of science: does the hypothesis hold up to critical questioning. Bill Hyland, you have demonstrated an utter lack of understanding what a critical question is. Susan, you might want to go over that, too, because 'faith' belies a 'sacred truth'. Right? A belief that something is true. Science has NOTHING TO DO AT ALL WITH BELIEF. NOTHING. NOTHING. get it? Science is concerned with the opposite of faith - PROOF. When we see people asserting and insisting that faith is a part of science, it is an indication that those people are trying to subvert the 'respect' science has in being far more correct than any other system at interpreting reality. How else could religion stnad? A great way to protect it is claim that it has a shared validity with science. Faith is NOT part of science. Don't let people like Susan or Troy fool you into erroneous thinking. You are partly right here, Chuck. Faith is NOT part of science. Faith IS part of motivation. Those without motivation are, for the most part, the \"worker bees\" of the world, whether it be in science or in any other endeavor. You should be familiar with many cases where people without vast resources, vast intellect or the favor of social position achieve wealth, produce inventions or rise high in positions of responsibility. These people USE money, USE science and USE learned leadership skills. Science is NOT and end unto itself. Science is a tool that you use to understand the universe you live in.

Another instance of faith in science is the belief that any problem can be solved with the proper application of technology. For many problems, this seems not to be true, but those who have that faith continue to surprise the world with new inventions, new applications for old technology and even whole new technologies.

The Hezballah cowards were, as is their specialty, hiding behind and around the UN observation team (which, do not forget, should have bugged out hours previously). The IDF fire mission was to suppress the Hezballah firing in the area and, unfortunately, not all munitions used in modern combat are precision munitions. And just exactly how does this current conflict go back to \"the simple principle of land grab and resource control\"? The Hezballah chief coward has already publicly stated that if Hezballah thought that Israel would fight to recover kidnapped citizens Hezballah would not have attacked Israel.

Radar is \"line-of-sight\" only. Even the most sensitive radar cannot detect something over the horizon. Ever. So the system is, quite clearly, not intended to detect launch events. A satelite system is in place to do that. This system is intended to be an early aquisition and terminal guidance asset. In other words, it will detect the expected object as it comes over the horizon and direct anti-missile missiles such as the Patriot to the incomming object.

I do not agree with the premise the IDF \"conceded that they lost the Battle against Hizbollah\". To quote an open letter from Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz (of the IDF) to the IDF, \"Alongside the achievements, the fighting uncovered shortcomings in various areas \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac logistical, operational and command. We are committed to a thorough, honest, rapid and complete investigation of all the shortcomings and successes.\" The IDF, in the north, was certainly ill-prepared. From the intel I have seen, it looks like the infrastructure broke down in the north, leading to compromised armories, supply dumps and mobilization plans. My impression is that Hezballah enjoyed initial success because the current Israeli government didn't believe that they were going to fight a proxy battle against Iran. Consider two statements by the Hezballah chief thug; that Hezballah would never have started the conflict if they had believed that Israel would be willing to fight and that Hezballah had expended roughly half of their supply of missiles (note that over 4000 missiles were fired at civilian targets in northern Israel). This makes me wonder just what was planned for the 8 to 10 thousand missiles they had. Especially in light of the fact that when Israel closed down the ports, they cut off additional munitions deliveries which had left Iran long before this pocket conflict began. | 685) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Middle East is in Crisis Again #2](forum_thread.php?id=33101) ( 26 Aug 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Bodley wasn't asserting that Israelis be humble as a sneaky way to gain the upper hand over their enemies.

Someone in another city perhaps? For the government of a nation, morality includes protecting your citizens from enemies, as the US Constitution says, \"..foreign and domestic.\" That the people they are protecting their citizens from hide behind noncombatants cannot be a concern of the Israeli government, or their military commanders, while those enemies are in the act of raining munitions upon their country.

Despite the decisions of recent (within the last 40 years) activist Justices, the first clause only prevents the establishment of a state religion, such as the Church of England. The second part of that clause prevents Congress from passing laws restricting free exercise of religion by citizens. You will find reference to the discussions regarding this clause in [Eliot's Debates](http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(ed0044)):). The discussion on page 194, I think, best describes the attitude and intent of those who framed the Constitution: But it is objected that the people of America may, perhaps, choose representatives who have no religion at all, and that pagans and Mahometans may be admitted into offices. But how is it possible to exclude any set of men, without taking away that principle of religious freedom which we ourselves so warmly contend for? This is the foundation on which persecution has been raised in every part of the world. The people in power were always right, and every body else wrong. If you admit the least difference, the door to persecution is opened. Nor would it answer the purpose, for the worst part of the excluded sects would comply with the test, and the best men only be kept out of our counsels. But it is never to be supposed that the people of America will trust their dearest rights to persons who have no religion at all, or a religion materially different from their own. As you can see, the original framers and delegates who approved of the final version of the Constitution would not only disagree with the assumption that the Constitution precludes a free exercise of religion, even on federal land, they would be disgusted by the attitudes of those who subscribe to such a concept. | 687) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Middle East is in Crisis Again #2](forum_thread.php?id=33101) ( [Message 405497](forum_thread.php?id=33101&postid=405497)) Posted 25 Aug 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Sure there are loads of arabs who want to destroy Israel.

How do you know what angle your elbow is opened at, with such a high accuracy, between a small range such as 175 and 190? I don't see how that could be measured. And is it being opened sideways, is the shoulder joint involved, and does the elbow actually flex backwards on itself if the arm is extended outward and forward, with the palm facing up? I know at least one or two women who can't do that. And when they say that women's shoulder's are smaller, do you mean shoulder length, as in the distance between the beginning of one shoulder and the end of the other? I always thought there wasn't that big a difference in that area, because my shoulder length is about 16 inches, and most girls I talk to have a similar length (slightly larger if they're taller, or slightly smaller if they're shorter). Of course, you might be talking about the how large across the shoulder bone is. Mine is about three inches across, but I don't know about women's. I used a setup much like that used to measure range of motion for people suffering from arthritis or injury. I opened up a large cardboard box, drew a quarter circle arc on the box and used a protractor, compass, string and marker to mark degrees of angle on the arc. I then rested my upper arm on a board so that my upper arm was parallel to the ground and tacked the carboard to the garage wall so that the bottom of the arc was parallel with mt upper arm. After that I moved only my elbow to open my elbow joint as far as it would go. My wife put a mark directly under the center of my wrist and we measured the angle, then we did the same thing with her arm. I realize that this was not a proper scientific experiment (which is why I called it 'apocryphal'), but it was fun. One thing to note is that when the arc has a raduis of half a meter, 15\u00c3\u00c2\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0 of arc is very easy to distinguish. | 700) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Link to \"Families\" by Neil Young](http://streamos.wbr.com/wmedia/wbr/neilyoung/families4.3.wvx) What he has done, in another departure from \"past President's practices\" is to express his sympathy to many grieving families personally.

That's just it. The objective was to locate the rocket launchers and destroy them before they could move away. There was no time for a discussion of what was nearby which also might be destroyed. Which happened to be civilians as well as homes, day after day. Which is not exactly acceptable from any civilized point of view. This would be why hiding military hardware in civilian residential areas is a war crime. Consider that Israel's military has one, and only one, basic mandate or duty. This paramounmt duty is to protect Israel and her citizens from foreign attack. When rockets or other munitions are fired at Israeli citizens, the only immediate method of making sure that rockets or other munitions are not fired from the same point, by the same people again, is to destroy the material and people involved in the act. When people are depending on you to protect them, you do not have the leisure to ask your enemy politely to move to the parking lot, where they can be removed (killed, put down, what have you) with sugrical precision. The cowards hiding next to and in residences, hospitals, schools, etc., are attempting to mitigate the military response to their acts by doing so.

Remember the real war on terror that the Bush administration and its allies decided not to fight, preferring to opt for cowboy-style military adventures. The Bush administration start the fight using both the 'cowboy-style military adventure' and the non-military, domestic program. The military operations are intended to both remove the major supporters and trainers of terrorist organizations and to provide a focus for such organizations to concentrate upon. The non-military domestic programs are intended to discover, monitor and physically locate terrorist operations within the country. Domestically, various means to develop this information are being used. The really interesting thing about this is that whenever the major media outlets (captained by the New York Times) have discovered a tool used by the non-military fighters, those major media outlets have immediately trumpeted the information to the world. This, of course, hamstrings the tool and makes the job harder. Managers of the major media outlets seem to believe that the 'war on terror' is a game, with points scored for tripping up the opposition. For almost all of the major media outlets the opposition is the Bush administration. I can only hope that it doesn't take pieces of large commercial aircraft raining down on their heads to get the media to realize that the true opposition are the terrorists.

That's because the astronomers will debate the status of Pluto, the large icy rock with the wildly out-of-kilter orbit that was dubiously declared to be the ninth planet in 1930. The matter is of no small interest locally, because the debate over Pluto's status is linked to last year's discovery at the Palomar Observatory of another large icy rock, nicknamed Xena, that certainly would qualify as the 10th planet based on the standards used to evaluate Pluto. The problem, it turns out, is that so would 13 more \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"transneptunian\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 icy rocks. Those with parochial pride in Palomar suggest the 13 others could be ignored based on an arbitrary size cutoff, giving Xena planetary status and making the observatory a crucial historical footnote. But scientific classifications should be logical and coherent, not an exercise in boosterism. So the question for astronomers boils down to this: Use a narrow definition and go back to the pre-1930 view that the solar system has eight planets, or relax standards and decree there are 23. While the latter may appeal to Michael Jordan and his legions of fans (non-sports fans: Jordan famously wore No. 23), our view is it would be a tremendous hardship for fourth-graders assigned to learn the names of 23 planets. This rationale may not be substantive, but it has (some) logic and coherence to it. So here's for tough standards and Pluto's retreat from the solar system stage. Eight is enough. Can't a case be made for Pluto to be a planet based on its gravitational effect on Uranus and Neptune? After all, the other \"transneptunian\" icy rocks do not affect the other planets in any meaningful way. | 722) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 5 Aug 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: The summer of 1930 also marked the beginning of the longest drought of the 20th century.

It'd take a lot of .50 cal rounds to put a Hog down, but it would take many rounds from that super cannon the A-10 has. Another thing about the Warthog is that in a ground support role it has a lot more time to just hang around and wait for some useful thing to do. The Harrier just uses fuel up faster. And I am not so sure, given two superb pilots, that the Harrier could get in enough punishment before that gigantic cannon the Warthog is built around spoke. I think it would simply depend on who had the benefit of surprise. This is scenario seems similar to the clashes between the Japanese Zero and the American P-48 that the AVGs (who became known as the Flying Tigers) flew. The Japanese plane could turn more quickly and go faster than the P-48, but was relatively lightly armoured. The P-48 could dive faster and take far more punishment.

I've met loads of these type of Christian, and so help me, I've even tried to teach some of them the big bang theory and the theory of evolution. There is nothing more frustrating than being confronted with several angry young people who tell you that fossils were put there by God to test you that there is no way that we're descended from monkeys and that you are going to burn in hell. ..and pretty much all them denounce both theories without actually knowing or wanting to know a thing about them. Speaking for myself, I am a believer who believes that much of the Bible is alegory and alliteration. A perfect example of that is the verse in Genesis 7:12, \"And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\" The phrase \"fourty days and fourty nights\" was a device used in the literature of the time which was understood to mean 'too many to count'. It doesn't mean that the rain was literally 40 days and nights. As for the descended from monkeys thing, I can only say that you have gigantic arrogance and hubris to dictate to God what methods may or may not be used to put us on this Earth.

To do so is hypocracy of the highest order Jeffery. Note that the 'war on terror' was not started and declared by the US. It happened, despite massive provocation, only after the terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center and attempted several other acts, killing thousands. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida believed that these acts would frighten and terrorize the US into allowing them free reign throughout the world. He and they were disastrously wrong. They and the people/nations/groups that supported & nurtured them made of themselves targets. Terrorists are a cancer on body of the Earth's population. They are being tracked down and killed not because of their political or religious convictions, not because of their location or race but because they attacked first. A long time ago, after the sucessful Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto said, \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\" The US found itself in a similar situation on September 12, 2001, and made a similar decision to ensure that such an event was not allowed to occur again.

I do not discount the possibility that mankind is causing some meaningful fraction of 'global warming', but I have not been given convincing evidence that this is the case. ... Well, the increased concentrations of CO2 and CH4 are very well recorded and documented and follow our industrial progress very closely. The really scary part is that Man is indeed not the only 'meaningful fraction' in the Global Warming story. There are examples of \"Tipping Points\" where catastrophic positive feedback mechanisms come into play and cause runaway rapid change. One such example is with the [Snowball Earth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/snowballearth.shtml) theory. Quoting from the respective peer reviewed scientific paper [\"The Snowball Earth\"](http://www.eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty/hoffman/snowball_paper.html): We receive ~343 watts per square meter of radiation from the Sun. Some of this is reflected back to space by clouds and by the Earth's surface, but approximately two thirds is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, increasing the average temperature. Earth's surface emits radiation at longer wavelengths (infrared), balancing the energy of the radiation that has been absorbed. If more of the solar radiation were reflected back to space, then less radiation would be absorbed at the surface and the Earth's temperature would decrease. The surface albedo is a measure of how much radiation is reflected; snow has a high albedo (~0.8), seawater has a low albedo (~0.1), and land surfaces have intermediate values that vary widely depending mainly on the types and distribution of vegetation. When snow falls on land or ice forms at sea, the increase in the albedo causes greater cooling, stabilizing the snow and ice. This is called ice-albedo feedback, and it is an important factor in the waxing (and waning) of ic e sheets. In short, for our example now, once a significant area of ice melts from the Earth's oceans and land, we get cooked very quickly. Note how the ice cover in the Arctic, Greenland, Antarctic and glaciers worldwide are retreating ever more quickly... My greatest worry is that the various politicians will make halting progress at a far slower pace than glacial speed... Regards, Martin Martin: The authors do not make any claims as to a 'runaway greenhouse event'. This paper (and the television special) dealt specifically with the Snowball Earth hypothesis. The authors made statements regarding greenhouse effects, such as, \"Climate scientists have long known that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays an important role in determining the Earth's temperature because it is a \"greenhouse\" gas, meaning that it absorbs infrared radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Over time scales of human lifetimes, the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be affected by biological processes such as photosynthesis or respiration, and by human activities such as the burning of tropical forests and fossil fuels.\" And this statement about the conditions required for ending a Snowball Earth episode, \"Given that solar luminosity 600-700 million years ago was about six percent lower than today due to stellar evolution, Ken Caldeira and Jim Kasting at The Pennsylvania State University estimated that roughly 0.12 bar of carbon dioxide (about 350 times the present concentration) would have been required to overcome the albedo of a snowball Earth.\" The information in the paper addresses the other side of the Snowball Earth coin only in that it mentions a wildly extreme set of conditions required to end the Snowball Earth condition. It is not valid to use this paper as an example of support for the 'Greenhouse Hell' earth scenario espoused by the Global Warming Movement. | 770) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: ...

Does this mean that we are all suspect? Judging by the illegal, warrantless wiretapping, and other equally suspect actions of our (U.S.) Government I guess we must be. Any government seeks its own perpetuation. One of the best means of doing this is by fostering fear and paranoia among its citizens. It is this method that served the Nazis so well, that led to pogroms, that turns us against each other. Beware your government, it cannot be trusted. There are two very important point about the NSA wiretapping program that must be kept in mind. The first is that we are at war. It is true and proper for any government to seek its own perpetuation as the best means to protect it's citizens. Your concerns are appropriate if the government is, in fact, acting as the Nazi government did. The US government is not doing so. As proof of this I point out the New York Times. The second is that for a phone call to be monitored it must be from or to suspected terrorist. All countries, in time of war, monitor communications to or from enemies or suspected allies. It is only common sense. This is done, for many of the same reasons, even when not at war. Reference the 'Carnivore' program establiashed and operated under the Clinton administration. These are reasonable actions used to protect the country from those intent on harm. If you are not calling or receiving calls from terrorists you have no reason for concern. These same points apply to monitoring the movement of money, as is in the current news. If you are not moving large sums of money around, into or out of the country, to and from terrorists, you have no reason for concern. | 772) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Well since you can't actually name one single freedom you've lost......

This question is not inane babble, but an attempt to articulate the struggle to comprehend the death of a loved one. Is a lack of emotion when thinking 'male-brand thinking'? I have witnessed attempts at totally dispassionate reasoning lead to conclusions at least as lacking in sense as any 'female-brand emotional thinking'. As to your question regarding God, this is a Religious Thread and simple courtesy would dictate that if you wish to attack someone's faith, you start an Anti-Religious Thread. And do not attempt to declare yourself to be agnostic or an atheist! An agnostic is skeptical about the existance of God, not antagonistic. And a true atheist has no belief in God, so the question of another's faith is of supreme indifference. Explain (to yourself) why you feel compelled to attack nobody's post and see if your reasoning would stand up to your own critical analysis.

I do not discount the possibility that mankind is causing some meaningful fraction of 'global warming', but I have not been given convincing evidence that this is the case.

There only one side of the story, that of the paranoid GOP-nuts was reported. These leftovers from gulf war 2, perhaps even with a \"Made in USA\" stamp on them, as the US worked close together with it's ally Saddam during gulf war 1 on this issues (and many european counties as well, before you start your non-american bashing again), were blown out of proportion to create (and maintain) the absurd picture of an Iraqi pre-gulf war 3 thread to anybody but the Iraqis. You need to know that the 'sarin' shells found (some older, some newer) were binary weapons. What this means is that two very stable precursor agents, in this case methylphosphonyl difluoride and a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl amine, were stored in separate compartments in the shell. This means that it's not the sarin shelf life but the shelf life of the presursor chemicals (basically forever) that has meaning. So, as I see it, here are the salient points related to the article: - Ms. Shrader either deliberately chose to ignore the binary weapon information or was ignorant of the facts - If she chose to ignore the facts about binary weapons, she lied by omission and the rest of her article should be discounted due to intellectual dishonesty - If she was ignorant of the facts about binary weapons, she was simply spouting off about something she should have, were she a real journalist, known. And the rest of her article should be discounted due to lack of proper research - These weapons were supposed to have been 100% destroyed more than a decade ago - These actually were the WMDs that the liberal establishment has spent some years trying to claim 'did not exist' - Finally, the United States does not sell or allow to have sold methylphosphonyl difluoride because the only use the chemical has is as a nerve agent presursor, which the US renounced and destroyed long ago. Other countries (especially France, Russia and Germany) have no such scruples.

Stastical methods are open to debate and requiring, at least, the inital pass at stastical analysis to be determined by the reviewer is valid. This is the most troubling problem with the Global Warming 'research' presented so far. Refusing to divulge raw data used for a stastical analysis is exactly the same as not giving a description of methods used for a physics experiment, thus preventing independent experimental verification (anyone remember cold fusion claims made several years ago?). | 793) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Monopolies can't exist without government force and pressure..

I would, however, like a reference to back up your claim that there is more forested areas today than in the past. After additional research I have found a document from the USDA Forest Service which contradicts the documents I based my earlier calim on. After checking the sources I think the estimating methodology for 1760 through 1840 is better than my previous data source. In [Trend Data](http://fia.fs.fed.us/slides/major-trends.pdf), the total forest area in the US and Alaska was 1.05 billion acres in 1760. This area dropped steadily until 1922, in rough lockstep with the progress of agricultural clearing in the East to about 730 million acres. After 1922, forest land area in the US has gone up slowly due to better forest management until is was at 749 million acres in 2000. This invalidates my claim in reference to total forest area since the founding of the US, but does support my claims in reference to forest management and that the US is not cutting down whole forests. Do you have the data excluding Alaska? New states should not bear on mainland USA statistics when adducing for data of over a century.... Check the web site for the source document.

I would, however, like a reference to back up your claim that there is more forested areas today than in the past. After additional research I have found a document from the USDA Forest Service which contradicts the documents I based my earlier calim on. After checking the sources I think the estimating methodology for 1760 through 1840 is better than my previous data source. In [Trend Data](http://fia.fs.fed.us/slides/major-trends.pdf), the total forest area in the US and Alaska was 1.05 billion acres in 1760. This area dropped steadily until 1922, in rough lockstep with the progress of agricultural clearing in the East to about 730 million acres. After 1922, forest land area in the US has gone up slowly due to better forest management until is was at 749 million acres in 2000. This invalidates my claim in reference to total forest area since the founding of the US, but does support my claims in reference to forest management and that the US is not cutting down whole forests. | 825) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 14 Jun 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: As a matter of fact when i read through these documents (UN resolutions etc) and provided clear cases of omission of support of claims of WMD's being found you all (the American contingent) politely ignored my posts.

They leave a quarter to a half mile or so of forest alone; the edges that line the highways - but if you walk into it a little distance, you find stumps and sawdust everywhere. Clear cut. For who? The States and Japan. The States are very wise - they buy up everybody else's natural resources, and harbour their own until the time they get very scarce. Actually not. \"The States\", or more properly, people in \"The States\" do buy natural resources which are offered for sale, but \"The States\" do not 'chop down whole forests'. If you are observing this in Canada, then the proper people to remonstrate with are your fellow Canadians. Next point: Before you sound off too loudly at home, go back and see if the company who cut down a section of forest didn't go back and re-plant the trees. What you saw is typically done in pine forest, which grows back quickly. Trees are known as a 'renewable resource' for this reason. If you ask nicely, you can get a map of the areas where this is allowed and of the areas where \"The Canadians\" have set aside forest areas to remain untouched. Get this from the Canadian government. In \"The States\" we call them 'Wilderness Areas'. Once again, in \"The States\" we have more forest lands today than there were when the \"The States\" began. This could not have happened if we went around cutting down, \"...whole forests...\". \"The States\" do not have teams of stealth loggers around the world cutting down other people's trees. \"The States\" do not threaten other nations and force them to cut down their trees. \"The States\" practice proper management of the renewable forest resource...and expect others to do the same.

That is, a block of aluminum is about impossible to get burning, even in pure oxygen. Have you ever tried cutting aluminum with an oxyacetylene torch like they do with iron? It is not successful. Aluminum forms a very tough layer of refractive oxide on its surface and that layer prevents the otherwise active metal from oxidizing further. The situation is different, if the aluminum is a fine powder. In that case, there is a very large surface area to be oxidized. If the grains are small enough, the oxide layer may never reach its protective thickness before all of the grain has been expended. Once the powder is this fine, it really burns easily and fiercely and ignites well. This can be demonstrated by throwing a spoonful of aluminum dust into a hot flame (such as oxypropane or oxyacetylene torch). There will be a tremendous flash and pulse of heat that is quite capable of burning one's fingers and face (just in case someone tries it). As for molten aluminum it is still very far from its ignition point. There is really no danger of getting its vapor cloud to ignite. How fast was the aircraft moving when it hit the building?

At this temperature, the water of hydration in the concrete is vaporized and consumed by the aluminum. This evolves hydrogen gas that burns. Aluminum burning in concrete produces a calcium oxide/silicate slag covered by a white aluminum oxide ash, all of which serve to insulate and contain the aluminum puddle. This keeps the metal hot and burning. Here's some ammo, go wild. And the thermal insulation had been removed previously. Which raises the question as to \"why?\" for the conspiracists Some have raised questions about the degree of fire protection available to guard the structural steel. According to press reports, the original asbestos cementitious fireproofing applied to the steel framework of the north tower and the lower 30 stories of the south were removed after the 1993 terrorist truck bombing. But for asbestos in 1986 (a) replacement of asbestos or of certain types of asbestos or products containing asbestos by other materials or products or the use of alternative technology, scientifically evaluated by the competent authority as harmless or less harmful, whenever this is possible; (b) total or partial prohibition of the use of asbestos or of certain types of asbestos or products containing asbestos in certain work processes. Various laws were past, so that might easily explain the removal of the abestos. Some laws were past essentially saying that if you had to work on it or demolish it, you had to remove it. After the initial damage, they may have been force to remove it. Or they decided to remove/replace for health/insurance reasons. It probably carried insuracne liabilities.

What the article failed to mention is that in households that are otherwise similar, those children with absent fathers who's fathers were absent due to death while in service to others (in other words soldiers, police, firemen, those who died attempting rescue, etc.) had statistics which were basically identical to children with living fathers. Fathers are more that just a means to a better economic position. Fathers, even poor fathers, even fathers that are dead, provide an example that goes very deep into the psyche of children.

It wasn't the entire load bearing structure that needed to be compromised to begin the collapse, only the relatively few attachment points where the floor slabs attached to the structure. These points were near the center of the area where the jet fuel was burning, where the hottest conditions were achieved. Sleestak also mentioned that, \"..casting iron itself becomes malleable at 800-950 C.\" What this means, given that Jet A burns at around 1000 C, is that the uneven loading caused by the 25% of external (and a significant number of beams in the central core, as well) load bearing beams which were destroyed in the initial impact caused these hinge points to start to deform. Given that there were many floors above both impact points, the thousands of tons of forced caused the attachment points to stretch like taffy when they achieved malleability.

True to a point. Have you ever heard of a super volcano? The entire Yellowstone basin, which is appx. 28x47 miles (43.45x77.25 kilometeres) is a single volcano. There are 7 known last I looked, 3 of which are in North America. One of the prevailing theories about the Permian-Triassic extinction is that the Siberian Traps caused it due to a series of eruptions over about a million years which ejected between 1 and 4 million cubic km. As to the Yellowstone super volcano, here is a quote from [http://www.solcomhouse.com/yellowstone.htm](http://www.solcomhouse.com/yellowstone.htm) \"Scientists have revealed that Yellowstone Park has been on a regular eruption cycle of 600,000 years. The last eruption was 640,000 years ago\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6so the next is overdue. The next eruption could be 2,500 times the size of the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. Volcanologists have been tracking the movement of magma under the park and have calculated that in parts of Yellowstone the ground has risen over seventy centimeters this century.\" Gasses from an eruption of that magnitude will cause climate change on a global scale. | 869) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Fractured | 870) |[Message Posted 6 Jun 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Well. Earth and Sol have variability in their natural course of 'life'. However, we humans are mixing things up for Earth by polluting its biosphere, changing the concentration of gasses in its atmosphere, and changing the coverage of plants on it. We humans do that. How could we expect there to be no change? The attitude of the planet being so huge that our operations couldn't possibly affect it is ludicrous. Anybody ever read 3001? Yes, we have done and are doing those things. I have not maintained that we could not possibly affect the planet, I have maintained that research has not established that we have had a meaningful effect on climate. The evidence looks good, but is not conclusive, that we (meaning all of humanity) have had a measurable but miniscule effect. But the research continues to be questionable in areas. A case in point are the studies of CO2 concentration in ice cores. They seem to show that years ago CO2 levels were about half what they are now. The cores were drilled, raised to the surface, removed to a lab and CO2 concentrations measured. Apparently good science. The problem is that CO2 and water have a highly active chemical life. The studies seem to assume that CO2 was trapped in ice and lay dormant until the cores were drilled, ignoring the fact that water is present and moves through ice in glaciers and ice caps, even (or especially) very deep in the ice. Also, no effort was recorded that attempts were made to either keep the cores at 'in situ' conditions of pressure and temperature or even to seal the cores to prevent outgassing when they were raised to the surface. As I see it, because pressures, temperatures and impurities in the ice affect the measured CO2 levels so significantly, these oversights bring the results into question. | 871) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) (Unrelated comment) . . .

An observation: I arrived at work around 8:30 and heard about the first plane immediately. I settled in, and then went into the meeting room where a bunch of people were gathered around the TV watching Canada A.M., which had switched over to US coverage. The first thing that immediately struck me as the one tower that had been struck was burning, was that there was no single military aircraft in the area. Not an F-15, not an Apache, not an A-10, not even a friggin Blackhawk! Nothing. It was unbelievable to me. Someone farts in the woods near the border, and a dozen rifles cock. Yet here was a building hit by a plane in NY, and even if it was an accident, it should have been swarming with military. Then the second plane hit, and the military was still conspicuous in its abscence. To this day it makes me go 'hhhmmmmmmm......' I had wondered the same thing at the same time until I realized that there were thousands of aircraft (commercial and personal) in the air at the time. I'm guessing they had to wait until the order to ground all flights took effect until they sorted out which ones remaining in the air were hostile (even IF the thought there was more than one occurred). It didn't take long for the other aircraft to do their damage, so that delay did cost in terms of life, but a bad decision is better than none. Just my observations. And now for something completely different.....the Larch. The US military are restricted by law from interfering with domestic issues and, right up until the second plane hit the other tower, the impression was that the event was a terrible accident. Had the aircraft not been a US commercial aircraft you would have seen F-15 type craft giving chase. | 877) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : ...[/b](but buildings dont collapse from fire anway)[/b]...

Every paper I read seems to treat solar energy as a constant. This is possibly due to \"dumbing down\" the information for easy understanding by the unwashed masses. Currently, approximately 174,390,000,000,000,000.0 watts per second of energy hit the earth 24/7/365. That value varies short term over a 10 to 12 year cycle such that the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere changes +/- by approximately half a Watt per meter squared (W/m2), but wait, there's more. Over the last century, the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere has trended upward to the effect that the mean value has increased from about 1365 W/m2 to about 1367 W/m2 (I have also read papers estimating 1370 W/m2 to 1372 W/m2). Considering the surface area of the earth, this is an astounding increase in the climatic energy budget. This longer term variability is obviously of a sinusoidal nature, but we have absolutely no idea what the amplitude and period of the variations are. We simply do not have enough data. It seems to me to be reasonable to, at the least, admit the possibility that solar variability may have somewhat to do with the whole global warming issue. | 879) |[Message 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Different point here; It's wise to point out that the Government run plants of eastern europe and Soviet Union use entirely different designs than the plants used by private profit seeking firms in the US and elsewhere. They did this because of lack of funds! The wealthier nations' rich private sector can afford to build a type of plant that is extremely safe. I don't know the technical details but Soviet style plants don't use a gravity protected core like western countries use. In the west the core will drop due to gravity in order to prevent a Chernobyl. Chernobyl resulted from a total disregard of safety. From the corner cutting design, lacking many safety provisions already common at the time. Through the substandard construction (built out of tolerences, with low grade concrete, and even more it was often dry poured). In the best of circumstances, this would have been manageable, but there was not a culture of safety among those operating the plant either. More or less what happened is this. The reactor was being taken down for service. Somewhere at the plant level, it was decided that this was an ideal time to test the backup cooling systems. Now would be a good time to mention, this type of reactor becomes unstable below a certain threshold (several have this problem, but they have many provision in the design to account for it). The thing nearly went out, and in attempts to keep it going they pulled every control rod out. The reactor was still well under the threshold, steam built in the reactor. Now water is pretty good at absorbing neutrons, steam isn't. The reactor spiked, maybe as much as 1000x it's rated capacity. And we have the worst nuclear accident in the world. The Chernoble reactor was of an obsolete design called a \"graphite pile\" reactor that used a vast amount of graphite as the neutron moderator (modern commercial reactors use water for the same purpose). When the spike hit the area near the core of the reactor got so hot that the graphite ignited. The burning graphite caused much of the damage and subsequent release of the huge cloud of radioactive dust. | 880) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) Posted 1 Jun 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I think that the environment is warming, but the root causes are moot.

BODLEY, a meltdown, no matter how severe, cannot cause a nuclear explosion, but you can get a chemical explosion or a steam explosion. It is extrordinarily difficult to force the conditions that cause a nuclear explosion. And commercial reactor design is very safe. The Three Mile Island incident in the US is proof of that. TMI was the result of several years of improper (or none at all) maintenance and a chain of decisions that were exactly wrong. The reactor core lost coolant and the result was a very small release of radioactive gas. This is flat out amazing considering that the reactor core was trashed. Everything else was confined within the dome shaped building you see at just about every nuclear power facility called a containment vessel. | 884) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe UBHAL AS AIRDE a an co 'nar Ach an la is thig t-am 1 Jun 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: What's the last thing you hear a Jun 2006 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: I have to agree with Chuck.

Be careful, your answer will say more about you than you may wish to be revealed. | 905) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe \"little man\" slur is a bit juvenile. The \"nothing of importance\" comment is more than a bit self important. You are posting in Cafe SETI, not \"Nature\"! Please understand that very few people have any interest in knowing if you have or have not. You know what, little man, my \"serial posting\" has a legit reason. I get here after everyone has already been here. I reply to peoples posts as I read them. IF they happen to be consecutive, so-be-it. THAT is NOT serial posting. What I found here, in this thread, is serial posting in the true meaning, one right after another, after another, after another.... And all about nothing of importance.... I never said it was a bad thing, i was merely making comment that Ariane had posting many times consecutively and was wondering how many you had managed. Whether or not it was serial posting never crossed my mind. 12 times in a row, huh? I have NEVER posted 12 times in a row. It's now up to you to prove that I have. I proved you to be a true serial poster, prove I did 12 posts in a row. I explained why I have 3, 4, 5 posts in a row above. I will find your post and link it to you here, but that will have to be tonight after work. So, continue with you serial posting, little man.... /-:< Well after reading back through 1200 of your posts, which was enlightening but fruitless i threw in the towel, then I realised i didn't make the original statement that you had 12 posts in a row, i was refering to Ariane's posts. It was Tigher that said you'd hit twelve, but i didn't check. So my apologies if you haven't, i was quoting misinformation. [edit] Oh, what the hell. Your post was easy to find. here's the [link](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=26694#228998) I promised you. [/edit] There were no accusations in that post, merely wondering out loud. Sorry if you thought I was accusing you of Serial Posting, which you see as bad, I did not intend to. PS. Sorry about the reruns, When they disappeared i reposted them but now they're back. | 906) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [SETI@home Science](forum_forum.php?id=9) : artificial doppler shift?](forum_thread.php?id=26029) ( [Message 220972](forum_thread.php?id=26029&postid=220972)) Posted 24 Dec 2005 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: Yes, FM radio would be similar. What I am asking about would be a bit more drastic, making the source appear to move away from, then toward, the radio telescope rapidly (or not) inreal time. Very rapidly changing doppler shift values. | 907) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [SETI@home Science](forum_forum.php?id=9) artificial doppler shift?](forum_thread.php?id=26029) ( [Message 220793](forum_thread.php?id=26029&postid=220793)) Posted 24 Dec 2005 by [BillHyland](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=2412206) Post: This may be a foolish question, as the processing currently done on the data may cover this question. Oh well, it will not be the first I either looked foolish or ignorant! So, one of you with the third lobe hanging out of your brain tell me, can data be effectively encoded using doppler shift artificially applied to a signal and would this make the signal stand out from noise if you knew to look "}
