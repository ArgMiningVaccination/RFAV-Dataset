Through serving the educational needs of New Mexico's divers e population, NMSU has provided comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education and public service. Upon its founding, NMSU was known as Las Cruces College and later renamed New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In 1960, t he constitution of New Mexico formally recognized the institution as NMSU. Today, NMSU is a major institution of higher education.Throughout its history, the university has preserved many traditions of its land -grant origin while also increasing emphasis o n the fine arts, humanities, social and natural sciences. ACCREDITATION New Mexico State University has been accredited since 1926 by The Higher Learning Commission (HLC may be contacted at 230 North Lasalle Street, Suite 7 - 5000, Chic ago, IL 60604 and (800) 621 -7440.) The university was accredited in 1954 by the American Association of University Women. In addition, the Student Affairs and Enrollment Management division has two accredited departments, the Counseling Center is fully acc redited by the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS), and the Student Health Center is accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). Various academic departments and programs maintain specialized accredit ation by appropriate agencies. These are found at the beginning of each college section. THE GRADUATE SCHOOL A number of academic departments of the university have a long history of providing formal graduate study. The first ma ster's degree from NMSU was awarded in 1896. In 1921, the president of NMSU appointed a committee to oversee graduate study. The Graduate School was formally established in 1956 with a full -time dean, and in the same year, 57 master's degrees were awarded. The Graduate School mission is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the creation of knowledge, while fostering academic excellence. The Graduate School promotes a high -quality learning environment that embraces diversity. New Mexico State University is one of the few research extensive universities that reflect Hispanic, Native American, and other American cultures and the world. Our international students from Latin American, Asian, African and European countries add to the richness of our diversity. T he quality of life for our students is of critical importance to the Graduate School and NMSU. We cultivate the marriage of academic, professional and personal skills while helping students graduate in a timely manner. POLICIES Since gradu ate degrees are awarded for attainment in scholarship, the requirements stated in this catalog are to be considered as minimal. The major department or the dean of the graduate school may make additional requirements as deemed necessary for each candidate. Each student's program is subject to the approval of the respective department head. Responsibility for securing approval of the proposed program of study rests with the student. Frequent consultation with the advisor is essential to satisfactory progress toward degree completion. GRADUATE DEGREE PROG RAMS For a full listing of the Graduate Programs offered at New Mexico State University, please see the Graduate Admissions webpage http://gradadmissions.nmsu.edu/graduate -prog rams/. ADMISSION A student seeking admission to graduate school at New Mexico State University must hold a minimum of a bachelor's degree or an advanced degree from a regionally accredited institution. The program of preparation should be substantially equivalent in the distribution of academic subject matter to the requirements for a comparable degree at NMSU. No student is officially admitted into a graduate program until a Certificate of Admission has been issued by the Graduate School. Although the Graduate School considers this certificate valid for a one year period, academic departments may require re -application if the admitted applicant does not enroll in the semester noted in the certificate. Formal application is required of all prospective students, including graduates of NMSU, who seek admission to a graduate program. Students must submit: the Application for Admission as well as other supplemental documents required by the academic department. Supplemental documents may in clude, but are not limited to, unofficial college transcripts, test scores (TOEFL, IELTS, GRE, and GMAT), statement of purpose, writing samples, and letters of recommendation. If a student is recommended for admission by the academic department, the studen t will be required to submit official transcripts, test scores, and the appropriate application fee directly to the Graduate School. Other official documents may be required. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the prior colleges or university directly to the Graduate School. CATEGORIES OF GRADUA TE STUDENTS A student seeking admission to a graduate program is assigned one of the following categories based upon previous academic performance: Doctoral Studen t To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, an applicant must have a minimum grade -point average of 3.0. Some doctoral degree programs also require a master's degree or its equivalent. Master's Regular An applicant whose scholastic record is satisfactory will be admitted as a regular student. This classification includes: 1. an applicant whose grade -point average is greater than or equal to 3.0, or a grade -point average greater than or equal to 3 .0 in the last half of undergraduate work, 2. an international applicant whose grade -point average (or its equivalent) is greater than or equal to 3.0, 3. a continuing graduate student whose grade -point average is greater than or equal to 3.0, or 4. a stud ent with prior graduate work at another institution whose minimum grade -point average is 3.0. GENERAL INFORMATION | 5 Master's Provisional An applicant whose scholastic record is not satisfactory can be admitted as a provisional student. Students ad mitted with this classification can be either: A) transferring graduate students whose cumulative grade -point average is less than a 3.0 B) Students whose grade -point average the last half of undergraduate work is less than a 3.0, but who does have a minim um grade -point average of 2.5 A student admitted provisionally must complete his or her first three courses, a total of 9 credits of graduate work, with a minimum grade -point average of a 3.0. A provisional student who does not meet the 3.0 grade -point ave rage after at least 9 credits of graduate work is subject to dismissal. A student admitted on a provisional basis is prohibited from working as a teaching assistant. However, he or she may work as a research assistant or a grader for one semester. A provis ional student can be employed for one semester as a grader. To hire a provisional student, departments must submit an official letter to the Graduate School requesting permission. Master's Undeclared An applicant that has not de cided on a specific graduate degree program and has an undergraduate minimum grade -point average of 2.5 may be considered for admission as an undeclared master student. International students with an F -1 visa are not eligible for undeclared master status. Advising for an undeclared master student can be obtained from the Graduate School. Only undeclared regular status students who meet all Title IV eligibility requirements are eligible to receive federal financial aid for one consecutive 12 - month period b eginning the first term of enrollment. Questions about financial aid and undeclared master's should contact Financial Aid and Scholarship Services. An applicant admitted as an undeclared master is not eligible to receive a graduate teaching assistantship. Student Enrollment Restrictions Students in this standing are restricted to enrolling in 9 graduate credit hours. To continue enrollment the student must apply and be admitted into a degree -seeking program. Course restrictions placed by the graduate de partment may constrain enrollment by an undeclared student. An undeclared master student is restricted to transferring 9 graduate credit hours to a degree program. Transfers Transferring from an undeclared master's to a degree program requires a new Application for Admission. If the student has nine or more graded graduate credit hours, the cumulative minimum grade -point average (GPA) must be 3.0 for the request to be considered. If the student transferring to a degree program has fewer than nine gr aded graduate credits and the undergraduate GPA is between 2.5 to 2.9 the recommendation for admission will be provisional student status. If the undergraduate GPA is 3.0 or greater, the admission recommendation will be regular student status. ADMISSIO N TO A GRADUATE CERT IFICATE PROGRAM The graduate certificate program of study is designed to develop or enhance a focused area of expertise. The primary purpose of a graduate certificate program is to pro vide specific skill training to meet employment needs locally, regionally, nationally and globally. A graduate certificate is a focused collection of courses, consisting of 12 -18 credits, successfully completed by a student in a given discipline or a set o f related disciplines. A graduate certificate is not an official graduate degree of NMSU. A student that successfully completes a certificate program at the graduate level will receive a certificate of completion statement on his or her official transcript and a formal certificate from the Graduate School. A student has three years to complete a graduate certificate program. The graduate certificate program is offered to both currently enrolled, degree - seeking students and students who enroll solely to obta in a certificate. Currently enrolled degree -seeking students must apply separately to the graduate certificate program. Students wishing to enroll solely in the certificate program must still meet all admissions criteria. Successful completion of a certifi cate program does not guarantee admission into a graduate degree program. A student enrolled in a graduate certificate program cannot transfer credits from another institution towards the completion of the program. However, transfer credits taken in a grad uate certificate program may be applied towards a graduate degree program in the same area of focus. The number of transfer credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on transfer credits is 5 years after the completion of the certif icate. Students only enrolled in a graduate certificate program are not eligible for a graduate assistantship. Graduate Certificate Student A student enrolled in a certificate program is not automatically enrolled in a graduate degree seeking program at NMSU. The status will change if he or she applies and is accepted to a graduate degree program. A student enrolled in a graduate certificate program is not eligible for a graduate assistantship. APPLICATION DATES AN D DEAD LINES Contact the graduate degree program for published application deadlines. If the graduate program does not publish a deadline, the Graduate School encourages the applicant to apply by March 15th for fall enrollm ent and by October 15th for spring enrollment to be considered for financial support. The Graduate School will continue to accept applications 30 days prior to the first day of classes. TRANSCRIPTS An applicant is required to arrange to have one official transcript from each institution attended sent directly to the Graduate School. If the applicant's undergraduate coursework is not complete at the time of application, she or he must submit a transcript showing the completion this course work directly after the degree has been granted. No application materials will be returned to the applicant. STANDARDIZED TESTS Certain graduate programs may require standardized test scores for admission. An applicant may be required to take one or more of the following examinations as determined by the academic department: Graduate Record Examination, the Miller Analogies Test, the Graduate Management Admission Test. (See academic department description for required testing.) READMISSION An NMSU student who has been out of school for more than two consecutive terms is required to make formal application for readmission to the institution. The application will be reviewed by the academic department and the Graduate School. The application should be submitted at least 30 days prior to the start of the semester. A student who has attended other institutions during the absence is required to submit official transcripts to the Graduate School prior to the date o f registration and be eligible to return to the college or university last attended. Admission status will be determined by previous NMSU academic standing. Academic performance at other institutions attended during the applicant's absence from NMSU may be taken into consideration in determining the student's admission status. RENEWAL OF APPLICATI ON FOR ADMISSION The admission credentials for an applicant who does not register for the semester admitted are retain ed at the Graduate School for a period of one calendar year from the date of application. At the end of this period, credentials are discarded. A student wishing to renew his or her application after the one - year lapse must submit a new application. DENIED ADMISSION The Graduate School or the department may deny admission if the scholastic record or program of study is judged inadequate. If denied admission by a specific academic department, the applicant may be eligible to seek und eclared 6| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G status as described in Categories of Graduate Students. If denied by the department, the student may wish to contact the department for additional information. Admission may be denied to an otherwise qualified applicant when the desired program lac ks resources to accommodate additional enrollment. A student who is denied admission to one program and wishes to be considered for another program must complete a new application for the second program. Application documents are retained by the Graduate S chool for one calendar year. NON -DEGREE ADMISSION Non -degree admission is designed to meet the needs of an applicant who does not wish to pursue a degree or who has not yet completed the application process to a specific depart ment. Academic advising for non -degree students is obtained from the academic department. No more than 9 graduate credits earned in non -degree status may be transferred to a graduate degree program. NMSU only recognizes graduate credit for non -degree work from the University of New Mexico (UNM). Transfer credit is restricted to 6 credits with the approval of the appropriate department, the college dean, and the graduate dean. A student classified as non -degree is not eligible to receive financial aid, stude nt employment, or institutional tuition waivers; nor is he or she eligible to participate in student government or intercollegiate athletics; and is not eligible to receive benefits from veterans' programs. VISITING STUDENT A visit ing student is a student taking graduate credit to transfer to his or her parent institution. An Application for Admission to the Graduate School must be submitted 30 days prior to registration. The student is required to submit unofficial transcripts; how ever, the academic department must concur and admit a visiting student. Visiting students are not eligible for undeclared status or for graduate assistantships.

TOEFL 68 to 78 IBT, 520 to 549 PBT 6.0 IELTS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY International students that wish to become teaching assistants must demonstrate that they are proficient in the English language. This is done by participating in an International Teaching Assistant Screenings (ITAS). The purpose of the ITAS exercise is to determine whether candidates will be required to take COMM 485 International Teaching Assistant Development before being allowed to be assigned a teaching assistant position. The ITAS requires that a teaching assistant candidate deliver a short, ten minute teaching demonstration of a typical introductory undergraduate level course in a specific area relevant to the his or her area of studies. The demonstration is observed by CELP faculty and an actual undergraduate student. Based on the results of this exercise, a full report by the CELP observers will be presented to the head of the department in which the graduate student wishes to be a teaching assistant. COMM 485 not required COMM 485 recommended, but not required COMM 485 required Ultimate authority to enforce the recommendation lies with the Department Head. Preferably during Summer Session II, or before the start of the first semester of enrollment, all international students that wish to be considered for a teaching assistantship must take the ITAS, which is administered by the CELP. The ITAS can be waived for international students who hold a degree from an accredited univer sity in the United States, or a country where English is the official language of instruction. Departments also have the discretion to allow waivers for special circumstances.

Nominations from faculty should be sent to the Graduate School as soon as possible but no later than March 1st. GRADUATE ASSISTANTS SALARIES AND TAX WIT HHOLDING GUIDELINES Inter nal Revenue Service tax withholding guidelines require undergraduate and graduate students employed through New Mexico State University to maintain at least 6 credits of course work during the fall and spring semesters and 3 credits of course work for summ er sessions to be eligible for the student FICA tax exemption. Student employees who do not meet this requirement during any given pay period will be subject to Social Security taxes at the rate of 6.2% and Medicare taxes at the rate of 1.45%. Salaries for graduate assistants in 2015 -2016 are as Level I Applies to regularly enrolled students pursuing a master's degree. This level is also for a first year student seeking a doctoral degree who does not currently hold a master's degree. On the doctoral student becomes a second year student and passes their qualifying exam, they can obtain support as a Level II (G2) student. Level II (G2) - Applies to students (a) pursuing the education specialist or doctoral degree who have passed the qualifying exam or (b) who have a master's degree in the same or cognate field and the recommendation of the head of their major department. Level III (G3) - Applies to a doctoral student who has passed th e comprehensive examination and has advanced to candidacy. Graduate assistants employed at least ten hours per week will be given in -state tuition during the first 12 months of tenure if Human Resources approve the hiring process prior to census data (stat ed by the Registrar's Office as the third Friday of the semester each spring and fall semester). If New Mexico resident status has not been established by the time of any reappointment, the graduate assistant may be subject to non -resident tuition rates. Applications for state residency may be obtained in the Registrar's Office located in the Educational Services building. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMB ERS IN STUDENT RECOR DS As required by law, social security number s are collected from prospective and current students who 1) plan to seek employment on campus or 2) wish to receive financial aid. In addition, the university is mandated by federal tax regulations to provide tuition and fee payment information to the stu dent and the Internal Revenue Service, so that applicable educational tax credits may be computed. The social security number will be necessary to submit this tax reporting. The social security number is a confidential record and is maintained as such by t he university in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. In order to be employed by New Mexico State University all students must have obtained a social security number within eight weeks of being hired or risk losing their assistant ship. When an official social security number is issued to an international student, it is the student's responsibility to inform Human Resources or the Registrar's Office as soon as possible. HOURLY WORK Eligibility for student payroll requires that a graduate student (a) be admitted to the Graduate School as well as to a department, (b) have a GPA of 3.0, and (c) be enrolled for at least 9 graded credits. A student may not work more than 20 hours per week during the academic year. Stud ents looking for current job postings should check with Career Services, Garcia Annex, Room 204; or visit http://careerservices.nmsu.edu/. Students not classified as residents of New Mexico but working at an hourly rate are not eligible to receive in -state tuition.

FINANCIAL AID University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services support the University's mission by providing access and equal opportunity for financial assistance to 10| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G eligible students through federal, state, institutional, and private sources regardless of sex, color, age or other circumstance. University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services administers a broad spectrum of loan, grant, scholarship and work -study funding in an attempt to meet the financial need of the university's students. Students and sp ouses, if applicable, are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future income. All information provided to University Financial Aid is regarded as confidential. Students applying for financial ai d complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) designed to determine, in accordance with state and federal guidelines, the difference between what the student and/or family is expected to contribute and the cost of attending NMSU. Among the factors that determine the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) are (1) annual adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service; (2) savings, stocks, or bonds; (3) other assets in the form of a business, farm, or real estate; (4) nontaxable income and benefits; and (5) student's prior year income and assets. Students applying for financial aid should complete a FAFSA by visiting http://fafsa.ed.gov/. A complete listing of programs and policies is available at http://fa.nmsu.edu/. GENERAL ELIG IBILITY REQUIREMENTS To receive financial aid a student must: Be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non -citizen. Enroll at least half time (as defined by federal regulation); this applies to most Title IV progr ams. Enroll in an eligible major. Enroll in eligible courses. Maintain satisfactory academic progress. Not be in default on any federal educational loans or owe a refund on a grant. Sign a statement of educational purpose, stating that the money will be used toward educational purposes only. FINANCIAL AID AWARDS All financial aid awards are based on information provided by the student and spouse, if applicable, availability of funds, and eligibility requ irements. Any award may be revised based on changes in enrollment, cost of attendance, outside resources, family contribution, or failure to meet satisfactory academic progress. Withdrawals or reductions in enrollment may affect an award or any future awar ds. Financial aid will not pay for audited courses or for classes in which credit will not be received. Grants and Scholarships These are a form of financial aid that generally does not have to be repaid. Both grants and scholarships can be need, non -need or merit based. Grants and scholarships can come from the Federal government, the state government, a college, or a private or nonprofit organization. Students may do research to apply for any grants or scholarships they might be eligible for, and should b e sure to meet application deadlines. To be considered for all scholarships at NMSU for which you may be eligible you are encouraged to apply online through Scholar Dollar$. One scholarship application serves all NMSU students, regardless of campus. NMSU h as a variety of scholarships that are offered to incoming freshman, transfer students, continuing and graduate students. TEACH Grant (Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grants) Grants that provide up to $4,000 a year to students who are completing or plan to compete course work needed to begin a career in teaching. As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant, a student must sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve in which the student agrees to (among other requirements) teach. Occasi onally, a student might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, they withdraw from school before finishing an enrollment period such as a semester. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans These are long -term loans available to graduate students. There is no requirement to demonstrate financial need. Unlike other federal loans, interest accrues while the student is attending school. Students are responsible for paying the interest on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan during all periods. Repayment of a Di rect Loan begins six months after graduation or six months after enrollment drops below half time. The interest rate on new Direct Loans vary according to the year the loan is disbursed. More information will be available at the time the loan is made. Stud ents receiving an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan must complete an entrance counseling session and a Master Promissory Note by visiting http://studentloans.gov before NMSU will disburse funds. In addition, students must complete an exit counseling session upon graduation or withdrawal from the University. Federal Perkins Loans A school -based loan program for undergraduates and graduate students with exceptional financial need. Under this program, the school is the lender. Perkins Loans must be repaid accor ding to Federal guidelines. Repayment of Federal Perkins Loans begins nine months after graduation or nine months after enrollment drops below half time. Students receiving a Perkins Loan, must complete an online entrance counseling session before NMSU wil l issue funds. In addition, students must complete an exit interview upon graduating or withdrawal from the university. Work -Study Programs The Federal Work -Study Program provides employment opportunities for selected students with demonstrated financial n eed. The New Mexico Work - Study Program also provides employment opportunities for New Mexico resident students.

FINANCIAL AID SATISF ACTORY ACADEMIC PROG RESS Federal regulations require that financial aid recipients meet certain academic standards to be eligible for federal financial a id. To ensure that financial aid recipients are making satisfactory academic progress, academic transcripts are reviewed at the end of each term to determine eligibility for the next term. All terms of attendance are reviewed, including periods in which th e student did not receive financial aid. All transfer work is taken into account when satisfactory progress is reviewed. In addition, repeated courses are included in the academic progress calculation. ELEMENTS OF FINANCIAL AID SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRE SS: Qualitative Progress: Graduate students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 (a B average). Grade point values are: A+ / A= 4.0, A - = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B - = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C/ C - = 2.0, D+/ D/ D - = 1.0, F = 0. Grades o f I, CR, RR, PR, NC, W, AU are not calculated in the GPA. Completion Rate: Students must complete a minimum of 70% of all course work (registered credits) attempted at NMSU. Any course with a grade of Withdraw (W), Incomplete (I), Failure (F), Audit (AU ), or No Credit (NC) is considered attempted but not completed. Repeats are considered attempted credits. Maximum Time Frame: Graduate students must complete their program within 150% of the credit hours required by the program. Students who have reached the maximum allowable time will be suspended from receiving financial aid. Total attempted hours including repeated courses and transfer course work are included in the student's maximum time frame calculation. FINANCIAL AID WARNIN G \"Warning\" is a status assigned to a student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress at school that evaluates satisfactory academic progress at the end of each payment period and/or term, and chooses to allow students who fails its progress standards to continue to receive aid. If the student has not returned to satisfactory standing after this additional semester, he or she will be suspended from further financial assistance until the satisfactory progress standards are met. FINANCIAL AID S USPENSION Students are suspended from receiving financial aid if they do not meet satisfactory academic progress standards for financial aid purposes. Students on GENERAL INFORMATION | 11 financial aid suspension will not receive any form of federa l or state financial aid (grants, loans, work study). When all standards of satisfactory progress are met, the student may contact their Financial Aid Advisor to have their financial eligibility reinstated. Please visit http://fa.nmsu.edu/contact -us for a list of personnel. THE APPEALS PROCESS Students suspended from financial aid may appeal the suspension if there are mitigating circumstances affecting their progress. Students who would like to appeal the suspension must submit an appeal form and all required documentation to the University Financial Aid. A committee will review the appeal and may grant reinstatement of financial aid based on mitigating circumstances that directly contributed to deficient academic performance. Ap peals are evaluated on a term -by-term basis. All appeals, including relevant documentation, must be submitted by the semester deadline based on the current semester of enrollment. A student may appeal the termination of eligibility only twice during his or her career at New Mexico State University. MASTER'S DEGREE New Mexico State University offers both academic and professional master's degrees. If the student's undergraduate program fails to provide a proper foundation for advanced work in the chosen field or department, the student may be required to take classes to correct those deficiencies, consequently resulting in a longer period of residence than would otherwise be required. CREDIT HOUR REQUIREM ENT A minimum of 30 semester credits is required for the master's degree. Most master's degrees require at least 15 credits in courses numbered 500 or above, including thesis credit for master's programs involving a thesis. Master's programs involving a t hesis include no more than 6 credits and no fewer than 4 credits of thesis. (See the section on Thesis for further guidelines). At least 15 credits for the master's degree must be for work in courses in the department in which the student was admitted. Ad ditional credits may be selected from other fields to fit into a logical, justifiable program. Courses used to remove deficiencies or satisfy prerequisites cannot be counted as part of the requirements for the master's degree. Students must take coursework from a variety of faculty. Students may not take more than half of the minimum credits required for a master's degree (excluding thesis credits) with the same professor. Short courses of less than one summer session or one semester duration cannot constit ute more than one -fourth of the total course requirements for a master's degree. PROGRAM OF STUDY It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a co mplete tentative program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This tentative program should be kept in the student's file within the department and is not to be considered as the Application for Admission to Candidacy, which contains the pe rmanent program. APPLICATION TO CANDI DACY The admission of a student to the Graduate School does not imply admission to candidacy for an advanced degree. The major department in which the student intends to become a candida te for a master's degree must be satisfied as to the student's sound basic training and the ability to pursue studies at the graduate level. Departments may require a comprehensive qualifying examination before officially approving any candidate for the ma ster's degree. An Application for Admission to Candidacy, which formally lists curriculum requirements for the student's program of studies, must be filed with the Graduate School no later than after the completion of 12 credits of graduate work. At the ti me the Application for Admission to Candidacy is submitted, the student must have a cumulative graduate grade -point average of 3.0. The application may specify the Graduate Catalog in effect at the time of matriculation, provided that the catalog is not mo re than seven years old. Otherwise, the current Graduate Catalog will be used. The student's program listed in the Application for Admission to Candidacy must (1) meet the requirements of the chosen catalog, including the regulations of the Graduate School and of the major department, (2) include undergraduate deficiencies and required courses specified on the student's Certificate of Admission, (3) be certified by the student, the student's advisor, heads of departments offering major and minor fields, and the cognizant deans, and (4) list each course number and abbreviated title with the hours and grades. If the program is not satisfactory in the judgment of the graduate dean, it may be returned to the department for revision. When the Application for Admi ssion to Candidacy has been approved by the graduate dean, the student will be formally admitted to candidacy for the master's degree. THESIS OR NON -THESIS OPTION A thesis in the major field is recommended and may be req uired, at the discretion of the department concerned. Not more than 6 credits nor fewer than 4 thesis credits may be counted toward the requirements for a master's degree. Many departments have a non -thesis option. Please check with the department on the n on-thesis option. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMEN T Having once registered for thesis, a student must continue to register for a minimum of 1 credit in thesis or graduate course work each regular semester until the thesis is approved by t he Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmi ssion and satisfy the requirements in effect at the time of reapplication. FINAL EXAMINATION Each candidate will be given a final examination conducted by the graduate committee in accordance to the schedule provided by the Gradua te School. It is the student's responsibility to be sure that the form to schedule this examination is submitted to the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. At the time of the final examination, a gradua te student must have an NMSU cumulative graduate grade -point average of at least 3.0 and must be enrolled in the final semester; or, if the student is writing a thesis, he or she must have completed all course work for the master's degree. Students with th e nonthesis option may be required to pay a special exam fee in lieu of registering for 1 credit of graduate course work. (See Tuition, Fees, and Other Expenses). The final examination format shall be determined by the department, with the approval of the graduate dean. If a department does not specify an examination format, the final examination shall consist of an oral defense of the student's thesis (if one was written) as well as a general examination of the candidate's field of study. Any candidate who fails in the final examination may (1) upon recommendation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester, or (2) be excluded from further candidacy for the degree. Failure in the s econd examination disqualifies a candidate from obtaining the degree. Certification that the thesis has been accepted and that the final examination has been passed must be filed with the Graduate School not later than one week before the degree is conferr ed. GRADUATE COMMITTEE The master's degree committee will consist of a minimum of three faculty members holding at least master's degrees. The committee chair and one other member must be in the student's department; however, the home department of one of these two committee members may be outside the student's department (see Graduate Faculty Guidelines section Appointments Outside of Home Department). The third person on the committee must serve as the dean's 12| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G representative and cannot be a faculty member of the students' home department. The committee chair and the dean's representative must be members of the graduate faculty (please refer to Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments). If the student has an approved minor area of study then either the dean's representative or a fourth committee member must come from the minor department. If no minor is declared, the dean's representative may come from a related area (recommended by the committee chair) or be appointed independe ntly by the dean of the Graduate School. All students completing a written exam are required to have a dean's representative that reviews the process of administering the exam. The dean's representative can sign off on all of the exams of students taking a written exam for the given semester. The dean's representative must be from outside the students' home department. The faculty committee of the student is responsible for identifying a dean's representative and completing the examination forms. A list of graduate faculty is available at the web site of the Graduate School. Faculty can use the list to identify graduate faculty to serve as the dean's representative. Departments can nominate individuals with a master's degree and/or doctoral degree and relate d experience for a temporary appointment to graduate faculty (please see Appointment to Graduate Faculty of Non -NMSU Employees in the Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments in this Graduate Catalog). Nomination letters must identify specific roles of the individual and the year(s) of service (up to three years per request per individual). The nomination letter must receive the endorsement of the academic dean. If granted a temporary appointment to graduate faculty, the individual will be limited to the specific role(s) identified by the department. Departments can request that the individual be allowed to serve as a dean's representative. As indicated in the Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments, any qualified member of the graduate faculty may j oin any graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which they are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the dean of the Graduate School. Depa rtments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members as long as the stated conditions of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. TIME LIMIT The graduate program leading to the master's degree must be completed within seven years (or eight successive summers) including completion of the master's thesis or final project. Any course work more than seven years old at time of the final examination will not be included in the program. APPLICATION FOR GRAD UATION Candidates, who have completed all requirements for their program of study are required to submit the Application for D egree (Diploma) by the deadlines specified in the academic calendar. If you will be completing two degrees/certificates in the same semester, you must apply for graduation for each degree separately. If you change your graduation semester after submitting your graduation application, or if you do not meet the necessary degree requirements, your graduation application will not be automatically updated to the next semester. You will be required to apply for a new semester and pay another graduation fee. Degr ees will be certified by the Graduate School upon the complete review and clearance of the candidates program of study. INTERDISCIPLINARY MA STER'S DEGREE Interdisciplinary studies at New Mexico State University are intended for individuals specializing in programs that require the integration of more than one discipline to fully engage in the field of study. Interdisciplinary studies provide a mechanism to address emerging scholarship, innovation, and research and allows graduate students to engage in emerging technologies, optimizing their education outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Interdisciplinary study takes advantage of traditional academic training within specific departments yet allows students to customize their own career preparation. In these programs, a coherent common core is expected and is intended to combine existing courses across disciplines to meet unique objectives. The Master of Science or Master of Arts degrees are awarded for inte rdisciplinary programs and are carried out under the direction of the student's graduate committee. The interdisciplinary studies option should not be used in cases where the applicants' objectives can be realized by admission to a specific department and inclusion of up to two minor areas in the program of study. Admission Students follow the regular admission procedures set forth by the Graduate School. In completing the application, the applicant indicates IMAS in the section requesting Department or Program and designates the area of interdisciplinary study in the section requesting Field or area of advanced study. A proposal for interdisciplinary studies (see 1 below) must be submitted with the application. A departmental referral form will be generated and sent to the primary department specified in the proposal (see 3 below). Once the student's graduate committee is designated, the committee can require additional materials such as a statement of interest, letters of recommendation, G RE or GMAT scores, and a personal interview. Degree awarded Students receive a Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS) and a concentration in the interdisciplinary study area. Other conditions that apply 1. The student must pre sent a written description of the program concept consisting of (a) objective of the program of study including proposed areas of skill development, proposed courses in more than one graduate degree granting department of NMSU, and (b) a justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. In addition the student needs to designate the degree being sought (Master of Science or Master of Arts) and a name for the interdisciplinary area. 2. The student's program of study must include a minimum of 30 graduate level credits and a maximum of 36 credits. The student may take 6 credits in departments that do not grant a graduate degree but the courses must be numbered 450 and above, and be pertinent to the program of study. 3. The majority of the d epartments involved in the student's program will be master's degree and doctoral degree granting departments. The student is expected to take at least 15 credits in the primary area of study within one department. The department selected by the student wi ll receive a copy of the student's application for admissions from the Graduate School. In addition, the student is required to select an approved minor area of study in another department that consists of at least 9 credits (see the Approved Graduate Mino rs section for the approved list of minors). 4. The student will form a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty and select an advisor who will chair the committee. The chair must be from the primary department where the student has taken at l east 15 credits listed in the proposal submitted and the other committee member must be from another department in which the student has selected a minor area of study from the approved list of minors listed in the Graduate Catalog. The third faculty membe r must be the dean's representative. 5. The student will be required to submit the Candidacy Form to the Graduate School after 12 credits are satisfactorily completed. 6. The program will meet all requirements of a master's degree, as listed in the Gradua te Catalog; with the interpretation that \"major field\" includes courses from two or more departments and in the designated interdisciplinary study area. 7. The program of study will include the completion of a research thesis or project. The work may be s ubmitted in the form of a publishable manuscript, technical report, thesis or creative option. 8. The student may enroll on a part -time basis keeping in mind that coursework cannot be more than seven years old at the time of the final examination. 9. The student will be administered a final comprehensive exam that is consistent with the department selected for the primary area of GENERAL INF ORMATION | 13 study. For example, if a department requires a written exam, the student in the interdisciplinary masters will also be required to take a written exam. 10. The final oral comprehensive exam will consist of questions pertinent to the area of study and the defense of the research thesis or project. In both cases an integrated approach to the areas of study chosen should be followed. 11. All other rules for graduate study at NMSU must be followed. Thesis/Non -thesis option As with any graduate student, the student in interdisciplinary studies can select to follow a thesis or non -thesis option. Students enrolled in the thesis option register for 6 thesis credits. Students not wishing to follow the thesis option will be required to complete a project report. The project must reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the program in which the student is engage d. Comprehensive exam Students in interdisciplinary studies take a comprehensive exam composed of questions designed by the student's committee. Two individuals in the areas of study plus the dean's representative outside of the department/program/interdisciplinary study option will be involved. A chair is also identified. SECOND MASTER'S DEGR EE A student who has earned one master's degree at NMSU may be allowed to count a maximum of 6 semester credi ts earned on the first degree toward a second master's degree, if those credits fit into a logical graduate program. The number of shared credits may be increased for dual and joint degree programs. DUAL AND JOINT DEGRE E PROGRAMS A dual degree program is a program of study whereby courses of study are combined so that students can complete two degree programs of study in less time than it would take if the programs were independently pursued. Upon graduation, they rec eive two separate diplomas from each degree program of participating departments and/or institutions. To enroll in a dual, students must complete two separate applications, receive two independent offers of admissions, and meet program and course requireme nts of both programs of study. A joint degree program is one where two or more departments interweave their courses and course requirements to create a single degree program. Students are admitted into one program, take courses in each participating depar tment, college or university, but only received one degree and diploma. These degree programs allow departments and/or campuses to take advantage of faculty talents. Both dual and joint degree programs must have prior approval by the Graduate School. Stude nts must apply and be accepted into graduate programs of each department participating in a specific dual or joint degree program. The list of approved dual and joint degrees can be found in the section Graduate Degree Programs. MINORS A can didate for a master's degree may select up to two approved minors in addition to the major. A minimum of 9 credits of graduate work is necessary for a minor at the master's level. (See Graduate Degree Programs, Concentrations, and Approved Minors for a lis t of approved minors.) To record a minor on a student's permanent record, the minor must be listed on the Application for Admission to Candidacy, and this form must be signed by the head of the department offering the minor program. At the oral examination , a committee member may move to remove the designation of a minor with the concurrence of the committee. A minor will not be awarded after the degree has been posted to the transcript. TEACHER LICENSURE Students wishing to take g raduate courses for licensure or renewal of licensure or for personal enrichment must be fully admitted to a department to do so. Undeclared students may not register for teacher licensure classes. Endorsement is available at both the elementary and second ary levels in bilingual education, TESOL (Teaching of English as a Second Language), reading, and special education. Endorsement is also available in early childhood education at the elementary level. Contact curric -instr@nmsu.edu for more information. SPECIALIST IN EDUCATION DEGREE The degree of specialist in education is provided for experienced members of the education profession who have completed the master's degree (except the school psychology program, which req uires the bachelor's degree) and have maintained a 3.3 grade -point average during pursuit of this degree or its equivalent. Primary emphasis is placed on the development of competencies needed for a professional specialization in a given field. Programs ar e available in curriculum and instruction and school psychology. Students must complete the general application for the Graduate School. They should also check with the admitting department for specific departmental requirements. Residency and Credit Requi rements The specialist in education degree requires a minimum of 30 semester credits beyond the master's degree, including research, intern experiences, and graduate courses. The student meets the campus residency requirement by completing a minimum of 24 credits from faculty of New Mexico State University. The student must maintain a 3.0 average. No more than 6 semester credits of C level work are allowed in this program. Program of Study It is recommended that, during the first semester of enrollment, each graduate student beginning studies toward a degree prepare a complete tentative program of study in consultation with the student's advisor. This tentative program should be kept in the s tudent's file within the department and is not to be considered as the Application for Admission to Candidacy, which contains the permanent program. Major Field All course work taken for the degree should apply directly, through a logic al program of study, to the specialty which the candidate has selected. Each department is responsible for defining the required sequence of courses. Candidacy Following the successful completion of 12 semester credits beyond the master's degree, the student is eligible for admission to candidacy. With the achievement of candidacy, a committee is appointed to work with the candidate on the remainder of the program. The committee consists of three members of the graduate faculty in the Coll ege of Education. Internship Each candidate will earn from 3 to 6 semester credits in an internship. This experience will consist of supervised performance of duties related to the candidate's specialty. The structure of the internship w ill be determined by the student's department. A research project will be conducted in conjunction with the internship. Oral Examination The oral examination committee will consist of the student's committee plus a dean's represent ative appointed from the graduate faculty by the dean of the Graduate School. This committee will conduct an oral examination at the conclusion of the research project and no earlier than the candidate's last semester of enrollment. The examination will co nsist of a defense of the project along with general questions on subject matter related to the candidate's field of study. Any candidate who fails the oral examination may, upon recommendation of the advisor and approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Time Limit The specialist in education degree must be completed within seven years follow ing admission to the program. Students cannot include any course work on their program of study that is more than seven years old at the time of the final oral examination. 14| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G DOCTORAL DEGREES PREPARATION FOR DOCT ORAL DEGREE PROGRAMS Prospective candidates are expected to hold bachelor's or master's degrees from accredited institutions, based on curricula that include the prerequisites for graduate study in the department of their subjec t. To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, the applicant must have a grade -point average of at least 3.0. Prospective candidates are urged to consult the department in which they wish to study for information concerning specific requirements. DOCTOR OF ECONOMIC D EVELOPMENT Students enrolled in the Doctor of Economic Development are required to complete and pass their comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to com plete an internship experience and a project paper as defined by their program. They can embark on the project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, t hey are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including ECDV 694 Internship and ECDV 699 Doctoral Project. A project paper must be finalized using a similar submission process as the dissertation (see section Finalizing the Doctoral Dis sertation of the Graduate Catalog). On the front page, after the title of the paper, the student should indicate that it is a project paper. Students completing projects papers do not need to complete the earned doctoral survey. The paper must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The form and style of the paper must comply with regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation/project paper -approval process as well as information on binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The project paper is not complete until copies have been acce pted for binding by the staff of Branson Library and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION (ED.D.) The degree of doctor of education attests proficienc y in a program of graduate study in which the emphasis is upon preparation for competent performance in professional education. This program is intended primarily for students pursuing careers in which teaching, administration, or school services predomina te, rather than those in which research predominates. The Ed.D. degree in curriculum and instruction is offered in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction; the degree in educational administration is offered in the Department of Educational Leadership and Administration. The requirements for doctoral degrees in the two departments of the College of Education have the following distinguishing elements: 1. The qualifying examination consists of a written and an oral section, both of which are administere d prior to admission to the program. Successful completion of the qualifying examination is tantamount to acceptance of the student for doctoral admission. Residency of at least two consecutive semesters cannot commence until the semester after the qualify ing examination is successfully completed. 2. Comprehensive examinations are usually administered three times annually. The written examination tests the major and related areas of concentration. Within two weeks after successful completion of the major an d related area examinations, the student takes a comprehensive oral examination. Candidacy follows the successful completion of the orals. A student who fails any part of the comprehensive examination may present him - or herself for re - examination of the f ailed part of the exam before moving on to the next part. 3. The major area of study must be within the College of Education. A minimum of nine planned and integrated credits constitutes the related area and can be taken in any department of the university with the approval of the student's committee. The related area must be specifically planned with the major and minor departments in order for the doctoral fields to be mutually supportive. Any transfer credit or predoctoral course work to be included in t he related field must have the approval of both the major and minor department at the outset. Specified course work in both research and statistics is required for this degree. Other requirements are described in the departmental sections of this catalog. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (PH.D.) The degree of doctor of philosophy requires distinguished attainment in both scholarship and original research. The degree is granted chiefly in recognition of the candidate's high attainmen ts and ability in the special field, as shown by work on the required examinations covering both the general and the special fields, and by the preparation of a dissertation. A candidate for the Ph.D. degree is expected to maintain a higher level of work t han the grade -point average of 3.0 that has been established for the candidate for the master's degree. DOCTOR OF NURSING PR ACTICE Students holding baccalaureate degree in Nursing are required to complete and pass all req uired course work for the Doctor of Nursing Practice degree program. They are also expected to complete and pass their comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, they are expected to complete an internship experience and a project pap er as defined by their program. They can embark on the project paper once they have completed and passed their comprehensive examination. They are not required to take 700 level dissertation hours. However, they are expected to complete at least 12 credits at the 600 level including NURS 698 Advanced Clinical Immersion credits sufficient to complete the DNP Final Project. Students that hold a Master's of Science in Nursing are required to complete all course work requirements, complete and pass their compre hensive exam, and complete a DNP Final Project. Post -MSN DNP students must complete at least 6 credits at the 600 level, including NURS 698 credits sufficient to complete the DNP Project. Completed projects must be uploaded to a national DNP Project repos itory approved by the Graduate Faculty of the School of Nursing in order to complete the DNP degree. INTERDISCIPLINARY DO CTORATE Students wishing to study in the interdisciplinary doctoral degree program must apply and be accepted into a doctorate -granting department. The following requirements for admission to the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program have been established: 1. A master's degree or equivalent program of study that includes at least 30 credit hours o f graduate course work with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. 2. Twelve credit hours of graduate course work must be completed at New Mexico State University in order to apply for admission into the interdisciplinary doctorate degree program . Additional course work is required for degree completion. 3. Evidence of outstanding academic achievement in graduate school. 4. A written description of the program concept prepared by the student consisting of (a) areas in which competency is required; (b) proposed readings and course work and how these relate to required competencies; (c) objectives and an outline for thesis research; (d) justification for not using an existing departmental degree program. 5. The student must select an advisor from his or her department to chair the committee and, in consultation with the advisor, structure a committee consisting of at least five faculty members from the graduate faculty list who are willing to work on the interdisciplinary degree program The committee must include at least two members from each of two doctorate -granting departments. The committee chair will convene a meeting to review and approve the proposed program. 6. The Graduate School will send an Admission Referral document, signed by all committ ee members, to the heads of all departments from which the student proposes to use more than 8 credits of course work, or from which faculty are requested to serve on the proposed committee. 7. Once the Admission Referral document has been approved by all departments, the committee chair will convene a meeting of the committee to review the student's program and make changes as necessary. In addition, the committee will set the format and date for GENERAL INFORMATION | 15 the qualifying exam. An effort should be made to incorporate the interdisciplinary nature of the program into the qualifying exam. 8. When the student has passed the qualifying exam and the Admission Referral memorandum has been approved by the respective department heads, the requirements for admission to the prog ram are satisfied. Formal acceptance into a doctoral program may be required in order to receive financial assistance. 9. The number or courses required for degree completion will vary depending on the student's program of study. Interdisciplinary doctorat e degree students must meet the requirements for residency, registration, the comprehensive examination, the Final Examination, the dissertation, and the declaration of approved minor. Please see the Doctoral Degrees section of this catalog to review the f ull requirements for doctoral degrees. 10. The dissertation work shall include at least 18 credits of a 700 -level course. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCTORAL DEGREES Program of Study A studen t who has completed 12 credits of graduate work beyond the master's degree, or its equivalent, in residence at New Mexico State University, and has successfully completed the qualifying examination, should file the Program of Study and Committee for Doctor al Students form (also called Program of Study) for the doctorate before registering for additional courses. This form may be obtained from the Graduate School, department offices, or from the website of the Graduate School: http://gradschool.nmsu.edu. The Program of Study form should be completed in consultation with the advisor and other members of the doctoral committee. This form should include the course number and abbreviated title with the credit hours. For courses already completed, grades must be s hown for both major and minor areas. The program recommended by the student's committee is subject to approval by the head of the major department, the head of the minor department (if applicable), the college dean, and the dean of the Graduate School. The program of study should be designed to meet the campus residency requirement described in Residency section and should include a minimum of 30 graduate credits (from NMSU or other approved graduate programs) plus 18 credits of dissertation work (700 -level course). Doctoral Graduate Committee The doctoral committee will be composed of at least four members of the graduate faculty holding doctoral degrees. The following rules apply to the composition of the committee: In addition to the committee chair, at least one other member must be from a discipline within the student's major area, which may encompass more than one degree -granting department. One member of the committee may be from a related area of study other than the student's declared minor. If an approved minor is declared, at least one but not more than two members of the committee must be from the minor area. At least three committee members must be members of the graduate faculty in doctorate -granting de partments. Of these three members: The committee chair must be a member of the graduate faculty in the student's department (See the section Appointments Outside of Home Department in the Guidelines on Graduate Faculty Appointments). The home departmen t of no more than one of the other two committee members from doctorate -granting departments may be outside the student's department. As indicated in the Guidelines for Graduate Faculty Appointments, any qualified member of the graduate faculty may join an y graduate program within a department. Applicants will be approved by the graduate program to which they are applying, through a process to be determined by that program, before their application is forwarded to the dean of the Graduate School. One member of the committee must serve as the dean's representative. The dean's representative can be either the member from the related area or minor area or an independent member appointed by the dean of the Graduate School but must not be from the student's depar tment. In programs where more than one department is a participant, the dean's representative may not be from any of those departments. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members as long as the stated conditio ns of membership are satisfied. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the dean of the Graduate School. All members of the committee will attend the comprehensive oral and the final defense for the dissertation. No change in membership of the doctoral committee may be made without prior approval from the dean of the Graduate School. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students must pass a qualifying examination. This examination is sched uled by the student's advisor and is administered by the major department. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Schedulin g the qualifying examination is based on the following criteria: (a) for students who enter the Graduate School with little or no previous graduate experience but wish to proceed directly to the doctorate, the qualifying examination should be taken after 1 2 credits of graduate work; (b) for students who enter with a master's degree or equivalent from another university, or another department, the qualifying examination should be taken before the completion of one semester of graduate work. The department ma y allow the master's final examination to serve as the doctoral qualifying examination or may require a separate examination for students who earn their master's degree at New Mexico State University, and will continue in the same department. Based on the result of the qualifying examination, the department will take one or more of the following actions: (a) admit the student to further work toward the doctorate; (b) recommend that the program be limited to the master's degree; (c) recommend a re -evaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (d) recommend a discontinuation of graduate work. In all cases, the Graduate School shall be notified of the results of the qualifying examination. Upon passing the qualifying examination, the student will be admitted to the doctoral program. The student's advisor and department head will then appoint the doctoral committee to prepare the student's preliminary program of study for the doctorate. This program shall be filed with the Graduate Scho ol. Application for Graduation Candidates, who have completed all requirements for their program of study are required to submit the Application for Degree (Diploma) by the deadlines specified in the academic calendar. If you will be completing two degrees/certificates in the same semester, you must apply for graduation for each degree separately. If you change your graduation semester after submitting your graduation application, or if you do not meet the necessary degree requirements, your graduation application will not be automatically updated to the next semester. You will be required to apply for a new semester and pay another graduation fee. Degrees will be certified by the Graduate School upon the complete review a nd clearance of the candidates program of study. Time Limit If more than five years have elapsed since the date of the comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission t o the final examination. Final Examination Every student working toward the doctoral degree will submit a dissertation embodying the results of original research. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate the student's ability i n independent investigation and to be a contribution to human knowledge. The dissertation shall display a mastery of the literature of the subject field and present an organized, coherent development of ideas with a clear exposition of results, and provide a critical discussion of the limits and validity of the student's conclusions. When a complete draft of the dissertation has been prepared, the student's doctoral committee (appointed after the qualifying examination) will conduct the final examination. T he final examination is concerned primarily with the research work of the student as embodied in the dissertation, but it may be much broader and extend over the candidate's entire field of study. The intention of the final examination is to verify that th e candidate has a satisfactory grasp of the major 16| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G subject as a whole and has a general acquaintance with the fields of knowledge represented by the course of study. The final examination is entirely oral and is open to the public. The final examination mus t be completed in accordance with the schedule provided in the academic calendar. The form requesting this examination is to be submitted by the department to the Graduate School ten working days before the examination is taken. This form may be found on t he Web at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/forms -index.html and is also available from the Graduate School and departmental offices. The student must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the dissertation no later than seven worki ng days before the date of the final examination. Any candidate who fails the final oral examination may (a) upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester; or ( b) be terminated from the doctoral program. Failure in the second examination disqualifies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Registration during Regular Semesters and Summer Session After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least 3 credits of dissertation or graduate course work each spring and fall semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the c opies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abide by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requir ements in effect at time of reapplication. During spring and fall semesters the doctoral candidate must register for 3 units of dissertation or other graduate course work. The candidate must have also applied for the degree by filing the Application for De gree (Diploma) by the deadline specified in the academic calendar. If the final examination is to be held during the summer or the dissertation is to be completed during the summer, the student must register for 1 credit during the summer session in which the final examination will be held or the dissertation will be completed. In order to graduate in the summer the student must have filed the Application for Degree (Diploma) by the posted deadline for the semester in which degree requirements will be compl eted. Comprehensive Examination Before admission to candidacy for a doctoral degree, the student must pass a comprehensive examination intended to test knowledge of the major and any approved minor fields of study. The stu dent will be admitted to the examination after satisfaction of the language requirements (where applicable), after completion of adequate course work to the satisfaction of the major department and the Graduate School, and when considered by the committee to be adequately prepared. The Graduate School should receive the Program of Study and Committee for Doctoral Students and standardized test scores (if required by the department) after the student passes the qualifying examination and before the comprehen sive examination. The oral examination form must be on file at the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. The examination must be part written and part oral. The results of the oral examination will be re ported to the Graduate School. Any applicant for candidacy who fails the comprehensive examination may, upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the graduate dean, (1) be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester or (2 ) be terminated from the doctoral program. The student must be duly registered for 3 credits of graduate course work in the Graduate School during the semester in which the comprehensive examination is taken. A student taking an oral examination during the summer must enroll for at least one credit for that term. In general, there should be a time lapse of at least one year between the comprehensive and final oral examination. However, due to the type of research required in some departments and the method of administering the written comprehensive in other departments, such a time lapse is not always practical. In all cases there must be one semester between the comprehensive and the final oral examinations. Advancement to Candidacy A student will be formally advanced to candidacy upon the successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the recommendation of the committee, and the approval of the graduate dean. A minimum of 9 credits must be taken after successful com pletion of the comprehensive exam. A student may not register for dissertation credits (700) prior to successful completion of the qualifying exam. The dissertation preparation shall total at least 18 credits of courses numbered 700. The doctoral committee can impose additional requirements for courses numbered 700. A student is admitted to the doctoral program after successful completion of the qualifying examination. After successful completion of the comprehensive examination, a student must continue to register for at least 3 credits of dissertation or graduate course work each regular semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the copies have been accepted by the binding section in Branson Library. A student who fails to abid e by this regulation will be considered withdrawn from the university, and, in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at time of reapplication. Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation After successful completion of the final examination a copy of the dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School for format review on or before the deadline. The deadlines are posted to the Graduate School website at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm. The form and style of the dissertation must comply with the regulations given in the Guidelines for Preparing a Thesis or Dissertation http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines. These guidelines also contain detailed information on the dissertation -approval process and binding. Candidates are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School on format, deadlines, and procedures before final typing. The dissertation is not complete until copies have been accepted for binding by the binding section staff and until the microfilm agreement form has been completed and received in Branson Library. Residency The requirements for the doctoral degree ordinarily cannot be met in less than three years follo wing the bachelor's degree. The minimum campus residency requirement for the doctoral degree shall include enrollment in at least two semesters of classes taught by New Mexico State University faculty. DECLARATION OF APPRO VED MINOR Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. The list of approved minors can be found in the Graduate Catalog in the section called Graduate Degree Programs, Concentrations , and Approved Minors. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and final examinations. REGISTRATION Graduate students may register in person in their departments or on the Web at https://my. nmsu.edu. No person will be officially registered unless formally admitted to the Graduate School. CHANGE OF ADDRESS In order to assure accurate student records, students are responsible for keeping the Graduate School and the Reg istrar's Office informed of the following: Changes in residence and mailing addresses; current telephone numbers, and primary e -mail addresses. Failure to do so may result in transcripts, diplomas or other important communications from the university not being received in a timely manner. SHORT COURSES AND IN STITUTES Short courses and institutes are conducted on the campus each summer and during the academic year. Courses numbered 450 and above have been approved GENERAL INFORMATION | 17 to car ry graduate credit for students regularly enrolled in the Graduate School. Registration is required to receive graduate credit for these courses. Concurrent enrollment of graduate students in regular and short courses is allowed provided that the combined credits do not exceed 15 in a fall or spring semester. All short courses carrying one semester credit will be graded on an S/U basis, and these S/U credits will be counted toward the student's limit of S/U credits. SUMMER SCHOOL SESSIO N During the summer session, the maximum number of graduate credits a graduate student may take is 9 credits. Students who wish to enroll in more than 9 credits in the summer, must write an appeal letter addressed to the Graduate Dean. REGULATIONS POLICIES ON GRADUATE COURSES Numbering of Courses University courses numbered 100 through 299 are considered lower division and are for undergraduate credit only, these courses will not be applied toward a graduate degree at any time. Courses numbered 300 through 499 are considered upper division and are intended for the undergraduate level, but in some cases graduate credit may be obtained. Courses numbered 450 through 4 99 are designed for seniors and graduates; 500 through 599 are primarily for graduate students working on a master's degree; 600 through 700 are principally for students working on a doctoral degree. In some cases, graduate credit may be obtained in course s numbered 300 through 449, to secure such credit, a written request must be filed with the dean of the Graduate School at the time of registration. However, these courses cannot be deficiencies, and no more than 4 credits will be granted toward a degree c an be granted for courses numbered below 400. The total of courses numbered 300 through 449 cannot exceed 8 credits. Full-Time Graduate Student A full -time graduate student is one enrolled for 9 or more credits per semest er other than for tuition purposes. Students doing graduate work while engaged in full-time, off -campus employment should limit themselves to one or two courses. Graduate students should take into consideration any outside workload and commitments in plann ing their course load. Full -time graduate students without other commitments normally enroll for 9 -12 graded credits each regular semester; the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take in any regular semester is 15 credits. During the s ummer session, the maximum number of graded credits a graduate student may take is 9 credits. Graduate students may enroll for one additional credit that is not graded (i.e., Audit) for summer, fall and spring semesters. Course Deficiencies Students who have been admitted with departmental deficiencies may be required to take diagnostic tests and additional qualifying examinations. They must complete satisfactorily, in a manner specified by the major department, all undergraduate course deficiencies as prescribed by the department responsible for the graduate program. Course deficiencies will be listed on the undergraduate transcript; however, these deficiencies will not be calculated in the student's graduate GPA or graduate hour s. With the permission of the student's advisor and the head of department, courses to meet undergraduate deficiencies may be taken under an s/u option (with S being a grade satisfactory to the professor). These courses will not affect the maximum number o f S/U graduate credits permitted. Registration Requirements for Summer If the final examination is to be scheduled or the thesis is to be completed during the summer, the student must register for one credit hou r during the summer session in which the oral examination will be held or the thesis will be completed. In order to graduate during a summer session, the student must also have filed the Application for Degree (Diploma) by the deadline posted in the curren t Registration Guide online or the academic calendar printed on the inside back cover of the current Graduate Catalog and at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/deadlines/deadlines.htm Adding and/or Dropping Courses It is the student's responsibility to initiate official withdrawal from a course. As indicated on the online Academic Calendar, courses may not be added after the last day to add, students must drop their course(s) by the last day to drop and students can find the r efund policy and schedule. Auditing Courses A student officially admitted to the Graduate School may enroll in any class as an auditor with the verbal consent of the instructor, provided the facilities are not required for regular students. Record of enrollment is preserved but no credit is given. Courses being taken as audit will count toward total course load but cannot be used to meet the minimum course load requirements. Because graduate students can enroll in any undergraduate course under the S/U option, they are discouraged from auditing classes. Repeating Courses Any graduate course numbered 450 and above may be repeated. Any computable grade (excluding I, W, AU, CR, S or U) earned for the course wil l be included in the cumulative grade -point average, but the credit hours may be earned only once. Substitutions and Waivers All substitutions or waivers of required courses for degree candidates must be approved before th e last day of registration during the semester in which the student expects to obtain the degree. Challenging Graduate Courses A graduate student may challenge a graduate course by examination. Changes in Registration Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate official withdrawal from a course. Forms are available from the Academic Advisor or in the Deans' offices. Courses may not be added or dropped after the cutoff date indicated in the university academic calendar, with the exception of petitions for retroactive withdrawal processed in accordance with Policy 6.92 . For refund policy, see http://uar.nmsu.edu/withdrawals/. When a student officially drops a course, the W grade is assigned as follows: 1. No grade is assigned during the registration period. 2. A W grade is assigned to any student who officially drops a course during the first half of its duration. A student may not officially withdraw from a course after this time. 3. A grade of W is assigned in all courses to any student officially withdrawing from the university prior to the last three weeks of class es. A student found insufficiently prepared to carry a regular course may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same field any day before the last day to officially withdraw from an individual course. Any person attending under Veterans Educati onal Assistance must notify the Military and Veterans Programs office if dropping or adding courses changes enrollment status for benefits. Concentrations A concentration is a collection of coursework in a specific area that is part of a degree program of study at NMSU. Only approved concentrations within a students' department or program may be noted on a transcript. Students must file a request for inclusion of an approved concentration at the time they file their program of study a nd must identify the concentration in their application for the degree. Concentrations will not be added to a transcript after the degree is awarded. Departments must certify that a student has met the requirements for a concentration at the time the stude nt successfully completes the final examination. GRADING SYSTEM Graduate students are expected to apply themselves intensively to the study of the material covered by the courses in which they are enrolled. Accordingly, a high level of performance is required. The student must maintain a grade -point 18| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G average of at least 3.0 in all graduate courses taken as a graduate student at NMSU. Courses transferred from the undeclared program at NMSU or from other institutions will be included in determining grade -point averages. Grades At the end of the term, grade reports are not automatically mailed to students. Students can access grades and credits by the web using my.nmsu.edu. It is the responsibility of the student to provide updated grade addresses to the Registrar's Office. At the request of the student, the instructor will provide information on progress in the course prior to the last day to drop a course. The NMSU system of grading is expressed in letters, which carry grad e points used in calculating the cumulative grade -point average: Letter Grade Grade points per unit of credit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 2.0 D+, D, D - 1.0 F 0 W \u2014 Withdrawal 0 N \u2014 Grade not submitted 0 CR \u2014 Credit authorized, but not letter grade 0 IP \u2014 In progress 0 RR \u2014 Progress in undergraduate course 0 PR \u2014 Progress on graduate thesis 0 S* \u2014 Satisfactory work 0 U \u2014 Unsatisfactory work 0 I \u2014 Incomplete 0 AU \u2014 Audit 0 *An S grade is a grade satisfactor y to the professor and is normally equivalent to the letter grade of C or higher. In computing the overall grade -point average, the total credits in which grades of A, B, C, D, or F have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earne d. A course for which only CR, but no letter grade, is given and a course in which an S or PR grade is earned will be included in earned hours but is not computed in the grade -point average. C, D, and F Grades Although C - grades earned at New Mexico State University may be counted toward the requirements for an advanced degree, this is not considered acceptable graduate -level performance. Courses in which a student earns only a D or F may never be counted toward a graduate degree, although such grades are calculated in determining the grade - point average. Therefore, any grades of D or F must be compensated for by the necessary hours of A if the student is to have the 3.0 grade -point average required before awarding of the degree. Incomplete Grade The grade of Incomplete is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control. The following regulations apply to removing or changing an Incomplete grade: 1. Instr uctors may assign an Incomplete grade only if the student is unable to complete the course due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. Examples of appropriate circumstances include document ed illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, and similar circumstances. Job related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for being assigned an Incomplete. In no case is an Incomplete to be used to avoid the assig ning of D, F, or Unsatisfactory grades for marginal or failing work. 2. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the I Grade Information Form and have the form delivered to the course dean. The instructor will state in writing the steps necessary to complete the remaining course work or the instructor may indicate that the student will be required to re -enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the I grade will not be removed). The student will sign this document or the course dean wil l send a copy of the document to the student's official permanent address. 3. The student is entitled to have the Incomplete grade removed from the transcript only if the student completes the remaining course work as specified on the I Grade Information F orm, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. The work must be completed within 12 months after the Incomplete is assigned and prior to the student's graduation, or within a shorter period of time if specified by the instructor on the I Grade Informatio n Form. If the student fails to complete the course work, the instructor may change the Incomplete grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F, or Unsatisfactory) provided that the instructor stated that this would occur on the I Grade Information Form. 4. Incomplete grades can be removed from the transcript by the instructor only during the 12 month period following assignment of the Incomplete or prior to the student's graduation, whichever comes first. To remove an Incomplete, the instructor must comp lete a Change of Grade Form and file the form with the Registrar's Office. The instructor may assign whatever grade is appropriate for the entire course. This may include grades of D, F, or Unsatisfactory. An Incomplete not changed by the assigning instruc tor within 12 months and prior to graduation shall remain an Incomplete grade thereafter. 5. A student may re -enroll and receive credit for any course for which an Incomplete grade was previously received, but retaking the course will not result in removal of the Incomplete grade from the student's transcript. The effect of removing an Incomplete grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation, or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's a cademic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade replacing the Incomplete is included in the grade -point average calculation that establishes the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorde d after the student begins another semester, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based upon its inclusion with grades for the semester in which the student is enrolled. Students may appeal an unsatisfactory grade through the procedure described in the Disciplinary Issues section of this catalog. S Grade An S grade indicates satisfactory performance. Independent Studies Independent study courses (including directed reading and special topics courses whic h do not carry a subtitle) are for students capable of self -direction who meet the requirements for the S/U option, i.e., if the students are not eligible for the S/U option, they are not eligible for independent study. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earned in independent study courses. GENERAL INFORMATION | 19 Grading of Research In grading master's and doctoral research and thesis and dissertation work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the symbol PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) in place of a grade. Progress indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but gives no indication of its quality. Unsatisfactory indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality. These symbols remain on the student's transcript permanently. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of credits of research required. After having submitted a series of PR (Progress) or U (Unsatisfactory) symbols, the instructor shall report a grade at the conclusion of the final oral examination, or no later than the date the thesis or dissertation is submitted for the signature of the graduate dean. If the thesis or disse rtation and the performance in the final oral examination are found to be acceptable, the instructor shall report a S (Satisfactory)grade. If the thesis or dissertation or the performance in the final oral examination is found to be unacceptable, the instr uctor shall report an U (Unsatisfactory) grade. Students who accumulate a total of two Unsatisfactory grades in courses numbered 598 (approved courses), 599, 600, 699, or 700 will be placed in provisional status. Three Unsatisfactory grades in these course s will result in dismissal from the Graduate School. Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory Course Option Grades of Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory (S/U) may be used for courses taken by a regular status gradu ate student outside the major department, provided that the student's advisor and the head of the department approve. Departments may designate three credits of departmental courses numbered 500 and above for S/ U option grading with the approval of the co llege dean and the graduate dean. The S/U grade request form must be submitted to the graduate dean at the time of registration for an academic session. The limitations of the S/U option are as follows: No more than a total of 6 credits of S/U courses are permitted on the master's degree. Doctoral candidates may take an additional 6 credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy. Registration is limited to one course per semester, and courses with Unsatisfactory grades cannot be used in a stude nt's program. TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDITS INTO A DEGRE E PROGRAM A student may transfer graduate credits taken at NMSU as well as graduate credits from another university to New Mexico State Univer sity, provided the credits were earned on the campus of an accredited institution. Transferred course work (grades and hours) is maintained separately from NMSU course work. Immediately after initial enrollment in the Graduate School, students must submit forms to obtain formal permission from the department head, the dean of the college, and the dean of the Graduate School to transfer graduate -level course work. The department has the responsibility to accept or reject any number of transferred credits bas ed on such elements as whether the work fits into a logical program for a degree, if grades of A or B have been earned in the courses proposed for transfer, and any other elements it deems relevant. Credit granted for work done at another institution is te ntative until proved by satisfactory work in residence, and the department may also require work to be validated by examination. At the master's level, students must take at least 50 percent of the course work required for the degree from faculty of New Me xico State University to meet the residency requirements for their degree. Transfer credits must meet the same time -limit requirements (seven years) as graduate classes at accredited universities.

Doctorate Level At the doctoral level, students may transfer course work required for their master's degree. Transfer credits must meet the same time -limit requirements (seven years) as graduate classes from an accredited University. Graduate Certificate Students enrolled in certificate programs cannot transfer credits from another institution towards the completio n of the certificate program offered by New Mexico State University. However, they can transfer credits taken in a graduate certificate program of NMSU into a graduate degree program of New Mexico State University provided that the courses will lead toward s a graduate degree in the focused area of the certificate program. The number of transfer credits will be determined by the program of study. The time limit on course transfer is five years after the completion of the certificate. Masters of Fine Arts The department head and the graduate advisor before consideration for candidacy will determine the number of transferable credits from a previous graduate program. Specialist in Education Degree A maximum of 6 graduate credits earned at another approved institution may apply to this degree. Transfer credits must have been earned during the five -year period prior to completion of the specialist in education degree. Join Degree Program A student who is enrolled in a specially designated, pre -approved (by the graduate dean and the applicable academic college dean(s) joint program that leads to the student being awarded both undergraduate and graduate degrees may petitio n to have two graduate level courses (up to 6 credits) previously taken for undergraduate credit considered as transfer credits into the student's graduate degree program. To be considered for transfer credit, a course must have been taken by the student a s a junior or senior and prior written permission must have been received from the director of the applicable graduate program, the course instructor and the department head. In addition, only courses in which the student received a grade of ' B' or better will be considered for transfer credit. Credit can be transferred once, the student has been accepted into the graduate degree program. Senior Petitioner Program An undergraduate student who is in the last 15 graded credit s of a bachelor's degree program and who is completing all requirements for graduation, may take up to 6 credits of graduate level courses numbered from 450 through 598 for credit toward an advanced degree, with the approval of the appropriate academic dep artment, college dean and the graduate dean. These credits, however, can not be used to complete the student's undergraduate degree. The student must: 1. have a cumulative grade -point average of 3.0 or higher or have a grade - point average of 3.0 or higher in the last 45 credits completed 2. complete the Senior Petitioner Form at the Graduate School 30 days prior to registration 3. if accepted as a senior petitioner, the student must file a Senior Petitioner Course Form for each course by the deadline to ad d courses for the semester in which the course is to be taken and obtain approval from the graduate instructor, and the undergraduate advisor 4. register for the course at the Graduate School. The combined total of graduate and undergraduate courses for t he semester may not exceed 17 credits. Senior petitioners must consult with an admission's representative at the Graduate School. As a senior petitioner in a graduate program, the course(s) will become part of the graduate record and will not be used in th e calculation of the student's undergraduate grade -point average or credit hours. 20| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G LEAVING GRADUATE SCH OOL Leave of Absence/Continuous Enrollment Students working on advanced deg rees who plan an interruption in studies for a calendar year should address a request for leave of absence through their department head, alerting the dean of the Graduate School. The student must submit a formal letter through their department head to the Dean of the Graduate School. Email will not be accepted. The request should include the beginning date and the anticipated ending date for the period of absence. A graduate student on leave of absence will be expected not to use university facilities and place no demands upon the university faculty and staff, and, therefore will pay no fees. Time spent in leave -of-absence status will not be counted toward time limits. A graduate student who fails to register for one calendar year without obtaining a leave of absence from the Graduate School will be considered withdrawn from the university. For information on resuming studies after such absence, see Readmission. Administrative Withdrawal When an administrative withdrawal fro m a course is initiated for a student who is representing the university at an official out -of-town event, the withdrawal will become effective upon the return of the student to the university from that event or five class days after the signed drop slip a rrives in the dean's office, whichever is sooner. Military Withdrawal For special provisions consistent for military personnel, see the section on Military and Veterans Programs (MVP). Student Medical Withdrawal A medical withdrawal applies to a student who becomes seriously ill, injured, or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete an academic term for which they are enrolled. The attending physician must provide a letter on official let terhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student was under medical care and that the student must withdraw because of the medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year after the end of that term for which the withdrawal is being requested. Once the information is reviewed a determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or other refunds (Students receiving funds awarded b y the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University). At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins a t the Student Services Office. Withdrawal Due to Medical Conditions of a Family Member A student who must withdraw because of a medical condition of an immediate family member will need to sub mit a letter from the family member's attending physician on official letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student's immediate family member was under medical care, and confirm that the student must withdr aw to attend to the immediate family member's medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year after the end of that term for which the withdrawal is being requested. For purposes of this policy, \"imme diate family member\" includes spouse, a domestic partner as defined in the NMSU Policy Manuel 7.04 Domestic Partnerships, a child, parent or legal guardian, a sister or brother, a grandparent, or a grandchild. Such familial relationships created by law are also included (i.e. mother/father in law; half or step siblings); other relationships can be considered on a case -by-case basis. Once the information is reviewed a determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or other refunds (Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University). At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Office. Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an official procedure that must be approved as indicated on the withdrawal form. All such withdr awals will be registered on the student's transcript. It is the student's responsibility to initiate withdrawal from the university and to obtain necessary signatures. Students who leave without following the official procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. On the Las Cruces campus, withdrawal begins at the Registrar's Office. At all other campuses, withdrawal begins at the Student Services Office. Applicable dates are published on the approved university academic calendar or under important d ates at http://registration.nmsu.edu. Students who withdraw from all courses for the semester should do so in person through the Registrar's Office. Students who are unable to come in person may submit an e -mail using their NMSU e -mail account to registra@ nmsu.edu. A student who withdraws from all classes for the semester will retain access to their NMSU account per current policy but will lose access to other services and privileges available to enrolled students. Financial information concerning drops and withdrawals can be found at http://uar.nmsu.edu/withdrawals/. Financial Aid Recipients should contact University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services before withdrawing. Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University. The Federal Higher Education Act requires the University to calculate a Return of Federal Student Aid Funds for students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) from all classe s on or before the 60 percent attendance point in the semester. Using a pro -rata schedule, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student's earned versus unearned Federal student aid funds. The unearned portion of Fe deral student aid funds will be returned to the appropriate aid program(s). Students withdrawing from classes are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of Federal student aid funds. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT - EVALUATING YOUR ACAD EMIC EXPERIENCE New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learning environment. Assessment is a process of rigorous review f ollowed by implementation of changes to enhance and improve the quality of education students receive at NMSU. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of, and engaged in, assessment activities. Faculty and staff at NMSU will communi cate to students the value and implications of assessment. For their part, students will provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development. Students are expected to participate in all types of assessment when asked to do so. Types of asse ssment activities include class assignments, course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments will be published only in aggregate form. Efforts will be made to inform students of assessment results and the program improvements implemented as a result of assessment. PRIVACY RIGHTS The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98 -380), The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974:1974\": student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. Other information regarding disclosure of student data is p osted at the Registrar's Office in compliance with the act. Requests for withholding directory information must be filed in writing with the Registrar's Office. PURGING OF STUDENT F ILES All files of students who have attend ed NMSU Graduate School are kept for five years following final enrollment and then destroyed. Only archival documentation is retained. The files of students who do not enroll are destroyed after one year. TRANSCRIPTS An official transc ript is the University's certified statement of a student's complete NMSU academic record in chronological order by semester and year. It includes coursework, grades and degrees earned. Credit hours earned through transfer work are not listed in detail, bu t do appear as cumulative totals. GENERAL INFORMATION | 21 Transcripts are available as digitally -signed PDFs or printed copies. Transcripts can be ordered online at http://mytranscript.nmsu.edu. A fee is charged for each copy. No transcript will be released if the student is in d ebt to the university. The student name appearing on the transcript will be the same as it appears on the student's official NMSU records. Name changes are processed for current students only. Contact the Registrar's Office, registra@nmsu.edu, for addition al information. DISCIPLINARY ISSUES ACADEMIC PROBATION A ND SUSPENSION Academic Standing is based on both the student's semester GPA and cumulative GPA. Graduate Academic Probation I: A graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation I when a graduate student's semester GPA is above a 3.0 and the cumulative GPA drops below 3.0; or when the semester and cumulative GPA's drop below 3.0 and the previous academic standing is Graduate Regular Good Standing. Graduate Academic Probation II: Is issued when a graduate student semester GPA is above a 3.0 and the cumulative GPA drops below as 3.0 and the previous academic standing is one of Graduate Academic Probation I or Graduate Re - admit on Probation I. The student must maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or higher until the cumulative GPA reaches a 3.0 or higher at which time the graduate student is placed on Good Academic Standing. If the graduate student is unable to maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or higher and the cumulative remains below 3.0 GPA while under Graduate Academic Probation II, the student will then be placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate Academic Suspension: When a graduate student does not achieve a semester GPA of 3.0 or higher, and the graduate cumulative GPA remains below a 3.0 while under Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re -Admit on Probation II, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate students under Graduate Academic Su spension are barred from enrolling in graduate level courses at NMSU while under Graduate Academic Suspension. Graduate students on Graduate Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of one semester. Graduate students on suspension who wish to continue Gr aduate School after suspension must re -apply to the Graduate School and petition the Graduate Dean or College Academic Dean to be removed from Graduate Academic Suspension. At this time the graduate academic suspension status will be evaluated for possible removal. Should the suspension be lifted, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re - admit on Probation II until such time that the graduate cumulative GPA equals or exceeds 3.0. If you have questions about your academ ic standing, please contact the advising center or Graduate Dean's office. DISCIPLINARY PROBATI ON AND SUSPENSION Graduate students are subject to the rules and regulations with respect to disciplinary probation and suspension as listed in the Student Code of Conduct section of the Student Handbook (http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/) and in the Regulations section of the Undergraduate Catalog (http://catalog.nmsu.edu/). Graduate students who engage in academic mis conduct at any of the other campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. ATTENDANCE AND STUDE NT BEHAVIOR The i nstructor may report any absences to the graduate dean when the number of absences from class (including audited courses) is impairing the work of a student in a course. The graduate dean may drop a student from a class for persistent absence when such act ion is recommended by the instructor. Similarly, a student may also be dropped from a class for engaging in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class. Students making satisfactory progress in their classes will be excused from classes when they are representing New Mexico State University on a university -sponsored event (e.g., ASNMSU president representing NMSU at legislative session, student -athletes competing in NMSU -scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational field trips and conferences). Authorized absences do not relieve the students of their class responsibilities. Prior written notice of the authorized absence will be provided to the instructor by the sponsoring department. Only students who have enrolled in a class for credit or audit are allowed to attend classes. A student who has officially withdrawn from a course may continue to attend the course with the permission of the instructor for the remainder of the semester. Students not enrolled may visit cl asses only with the permission of the instructor. ACADEMIC CONDUCT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS Graduate students at New Mexico State University are expected to observe and maintain the highest academic, ethical and pr ofessional standards of conduct. Students should consult Section III of the Student Code of Conduct in the Student Handbook (http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/) for more specific information regarding the rules of conduct and definitions of misconduct. In th e event these standards of conduct appear to have been breached by violations such as plagiarism (consult the Library's Web page at http://lib.nmsu.edu/plagiarism), cheating, nondisclosure or misrepresentation of academic credentials, fabrication of data, or other forms of academic misconduct, the procedures set forth below shall be employed to resolve the issues. As mentioned before, graduate students who engage in academic misconduct at any of the other campuses of New Mexico State University, including A lamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana and Grants, are also subject to the Student Code of Conduct of NMSU. PROCEDURES TO DEAL W ITH CASES OF ALLEGED ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT IN GRADUA TE SCHOOL Policies and procedures for dealing with such cases are detailed in the in the Student Code of Conduct http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/. Questions concerning these policies and procedures should be addressed to the dean of the Graduate School. P rocedures include all course levels and all of the campuses of New Mexico State University, including Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Dona Ana, Grants and Las Cruces. GRADUATE STUDENT APP EALS BOARD Each academic year a standing committee, consisting of three members of the graduate faculty and two graduate students, is appointed by the dean of Graduate School to handle grievance complaints including grade appeals. Any graduate who believes that he or she has been unjustly treate d within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary in the following steps to resolve his or her grievance. In general, there are three levels at which a grievance can be addressed: a course instructor or advisor, a department head, or the dean o f the Graduate School. If the initial grievance is with an instructor or advisor, the process begins at Step 1. If the initial grievance is with a departmental committee, the process begins at Step 3. In all instances, the process must begin at the lowest possible level. 1. Under normal circumstances, the student should discuss the issue with the instructor/advisor. 2. If the student is unable to resolve the issue through consultation with the faculty member, the student must submit a written memorandum det ailing the grievance to the course instructor or advisor within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The person to whom the memorandum is addressed must respond in writing within ten calendar days to the student. 3. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1 -2, he or she must submit a written appeal to the department head within ten working days of the initial decision. If the student is initiating the appeal at the departmental level, he or she must do so, in writing, within ten calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The department head must respond in writing within ten working days to the student, the instructor or advisor (if one is invo lved), and the dean of Graduate School. 4. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1 -3, they must submit a written grade appeal letter to the academic dean's 22| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G office of the college where the course is taught. If it is a grievance agains t a faculty member, then the academic dean's office where the course is taught would be that of the faculty member's college. The student has ten calendar days after receiving the decision of the department head. The associate dean of the given college has ten days to collect the necessary documents to make a decision on the student's appeal or grievance. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. The academic dean's office w here the course is taught may convene an ad hoc committee to investigate the case. 5. If after the fourth step the student or any of the other parties involved is still not satisfied with the response, he or she must present to the dean of the Graduate Sch ool within ten working days a formal letter that provides specific details regarding the nature of the grievance. Copies of all documents including course materials and grades must accompany the letter. In the letter, the student can request that their cas e be presented to the Graduate Student Appeals Board. After receiving a letter complaint (not an email), the dean of the Graduate School will determine whether the complaint has merit. He or she will do so after reviewing the letters from the faculty membe r, the department head and the office of the academic dean as well as the materials from the student and all those involved in the case. If the graduate dean determines that the appeal does not have merit, he or she will inform the appellant and other part ies, in writing, within ten working days of receiving the appeal. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. If the graduate dean decides that the appeal does have merit, he or she will convene the Graduate Student Appeals Board, normally within three weeks. The Graduate Student Appeals Board will conduct, within 60 days of their convening, whatever investigations and deliberations are necessary, and will forward to the dean of the Graduate School a recommendation to resolve the grievance. 6. After reviewing the recommendation of the Graduate Student Appeals Board, the dean of Graduate School will, within ten working days, inform all parties involved of his or her decision in writing. 7. The dean of the Graduate School may waive the normal time frame for grievances when either party presents compelling evidence justifying such a delay, but grievances must be launched within one year. Grade appeals involving charges of plagiaris m must follow the process established on academic misconduct in the Student Code of Conduct., the web site is http://studenthandbook.nmsu.edu/. The Graduate School strongly encourages students to study and use the Plagiarism web site of the Library to lear n of ways to avoid plagiarism: http://lib.nmsu.edu/plagiarism. GRADUATION REQUIREME NTS APPLICATION FOR DEGR EE (DIPLOMA) Degree candidates are required to file an Application for Degre e and pay graduation fees for each degree sought. This fee ($25 for certificates and $35 for graduate degrees) will be included in the total cost for the semester or session in which the candidate anticipates completing degree requirements. If degree requi rements are not completed during the semester or session, the student must reapply and pay the appropriate fees. The Application for Degree form is available online through the MyNMSU website. It must be completed and submitted by the designated deadline f or that semester. A $25 late fee applies to applications received after the application deadline, and no applications will be accepted after the posted deadline date. A student must specify choice of catalog as indicated under Graduation Requirements. The latest date for substitution or waiver of required courses for candidates for degrees is two weeks after the last date of registration for regular or summer terms. ATTENDANCE AT COMMEN CEMENT The academic colleges will con firm eligibility to participate in the commencement exercises held at the close of the fall and spring semesters. Eligible candidates (registered for final degree requirements, as certified by the college deans) and degree recipients from the previous summ er session will participate in the fall ceremony. Students who complete degree requirements in the spring must attend the spring ceremony. Commencement is a symbolic ceremony. Participation in commencement does not, in itself, mean that a student is consid ered an NMSU graduate. In order to be awarded a degree, a student must fulfill university requirements as determined by academic colleges. The degree will reflect the graduation date from the application for degree in which all degree requirements were det ermined by the academic colleges. DIPLOMA Diplomas will be mailed to graduates approximately eight weeks after final grades have been processed by the Registrar's office, concluding a final degree audit by the individual Colleges. The diplo ma will be mailed to the address specified on the degree application, unless an address change has been requested before the end of the semester. The name on the diploma will reflect the student's current official NMSU records. Name changes are processed o nly for currently admitted students. The degree title and major(s) will be printed on the diplomas, in accordance to the degree application award, determined by the academic colleges. Academic honors will also be printed on the diplomas below the degree an d major(s). All fees and bills owed the university must be paid in full before a student may receive a diploma or transcript of credits. RESEARCH FACILITIES The University recognizes and supports the concept of off -campus study and research as a valuable experience for graduate students. These experiences may take the form of internships, intensive study of specialized techniques with personnel at other institutions, and conducting research at specialized research facilities. Arr angements for such off -campus activities should be made with the student's committee and the graduate dean and should represent opportunities not normally available at this university. When the bulk of a student's research is to be conducted off -campus, bo th on - and off -campus advisors should be appointed and periodic meetings with the student's committee held to ensure timely progress. Such opportunities offer students considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable contacts between the stu dent, the university, industry, and research institutions. Students are encouraged to pursue these opportunities with their advisors and the graduate dean. AGRICULTURAL EXPERIM ENT STATION The Agricultural Experiment Station is the research division of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences. Faculty, professional personnel, and graduate students conduct basic and applied research concerned with biological, physical, and economic phases of food and fiber production, processing, and distribution; consumer health and nutrition; and the social and economic aspects of rural living. Energy, environmental, and natural resource conservation aspects of these broad disciplines offer many opportunities fo r the graduate student to undertake meaningful research investigations in both the laboratory and the field. There are eight departments on the main campus with excellent laboratory facilities for research. In addition, the station maintains 13 field resea rch centers including eight agricultural science centers, a forestry research center, a livestock research center, an animal insect lab, and two research ranches. The station provides financial support to graduate research assistants and cooperates with re search institutes at the university and with various state and federal agencies in providing opportunities for graduate research programs covering a wide scope of student interests.

Satisfactory progress and regular class attendance are expected of such students. If a veteran receiving benefits is suspended for academic reasons, benefits are terminated and will be restored only after readmissi on to NMSU. If the university has liability claims filed against it as a result of a veteran failing to meet compliance requirements of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the university will not release any academic records on the veteran until such time as the veteran has reimbursed the federal government for funds drawn in violation of those requirements. A student receiving VA education benefits who is pursuing a degree program offered by New Mexico State University should adhere to the curriculum of that program. Failure to do so will result in the student being certified for less than full-time status or becoming liable for an overpayment.

The department has programs in plant sciences, environmental science, soil science, water management, natural resources management and turf management. Students traine d in these areas are in demand for U.S. and international positions. This demand is at all levels of training -BS, MS, and Ph.D. Therefore, the course work and original research in Plant and Environmental Sciences leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy are designed for and have proven to be successful in preparing students for commercial companies, educational institutions, governmental agencies and private production enterprises. The student may emphasize study in several discipline areas described in the following pages. The agronomy section emphasizes sustainable crop production, plant -pest/disease/weed interactions, soil -water -plant relations, crop physiology, and breeding and genetics of cotton, alfalfa, maize and peanuts. The genetics section places special emphasis on genetic basis of agronomic or horticultural traits, applied bioinformatics, gene regulation and genomics. The environmental and soil science sections emphasize environmental quality and ecosystem services, bioremediation , recycling of organic wastes and wastewater, water use efficiency, soil -plant relations, soil -geomorphology and desert ecology, and the fertility, chemistry, physics, and microbiology of soils, including forest soils. The horticulture section emphasizes t he creative use of plants by humans, and studies on the technical advancements in the husbandry of most economic commodity groups of fruits, vegetables, or ornamentals as well as managed turf. Emphasis may be in breeding and genetics of chile or onions, pl ant growth and development, nutrition, dormancy and cold hardiness, plant stress (water and/or salinity) response, fruit and vegetable physiology, forestry, and turfgrass. Most students will be expected to complete a thesis. The research detailed in a thes is should be of a scope and quality to merit publication in a refereed journal. Depending on prior training and experience, a non -thesis option is available subject to approval by a departmental committee. The non -thesis option requires 40| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G completion of a res earch project and paper of limited scope. In both the thesis and non -thesis options, suitability of the research project and resulting thesis or paper will be judged by the student's graduate committee. A minor is recommended and may be taken in chemistry, biology, molecular biology, environmental management, applied statistics, toxicology or other areas. Prerequisite to major graduate work is completion of a curriculum essentially equivalent to that required by the department for the BS degree at New Mexic o State University. Qualifications for admission will be reviewed by the departmental graduate faculty. Applications should include a letter of interest. A 3.0 undergraduate grade -point average is needed for admission to study for the MS degree and a 3.3 grade -point average for Ph.D. studies. The department requires the GRE scores and three letters of recommendation, transcripts, as well as the student's letter of interest as an admission requirement. Acceptance requires that a graduate faculty member in th e applicant's area of interest accept the student into their program. A student planning a program leading to a Ph.D. must satisfy one of the following departmental requirements approved by the doctoral committee: 1. A thorough knowledge of a language othe r than English 2. A reading ability in two foreign languages 3. Reading ability in one foreign language and proficiency with a research tool 4. Reading ability in one foreign language and one semester of supervised teaching experience 5. Proficiency with a research tool and one semester of supervised teaching 6.

A major need exists to train the next generation of water resource researchers, educators, and managers to address these challenges, both inside and outside New Mexico. To help meet these needs, an interdisciplinary p rogram in Water Science & Management (WSM) has been developed at NMSU by the departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business, Animal and Range Science, Civil Engineering, Geography, and Plant and Environmental Sciences. The primary purposes of the interdisciplinary masters and doctoral degree programs in WSM are to provide graduate education for addressing state, national, and international water issues, and to train the next generation of water professionals needed to meet the challenges no ted above. A Master of Science WSM degree can be earned with 26 credits of formal course work, plus additional thesis research credits, and a Doctor of Philosophy WSM can be earned with 30 -40 credits of formal course work beyond the masters, plus additiona l dissertation research credits. Five (5) fields of study are offered in the program and are detailed below (suggested classes for each area are detailed in the following section): Agricultural Water Resources relates to the major use of ground and surfa ce water in providing safe and secure food systems while ensuring ecosystem services. This field of study includes water allocation, water conservation and water management issues facing urban water supply and irrigated agriculture. Watershed, Riparian a nd Aquatic Systems includes the processes of organizing and guiding land and other resources used in a river basin to provide desired goods and services without adversely affecting soil and water resources. Watershed, riparian, and aquatic system managemen t involves an array of nonstructural (vegetation management) practices, as well as an array of structural (engineering) activities, when conditions warrant. Water Quality and Treatment includes processes used to make water acceptable for desired end -uses . These can include use as drinking water, industrial processes, agricultural uses and environmental management. The goal of water treatment processes is to remove existing contaminants in the water or reduce the concentration of such contaminants so the w ater becomes fit for its desired end -use. Water Economics and Policy examines the demand for water by all its competing uses, including irrigated agriculture, energy, urban supply, and environmental restoration and management. Policies are examined for t heir influence on water supplies, water demands, and economic values of water reallocations among agricultural, environmental, energy, and urban users. It examines the role of water markets, water user decisions, institutional adjustments, and water -COLLEGE OF AGRICULTU RAL, CONSUMER AND ENVI RONMENTAL SCIENCES | 41 relat ed policies with respect to resource costs, water quality, profitability, and environmental effects. Water Informatics is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and especiall y the dissemination of water information, including both human and machine readable documents. Examples of human readable documents include maps, field data sheets, operational schedules, and long term asset management plans with narrative text. Machine r eadable documents include files for geographic information systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), relational database management systems and emerging applications.

Further details can be found in the on-line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/). With the advisor's consent, the student may instead complete a coursework -only Master degree; this requires 36 credits of regular course work, satisfying the same re quirements listed above, except that the 6 credits of thesis or project are replaced by 9 credits of courses numbered 550 or above and distinct from C S 589, C S 598, and C S 599. Students pursuing a coursework -only degree are expected to complete an oral exam covering a selected subset of the students' plan of study. Further details can be found in the on -line Graduate Handbook (http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/) COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 51 5-YEAR DUAL DEGREE BS+ MS PROGRAM The dual degree program co mbines some of the requirements of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science(BS) and the Masters of Science (MS) in Computer Science. Full details of the program can be found at http://www.cs.nmsu.edu. It is very important for the student to apply to the BS+MS program before they take any 400 -level C S courses. Admission occurs in two steps. First, students will apply to the Computer Science department to receive approval for the BS+MS program. The student submits the pre -application when he/she is within 48 credits of earning a BS in Computer Science; an application form is provided in the department web site. Qualification for the BS+MS program will be based on the cumulative (non -grade replaced) grade point average in Computer Science and Math courses t aken to that point, including at least two out of C S 370, C S 371, and C S 372 (at least 3.5) and recommendations by faculty members listed on the departmental application. Additional factors might be taken into account when available (e.g., TOEFL/IELTS s cores, GRE scores). Students having a grade point average below 3.5 may be admitted on a case -by-case basis, depending on faculty recommendations and evaluations of the individual academic and professional history. Once the Computer Science department has notified the applicant of acceptance in the combined BS+MS program, the applicant must then formally apply to the graduate school (prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate) for formal admission to the graduate program; this application to the graduate school is made during the semester of graduation from the BS in Computer Science. REQUIREMENTS The curriculum for the first three years of the BS+MS program coincides with the requirements of the BS program. In particular, the general requirements include a grade of a le ast a C - in each course to satisfy the departmental and non - departmental requirements. No course may be counted as satisfying both a departmental and no -departmental requirement. No course taken to satisfy either a departmental or non -departmental requirem ent may be taken S/U. The following are the departmental requirements for the degree (the non - departmental requirements are identical to those of the BS in Computer Science).

DEG REE: DOCTOR OF PHILO SOPHY MAJOR: COMPUTER SCIE NCE Doctoral students may specialize in any of the areas in which computer science faculty members have active research interests. Through in terdisciplinary arrangements with other doctoral departments at New Mexico State University, doctoral students may also specialize in such areas as computational biology, computer networks and architectures and cognitive science. Doctoral students are expe cted to join the program with a preparation equivalent to that required for the Master's degree in computer science at New Mexico State University. The requirements for the degree are as specified in the NMSU graduate catalog, with the following additional considerations: The qualifying examination consists of written exams in five subject areas: four of these are required areas, while the fifth is an elective area. The student will take four exams in the following required subjects: Operating Systems or Computer Architectures; Principles of Programming Languages; Design and Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures; and Discrete Mathematics. The topics of each exam are listed on the departmental website. The student is required to enroll in an elective course offered in the first semester of his/her enrollment at NMSU, which identifies the fifth subject for the qualifying examination. The faculty in charge of the class will determine the exam topics of the elective subject. The student is required to take the qualifying examination at the end of the first semester of enrollment as a doctoral student at NMSU; the only exceptions will be granted to students entering the doctoral program with significant undergraduate deficiencies -in such case the deadlin e 52| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G for the qualifying examination will be indicated in the admission records. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that the qualifying examination is taken within the prescribed deadline. Students failing to meet the deadline will be automatica lly withdrawn from the doctoral program. If a student fails any of the exams, he/she must retake those exams in the following semester. If a student fails to pass all exams after the second attempt, he/she will be dismissed from the doctoral program. The comprehensive examination evaluates depth of knowledge in the specific research area selected by the candidate with the consent of his/her graduate committee. It includes: a written part, in the form of an extensive survey paper; an annotated bibliography ; and an oral examination. The student is required to submit and defend a prospectus, at the same time or after completing the comprehensive examination. The prospectus describes and motivates the specific research problem to be addressed in the doctoral dissertation. A PhD student is required to take at least one course each in the following three areas (foundations, systems, or applications): GRADUATION REQUIREME NTS Foundations C S 510 Automata, Languages, Computability 3 cr.

The programs are designed to prepare students both for diverse careers in the public sector and for further training at the doctoral level. The MPA program is accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), a distinction held by fewer than one - quarter of MPA programs nation wide. The MPA program offers joint degrees with the Department of Criminal Justice (MPA/MCJ) and with the Department of History (MPA/ MA in Public History). Students in a joint degree program can earn two master's degrees with fewer credits than would be r equired to earn those degrees independently. Admission Prospective graduate students in either the MA or MPA should demonstrate a 3.0 grade point average for the second half of their undergraduate course work. For students with a GPA of less than 3.0, GRE scores are required, though this requirement may be waived if the undergraduate degree was awarded more than five years before applying. Applicants to either program are required to submit an application online. See instructions at: http://prospective.nmsu .edu/graduate/apply/index.html. Applications include three letters of recommendation, a writing sample, and a personal statement concerning their interest in pursuing a graduate degree. Additional information concerning program requirements and the admissi on process can be obtained from either the department's MA chair or MPA director. Under exceptional circumstances the department may exempt students from the minimal requirements. Application for admission to the Graduate School should clearly indicate the program in which the student wishes to enroll. Applications for admission to the MPA program are reviewed twice a year, once in the Fall semester and once in the Spring semester. Students interested in a joint degree option must apply and be accepted in t o the two departments separately, and indicate their interest on their applications in one of the joint degree programs. General Requirements Students in both the MA and MPA programs select either a thesis or non -thesis option. Students planning on continu ing their studies in a doctoral program or wishing to establish expertise related to a specific career objective are strongly encouraged to select the thesis option. The non -thesis option is suggested for students desiring immediate employment or seeking t o enhance their current employment situations. Course work outside the department must have prior advisor approval to ensure a well -integrated program of study. Complete information on the requirements for either program should be obtained directly from th e department. Most MA and MPA courses are offered in the evening. DEGREE: MASTER OF AR TS MAJOR: GOVERNMENT The MA program provides general course work in each of the major fields of political science .

In addition, 6 of the 24 Math credits must be from the following list of courses: Alge bra (MATH 582), Complex Analysis (MATH 591, MATH 592), Differential Equations (MATH 531, MATH 532), Logic and Foundations (MATH 557, MATH 585), Probability and Statistics (STAT 562, STAT 571), Real Analysis (MATH 593, MATH 594) and Topology (MATH 541, MATH 542). 4. At most 6 credits of individual study courses such as MATH 540 may be used to fulfill the course requirement. 5. MATH 511 through MATH 516, and MATH 563 through MATH 569 may not be used to fulfill any of these requirements. 6. The student's progr am of study must be approved by the departmental Graduate Studies Committee. 7. The student must successfully complete a final master's examination. The Master's Final Examination The Master's final examination is an oral examination administered by the student's committee and covers the student's coursework. The student's committee consists of at least three departmental members and a Graduate faculty member from another department who serves as the Dean's representative. If the student has a minor area o f study, then a member must come from the minor department. The examination is restricted to course work presented in the student's program of studies. When a master's thesis has been written, the master's final exam will be in part an oral defense of the thesis and in part a general examination of the candidate's course work. The oral exam must be completed at least 10 days prior to the end of the semester in which the candidate wishes to receive the degree. DEGREE: DOCTOR OF PH ILOSOPHY MAJOR: MATHEMATICS Candidates for the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Mathematical Sciences must pass a qualifying examination, three comprehensive written examinations, a basic mathematical reading knowledge test in a language other than English, a comprehensive oral examination, a series of courses, and a final oral doctoral thesis examination. These are briefly described below. For more information, see the Graduate School requirements in this catalog, and t he Mathematics Graduate Student handbook at www.math.nmsu.edu. Qualifying examination: Every student admitted to the Ph.D. program must complete the Ph.D. oral qualifying examination. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strengt h or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. Students who complete their mathematics master's degree at NMSU may request, at the time of applying for their master's oral final examination, that the Mas ter's examination also fulfill the Ph.D. qualifying examination requirement. In all other cases, towards the end of the student's first semester in the Ph.D. program, the student and his or her advisor will convene an oral examination with three examiners, the examiners being the advisor and some of the student's current or past instructors. As a result of the Qualifying examination, the department will take one of the following actions: (1) admit the student to further work toward the Ph.D.; (2) recommend that the student's program be limited to a Master's degree; (3) recommend a reevaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester; or (4) recommend a discontinuation of the student's graduate program in mathematics. Written comprehensive e xaminations: Candidates for the Ph.D. degree must pass written comprehensive examinations in three of the seven areas of algebra, complex analysis, differential equations, logic and foundations, real analysis, statistics and topology. To ensure adequate br eadth, a combination of three comprehensive examinations must include real analysis, and at least one of algebra and topology. The seven examinations are based on the following comprehensive examination sequence courses: Algebra (MATH 525, MATH 581, MATH 5 82), Complex Analysis (MATH 517, MATH 591, MATH 592), Differential Equations (MATH 518, MATH 531, MATH 532), Logic and Foundations (MATH 504, MATH 557, MATH 585), Real Analysis (MATH 527, MATH 528, MATH 593, MATH 594), Probability and Statistics (STAT 562, STAT 571), and Topology (MATH 541, MATH 542). Full time students should complete the comprehensive written exams in the first two years. Those who have not made substantial progress towards completion of their written exams at the start of the fifth semes ter may be removed from the program. Students who have not completed the written exams by the start of the sixth semester will normally have any departmental funding revoked. Exams are offered every August and January. A student must register to take exams in the semester prior to taking the exams. A student has three consecutive examination periods to complete the written comprehensive exam requirements (Example: if s/he starts in August, s/he has the August, January and August examination periods to compl ete the exams). This does not extend the time limit mentioned above. Students will normally not be given more than two attempts at any one exam. Course requirements: Before graduation, a student must pass a total of four comprehensive exam sequences, but needs to take the comprehensive examinations in only three of them. In addition, a student must pass four more (one -semester) MATH/STAT courses from the seven comprehensive exam sequences listed above. A student may pass any of the four comprehensive exami nation sequences before enrolling as a Ph.D. student, but the four additional courses have to be passed after enrolling as a Ph.D. student. The following courses will not count towards the course requirements: Any course below MATH 501, MATH 511 through MA TH 516, and MATH 563 through MATH 569, MATH 540/STAT 540, MATH 598/STAT 598, MATH 599, MATH 600, MATH 700. Students and advisors are encouraged to consider further courses beyond this minimum. Foreign language examination: The department requires that each Ph.D. student pass a basic mathematical reading knowledge exam in a language, other than English, relevant to the student's research interests. This exam is coordinated by the student's advisor and consists of the open -dictionary written translation into English of a mathematical text of interest to the student. The language requirement must be fulfilled prior to the oral part of the Ph.D. comprehensive examination. Oral Comprehensive Exam: The student must take this exam at the end of the semester after c ompleting the written comprehensive exams. The student should present a proposed direction for thesis work. Final Oral Exam: This should be an exam over the student's thesis and administered by the same committee of the oral comprehensive exam.

Integration of this knowledge into the conte xt of complex living tissues interacting with the environment is the ultimate goal. This requires that the expertise from many diverse traditional disciplines be directed along converging experimental lines. The Ph.D. program in molecular biology is design ed to facilitate an interdisciplinary approach to graduate research, utilizing both traditional techniques and the latest advances in biotechnology, including the extraordinary power of recombinant DNA methodology. Participants in this program will take co re courses in biochemistry, molecular biology and cell biology. Subsequent course work will be tailored for the individual student, depending upon his or her research emphasis. Participation in regular seminar programs will be expected to provide students with the widest possible scientific background. Financial aid, in the form of a limited number of MB teaching and research assistantships, is available on a competitive basis. Research Assistantships may also be available from individual faculty within the Molecular Biology (MB) program. Only the most competitive students are admitted with assistantship support. The MB program offers curricula leading to the MS and Ph.D. degrees in the areas of biochemistry, molecular genetics, molecular biology, cell biolo gy, bioinformatics, and microbiology. Admission to the MB Program without deficiency is based on an undergraduate program essentially equivalent to that pursued by an undergraduate major in chemistry, biology, agronomy, horticulture, biochemistry, or micro biology at this university. An entering student is required to complete the Graduate Record Examination (General Aptitude). Undergraduate deficiency courses must be passed with a minimum grade of B. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact at least th ree individual program faculty before applying to identify a prospective advisor and laboratory in which to pursue graduate research. Previous course records and GPA standings (typically minimum of 3.3/4.0), GRE scores (typically minimum of 300 combined verbal and quantitative), TOEFL scores of foreign applicants (typically minimum of 550 on the paper -based or 213 on the computer -based), a letter of interest from the applicant that identified faculty laboratories of interest, and three letters of reference regarding research performance or potential are weighted heavily during the selection process. Students with a BS degree in one of the disciplines listed above can expect to earn the MS degree in about 30 credits, including at least 6 credits of thesis research. The Ph.D. degree can be earned in about 30 to 40 credits of formal course work, plus additional thesis research credits, for a minimum total of 75 credits beyond the BS Because research is central in both the MS and Ph.D. curricula, early selection of a research advisor is required. Ph.D. degree candidates will successfully complete a written and oral qualifying examination based on their proposed research and the subject matter in the core courses (below) at the end of the first year of study. Also at this time, the master's or doctoral committee is organized to assist in planning a program appropriate to the background and goals of the student. Ph.D. candidates will subsequently complete a comprehensive written examination and oral examination appro ximately at the end of the second year of study. A final, formal presentation and oral defense of the original research documented in the MS or Ph.D. thesis completes the degree requirements. The Molecular Biology program also offers formal minors in molec ular biology or bioinformatics. The molecular biology minor consists of 10 credit hours including MOLB 545; either MOLB 520 or MOLB 542; any of the tier II courses; and one MOLB 590 seminar. The bioinformatics minor is jointly offered with the Department o f Computer Science and consists of 9 credit hours for Master's students and 12 credit hours for Ph.D. students, including MOLB 452/GENE 452, and additional courses selected from those listed at http://research.nmsu.edu/molbio/. The courses selected will de pend on whether the student is majoring in a biological or non -biological science and include courses from the graduate Computer Science and Molecular Biology curricula. Please inquire with the Molecular Biology Program office for the most recent requireme nts for the bioinformatics minor. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Phase I Core Courses MOLB 520 Molecular Cell Biology 3 cr.

Admission to these programs is competitive and selection of applicants is based on undergraduate and/or previous graduate grade -point averages, performance on the general and subject Graduate Record Examination, other evidence of prior academic and research accomplishments submitted by the applicant, and references, as well as, in the case of applicants for the doctoral program, matching of the applicant's research interests, as described by the student's statement of purpose, to the Department's research activities. All degree -seeking graduate students mu st satisfy the relevant Graduate School requirements, pass a qualifying examination based on undergraduate physics courses at the 400 level, successfully complete a 3 -credit, 500 -level laboratory, and demonstrate or develop knowledge of computer programmin g. Additional course requirements are described below; courses taken S/U may not be used to satisfy any of the degree requirements, including the lab requirement for Master's and Ph.D. students. The qualifying and comprehensive examination outcomes are dec ided by vote of the entire faculty, based on the recommendations of the corresponding examination committees. For the qualifying examination, the faculty may decide that a student pass at the doctoral level; pass at the master's level; be requested to reta ke the exam at the next available opportunity; or terminate graduate study. For the written part of the comprehensive examination, the faculty may decide that a student be given an unconditional pass; be given a conditional pass, with the requirement that the student produce additional evidence of research accomplishments during the oral part of the exam before being granted admission to candidacy; repeat the written part the next time it is offered; or terminate graduate study. In addition, the faculty may decide to discontinue financial support to a student based on the student's performance on the qualifying or comprehensive examination. Students will receive written notification of the exam's outcome from the Graduate Physics Program Head within 30 days of the exam. Appeals must be addressed to the Physics Department Head within 30 days of receiving written notification of the exam's outcome and will be decided by the physics faculty. A student granted an unconditional or conditional pass on the written p art of the comprehensive examination must take the oral part in the same semester that the written part was taken; the student's Ph.D. committee makes the final decision, following the oral part of the comprehensive examination, on admission of the student to the candidacy to the doctoral degree. Students may choose areas of emphasis from a variety of experimental, theoretical and computational research programs in the department. The current major research areas of the department include atmospheric physic s, condensed matter physics/materials science, geophysics, optics, particle and nuclear physics, physics education, and others. These research projects are supported by multimillion -dollar funding by various federal agencies and two national laboratories w ithin the state of New Mexico: Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. In addition to the in -house research, the department conducts collaborative research programs with the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Center for Integrated NanoTechnologies, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory, Fermilab, Air Force Research Laboratory and other national and international laboratories. The MS in Physics with a concentration in Space Phy sics program provides students with a strong foundation in physics with an intensive focus on space physics. Graduate study in space physics at the master's level prepares graduates for continued and specialized study toward the doctorate program in space -related fields as well as for challenges they will confront in space industrial and government settings. The department is housed in a newly -renovated building which contains research laboratories, classrooms, offices and a computational laboratory. DEGREE : MASTER OF SCIENCE MAJOR: PHYSICS For the master's degree, students must also successfully complete or transfer at least 30 course credits and pass a final oral examination or the doctoral comprehen sive examination. Of these 30 credits, at least 21 must be in physics/geophysics, at most 3 may be for individual study or other informal courses, at most 6 may be for a thesis, and at most 9 may be numbered between 450 and 499.

DEGREE: MASTER OF AR TS MAJOR: SOCIOLOGY The Southwest and Border Region Our unique location attracts faculty who are interested in peoples of the southwest, particularly Hispanics/Latinos and American Indians. In addition, our proximity to the U.S. -Mexico border provides an ideal laboratory for the examination of such issues as gl obalization, transnational migration and the consequences of border development. Social Inequality Our faculty members examine the intersection of race, class and gender oppression in their teaching and research, with special attention to educational, rura l/urban, ecological and global disparities. One goal of this examination is to address social problems such as poverty and racial/ethnic inequality. The program is designed to prepare students for doctoral study in sociology and for employment in research and applied areas of the field. In addition to the on - campus program, we offer an online MA for students who are geographically distant from the NMSU main campus or who have full time jobs. Through small seminars, on campus graduate students engage in disc ussions of subjects that often result in thesis and internship topics. Regardless of course format, faculty members and students work toward the mutual goal of developing each student's full potential. Students seeking a master's degree in sociology should have taken one undergraduate course each in methods and statistics or their equivalent. Students who have not taken these courses should complete them before beginning their graduate study, or as soon as possible, in consult ation with an academic advisor. Program Options and Requirements Graduate students in sociology have two program options, thesis or non -thesis. Faculty consider the students special interests and career plans in advising regarding their choice of program options. The thesis option is ty pically selected by students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree, while the non -thesis option is commonly pursued by those desiring immediate employment in research and applied areas in government, education, social welfare and health. The non - thesis, cour sework only option is currently the only option available for on -line MA students. All students must pass a final master's examination. Thesis Program Requirements In addition to the successful completion of an acceptable master's thesis, students who choo se this option will take a minimum of 36 credit hours of graduate work distributed as follows: SOC 501, SOC 551, SOC 552, SOC 553 (12 credits total), to be taken within the first 27 hours of graduate credit. A grade of B or better is required to receive credit for each of these core courses. SOC 599 (6 credits) Thesis 18 credits of additional 500 level Sociology course work to be taken in consultation with the sociology graduate student's advisor. 66| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CATALO G Final master's oral examination covering all general coursework and the thesis.

Students will be advised upon their formal acceptance into the program. MAJOR: SPANISH The Degree Pla n The degree plan requires a minimum of 36 credits in Spanish, of which at least 30 must be earned at the 500 level, and the remainder above the 450 level. The courses should be concentrated in the student's chosen area of study (linguistics or literature) as each student will be tested on a reading list that corresponds to each area study. A thesis is optional. Students authorized to complete a thesis may count a maximum of 6 credits of thesis work toward the degree. At the present time, the thesis option is not available for online -only students. There are no required core courses at this time and a student should work closely with his/her advisor and the Graduate Director to establish an appropriate individual degree plan. All students in either the on -campus or online program may complete a minor at the master's level by taking 9 credits (3 courses) at the 500 level or above, in another area (department) of study, or within the department itself. For instance, a student studying linguistics may wish to ob tain a minor in literature or a student studying literature may wish to obtain a minor in linguistics. In either case, the minor credits count as part of the 36 total credits required for the degree. In all cases, the student should work closely with the G raduate Director to ensure his/her particular plan of study is acceptable to the program.

Courses that may apply to either area include SPAN 590 (see subtitles in schedule of courses to confirm subject of the course) SPAN 598, SPAN 599 (both courses require a course proposal and prior approval). Additional Language Requirement For both the on -campus and online degrees, the department requires that students fulfill a second language requirement (in addition to English and Spanish) by following an approved cou rse of study. Typically, this is completed by taking a four -semester course of study, but may vary according to the languages available. Options for completing this requirement include taking classes at a local Community College or University, or online. S ome students have met this requirement by studying abroad through NMSU. Students should consult the Graduate Director to establish a plan and discuss how this requirement will be met. Note: evidence of fulfilling the second language requirement must be provided to the Graduate Director BEFORE taking final examinations. English Language Requirement International students are required to demonstrate proficiency in English and meet all international admissions requirements prior to beginning their program of study. Please see the section of the Graduate Catalog on international admissions requirements and scores required for either the TOEFL or IELTS exam. Note: evidence of fulfilling the English Language Requirement must be provided to the Graduate Director AN D the Graduate School BEFORE taking final examinations. Final Examinations Students must successfully complete a final department examination (generally during the final semester of coursework) that is partially written and partially oral. Please consult t he Graduate Director for specific information on dates and format for these exams. Final examinations are only available during the Fall and Spring semesters. Areas of Interest/Reading List As stated previously, each student needs to select an area of inte rest Linguistics or Literature. At the end of the student's degree, the final examinations (written and oral) will be based on the readings from the readings list in the student's selected area of study. For example, a student that has opted to specialize in literature is responsible for reading all the materials on the Literature Reading List. Likewise, a student that has opted to specialize in linguistics is responsible for reading all the materials on the Linguistics Reading List. The student is respons ible for the reading list that was in place the year he or she started the program. Each student is responsible for covering the reading materials listed. Please contact the Graduate Director for a detailed reading. Note that the list is dated, so make sur e to refer to the correct list that covers the year/semester the student started the program. The student is responsible for covering ALL the readings even if the student did not cover them as part of work done in class. Graduate Assistantships For the on -campus program only, the department awards graduate assistantships to qualified students. For this financial assistance, the student works up to 20 hours a week in departmental programs, chiefly in the teaching of elementary and intermediate Spanish course s in either the Heritage Language sequence or Spanish as a second Language sequence. Students interested in being considered for an assistantship should clearly state this interest in their introduction letter during the application process. The department offers a limited number of assistantships, and students should remember that not everyone that applies for this award receives one. Maintaining the award depends on the student's successful performance both academically and in the classes he/she teaches a nd is evaluated on a semester -by-semester basis. Students who receive an assistantship are required to take SPAN 594 (see course description) as part of their degree plan in order to help them prepare for teaching classes at NMSU. 68| NEW MEXICO STATE U NIVERSITY 2016 -2017 GRADUATE CAT ALOG Dean James Hoffman Associate Dean (Academic Programs) Kathleen Brook Associate Dean (Research) William Gould Assistant Dean (Development) Anthony Casaus MBA Academic Advisor John Shonk ACCOUNTING M.

DEGREE: Master of Acco untancy MAJOR: Accounting MINOR: Information Systems MASTER OF AC COUNTANCY MASTER OF ACCOUNTANC Y (MACC) The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous expansion in the k nowledge base required for accounting professionals. The business environment has become increasingly complex, as evidenced by the growth in the body of national and international accounting and auditing standards, taxation, SEC and other regulatory requir ements. The accountant must also be well versed in communications and analytical skills, computer -based information systems, professional ethics and global issues. Neither the traditional four -year accounting program nor the MBA provides the educational br eadth and depth necessary to fully prepare students for the demands now imposed by many accounting careers. The major objective of the Master of Accountancy (MACC) program is to provide for these increased educational needs and to prepare students more ade quately for careers as professional accountants in financial institutions, government, not -for-profit organizations and public practice. The program is designed to provide a technical and theoretical foundation in accountancy at the advanced level and yet allow the student to take courses to accommodate individual needs. The MACC program is recommended for those students wishing to fulfill the 150 - hour education requirement which most states, including New Mexico, have legislated as a requirement for taking the Uniform CPA Examination. Graduate assistantships are available for a limited number of qualified students. Interested persons are urged to apply well within the deadlines set by the Graduate School. Inquiries should be addressed to the Master of Accou ntancy Director. Admission requirements of the Graduate School must be met before the applicant may be admitted to the Master of Accountancy program. Consideration for admissions to the Master of Accountancy program is dependent on an applicant's undergrad uate record and score on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). Specifically, an applicant's undergraduate GPA is multiplied by a factor of 200 and the result is added to his/her GMAT score. The required total is 1100. Applicants scoring between 1 000 and 1100 will be admitted to the program only with approval of the MAcc Admissions Committee. The minimum acceptable GMAT score is 400. An acceptable score on the GMAT should be submitted at least one month prior to the student's first enrollment unles s the student meets one of the GMAT waivers listed below. In addition to the aforementioned entrance requirements, an applicant's GPA in 7 upper division accounting prerequisites must be at least 3.0. For those students not receiving their undergraduate ac counting degree at NMSU, it is expected that substantially all of the accounting prerequisite classes be from an AACSB accredited business school or the application will need to be approved by the MACC Admissions Committee. In this case the Admissions Comm ittee may require that some of these prerequisite courses be retaken at an AACSB institution such as NMSU. All grades, including those from the first attempt at repeated classes, will be used to compute upper division accounting prerequisite grade point av erages to determine admission to the graduate program. At the suggestion of any faculty member, the MACC Admissions Committee will review the application of a student whose potential might not be accurately reflected by this calculation. GMAT Waivers: The GMAT requirement is waived for those who: 1. Are graduates of an undergraduate program in accounting from a US AACSB accredited business school with at least a 3.25 GPA overall and a 3.25 GPA in their eight upper division accounting courses; or 2. Are grad uates of NMSU's undergraduate accounting program with at least a 3.25 GPA overall and a 3.0 GPA in six core upper division accounting classes; or 3. Hold a post baccalaureate degree (such as MBA, MS, MA, JD) from an approved, AACSB -accredited US university with a minimum 3.0 GPA in graduate course work. Candidates for the Master of Accountancy degree who have an undergraduate degree in accounting must successfully complete a minimum of 30 graduate credits. Qualifying NMSU undergraduate accounting students c an apply to have two graduate courses count for their undergraduate program as well as their graduate program. Candidates with an undergraduate degree in a field other than accounting must complete additional prerequisite work dependent upon previous cours es taken. In any case, all candidates must present or fulf ill the following requirements: FOUNDATION COURSES These courses are required of every student unless they can be waived. As a general policy, the courses upon which waivers are claimed must have be en taken within seven years of enrollment in the program with a grade of B or better. A final decision regarding a waiver is based on an evaluation of each student's total educational and professional background. The following is a list of these courses (for a description of these courses, see the New Mexico State University Undergraduate Catalog) ACCT 221 Financial Accounting 3 cr. ACCT 222 Management Accounting 3 cr. BCIS 338 Business Information Systems I 3 cr. BCIS 485 Enterprise Resource Planning 3 cr. BLAW 316 Legal Environment of Business 3 cr.

ACCOUNTING AND RELATED PREREQUISITES (21 CREDITS) In addition to the foundation requirements, each student must present or complete the equivalent of an undergraduate major in accounting. This requires, at a minimum, 21 credits of accounting above the elementary level. No coursework applied toward the MACC degree, including the foundation requirements and the undergraduate accounting prerequisites, may be taken on an S/U basis. MACC CORE AND OTHER COURSES (30 CREDITS) Core Courses: Each student must complete 21 credits in accounting courses numbered above 520. These courses must include a research class (either ACCT 555 or ACCT 564) and Ethics in Accounting (ACCT 559) unless a student has already taken an equivalent course. In addition, three of the credits may be in upper division undergraduate elective accounting courses numbered 450 or higher. Other specific courses to be completed by each candidate will be determined in the advisement process. Other Courses: All students must complete a total of 9 additional credits in other courses. Three of the credits must be ACCT 510, Technical and Professional Communication for Accou ntants, the rest must be from the approved list of electives or a waiver must be received to take a course not on the list. Neither ACCT 503 nor any course fulfilling the foundation requirement may be included. Any student wishing to be waived from any of the above requirements may submit a petition in writing to the MACC Director. Each request will be considered individually by the MACC Committee. The Graduate School requires that students maintain a grade -point average of at least 3.0 in all courses taken as a graduate student, as well as a 3.0 grade -point average in all graduate courses taken as a graduate student at NMSU. The Department of Accounting and Information Systems requires, in addition, that every candidate for the MACC degree maintain at least a 3.0 grade -point average in all accounting courses used to satisfy the core and elective course requirement. MACC students may not retake 500 -level accounting courses for which they have previously received a grade without approval of the MACC Admissions Committee. COMPREHENSIVE EXAMIN ATION Satisfactory performance on a comprehensive examination is required for the degree. Thesis: No thesis is required; however, under special approval, a candidate may elect to write a thesis under ACCT 599. Up to 6 credi ts may be earned for the thesis. Admission to Master of Accountancy Class registration in any Accounting course numbered above ACCT 503 requires 1. prior full admission to the MACC program, or 2. prior consent of the Director of the MACC program. MINOR: INFORMATION SYSTEMS This minor is for master's -level students who are not in the Masters of Business Administration (MBA) program. Students in the MBA program may choose a specialization in Information Systems (see the Bu siness Administration section below). To obtain a graduate minor in Information Systems (IS) students must satisfy the requirements as stated in the Graduate Catalog for a minor at the master's level. For it to appear on the transcript, the student must li st the minor on the Program of Study and Committee for Master's Student (Application for Admission to Candidacy) and have it signed by the head of the department offering the minor.

Course work in the graduate program includes: water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste systems design, environmental chemistry, environmental microbiology, environmental contaminant analysis, industrial pollution control, fate and trans port of pollutants in engineered and natural systems and water quality in surface water and groundwater systems. Additional topics of interest to the students are covered through special topics classes and by courses taught outside of the College of Engine ering. MAJOR: ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING The MS program requires either a thesis or a non -thesis practice oriented experience. The non -thesis option is designed for students that are working full time in engineering practice, but is also available to other students interested in pursuing a non -thesis option. The thesis option consists of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours, including 6 credit hours of thesis. Students who are working full time in engineering practic e may apply for the non -thesis option. This option consists of 30 semester credit hours of which up to 3 credit hours can be awarded for a professional engineering design experience (ENVE 590) and up to 6 credit hours can be awarded for an engineering prac ticum (ENVE 598). Transfer credit for courses taken elsewhere is evaluated on an individual basis. Up to six semester hours of graduate level courses taken may be used to satisfy MS degree requirements provided that the credits were not used toward another degree. REQUIRED CURRICULUM The graduate environmental engineering program of the CAGE department expects all MS and Ph.D. students to meet certain requirements in pursuit of an advanced degree. Some of these requirements are related to the quantity, leve l and quality of coursework. This Graduate Catalog details what is expected as a minimum for graduation, but it is up to the student and his/her advisor and graduate committee to determine the plan of study for the student. The student and his/her advisor will create this program of study in the first semester of graduate work. Students desiring to work toward an advanced degree in environmental engineering must have completed undergraduate preparation similar to that required for a Bachelor of Science degr ee in an ABET accredited engineering program or must have adequate background, as determined by the graduate faculty of the program. The program administrator will approve exceptions to these requirements. The environmental engineering faculty will form a committee for every entering student. The faculty will evaluate the student's record and determine which deficiencies and/or core courses, if any, are needed by the student. For all professional non -thesis programs, the department head will review the comm ittee's decision. In order to provide consistency among plans of study for graduate students and to set a minimum set of core or pertinent courses, it is the policy of the graduate environmental engineering program that each graduate student will fulfill t he following course requirements (or equivalent).
