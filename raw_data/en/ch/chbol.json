What is in Italian Seasoning If you have a grocery store that carries bulk spices, buy them there. You can also get bulk spices sometimes at restaurant supply stores. As you make your Italians seasoning again and again, you can play with the amounts and add in more or less according to your tastes. - Basil: This is spice has a balance between sweet and savory, with hints of mint, anise, and pepper. - Oregano: This is a strongly aromatic herb. - Rosemary: It has a sage-like, peppery flavor - Marjoram: milder flavor than oregano and tastes similar to thyme. - Thyme: It has a sharp, almost minty flavor. It is earthy with floral hints and is a little bit sweet and a little bit peppery.

Storing Homemade Italian Seasoning This mix is quick and easy to make, so you'll want to store it properly so it lasts a long time, and stays fresh. The beauty of dried herbs is that as long as they are in a tightly sealed jar or tin, they can keep for a really long time. Even up to 2-3 years sometimes. They don't mold or spoil like fresh herbs can. You will know they are no longer good when they are no longer aromatic. To ensure the longest and freshest herbs store away from heat and light which will cause them to lose their flavor and smell faster. If you keep spices in a spice rack on your counter keep far enough away from the stove to prevent heat damage. For this Italian seasoning simply add the seasoning to a sealed jar or container. This seasoning will last 6 months or more in a sealed jar stored in a dry, cool area away from direct sunlight. Italian seasoning does not need to be refrigerated. More Italian Recipe to Try!
