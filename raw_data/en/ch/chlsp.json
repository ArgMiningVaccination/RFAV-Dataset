Dr. Mercola Berberine and MicroPQQ Advanced boosts your energy from the inside out, starting with your cells! Bonus: it stimulates a healthy metabolism too!* Let's go back to your high school science class to see the simple science behind this [ metabolic supplement](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/sports-fitness/weight-metabolic-function/). (Remember rocking those cheek marks from wearing science goggles? We're going to learn about your cells without those oh-so-stylish indentations!) Mitochondria are considered the powerplant of a cell because, well, quite simply, they produce cellular energy! When your cells are energized, that power radiates outward so your whole body is fueled with energy. And you know what energy means: non-groggy mornings, more time with the people you love, and more energy for the activities you enjoy! However, as we count more birthdays, our mitochondria age too. They may suffer from minor damage or mild mutations that impact how well they produce and store energy. Eventually, our cells get clogged with a buildup of poorly functioning mitochondria. As a result, there is less space for new mitochondria. And that means less energy! But here's the secret behind this science lesson: If you can help your cells remove the old mitochondria, your cells will regenerate new ones. And that's a good thing because fresh mitochondria are associated with a healthier, longer life.* But can you properly fuel your mitochondrial health? That's why it's vital to take a [ metabolic function supplement](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product-category/sports-fitness/weight-metabolic-function/) like Dr. Mercola Berberine and MicroPQQ Advanced!
