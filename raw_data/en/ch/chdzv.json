Guidelines for Student Requests for Reasonable Accommodation on the Basis of a Learning Disability 1.

Even when parents are involved in requesting services, it is primarily the student's responsibility to initiate the request. 2. A newly accepted or currently enrolled student whose learning disability requires reasonable accommodation may make a request for accommodation at any time. Because the arrangements for some accommodations take a significant amount of time, the student should make a request as early as possible.Nondiscrimination Policy9University of Jamestown, founded in 1883, is a non-sectarian, independent four-year college known for integrating the liberal arts and the professions in a Christian environment.Nondiscrimination Policy 3. To be considered as a student with a learning disability under the law, the individual is responsible to provide relevant written documentation that substantiates his or her claim.

Homesteading began in 1868, and Texas cowmen moved longhorn cattle to great open-range spreads in that portion of the territory known as \"Little Missouri Country.\" By 1872 the Northern Pacific Railway had reached Jamestown. In the part of the territory that is now western North Dakota, a French nobleman, the Marquis de Mores, ranched and built a meat packing plant; another Frenchman, Pierre Wibaux, started a ranching operation that was to become the largest in the United States; and a young man from New York, Theodore \"Old Four Eyes\" Roosevelt, began a career that was to take him to the White House. Amid this excitement and growth, dedicated Presbyterian settlers met to discuss the founding of a college. The first liberal arts college in the area, University of Jamestown was incorporated in 1883 and chartered in 1884 under sponsorship of the Presbyterian Church, which recognized its responsibility to \"promote the progress of our divine religion and to maintain and improve Christian citizenship, believing that these objects cannot be attained without the proper education of our youth under Christian influences.\" The first classes at University of Jamestown began in September of 1886, three years before North Dakota became a state. By the end of the University's second year, eighty-two students were pursuing degrees under the tutelage of five professors. Physical facilities were meager and circumstances difficult on the open prairie. The college hill had only one building and a barn for horses. Wood stoves furnished heat and oil lamps provided light. The extremely cold winter of 1886 contributed to the onset of economic problems. After closing during the financial panic of 1893, the University was reopened in 1909 by the North Dakota Synod under the leadership of President Barend H. Kroeze. Dr. Kroeze was to set in motion forces that would allow the University to grow and prosper as it \"encouraged the development of an educated Christian citizenship\" and sought \"to offer a liberal culture combined with moral training.\" The current 110 acres of wooded land the campus now occupies bears little resemblance to the bleak site upon which the founders stood and pondered the future of their own lives and that of a fledgling college. Today, University of Jamestown overlooks a progressive city of sixteen thousand people which offers a variety of recreational facilities and warm hospitality. Modern facilities now grace \"College Hill,\" including the architectural prize-winning Raugust Library, which houses more than 150,000 items; Larson Lifetime Sports Center; Seibold and Prentice residence halls; Lyngstad Center, a modern classroom facility; the Reiland Fine Arts Center, with its exceptional concert/performance hall; the state-of-the-art Unruh and Sheldon Center for Business and Computer Science; the Ed and Elaine Nafus Student Center; the Foss Fitness Center; the newly remodeled Liechty Center-Taber Hall; and the new 21,350 square foot McKenna Thielsch Center. The College has also recently completed a 13,350 square foot building in Fargo to house the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program. Only the University's objectives have remained unchanged. These are reaffirmed in our goal of academic excellence in a Christian environment and in our determination to equip our students to face new problems and challenges in a changing world. Those General Information12objectives are realized not only through a quality faculty and curriculum but also through outstanding facilities and co-curricular programs, such as athletics, choir, and drama. We believe a Christian environment is crucial to the educational process. It provides discipline to the development and freedom of the mind and imparts a spiritual dimension of hope and grace. University of Jamestown and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) have an historical relationship, and they maintain their relationship by a covenant agreement to support one another in their respective missions. Our size and location in a small North Dakota community facilitates our mission to provide students with meaningful individual guidance and support by competent and concerned faculty. That is the essence of the quality liberal arts education. The Mission of the University Throughout its more than one hundred- year history, University of Jamestown has consistently stood for academic excellence and Christian principles in all that it does. Catalogs published by the University from the very earliest years declare the commitment of this institution to the highest and best. The current values and mission statement of the University are included below: Mission Statement We are a community dedicated to the development of wholeness in our students. We adhere to a curriculum of academic excellence which balances the ideals of the liberal arts tradition and sound professional preparation. Our Christian tradition encourages an atmosphere of self-discipline, responsibility, and concern for the continuing growth of the individual.Foundational Values As an institution of higher education in the Presbyterian tradition, we celebrate God through the use of our minds and the exercise of reason, believing that God is the source of all truth. \"You shall love the Lord our God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind\" (Matthew 22:37). Our Christian and Reformed tradition embraces the liberal arts and the ongoing search for knowledge and truth as a way of liberating the human spirit and of understanding the world we share with others. University of Jamestown promotes education as a means to improve lives, search for vocation, and create lifelong seekers of truth and wisdom. We value the life of the mind and the life of the spirit and therefore hold that faith and reason reinforce each other and that through mind, heart, and hands one can honor God and serve humanity. Historically, this strong belief that learning and the search for truth are closely connected to faith formed the basis for the Presbyterian Church's early and significant commitment to higher education. As a result, prior to the Civil War, one-fourth of the colleges in the United States were Presbyterian. In 1883, when the Presbyterian Church extended its mission into the Dakota Territory's frontier, University of Jamestown was founded in a newly incorporated city ninety miles west of Fargo. University of Jamestown is a fully independent, self-governing institution that shares an historic relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA). We are proudly non-sectarian and welcome students of all faiths and beliefs. Our Latin motto, \"Lux et Veritas,\" proclaims to all that the pursuit of truth lights our journey today as it has since 1883.General Information13General Information Accreditation, Approvals, Memberships, and Affiliations University of Jamestown is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association.

North Dakota Academic Scholarship and North Dakota Career and Technical Education ScholarshipAdmission, Costs, and Financial Aid Two academic scholarship opportunities are available for high school seniors. These scholarships were authorized to encourage and reward high school students for taking more challenging course work in preparation for college and to prepare them for entering the workforce. The amount of each scholarship is $750 per semester based on full-time enrollment in an accredited North Dakota higher education institution. Full-time enrollment for these scholarships means enrollment in at least twelve credits during a student's first two semesters and enrollment in at least fifteen credits during the semester thereafter. The scholarships are renewable provided the student maintains a 2.75 grade point average. The student may be eligible for up to $6,000 within six academic school years. The application deadline is June 7 th. Student Work Programs Federal Work Study Federal Work Study is a need based work program that offers part-time employment to students and is subsidized by the federal government. Positions are assigned to eligible freshmen, but thereafter students are expected to secure their own positions through appropriate supervisors. Work awards may be limited by funds available as well as by individual student need in combination with other financial aid awarded. University of Jamestown Work Program A limited number of part-time positions are available to students who do not qualify for the Federal Work Study program.22Loan Programs Loans allow students and parents to borrow money to meet educational costs at relatively low interest rates. In most cases, repayment is delayed until graduation or an enrollment status of less than six credits. Additional information regarding all loans below is available in the Financial Aid Office and on the college website. Federal Direct Loans Federal Direct Loans are available to all students who have completed the FAFSA and are otherwise eligible. Direct Loans are characterized as subsidized or unsubsidized based on the FAFSA in combination with other financial aid awarded to the student. The federal government pays the interest on a Subsidized Direct Loan during the student's enrollment whereas the student is responsible for paying interest on an Unsubsidized Direct Loan. At the borrower's choice, the interest on an Unsubsidized Direct Loan can either be paid during enrollment or can be capitalized. A borrower must complete Direct Loan Entrance Counseling prior to the disbursement of any loan proceeds. The maximum annual loan amounts for dependent students are: Freshmen $5,500 (maximum of $3,500 subsidized) Sophomore $6,500 (maximum of $4,500 subsidized) Junior and Senior $7,500 (maximum of $5,500 subsidized) Repayment begins six months after the borrower is no longer enrolled at least half time. The annual interest rate is 4.66% for the 2014-2015 award year, and capped at 8.25 percent. Federal Perkins Loan The primary factors in determining eligibility for the Perkins Loan are financial need as reflected by FAFSA results and availability of funds. The maximum per borrower is $5,500 per year. A borrower must complete Perkins Loan Entrance Counseling prior to the disbursement of any loan proceeds. Repayment and accrual of interest on new loans begin nine months after borrowers are no longer enrolled at least half-time. The annual interest rate is currently fixed at five percent. Minimum monthly payments are $40. The maximum repayment period is ten years. Cancellation and deferment provisions are available for certain types of employment, service, and other circumstances. Details are available in the Financial Aid Office and/or from the University of Jamestown Loan Coordinator. Federal Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Parents of dependent students may borrow funds through the PLUS program. Eligibility requirements include U.S. citizenship and an approved credit rating. Repayment generally begins sixty days after the second disbursement, but may be deferred upon request. Alternative Loans The University of Jamestown will certify any alternative education loan that a student requests (up to the student's cost of attendance). Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress is language set forth in federal guidelines. It specifies the minimum academic progress required for a student to continue to Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid23participate in federal and state financial aid programs. The University of Jamestown has adopted similar guidelines for institutionally funded programs. Student progress is monitored by the Financial Aid Office at the University of Jamestown after every semester, including summer school. To demonstrate Satisfactory Academic Progress for financial aid purposes, all students must comply with the following three components: 1. Qualitative: First time students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 1.8 until the end of the second academic year, at which time, they must maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. Students transferring into or returning to the University of Jamestown after a period of non-attendance will be required to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 without regard to number of semesters attended elsewhere. 2. Pace or Quantitative: All grade levels must complete (with a 'D-' or higher) at least 67% of all attempted credits. This ensures that the student will complete the program of study within the maximum timeframe. 3. Maximum Timeframe or 150% Rule: The maximum timeframe for an undergraduate program is measured in credit hours and is a period that is no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the educational program. The usual number of credits required for graduation is 128 credit hours at the University of Jamestown. However, some programs may require extra semesters to complete the degree so will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Financial Aid Officer and/or designated committee. In general, a student becomes ineligible for federal, state and institutional aid when s/he reaches 192 attempted credits. Monitoring Procedure The first semester that a student fails to comply with satisfactory academic progress guidelines by either qualitative or pace calculation, a status of FINANCIAL AID WARNING is assigned. No appeal is required by the student. The otherwise eligible student will be entitled to financial aid for one additional semester. The student will be notified by letter and by email of such action. Should a student fail to make progress after a semester on FINANCIAL AID WARNING but (1) has successfully appealed and (2) has been notified that aid has been reinstated, will be assigned the status of FINANCIAL AID PROBATION and an ACADEMIC PLAN is created for the student. ACADEMIC PLANS will be created by the Financial Aid Office, in consultation with the Registrar, using a standard format and formula to determine how many semesters it would reasonably take any student to regain compliance both qualitatively and quantitatively. The student's advisor will be notified of the plan. If the student's APPEAL is denied after any semester or if a student chooses not to appeal, the student is no longer eligible to receive financial aid until such time as compliance has been regained. Any charges that the student incurs during this period of SUSPENSION are the personal responsibility of the student. Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid24Additional Information A detailed Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is available on the University website or in the Financial Aid Office. Only official forms will be accepted for appeals. All forms may be found on the University website and are also available in the Financial Aid Office. The Financial Aid Committee will strictly adhere to the stated deadline for appeal. Attempted credits include all courses taken for which a student receives a grade or 'W'. Attempted credits also include those taken during terms in which the student receives no aid as well as repeated courses and credits transferred into the University of Jamestown from other institutions. Repeated courses will be counted only once for the total number of credits completed. However, both sets of credits will be counted toward the 150% Rule. The highest grade will be used to determine GPA. Incompletes must be finished in a timely manner as determined by the Registrar. Action with regard to Satisfactory Academic Progress will be held until the prescribed period has elapsed.Admission, Costs, and Financial Aid Return of Federal Title IV Aid and Institutional Refund/Repayment Policy The University of Jamestown has adopted a policy for institutional refund/repayment that complies with the federal Return of Title IV Funds regulations. A student is considered enrolled for attendance purposes until he/she has officially withdrawn from the University of Jamestown (see Official Withdrawal page 40) or until the end of the semester, whichever is first. The minimum amounts to be returned to Title IV programs are calculated according to federal guidelines. Detailed information is provided to each student with his/her financial aid award letter every year and is available upon request in the Financial Aid Office as well as on the University website. Consortium Agreement The United States Department of Education requires that a written consortium agreement exists between two federally eligible institutions whereby a student desires to take courses at the student's non-degree granting institution. When a consortium agreement is deemed necessary, the financial aid administrators of the two institutions will sign an appropriate agreement. All transcripts for courses taken on a consortium agreement will be transferred to the University of Jamestown at face value.25Student Activities University of Jamestown strives to offer a wide variety of opportunities for students to become engaged during this time in college. Events include dances, athletic events, convocations, concerts, clubs, and more. Among the major social events are New Student Orientation, Homecoming, Family Weekend, and Jimmie Jive Week.

All residence hall regulations are based on an attempt to balance the concern for the individual with the concern for the community. Each residence hall is staffed by a resident director and/or assistant resident director who oversee general residence hall living and who work closely with the resident assistants to develop optimum living conditions for all residents. Transcripts Transcript requests must be submitted in writing at least one week prior to the date needed. Either a completed transcript request form or a letter bearing the student's signature is acceptable. Federal law does not permit the University to honor requests for transcripts made by telephone or by relatives or friends of the student. A request for a transcript of credits by a student who is in debt to the University will not be honored until the debt has been paid. The first transcript issued is free of charge. Thereafter, a fee of $5 per transcript is charged. The written request by the student, accompanied by a check or money order payable to the University of Jamestown, if applicable, should be sent to the Registrar's Office, University of Jamestown, 6086 College Lane, Jamestown, ND 58405. Transcripts can be requested online through the National Student Clearinghouse for an additional $2.25 per transcript. Each transcript includes the student's entire academic record to date.

Academic Advising The academic advising program allows students to explore and develop educational plans appropriate to their life goals and aspirations. All incoming freshmen are registered in Journey 101. The course is designed to familiarize first-year students with University of Jamestown and college life in general. The course places particular emphasis on assisting students to \"look inward\" and to evaluate their strengths in order to help them to form clear educational goals and a sense of vocation. After the fall semester of the freshman year, students may declare a major and are then reassigned to a faculty advisor in their major area of interest. This is another opportunity for students to receive personal guidance as they progress in their educational plans. Advisors are available to assist in the planning of class schedules and the selection of concentrations within a department. This also enables students to develop an ongoing relationship with faculty members. Learning and Academic Advising Center The Learning and Academic Advising Center offers assistance to students who have not yet declared a major or who need further help in the development of suitable educational plans, the selection of appropriate classes, or the evaluation of academic progress. The Learning and Academic Advising Center strives to promote student development by helping students to identify and assess alternatives and consequences of their educational plans and decisions. This center also provides students with the unique opportunity to receive peer tutoring free of charge. Peer tutors are available to assist students in most subject areas. Students experiencing academic difficulty may consult with the director of the center to develop a plan to help them achieve their academic goals. Consultation on advising concerns and assistance in reading skills, study skills, and time management are also available.

Student Conduct Admission to the University of Jamestown constitutes agreement that applicants will abide by the rules and regulations of the University. Policies and programs are directed toward assisting students to develop a maturity that allows them to work and think as free individuals within a community. Specific University regulations may be found in the Student Handbook, which is distributed to each new Student Activities, Services, and Conduct30student in the fall. Additional copies are available from the Student Affairs office or on the University's web site. Smoking and Tobacco Use University of Jamestown strives to provide an atmosphere conducive to the physical and mental well-being of its employees, students and visitors. To support this atmosphere, the University of Jamestown is a Tobacco Free Campus. This policy applies to all employees, students, visitors, and contractors. The policy also applies to external individuals or companies renting space with the University of Jamestown and should be reflected in all agreements/contracts with such individuals or companies. The use of electronic (e-cigarettes) is also prohibited. Alcohol The use of alcohol on campus or at student University functions is prohibited. Under North Dakota law, alcoholic beverages are prohibited to anyone under twenty-one years of age. Procuring alcoholic beverages for a minor is a felony offense. The University and the Law The University upholds municipal, state, and federal laws and cooperates fully with all law enforcement agencies. Violation of public law may result in University disciplinary action. As a part of the larger community, students accept full responsibility for their own actions under federal, state, and local laws. While affording reasonable aid to its members in difficulties with the law, the University provides no immunity from the consequence of illegal acts. Academic Integrity Policy At the University of Jamestown, we operate in an atmosphere of mutual trust between and among instructors and students. Sometimes this trust is violated through the intentional or accidental misrepresentation of facts, ideas, or data by members of the academic community. Such misrepresentations are violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. There are three main types of violations: cheating, inappropriate collaboration, and plagiarism. Cheating involves the misrepresentation of knowledge or experience. For example, if students use unauthorized materials during an examination (for instance, by using crib sheets, looking at other students' exams, obtaining the questions in advance, and so on) they are falsely representing themselves as having recalled material or reasoned correctly, when, in fact, they did not. If students fake the data in a laboratory experiment, they are falsely suggesting that they acquired information in accordance with prescribed procedures. Inappropriate collaboration involves presenting academic work as one's independent effort when it includes significant elements of the work of others. When important ideas or actual phrasings in an academic work belong to an unnamed colleague, misrepresentation has occurred. It is dishonest for one student to write some or all of another student's paper or presentation. It is equally wrong for one student to develop key ideas for a project that is represented as the work of another. Inappropriate collaboration is a violation for which both or all parties will be held accountable. Plagiarism involves both theft and cheating. When someone appropriates, for use in formal course work, the wording, phrasing, or ideas of another, and either accidentally or intentionally fails to acknowledge the debt, it is considered theft. Student Activities, Services, and Conduct31Plagiarism is also cheating in that one is creating a false impression about one's own intelligence, ability, and achievement. If students are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, they should seek help from their instructors and refer to appropriate handbooks. Disciplinary Process It is the responsibility of every member of the University of Jamestown community to maintain the integrity of the grading system; anyone with knowledge of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy must report this information to a faculty member, a member of the university staff or administration, or the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs. All cases of academic dishonesty must be reported to the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs, who will maintain records on each student who has committed a violation of the policy. Students who violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the University of Jamestown will be subject to disciplinary action. A course instructor who suspects a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy should inform the student or student of his/her suspicion and present him/her with the evidence, allowing the student an opportunity for rebuttal. Upon determination of a violation, the course instructor will decide the penalty to be imposed. Depending on the severity of the infraction, this may involve a requirement to complete the assignment again, failing the student for the assignment, or failing the student for the course. If a dispute arises between a course instructor and a student about whether a violation has been committed, it is referred Student Activities, Services, and Conduct to the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs for resolution. If the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs determines that no question exists, the appeal process is terminated. If any question remains, the Dean may refer it to the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate about the commission of an offense will be final in all such cases. If a student involved in a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy is not enrolled in a particular instructor's course, as in a case of inappropriate collaboration, the instructor should inform the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs of the case for appropriate disciplinary action. In the case of multiple violations of the Academic Integrity Policy by a student, the Vice President/Dean of Academic Affairs may impose additional sanctions, which may include academic warning, academic probation, academic suspension, or expulsion. If any question remains, the Dean may refer it to the Executive Committee of the faculty for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the faculty will be final in all such cases.32Classroom and Residential Buildings The University of Jamestown campus offers a unique architectural blend of both old and new.

General examinations and subject examinations are administered on campus by appointment. Inquiries should be directed to the Career Center Assistant in Raugust Library 110. Students may not repeat by CLEP exam a course previously taken unless this is specifically approved by the department chair in that discipline. For more CLEP information go to www.collegeboard.com/CLEP Directed/Independent Studies Directed and independent studies are non-classroom programs of study, arranged for and undertaken by a student under the supervision of a faculty member and at the discretion of that faculty member. Such studies must be judged to be of substantial weight, equal to or exceeding the merit, time, and attention given to a classroom course of equivalent credit. The purpose of these studies is to allow a student to do research beyond what is offered in the normal curriculum or to assist a student in resolving a serious scheduling conflict outside of his/her control that cannot be resolved by other means. Directed and independent studies are subject to the following requirements:1. Contact hours: A directed study must have scheduled faculty-student contact hours equal to at least one third of the contact hours of a classroom course of equivalent credit. Contact hours for an independent study are at the instructing faculty member's discretion. 2. GPA: A student taking a directed study must have a GPA of at least 2.75. A student taking an independent study must have a GPA of at least 3.5. 3. Class standing: Students taking directed or independent studies must have completed at least twenty-four college semester credits. 4. A student who has received a D or F in a course may not take a directed or independent study in order to replace the grade for that course. International Study For many years, the University of Jamestown students have pursued academic programs at approved foreign universities during the summer terms, semesters, or during entire years. The courses are selected by the student with the University's approval and resulting credits are accepted toward a degree and major requirements. The University of Jamestown is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), one of the largest student exchange organizations in the world. Students attending an ISEP member institution have access to more than 150 study sites in Africa, Asia, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, Oceania, South Pacific, and the United Kingdom for a full academic year, a semester, or a summer program. The ISEP program provides the opportunity to become immersed in a foreign culture, earn credit towards a degree at the University of Jamestown, make friends in a host country, and meet students from all over the world. Students involved in the ISEP Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations38exchange program pay the same tuition, room and board costs that they would pay at the University of Jamestown. Federal and most other forms of financial aid can be applied toward participation in ISEP. The Irish-American Scholar Program, open to all majors, provides semester and full academic year options for study in Northern Ireland. www.presbyteriancolleges.org/irishamericanscholars.htm Contact the Career Center Assistant in Raugust Library 110 and see www.isep.org for more information on the ISEP program. Experiential Education Experiential Education includes field experience such as internships and cooperative education, job shadows, volunteer work, consulting projects, and practicums. Experiential Education is campus- wide in scope and available to all students regardless of major. Interns are placed with a site supervisor willing to provide training and supervision. Interns receive valuable on-the-job training while earning college credit, and in some cases are also paid. Work assignments must be relevant to the student's major program of study and relate to the student's educational and professional goals. Students may participate in the program in the fall or spring semesters or during the summer months which would enable them to work full-time at the site. Students have access to local, regional, national, and international contacts for internship opportunities through resources in Career Services and the Experiential Education Office, and on the Career Center web site: www.uj.edu. The Career Alumni Network, alumni and friends of UJ, provides contacts for job shadows and information regarding interviews. International students seeking curricular and optional practical training should consult the Career Center Director. For more Career information, contact the Career Center Director located in Raugust Library. Career Education The following one-credit courses, offered by the Career Center are designed to help students develop sound career planning and job search skills: EE 100-1 Intro to Experiential Education Introduces students to job shadows and observations, internships, consulting projects, study/intern abroad, and volunteer/community service projects. Students participate in community service projects of their choice. Fall and spring CE 101-1 Career Decision Making An overview of the world of work, career exploration, and career testing. Appropriate for students who are deciding on or exploring career choices for their major. Spring EE 300-1 Internship Preparation Students learn about internships, locate sites, prepare application materials, develop interview skills, and visit with current/past interns. A non-credit internship preparation seminar/self-study is also available. Fall and spring EE 350 Internship Provides a pre-professional practical learning experience in an appropriate work environment that will benefit the student and the organization. The course is structured to integrate classroom and work site learning experiences relevant to the student's educational and career objectives. One to eight credits. Fall, spring, and summer CE 401-1 Job Search Skills This course will give a broad overview of activities involved in an effective job search. Seniors only. Fall and spring Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations39EE 450 Consulting Students apply the theoretical foundations of their studies to a practical situation. Student teams assist businesses and organizations in areas designated by the project contact. The student consulting team is usually assigned to each project for eight to sixteen weeks and receives two to four credits. Fall, spring, and summer Honors The Dean's List of Outstanding Scholars The dean's list of outstanding scholars includes all full-time students who at the end of any given semester earn a grade point average of 3.50 or better with a minimum of twelve semester credits, exclusive of \"Pass\" credits. College Fellows A limited number of outstanding junior and senior students are selected each year by the faculty for the distinction of College Fellow. Recipients are to be of exemplary character and must possess an overall cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better as well as a grade point average of 3.50 or better in their majors. Fellows may tutor or teach under the direction of their department chair(s) and hold rank just below that of college instructor. Distinction in Degrees Scholastic excellence is recognized with diploma designations as follows: Latin Honor Minimum GPA Summa Cum 3.50 The honors-level grade point average must be maintained on both the University of Jamestown credits attempted and the cumulative grade point average, including all transfer credits.Honors Program The student honors program at the University of Jamestown offers gifted seniors the opportunity to explore a particular topic in-depth under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. Those students whose cumulative grade point average is 3.6 or better may apply for admission to the honors program during the second semester of their junior year. Honors project proposals must be submitted no later than the end of the first full week in April. All proposals, which constitute application for admission to the Honors Program, are subject to the approval of the Honors Committee. Once admitted, students commit themselves to work on their Honors Program projects throughout the senior year. Students must register for the honors project with the department chair, using the course number 499-Honors Program. Successful completion of an honors project will involve the production of a substantial research paper and its oral defense. Recognition of a completed Honors Program project will be given by the University on the student's official transcript and at commencement. Students whose final products are of \"A\" quality will receive six hours of credit and will graduate with departmental honors noted on their transcripts. In other cases, students whose final projects are B quality will receive six hours of credit for directed study, but no honors. Students whose work at the end of Semester I shows little promise of completion at the B level or better will receive an appropriate grade for directed study but will not be allowed to proceed with the honors study. Work in the Honors Program will be above and beyond the requirements for the student's major(s) and typically will be confined to topics within the major, although exceptionally gifted students may be permitted to do interdisciplinary work. The honors Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations40program is under the administration of the Honors Committee, which includes faculty members drawn from various divisions of the University. Interested students should contact their advisors or the academic dean for further information regarding the program. Honor Societies Students who qualify may join honor societies that have chapters at the University of Jamestown. Current honor societies are Alpha Chi (academic), Alpha Mu Gamma (foreign language), Lambda Pi Eta (communication) Phi Lambda Theta (education), Psi Chi (psychology), and Sigma Theta Tau (nursing). Academic Regulations Attendance The participation of students in all regularly scheduled classes is considered an important part of the academic procedure. It is assumed that students will conscientiously fulfill this responsibility when classes are scheduled and will contribute to class activities. An instructor may consider irregular attendance in his/her evaluation of students' educational achievement. Students are responsible for ascertaining attendance requirements for each course in which they are enrolled. Specific policies related to excused and unexcused absences can be found in the Student Handbook. Additional copies of this may be obtained by contacting the director of student housing. Grades Tentative grades are reported at midterm to assist students in gauging their effort for the remainder of the term. At the completion of each course the student is given a grade: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or P for passing work; I for incomplete work; and F for failure. The grade \"incomplete\" is given only at the end of a semester in which the student for justifiable reasons in the opinion of the professor is unable to complete the course. If an incomplete course is not completed within four weeks of the next resident semester after the grade was given, or if an incomplete course is not completed within one semester by a student not in residence, the grade will be that which the professor submitted based on the assumption that the student received failing grades or zero points for all uncompleted work. Exceptions to this rule will be made only when there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student, with the professor's approval, has petitioned the office of vice president/dean of academic affairs for an extension of time. The vice president/dean of academic affairs may grant an extension of time or a replacement of the incomplete with a W (Withdrawn). Pass-Fail Option Twelve elective credits may be taken on a pass-fail basis. Courses taken on a pass-fail basis cannot be courses that contribute to major, minor, or general education requirements. No more than one class may be taken on this basis during any given term. No more than twelve semester credits of pass-fail work may be counted toward the satisfaction of graduation requirements (student teaching and internships excepted). Students taking a course on a pass-fail basis must attend all classes, take all examinations and possess all prerequisites required of students enrolling on a letter grade basis. Performance of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- caliber will be awarded a grade of \"Pass,\" which does not affect the grade point average. Grades of F are included in the computation of the grade point average. Students may elect (or reverse) the pass- fail option until two weeks after mid-term for semester-long courses, and until the fifth week of an eight-week course. Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations41Grading of Experiential Education and Internships: All experiential education and internship credits will be graded Pass/Fail. If participation is not a requirement for a major or minor, it will contribute to the twelve-credit maximum for Pass/Fail. If participation is a requirement of a major or minor, it will be exempt from the twelve-credit limit (for example, student teaching.) Auditing Students must register for all classes they wish to audit. No credit is given for a class that is audited. Students must observe normal attendance requirements; however, they are not required to take tests or submit term papers. Students have until two weeks after mid-term for semester-long classes and until the fifth week for an eight-week course to elect to take the course for audit. Adding or Dropping Classes Students may drop and/or add classes within the first ten days of the semester without receiving a grade, charge, or a \"W\" on their transcript. The class schedule that is in place after the ten-day drop/add period will be the class schedule charged out by the Business Office. No tuition refunds, other than government-mandated ones, will be paid after that date. Classes that run only eight weeks have a five day rather than a ten day drop/add deadline. A $5 fee is charged for a change made after these deadlines. Classes added beyond these deadlines require approval of the vice president/dean of academic affairs of the University. Students may withdraw from classes without receiving a grade until two weeks after mid-term or until the end of the fifth week for classes that run eight weeks; however, there will be a $5 fee and a \"W\" will appear on the transcript. After this period a student may not withdraw from a course unless there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student has petitioned the office of the vice president/dean for academic affairs for approval to withdraw. Students who do not withdraw by the deadline will receive a grade for the course in accordance with their performance in the course. Students who stop attending a class without officially dropping will receive a failing (F) grade. Grade Point Average (GPA) The University of Jamestown grade point average (GPA) is used to determine academic standing. The GPA is computed by dividing total grade points earned by the total number of semester credits attempted in which the student received a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F. (Exception: If a course is repeated, only the higher grade is included in the GPA calculation; however, the lower grade remains on the transcript as well.) Grade points awarded per semester credit are the following: A+ = 4, A = 4, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3, B- = 2.67, C+ = 2.33, C = 2, C- = 1.67, D+ = 1.33, D = 1, D- = .67, and F = 0.Grades of P, W, and I (Incomplete) do not affect the grade point average. Two grade point averages are maintained for each transfer student - the University of Jamestown GPA and an overall GPA that includes transfer credit. A minimum overall GPA of 2.00 must be maintained for graduation. The overall GPA is also used in determining eligibility for scholarships and for all academic honors (other criteria beyond GPA may exist in some cases.) Classification of Students Official classification of students is determined by the registrar as follows: Freshman: fewer than thirty-two semester creditsSophomore: a minimum of thirty-two semester credits and a maximum of sixty-three semester credits Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations42Junior: a minimum of sixty-four semester credits and a maximum of ninety-five semester creditsSenior: a minimum of ninety-six semester credits Academic Course Load Students registered for twelve or more semester credits during a given semester are classified as full-time students. Students expecting to complete their degree program in four years must successfully complete an average of thirty-two semester credits per year. Students granted permission by the vice president/dean of academic affairs to carry an overload in excess of twenty semester credits will be assessed a fee. Official Withdrawal from College A student who must withdraw from college should obtain an \"Official Withdrawal\" form from the registrar. This form must be completed for official withdrawal from the University. An unofficial withdrawal results in failure in all courses. Adequate Progress Toward a Degree The GPA levels defined as \"adequate progress toward a degree\" are as follows: Minimum Credits GPA First three semesters of undergraduate education ......................................... 1.80 All others ............................................... 2.00 Academic Warning A student is placed on academic warning when his/her semester GPA drops below the level defined above as \"adequate progress.\" The student will be removed from academic warning status whenever his/her semester and cumulative GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. Academic warning notifies a student that he/she has a GPA that might impede his/her ability to meet graduation requirements. Academic warning status does not restrict course load, eligibility for intercollegiate athletics, or the right to hold student office. It does specifically render the student ineligible for directed/independent studies. Academic Probation A student is placed on academic probation when the student has been on academic warning status for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester GPA to the level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to place a student on probation without a previous semester on warning. the student has been on academic warning status for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester GPA to the level required for adequate progress. A student will be removed from academic probation when his/her semester GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. Academic scholarships are reduced by ten percent during the semester in which a student is placed on probation. The reduction is not cumulative and the original scholarship is reinstated when the student returns to good academic standing per the Vice President for Academic Affairs. While on probation, the student is ineligible for intercollegiate athletics, and the course load is restricted \u2014 unless otherwise stated \u2014 to thirteen semester credits. In addition, the student on probation is ineligible for directed/independent studies and may be required to accept academic counseling. Academic Suspension A student is placed on academic suspension after he/she has been on academic probation for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester and cumulative GPA to the Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations43level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to suspend a student without a prior semester on academic probation. Academic probation may be continued in lieu of suspension if the University of Jamestown cumulative grade point average improves but is below that required for good standing, providing the semester average is at or above adequate progress level. A student who has been suspended may request re-admittance to the University of Jamestown after one semester. His or her status will be reviewed by the vice president/dean for academic affairs and the vice president for student affairs. The student will be notified whether he or she will be re-admitted on academic probation or denied admission. Incompletes Incompletes must be finished within four weeks of the beginning of the next semester. No final action will be taken until the four-week period has elapsed. Exceptions to Academic Regulations Academic regulations exist in order to ensure integrity and fairness in the academic programs of the University. Therefore, exceptions to academic regulations will be granted only when there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control that justify special consideration. If a student believes that such circumstances exist, he or she may petition for an exception to an academic regulation. The petition process is outlined below:1. The student obtains a petition form from the Registrar's Office. 2. The student fills out the petition, stating clearly the reasons for the request and providing any supporting evidence. 3. The student signs the petition and returns it to the Registrar's Office. The registrar then passes the petition to the academic dean. Upon the student's request, the registrar will also make an appointment for the student to speak with the dean concerning the petition. 4. The academic dean considers the petition, and if he/she deems it necessary, consults with the Curricular Council. 5. The dean approves or denies the petition and returns the petition with an explanation to the registrar who informs the student of the decision. Eligibility Student organization offices are restricted to full-time students who are not on academic probation. Athletic eligibility is granted only to students who are not on academic probation and who meet the standards of the Dakota Athletic Conference. Student Papers Faculty may dispose of papers, projects, quizzes, exams, or other materials that remain unclaimed or unexamined by the student on the last day of classes of the next semester (excluding summer semester.) Transfer Courses All students enrolled at the University of Jamestown who wish to complete courses at other academic institutions and to transfer those courses for credit to the University of Jamestown must have those courses pre-approved through the registrar's office. Whether a course corresponds in content and quality to a University of Jamestown course will be determined by the registrar in conversation with the relevant department chair and the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A minimal expectation is that the course in question comes from an institution that is accredited by a CHEA approved regional accrediting association of schools and colleges that offers either associate or bachelor degrees. Curriculum, Honors, and Academic Regulations44A minimum of 128 semester credits must be earned. At least forty-eight credits must be upper-division (300-400) level. A maximum of sixty-four semester credits will be accepted from a junior college.

All students enrolled at the University of Jamestown who wish to complete courses at other academic institutions and to transfer those courses for credit to the University of Jamestown must have those courses pre-approved through the registrar's office. Whether a course corresponds in content and quality to a University of Jamestown course will be determined by the registrar in conversation with the relevant department chair and the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A minimal expectation is that the course in question comes from an institution that is accredited by a CHEA approved regional accrediting association of schools and colleges that offers either associate or bachelor degrees. Graduation Application A Graduation Intent Form must be submitted to the registrar at least one semester prior to graduation. This is the responsibility of the student. Forms are available in the Registrar's Office.Grade Point Average1. Entry into the various majors of the University of Jamestown requires a grade of at least C- in each prerequisite course. 2. In addition, progression within the major is dependent on maintaining a grade of C- in each course. However, graduation from the University of Jamestown requires a cummulative GPA of 2.0. 3. A grade of C- received in a course at the University of Jamestown will count toward total credits but will not satisfy major or minor requirements. Commencement Graduating seniors are expected to attend and participate fully in graduation activities including baccalaureate and commencement ceremonies. Mid-year or other graduates unable to return for commencement may request their degrees in absentia by writing to the vice president/dean of academic affairs. Requirements for the Degree49Assessment The University of Jamestown has a genuine interest in a continuing assessment of student learning as a way of measuring its success in meeting its mission and enhancing its academic programs. The assessment process is guided by the foundational values and the mission of the University.

While formal and informal reports from alumni, employers, trustees and other constituencies comprise additional information relevant to assessment, student input constitutes the critical source of assessment data. Therefore, all students will be expected at various junctures during their tenure at University of Jamestown to contribute to our assessment program by completing surveys, standardized tests, and exit interviews as required by their curriculum.Assessment51Harris Widmer Center for Excellence in Information Technology In early 1999, the University of Jamestown launched a major new initiative in information technology for the 21st century with the establishment of the Harris Widmer Center for Excellence in Information Technology. The first venture of the newly established Center was to increase students' access to computers. Each room is networked for access to e-mail, the internet, and other network services. This dramatic enhancement of computer accessibility to students was made at no additional charge to the students. The Center's establishment was made possible with a generous lead gift from Harris and Arlyce Widmer, Fargo, N.D. Mr. Widmer is a graduate of the class of 1958 and a long-time College trustee. The Center's facets include: Studies in Information Technology (See Computer Science section). Software skills certification, which involves training in word processing, spread sheets, databases, e-mail and Internet, web page design, presentation software, graphics, desktop publishing, and networking. Special internship opportunities, which will greatly enhance the resum\u00e9 of University of Jamestown graduates.Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business Since its launch in the fall of 2000, the Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business has become a premier center for management education with programs that compare favorably with those of any liberal arts college in the country. The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business was named in honor of Roland E. Meidinger, trustee emeritus and longtime benefactor of University of Jamestown, and the recipient of the honorary degree Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, from the college in 1976. In order to accomplish its mission of excellence in business education and to achieve its strategic goals, the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business has implemented several major initiatives that have resulted in the following distinctive program hallmarks: Accreditation and Certification of Programs The following degree programs offered through the Roland E. Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business by its Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE): Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration with concentrations in accounting, business communication, financial planning, general management, global business, hospitality and tourism, and marketing Bachelor of Arts degree in accounting Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts Business Studies Bachelor of Arts in Financial Planning and Wealth Management. Center for Excellence52Center for Excellence Strong and Talented Faculty The faculty in the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business are talented, respected, highly collaborative, committed to excellence in teaching and student learning, and are either doctorally- or professionally-qualified to teach in their particular disciplines. Innovative New Programs An important initiative of the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business is the development of new programs that expand offerings and widen the range of choices for students. The center has recently developed an option of a concentration in financial planning in the accounting major, a major in liberal arts business studies, liberal arts concentrations in the business administration major, an interdisciplinary major in health and fitness administration, and concentrations in hospitality and tourism management, and information technology.Expanded Opportunities for International Experiences The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business, through its Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics, currently offers students the following opportunities for international study in business, economics, and/or accounting: IACBE International Partnership for Study Abroad Irish/American Scholars Study Abroad Program International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) Expanded Internship and Experiential Education Opportunities The expanded opportunities for internships and other types of field experiences developed by the Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business provide students with experiential learning that is vital to the complete education of business students. Nationally Recognized Student Organizations The Meidinger Center for Excellence in Business currently has a very strong and active chapter of Phi Beta Lambda, which is a national student business organization.53 With the first class of their first semester, University of Jamestown students begin a journey\u2014a journey to success. The metaphor of the journey is apt because it reminds both students and those working with them to keep thinking about where the chosen path will lead. We want each student to make the most of his or her four years at the University of Jamestown. And as with any journey, the best way to make the most of it is to keep one's eyes open in order to see as much as possible. Therefore, the Jamestown Journey to Success emphasizes the importance of looking: Students Look Inward through examining their own interests, strengths, goals, and dreams. This begins in Journey 101 where students meet in small groups each week with a faculty/staff teacher and an upper-class student guide. Teachers and guides provide the students with analytic instruments and hold discussions to help them think carefully about what they want to accomplish both inside and outside the classroom during the next four years. This results in thoughtful choices of major and minor areas of study as well as involvement in co-curricular activities. Students Look Outward by asking how to take the talents and strengths they have identified and use them not only to accomplish their own goals but to serve those around them. All students at the University of Jamestown do community service as part of the required course in ethics. Students also have the chance to help others distant from the college through mission trips with groups such as Habitat for Humanity and the Presbyterian Church in Kenya or to serve those in our own community through groups like Students of Service, Champions of Character, and many others.The Jamestown Journey to Success Students Look Beyond in order to learn about people, cultures, and ways of life different than their own. This happens through overseas travel to places like China, Guatemala, Kenya, or Italy or within the U.S. to cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, or New York. But travel is not the only way to learn about new ideas and diverse perspectives; right on our own campus students can take advantage of Multicultural Week, Foreign Film Festivals, or interaction with international students. Students Look Forward as they make use of college resources to prepare themselves for that next step into the world of work or further graduate study. Career Services offers student individual assistance in searching for a job or selecting a graduate school. Opportunities like Backpack to Briefcase Conference allow students to choose among a wide range of sessions on topics such as networking, interviewing, business etiquette, resume writing, applying to graduate school, and many more. The Jamestown Journey is our way of ensuring that each student's journey fits his or her needs, helps meet the needs of others, and leads to a successful future. The Journey also includes a four-year graduation guarantee, a guaranteed internship, and a co-curricular transcript for students who want them. * There are very few times in students' lives when they will be surrounded by so many others dedicated to helping them reach their goals as during the years of their journey at the University of Jamestown. *The four-year graduation guarantee and the guaranteed internship are subject to specific conditions. More information is available in the Registrar's Office.54Academic Departments 55Art Associate Professor Cox (chair) Mission Statement The mission of the Art Department of the University of Jamestown is to prepare students in visual creativity, interpersonal and group communications proficiency, and to provide for them a learning experience that will help develop their personal growth within the college's liberal arts curriculum. We seek to expose students to traditional and innovative art cultures, trends, and media. From these studies and experiences, students will achieve academic excellence through a better understanding of the arts, civilization, religion, languages, literature, philosophy, government, and geography.

Health-Related Majors A bachelor's degree is granted from University of Jamestown to students completing majors in clinical laboratory science and in radiologic technology. The number of credits within these majors make the BS degree the best option. Students seeking a BA in these majors can expect to exceed the 128 semester credits required for graduation. Clinical Laboratory Science Major Clinical laboratory scientists (medical technologists/medical laboratory scientists) are health professionals who supervise and conduct laboratory diagnostic tests on patients' body fluids and/or tissues, assisting the physician with diagnoses and treatments. An education in this field will prepare the student for a variety of career opportunities. Two options are available in preparing for a career in clinical laboratory science (CLS.) Students can plan programs so that they need not decide immediately which option they will choose. Each includes a year of clinical internship in an accredited medical technology/clinical laboratory science program and prepares the student for the medical technologist certification exam from the Board of Registry of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists and the clinical laboratory scientist exam from the National Certifying Agency. As a member of the Western College Alliance for Clinical Laboratory Science, a cooperative education program between several universities and colleges in the Midwest, University of Jamestown is affiliated with the clinical laboratory science program at the University of North Dakota (UND). The final professional year begins with a summer semester at the University of North Dakota. Fall and spring semesters are then spent at one of the many possible clinical sites. There are currently more than twenty-five clinical affiliates in North Dakota, Minnesota, and other western states.Biology62Biology Option A Students can complete Option A in four years, earning a Bachelor of Science degree from University of Jamestown with a major in clinical laboratory science. Three years are spent on campus at University of Jamestown completing prerequisite course work and general education requirements. During the fall semester of the junior year, the student applies to the affiliated CLS program. The senior year consists of twelve months of specialized clinical laboratory science education, beginning with summer session at the UND campus in Grand Forks. Fall and spring semesters are spent at one of the many clinical sites. Option B Option B is a five-year program. The student spends four years at University of Jamestown completing a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in biology or chemistry before entering the one-year clinical training. During the fall semester of the senior year, the student may apply either to the UND program or to any accredited CLS program nationwide to complete the professional internship. Program note The Clinical Laboratory Science major prepares students to transfer in three years to a CLS program outside of University of Jamestown. Acceptance into the off campus program is independent from University of Jamestown. Students should consult with the program director, registrar, Business Office, and Financial Aid Office early in their course of study to ensure a clear understanding of the CLS program, application procedure, and financial aid implications for the off-campus portion of the course of study. In addition to the bachelor of science general education requirements, the following courses are required for students planning a major in clinical laboratory science: At University of Jamestown Dept.

Six credits must be 300/400 level and all other general education requirements must be completed. Many students choose to attend for three years, taking lighter course loads and taking additional courses to strengthen their credentials. Sixty semester credits (which include forty-two upper level) will be granted for successful completion of the two years in the radiologic technology program at an affiliated radiological technology program. Copies of these affiliation agreements are available for review in the Business Office. Other programs must be approved in advance by the program director, and specific agreements must be formalized by the academic dean, the registrar, the Business Office, and the Financial Aid Office. Students must apply for admittance to an affiliated program during the fall semester of their sophomore year. Acceptance at a program is competitive and not guaranteed. All University of Jamestown classes must be completed before attending the affiliate institution. Upon satisfactory completion of the program, the bachelor's degree is granted by University of Jamestown. Health-Related Pre-Professional Preparation (Please refer to section beginning on page 195.)

Based on this foundation, it is our mission to pursue excellence in business education and to prepare students for successful professional careers, graduate studies, and a lifetime of learning, service, and personal growth. Broad-based Goals In order to accomplish its mission, the Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics pursues a set of broad-based goals. They are as follows: to promote a dynamic environment of academic excellence that emphasizes student learning in all programs of study to enhance operational effectiveness and measure excellence in business education through comprehensive programs of outcomes assessment and continuous improvement that are fully integrated with strategic planning to engage in continuing curricular review and development to develop ethical leaders who excel in a variety of organizational environments through contributions to the personal and professional development of students to promote and engage in a variety of faculty development activities to provide significant opportunities for international study, experiential education, and co-curricular activities to foster a stimulating and effective learning and teaching environment for all students and faculty to establish and sustain internal and external collaborative educational relationships and partnerships to enhance visibility, reputation, and service presence by developing and sustaining community, regional, state, national, and international outreach initiatives Assessment The Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics affirms the importance of continual and comprehensive assessment of student learning outcomes in all of its programs as a method of measuring excellence in business education. Consequently, the department is committed to the use of outcomes assessment results as a means to achieve its stated purposes and educational goals and to improve student academic and personal achievement. Therefore, all students who pursue majors offered by the department will be required to participate in its ongoing outcomes assessment program, which includes a national standardized test in business. Accreditation Specialized business accreditation by an independent, external accrediting body is a means by which students, parents, the business community, and other stakeholders of the College can be assured that the institution's business degree programs meet high standards of excellence and follow best practice in business education. University of Jamestown has received specialized accreditation for its business programs through the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), located in Olathe, Kansas. The business programs in the following degrees are accredited by the IACBE:68 Bachelor of Arts in business administration with concentrations in accounting, business communication, financial planning, general management, global business, hospitality and tourism management, information technology, liberal arts, and marketing Bachelor of Arts in accounting Bachelor of Arts in financial planning and wealth management Bachelor of Arts in liberal arts business studies Study Abroad Opportunities The Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics currently offers students the following opportunities for international study:1. In cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA), the British Council, and the Department for Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland, the department participates in the Irish/American Scholars Program. This program provides students with the opportunity to apply to study for either one semester or a full academic year at one of our partner institutions in Northern Ireland: Queen's University-Belfast, University of Ulster-Coleraine, University of Ulster, Magee College-Derry, University of Ulster-Jordanstown, University of Ulster-Belfast, or the Belfast Metropolitan College. 2. University of Jamestown is a member of the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP), which is the world's largest network of colleges and universities cooperating to provide international educational experiences for their students. Through the ISEP network, students have access to affordable, high-quality study abroad programs in any discipline, including business, economics, and accounting. The reciprocal exchange program is designed so that students pay all of their normal fees, including tuition and room and board, to University of Jamestown and then study abroad for a semester, a full academic year, or a summer. Programs in business, economics, and accounting are available in more than sixty universities throughout Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, and North America. Requirements for the Accounting Major At the recommendation of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), state law now requires that candidates who sit for the certified public accountant examination must have completed 150 academic credit-hours with either a major or concentration in accounting. The intent of the AICPA recommendation is to generate CPAs who possess a broader base of knowledge that extends beyond accounting. University of Jamestown currently requires a total of 128 credit hours for graduation with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Therefore, state law requires CPA candidates to complete an additional twenty-two credit hours in order to sit for the CPA exam. The Department of Business, Accounting, and Economics offers two accounting program options. The first option, the accounting major, consists of the sixty-three credit-hour major requirements listed below. The second option, an accounting major with a concentration in financial planning, consists of the sixty-three credit-hour major requirements, plus a seventeen credit-hour concentration. Students who plan to sit for the CPA exam may complete the recommended courses listed for either option in order to fulfill the additional twenty-two-credit-hour CPA requirement. They may also choose to complete the additional credits through graduate study.

Spring108Criminal Justice and Sociology Professor Stone (chair); Lecturers Fremgen, Kaiser, Redmann, and Rummel Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Criminal Justice and Sociology at University of Jamestown is two-fold. Sociology courses support the curricula in general education, teacher education, and nursing. Their aim is to sensitize the student to the role of social forces (e.g. homogeneity, stratification, urbanization) and social institutions (e.g. the family, education, religion, politics, and the economy) as they impact our individual and collective lives. In criminal justice, students are prepared to pursue one of three distinct, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, options. The focus of the major is a solid preparation for entry-level careers in law enforcement, corrections, or adult or juvenile probation and parole. In addition, discipline-specific writing is an explicit student outcome goal to which the department is committed. Finally, the department is fully committed to its program of outcomes assessment to measure the degree to which its mission is being accomplished and provide guidelines for program enhancement.

English and theatre are presented chiefly as an area of knowledge important to the liberal arts tradition but also as preparation for post-graduate or professional study and as preparation for a career immediately following graduation. The department maintains that the understanding and appreciation of the art of theatre can best be taught by participation. Students from all majors may participate in theatre classes and College productions. A grade of C- or above must be earned in all courses required in a major or a minor. Requirements for the English Major The English major requires 36 English credits beyond English 102.

Mission Statement The fine arts program at University of Jamestown embraces art, music, and theatre as artistic disciplines that have traditionally been an integral part of the liberal arts. The program seeks to help students express themselves through widely varied artistic means. The program offers three majors: Fine Arts-Studio Fine Arts-Music Fine Arts-Theatre Students majoring in fine arts are strongly encouraged to work in close cooperation with their respective departments to develop their artistic abilities through participation in the various public outlets available at the College, such as art shows, theatre productions, and musical ensembles. If further concentration in a particular area beyond that required for the fine arts major is desired, students are encouraged to explore the possibility of a concurrent minor in a particular area. The requirement for the fine arts major is forty-two semester credits, including twenty-six semester credits in an area of concentration and two approved courses in each of the other areas. The department chair of an area of concentration may recommend additional courses as electives from among its own offerings or from supporting fields in accordance with the student's educational and career objectives. 122Foreign Language Associate Professors Stevenson (chair) and Roth Mission Statement The mission of the Foreign Language Department at University of Jamestown is to help prepare the liberal arts student as a citizen of our global community. We seek to expose students to other languages and cultures, thereby broadening their concepts of language, civilization, culture, philosophy, government, religion, geography, art, aesthetics, and literature with a firm anchoring in a Christian perspective and academic excellence. In order to determine student progress toward these ends, the department assesses student learning and departmental effectiveness on a regular basis. Placement and Advanced Standing in French, German and Spanish The first semester beginning courses in French, German, and Spanish are aimed at students with no prior instruction in those languages. A student who has completed high school course work in a foreign language is encouraged to consult with foreign language faculty members to receive advanced placement in a course beyond 101. Students who receive advanced placement into French, German, or Spanish 102 and complete the course with an earned grade of C- or higher will also receive three college credits for 101. Students who enroll directly in a 200-level French, German, or Spanish course will receive six advanced placement credits for language courses at the 101 and 102 levels when they complete the 200-level course with a C- or higher. The advanced standing credits count on the student's record but do not count as part of the semester course load. The credits count toward fulfilling general education requirements in the area of Global Perspectives. The advanced standing credits will be awarded at no charge to the student. The Foreign Language Department awards advanced standing credit for 200-level courses based on student performance on CLEP tests, which are administered through the Career Services. There is a charge for the CLEP exams. Majors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers majors in French, German, and Spanish that require twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof combined with twelve- eighteen credit hours of advanced language study in the student's major language. The advanced credits will be gained during study abroad or participation in a US-based language immersion program. Students wishing to major in French, German, or Spanish must complete all courses leading to the minor at University of Jamestown, then take additional coursework in their study abroad to complete the major. Credits gained through advanced placement or CLEP exams will be counted as coursework leading to the minor.

Bratton, Johnson, and Joy (chair) Mission Statement The objective of the History-Political Science Department is to equip students with a sufficient background in history and political science so that they may 1. become aware of their cultural heritage, 2. grasp the origins, causes, and nature of important contemporary national and international issues, institutions, and movements, and 3. have the essentials of a civic education, i.e., knowing how American government works, how people participate in it, and having an awareness of issues associated with American politics, both descriptive and normative. The department provides its majors and minors with suitable preparation for their subsequent careers as teachers, graduate students, lawyers, politicians, and professionals in other related occupations. History is a critical component of the liberal arts tradition. R.G. Collingwood argued that next to philosophy, history was the discipline best suited to synthesize other fields of knowledge into a coherent whole. Political scientists would agree with Aristotle that \"man is a political animal\" and that the human condition cannot be understood without reference to political motivations. A grade of C- or above must be earned in all courses that are required in a major or a minor. Requirements for the History Major Dept.

Fall and spring163Nursing Professors Mangnall (chair) and Rittenbach; Assistant and Mello; Instructor Briese The four-year baccalaureate nursing program at University of Jamestown maintains approval by the North Dakota Board of Nursing and accreditation by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN). Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) 3343 Peachtree Road NE, Suite 850 Atlanta, GA 30326Phone: 404-975-5000 Fax: 404-975-5020 www.nlnac.org Mission Statement The mission of the Nursing Department is to prepare a generalist in nursing who has the foundation to practice as a professional and/or to pursue graduate studies. The department provides a curriculum based on the concepts that promote holistic health for individuals, families, and communities. The department also serves as a resource for campus and community health-related activities. Declaration of Major Students planning to apply to the nursing program are encouraged to declare a nursing major in the freshman year. Declared students receive important communication from the Department of Nursing. Admissions There are two types of admissions into the nursing program. 1. The traditional admission occurs after three semesters of nursing prerequisite and general education courses. A student may be admitted conditionally if all admission criteria are not fully met. 2. Some students may be admitted formally into the Nursing major as entering freshmen (refer to the University of Jamestown Catalog, page 160.) Applications are available on-line via the Department of Nursing web page during the month of November. Notification letters regarding admission into the nursing program are sent out at the end of December. Students must apply and be accepted to University of Jamestown prior to applying for acceptance into the nursing major. The criteria for admission to the nursing major are as follows: 1. Completion of all nursing prerequisites or their equivalents: Psyc 203, Nrsg 205, Biol 208 and lab, Biol 216 and lab, and Soc 101 or Soc 230. Biol 209 and lab may be taken before or concurrently with sophomore courses. Students who receive a D or an F in one prerequisite course may repeat that course and still be eligible to apply for the nursing major. Students who have received a D or an F in more than one prerequisite course will not be considered for admission into the nursing major. 2. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher. 3. Enrollment is limited. Students are admitted to the program using a formula that relies significantly on the cumulative grade point average. The formula used to determine acceptance also gives University of Jamestown students some advantage over transfers. No candidate is excluded on the basis of gender, creed, race, or age. 4. Prerequisites cannot be fulfilled via CLEP or PEP. 5. All transcripts of credit transfers from other colleges and universities must be in the Registrar's Office before entrance into the nursing program.1646. Following admission, a grade of C- or above must be earned in all nursing courses. Refer to the Readmission Policy. Conditional Admission If class size capacity allows, the Department of Nursing may occasionally admit some students whose C-GPA is near 3.0. Acceptance of these students will be awarded on a conditional basis. Any conditional student receiving a grade below C- in either of the sophomore-level nursing courses will be ineligible to continue in the nursing program. This restriction is placed on the conditional student because the nursing faculty has consistently identified a strong correlation between lower GPAs and academic difficulty in progressing through nursing courses. Readmission After Nursing Course Failure (Regular Admission only) After receiving one failing grade (D or F) in a nursing course the student will be required to submit a letter requesting re-admission to the nursing program. The nursing faculty will meet and consider the student's re-admission status. A decision will be made based on the student's perceived ability to successfully progress through the major and to pass the NCLEX. Students who fail a nursing course are strongly advised to work with their advisor to formulate a plan outlining actions to facilitate successful course compleation. After reeiving a D or an F in a subsequent nursing course the studnet will be ineligible for continued progression through the major. FRESHMAN ADMISSIONS PROCESS Admission Criteria A select number of students may be admitted directly into the nursing major on entrance to the college. The following criteria outline the freshman admission process.1. Applicant must be admitted to University of Jamestown before application to the nursing program will be accepted. 2. Minimum high school GPA 3.25 on 4.0 scale. 3. ACT score of 24 or SAT score of 1100. 4. High school biology and chemistry strongly recommended. 5. Essay (part of the freshman nursing application) 6. Possible personal interview. Progression in the Nursing Major All freshmen accepted to the nursing program will be required to achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 prior to the beginning of the nursing coursework. Failure to achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in pre-nursing courses will make the student ineligible to enter the nursing program in the second semester of their sophmore year. The student may reapply to the program when all admission criteria are met. Freshman students enrolled in the nursing program need to pass all prerequisite courses with a grade of C- or higher. A student earning a grade lower than a C- in two or more prerequisite courses will be deemed ineligible for progression in the nursing program. All nursing prerequisites or their equivalents must be completed prior to beginning clinical coursework: Psych 203, Nrsg 205, Biol 208 and lab, Biol 216 and lab, Soc 101 or Soc 223. Biol 209 and lab may be taken before or concurrently with sophomore nursing courses. Students who have received a grade below C- in one prerequisite may repeat that course and still be eligible to apply for the nursing program. Freshman students accepted into the nursing program are expected to work very closely with their academic advisor to help ensure necessary coursework is completed on time.Nursing165Nursing CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS Each semester, prior to beginning any clinical experience, the following documentation must be on file before a student will be allowed to attend clinicals. 1. Health Record Requirement: Record of a current TB Test (completed through the Department of Nursing, if not obtained prior to admission). NOTE: Although the CDC requires a chest x-ray for a positive TB test, the student should follow her/his health care provider's advice. Record of MMRs (rubeola or rubella vaccination), OR Positive Titer, unless born before 1957. Record of 2 Chicken Pox (Herpes Varicella/Zoster) Varicella/Zoster) Vaccinations, OR a Positive Titer.

Proof of Health Insurance/Health Insurance Waiver mailed with acceptance letter. 2. Disability Accommodation. Reasonable accommodations will be made in assisting students who have disabilities to fulfill clinical and professional requirements. The ultimate determination regarding the reasonableness of accommodations will be based on the preservation of client safety and the resources of University of Jamestown and the Department of Nursing. Students requesting disability accommodations should refer to the detailed policy included with the application packet and contact the director of the Learning and Academic Advising Center. For further information regarding University of Jamestown's policy on disabilities, please see the Guidelines for Student Requests for Reasonable Accommodation on the Basis of a Learning Disability in the Catalog. 3. A criminal background check will be completed per affiliating healthcare agencies requirements. This process will be initiated by the Department of Nursing. Participation in the criminal background check is necessary for obtaining clearance for a student's participation in clinical learning opportunities at various healthcare facilities. Depending on the criminal background check results, the student may be denied progression in the nursing program. For the complete policy, refer to the Department of Nursing Student Handbook. FEES AND ExPENSES Nursing majors pay the designated college expenses. In addition, while enrolled in clinical nursing courses, students will pay some additional expenses related to the clinical experience. A clinical fee of $250 is added for each clinical course. Uniforms, stethoscopes, and lab supply totes are purchased during the sophomore year. Clinical software costing approximately $100 dollars is also purchased at this time and that fee continues each year in the nursing program. The software is an application for a hand-held smart phone or other device that can be carried during clinical experiences, therefore the purchase of a smart phone or other hand-held device is required. In the sophomore year, a criminal background check is required which costs aproximately $35. Additionally, there will be costs for required immunizations which will vary according to health insurance and current immunization status. Juniors and seniors also pay an integrated testing fee of $112 per semester. Transportation to and from clinical facilities is the student's responsibility. Financial aid may cover additional expenses. University of Jamestown provides professional liability insurance for sophomore, junior, and senior nursing students. Coverage only applies while the insured is acting in his/her capacity as a student of the College. Students are expected to provide their own health and accident insurance and required immunizations.166TRANSFER STUDENTS Applicants with previous college credits are evaluated in terms of college and departmental requirements. Students seeking transfer into the nursing major should contact the director of Admissions for enrollment into the college. All nursing prerequisites must be completed prior to entrance into the second-semester sophomore courses. RNS AND LPNS RNs and LPNs wishing to earn baccalaureate degrees may enroll in the nursing program at University of Jamestown.

Approved areas for teacher licensure at University of Jamestown include biology, chemistry, English, foreign language, history, mathematics, music, physical education, and elementary education. Since each state has its own licensure requirements and administers its own licensing process, students who plan to teach in states other than North Dakota should consult with that state's Education Department, write to the specific state(s) that they are considering, or visit the intended teaching state's web site for licensure requirements. Completion of noted courses in the early childhood concentration, along with a completed major in elementary education, will qualify the pre- or in-service teacher for preschool or kindergarten teaching in North Dakota. The course Educ 418A: Student Teaching in the Elementary School will be 10 semester credits and taken during the same semester as Educ 417-6: Student Teaching in the Kindergarten (6 semester credits). Changing state/federal standards may require program modifications, and the common core standard. Candidates for the North Dakota Educator's Professional License in Secondary Education must choose at least one major in a field taught in public schools. Students are responsible for meeting the major requirements as well as the professional component requirements. Students seeking licensure in secondary education must confer with an Education Department advisor during registration. Along with the major requirements, forty-eight semester credits in the Education Department are required for University of Jamestown's recommendation for teacher licensure in North Dakota. Students are encouraged to join the Student North Dakota Education Association (SNDEA), a professional organization, to gain greater knowledge of their field and to meet other pre-service and in-service educators. This organization also provides liability insurance during student teaching. Students may use other sources for liability insurance if they wish but must provide evidence of insurance to the department. An alternative is the International Christian Education Association. Other professional organizations in early childhood, reading, math, science, and special needs also afford opportunities for participation. Those eligible are invited to join Pi Lambda Theta, the International Honor Society and Professional Association in Education. (Programs and requirements are subject to change to meet state approval.)197Pre-Engineering Program The 3-2 engineering program provides a three-year course of study at the University of Jamestown with an additional two years of study in one of many engineering programs at universities around the country. Students completing the program receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Jamestown and a Bachelor of Science in engineering from the university at which they complete their engineering courses. Recent University of Jamestown engineering students have completed their studies at several universities, including: * Montana Tech (College of Mineral Science and Technology) * North Dakota State University * South Dakota School of Mines * University of North Dakota * University of South Dakota * Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. Pre-Law Law schools do not generally require a specific pre-law program. Those pursuing an undergraduate curriculum in preparation for law school should consult with the director of the Learning and Academic Advising Center and the history-political science faculty. Health-Related Pre-Professional Preparation The University of Jamestown offers pre-professional preparation for a number of health-related fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, osteopathy, chiropractic, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Traditionally, more than 85 percent of our science (biology and chemistry) majors pursue further study or professional degrees in the health professions, graduate research, and/or teaching. Note: Students preparing for health profession programs should obtain scheduling advice from advisors in biology or chemistry before registering for classes. Pre-Medicine Most American medical colleges select for admission only those applicants with a four-year college degree and prefer students with a well-rounded liberal arts education. Admission to medical school is strongly influenced by two measures: the student's score on the nationally administered Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and the overall grade point average (GPA). The University of Jamestown students historically have received excellent preparation for successful performance on the MCAT. We believe the key to this success is the availability of our instructors to help students. Students' scholastic achievements and their successful attainment of career goals are important to us. Pre-medicine students are not limited to a single set of courses. Students plan their programs in consultation with the pre-medical advisors. Medical schools usually require only a few basic courses. Beyond this minimum, courses may be chosen according to the student's own interests. The majority of the University of Jamestown pre-medical students choose to major in either biology, chemistry, or biochemistry; but a major in a different area may be satisfactory. It should be noted, however, that the first two years of medical school consist of intensive coursework in biology and chemistry .Pre-Professional Preparation198Suggested Biology Courses: Pre-Medicine students should have schedule plans checked by a biology advisor .

United States dental schools require that applicants take the Dental Admission Test (DAT) and schools of optometry require the Optometry Admission Test (OAT). Students interested in these fields should contact advisors in biology or chemistry to prepare a course program to meet their individual objectives. Also, professional schools may differ in what courses they desire applicants to have taken. Pre-Pharmacy The University of Jamestown traditionally has provided a strong background for students pursuing a degree in pharmacy. The Learning and Academic Advising Center and health professions advisors should be consulted when planning a pre-pharmacy schedule.Pre-Professional Preparation199Pre-Professional Preparation Pre-Physical Therapy Most programs of physical therapy desire students who have completed four years of undergraduate training. Students with a bachelor's degree then apply to a graduate program in physical therapy which will grant the master's degree or doctoral degree. Students considering pre-physical therapy should consult the Learning and Academic Advising Center and health professions advisors in biology or chemistry when planning their coursework. It should be noted that admission to physical therapy programs is very competitive and students who have been highly successful in their undergraduate work are the most viable candidates for admission. You must have 9 of the 13 prerequisite classes completed by the end of the Fall Semester prior to beginning the program. Any course work completed after the Fall Semester will not count toward core or prerequisite GPA calculations but will need to be completed prior to matriculation.

Pre-Occupational Therapy In addition to specific science courses, a background in psychology is recommended for occupational therapy. Students may complete two or three years of coursework at the University of Jamestown and apply for the professional programs at other institutions. Alternatively, students may complete four years of training in a major at University of Jamestown and then apply for Master of Science programs. As with other professional programs, admission to occupational therapy at the graduate level is competitive. Students considering this program should consult the Learning and Academic Advising Center and health professions advisors in biology or chemistry when planning their coursework.200University Personnel The Board of Trustees Class of 2016 Steve Bietz Bismarck, ND Ruth DeNault San Clemente, California Peggy Foss, Ph.D., Second Vice Chair Ann Arbor, Michigan Tessa Gould Washington, DC Jim Johnson Los Gatos, California H.
