The rising prevalence of neurological illnesses and cancer is one of the major factors driving the growth of the global complementary & alternative medicine industry. Furthermore, the expanding government initiatives and activities are contributing to the growth and development of the global complementary & alternative medicine industry. Globally, governments are establishing advantageous rules and legislation for the manufacturing and marketing processes, which is driving the expansion of the global industry. Complementary & alternative medicine (CAM) differs from traditional or standard medical interventions. It employs herbs, homeopathic remedies, acupuncture, massage therapy, and preventative care. Furthermore, complementary & alternative medicines are widely utilized to treat a variety of illnesses such as pain, exhaustion, cancer, and nausea, and increasing public understanding of the benefits of natural substitute therapies which is further boosting the market growth. For instance, In December 2019, Modern Acupuncture launched a new clinic in Florida, making it the second Modern Acupuncture location in Florida and the 54th in the U.S. This is in line with the company's vision to spread the clinic's acupuncture services across the country and strengthen its market position. Despite significant efforts to provide effective COVID-19 therapy and prophylaxis, many people continue to become infected. This could be accounted for by the ongoing virus changes and, as a result, the vaccine's efficiency.

Medicinal plants and some other complementary & alternative therapies have been utilized successfully in treating a wide range of health issues. Several studies have shown the efficacy of cupping therapy, natural products, and acupressure against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, it will create a positive impact on the market. The market has expanded significantly as a result of new products being introduced in response to rising treatment demand and ongoing innovation. For instance, in 2019, Optum acquired DaVita Medical Group. This investment will go toward the advancement of novel therapies for children, as well as physicians, healthcare providers, physiotherapists, and chiropractors. Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of the populations in most developed and developing countries reported using an alternative or complementary therapy.
