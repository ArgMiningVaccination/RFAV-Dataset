You probably feel tired day-to-day, which will put you at risk of falling ill if you come into contact with infections your immune system can't fight off. A weakened immune system can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, bronchitis, auto-immune disease and anaemia so it's important to treat it early. To function well, your body requires balance and harmony. Your immunity functions better when you lead a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep. Replacing bad habits with good ones can help to keep your immune system healthy. The best vitamins for boosting immunity at a cellular level are Vitamins B6, B12, C, D, folic acid, zinc, and selenium. One of the main benefits of IV drips is fast, more effective results without gastrointestinal side effects, absorption issues or loss of potency. It is quickly absorbed in the bloodstream rather than spending too much time in your stomach which can break it down too quickly and lessen its effectiveness. Our IV drips can help build up your immune system to fight against future infections as well as reduce tiredness and fatigue. "}
