[FAQ](#faq) Your First Visit Your First Visit SCU is an integrated health system that focuses on a whole-person approach. This means our acupuncturists embrace healthcare that looks not only at biological concerns like injuries or genetics, but also factors like mood, fear, stress, culture, family, and socioeconomics\u2014each of which affect a person's ability to heal and stay healthy. Your first acupuncture visit includes a detailed health history, physical examination similar to what you experience at a Western primary care checkup, and traditional practices including tongue and pulse diagnosis. We'll also discuss the other parts of your life that could be contributing to your condition and health goals. From there, you and your provider will collaborate to design a personalized treatment plan for you. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles at acupuncture points throughout the body to balance the flow of energy (qi) and blood. When there is a blockage along one or more of the body's channels, the flow of qi is interrupted and imbalanced. This can result in pain and/or disease. The insertion of needles at acupuncture points restores qi and blood flow, reestablishing a healthy balance in the body. In addition to acupuncture, your holistic care at SCU may include other traditional Chinese therapies. Meet Our Acupuncturists.
