Every checkout line magazine and wellness center across the country seems to have their own version of \"the\" detox diet. And if you're thinking we may have one too - we don't. Here at Traditional Medicinals, we believe that our bodies are powerful and fundamentally self-healing. Sometimes, they just need a little help from the plants. Our culture is awakening to old ideas rooted in nature and tradition. We hope to bring these time-tested perspectives into the detox conversation as well. Many detox diets refer to the body as being filled with \"toxins,\" which is where we as herbalists disagree. We believe our bodies are intelligent, and have effective and complex systems to rid the body of wastes and poisons. When we formulated our EveryDay Detox\u00ae teas, we wanted to support your body's natural detoxification process.* To do this, we looked for plants that are system tonics, bitter tonics and that support our pathways of elimination. This way, you can work in harmony with your body's natural functions, instead of shocking it with an intense cleanse or fad diet. Our newly improved [EveryDay Detox](/products/everyday-detox-tea/) Schisandra Berry tea is formulated based on Traditional Chinese Medicine combination theory. The main active ingredient is the powerful schisandra berry, whose use was first documented 2,000 years ago. In combination with hibiscus, nettle and lycium fruit (a.k.a. goji), this formula helps to stimulate your liver's natural detoxification process.* Known as the \"five flavor berry,\" schisandra makes this tea deliciously tart and slightly sweet. We source our berries from wild-collection villages around a giant panda sanctuary in China's Minshan Mountains, where we're helping protect half the world's panda population.

We have all heard the \"new year, new you\" mantra, advocating that we empty our closets, create resolutions and detox our lives. Every checkout line magazine and wellness center across the country seems to have their own version of \"the\" detox diet. And if you're thinking we may have one too - we don't. Here at Traditional Medicinals, we believe that our bodies are powerful and fundamentally self-healing. Sometimes, they just need a little help from the plants. [EveryDay Detox Dandelion](/products/everyday-detox-dandelion-tea/) highlights the power of dandelion and is based on a classic European tea combination for liver and kidney health.* We use dandelion leaf and root to give your liver a little love and support kidney function by increasing the flushing of waste from the kidneys.* We've also added in fennel, peppermint and licorice to make the blend slightly sweet and minty. [EveryDay Detox Lemon](/products/everyday-detox-lemon-tea/) is based on a classic European herbal combination to promote healthy skin, liver and kidney function.* We use burdock to support the skin, dandelion to support the liver, nettles for kidneys, and cleavers for kidneys and the lymph.* With lovely hints of aromatic citrus, this tea tastes as good as it feels. It's important to note that even some of the strongest plants (and practices) work gently and over time. Many of us crave an instant fix or a drastic change, but this can be shocking to the body. We invite you to do something radically simple: drink more water, eat simply with whole foods and enjoy herbal teas to promote wellness. "}
