He spoke so highly of it that my mother decided to try it too. Now, both of my parents take it daily and have been for years. They even bring it with them on vacations to protect and maintain their bone health. Buying multiple sets can be pretty economical and we can accumulate points for rewards because they look after old customers. My older brother is more than 80 years old and doesn't have the mental clarity he used to. After taking VitaBrain for several months, I've seen an improvement in his overall alertness. After a while, I felt like my own memory was slipping a bit and got interested in seeing what it could do for me. I feel like I've improved as well and insist on taking VitaBrain from now on.

After using Vitabrain, my mom's memory seemed sharper and she said she felt less scatterbrained. When I interact with her on a daily basis, she seems much more alert and responsive. Now my dad is also using Vitabrain, to maintain optimize his brain health. They're really happy with the results and will continue to use VitaBrain.

I was told, \"Whatever you've been doing, keep doing it!\" What I have been doing in the last couple of years is walking more frequently (especially on a hilly golf course pushing a cart) and taking Bone Essence. I have always led a very active lifestyle: exercising, walking, household chores, gardening, sporadic sports, etc., so I can only conclude that taking Bone Essence played a role in my better T-scores. I'm going to follow the doctor's orders and continue exercising and taking Bone Essence!
