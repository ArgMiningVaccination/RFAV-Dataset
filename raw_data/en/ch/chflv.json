Personal Statement Dr. Ahonkhai is an Infectious Disease clinician with focused training in HIV medicine, epidemiology, and outcomes research. She is committed to optimizing clinical outcomes for marginalized HIV patients and has focused her efforts on implementation research in Sub -Saharan Africa. Dr. Ahonkhai has successfully established collaborations with NGOs in Sou th Africa and Nigeria to consider measures to assess the quality of HIV care in these settings. Her initial collaboration with South Africa resulted in an analysis unders coring the limitations of loss to follow -up as a meas ure of retention in contrast to the potential utility of unplanned care interruption (UCI) as a quality measure. More recently, she has collaborated with the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria to launch the Care4Life program, where she has further studied UCI as a measure of effective retention, highlighting high rates of care interruption in this setting, and its ass ociation with poor CD4 response and virologic outcomes. Dr. Ahonkhai's recent work has highlighted disparate clinical outcome of HIV -infected youth in Nigeria who have higher rates of care interruption and virologic failure than older adults. Dr. Ahonkhai has also focused on health -system level predictors of patient -level outcomes, including medication possession ration, and patient -centered care. Dr. Ahonkhai's goal is to design novel, care delivery interventions to improve the quality of HIV care in resou rce-limited settings , especially of vulnerable populations . B.

Measuring Quality of HIV Care in Resource -Limited S ettings Over the last 15 -20 years, there has been increased focus on the quality of healthcare provided in the US and other resource -rich environments. These efforts have extended to HIV care in the US , but have been slower to extend to HIV care in resource -limited settings ( RLS). Dr. Ahonkhai has contributed to this effort by identifying gaps and opportunities for identifying quality measures associated with important HIV outcomes and by being among the first to evaluate the Patient Centered Medical Home as a framework for assessing high quality healthcare delivery in a RLS.

[abstract] Exploring Unplanned Care Interruption as a Measure of Retention in HIV Care Dr. Ahonkhai has explored unplanned care interruption (UCI) (with later return to care) as a measure of retention in South Africa and Nigeria both with regard to its feasibility and association with clinical outcomes. Long term retention in care has remained a challenge to HIV programs globally. The study of reten tion has traditionally focused on patients who were lost to follow -up (LTFU). Though high rates of LTFU have been reported, especially in RLS, the study of LTFU has been challenged in many ways including the lack of a consensus definition. In addition, wit hout robust medical systems allowing patients to be tracked across medical centers, or resources to determine accurate vital status for patients who have missed visits from HIV clinic , patients who \"LTFU\" may represent a heterogen eous group including patie nts with undocumented transfers of care and those who have died. UCI is a feasible measure in RLS, as it does not require the additional resources of patient tracking, death registries, and fully integrated medical record system s. Dr. Ahonkhai has contribu ted to the literature by highlighting high rates of UCI, especially early after ART initiation, occurring in 30 -40% of patients. Her initial analyses set in South Africa and Nigeria were both featured as oral presentations at the annual Conference on Retro viruses and Opportunistic Infections ( CROI ) in 2011 and 2014, respectively . Dr. Ahonkhai has also reported on the association between UCI and deleterious clinical outcomes including poor CD4 response to ART and increased risk of viremia.

[accepted for publicatio n September 2016 ] Identifying High Risk Groups for Poor HIV Care Utilization and Clinical Outcomes in Nigeria Dr. Ahonkhai has collaborated with the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN) to study predictors of UCI and poor outcomes in this large treatment network. Through this collaboration, they have reported on marked disparities in care utilization and virologic out comes between adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 15 -24 years compared to older adults. Within the APIN network , AYA had a greater risk of being out of care in the first year after ART initiation compared to adults. Even AYA who remained in care after starting ART had a much greater risk of virologic failure than older adults. Dr. Ahonkhai and colleagues have also identified patients with higher CD4 counts (>350/uL) to be at more than 3 -fold greater risk of UCI than their counterparts with lower CD4 val ues. This finding is of great concern in the face of the newest WHO HIV treatment guidelines calling for treatment for all patients irrespective of CD4 count.
