Purpose The purpose of this FOA is to address gaps in our understanding of HIV viral suppression and transmission in the U.S. and to inform novel strategies for tracking infections and linking individuals to testing, treatment, and prevention services. Research is sought that will leverage extensive data and resources available to public health researchers to develop and test new methods for tracking infections, implementing testing and treatment, and linking individuals to care. Ultimately this research should devise effective strategies for sustained HIV suppression and to halt HIV transmission in the U.S. Research utilizing m/eHealth, real-time epidemiologic databases, data science, or similar novel technologies and computational approaches to bring together existing and emerging data in ways that provide new insights into the dynamics of the epidemic are especially encouraged. Investigators may extend findings to conduct implementation science evaluations of these strategies within these applications. Background All steps along the testing, linking, and treating care continuum are vital to achieve durable viral suppression and prevent new HIV transmission. While initial progress to control the U.S. epidemic has been substantial, continued progress on the U.S. HIV elimination goals will require novel approaches to achieve and sustain suppression. Gaps occur at all stages of the treatment continuum and these gaps result in a failure to suppress the virus and the risk of onward transmission. 2014 data from CDC show that testing rates overall are at 85% for U.S. persons living with HIV but testing rates for young adults are poor with only 56% of those infected knowing their HIV status. Currently, U.S. rates of first linkage to care, as reported to the CDC by 32 states and D.C. (2015) vary from 48% to 86.7% among individuals aged 13 and older. In addition, retention in care after initial linkage is poor, between 36.7% and 49%. Furthermore, differences in HIV suppression exist when data are stratified by geography, urban status, gender, or race/ethnicity. Each subgroup faces unique challenges to achieve and maintain HIV viral suppression. In January 2019 the \" [Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America](https://www.hhs.gov/blog/2019/02/05/ending-the-hiv-epidemic-a-plan-for-america.html)\" (EHE) initiative was announced. This plan targets HIV efforts on the 48 highest burden counties, the District of Columbia, San Juan (PR) and the seven states with the highest rural HIV burden (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina). Four pillars or strategic areas have been identified: A variety of strategies can be used to address gaps in our understanding of HIV viral suppression and transmission and contribute to the EHE efforts. Substantial data resources exist in the U.S. to understand how to optimize HIV control programs and to design interventions that will benefit those at risk of HIV infection or with poor viral control. Rapid advances in technology have increased data storage capacity and the liquidity of data. Harnessing data from mHealth allows the use of mobile phones or other wireless technologies in medical care and personal assistive applications and can be used to spread prevention messages, conduct disease surveillance and management, and track epidemics. Similarly, eHealth, referring to electronic medical records in care and research, is expanding our ability to measure health outcomes in HIV. These data sources are characterized by high volume and variation, and research is needed to apply emerging data science approaches to capture, manage, organize, harmonize and analyze data to extract useful information for public health use. Focused epidemiology is needed to elucidate the correlates and predictors of successful viral suppression and prevention and develop empirical public health approaches to achieve \"getting to zero.\" Data are currently insufficient in some areas of the country to fully describe the epidemiologic patterns. Current surveillance systems are not optimized for real-time responses, resulting in delays in response to outbreaks. Outbreaks of HIV can be explosive as in Scott County, Indiana (2011-2015) and Lowell, Massachusetts (2014-2018), highlighting the need for timely data. The advent of treat-all strategies increases in the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), changes in health care access, fluctuations in substance abuse and access to clean needles all impact transmission risk. Methods that can measure the impact of these prevention efforts on transmission rates much closer to real-time can appropriately guide public health responses and improve the ultimate outcome. Finally, implementation science can be used to translate research knowledge into practice. Implementation Science is defined as the study of methods and strategies to promote the uptake of effective interventions or research findings into routine healthcare. Different public health strategies may be required to attain HIV viral suppression in different racial and ethnic groups, in different age strata and in different geographic areas of the U.S. Identifying the potential gaps and barriers to implementing proven-effective interventions in these groups will be crucial in ending the HIV epidemic. Research Objectives and Areas of Interest This initiative is intended to support the application of data-based epidemiology and analyses to the complex factors impacting HIV viral transmission, suppression, and retention in care. Research should be focused on the U.S. epidemic with the intent to deepen understanding of the broader context of viral suppression. Applicants to this initiative should propose approaches to increase the precision and timeliness of measures along the treatment cascade and to determine critical components of rapid and sustained viral suppression at the individual and population level. These findings could then be tested, using implementation science methodology, to determine the effectiveness of new approaches to achieve more rapid and durable viral suppression. If proposed, implementation science approaches should be in partnership with HIV care implementers in the public or private sector. Research may be proposed which combines data from clinical care, laboratory measures, clinical trials, observational research, human behavior surveys, viral phylodynamics, bioinformatics, sexual networks, transmission clusters, geospatial mapping, and the larger human and environmental digital footprint to improve the understanding of viral transmission and suppression. Applicants may propose innovative crowd source approaches to generate new shared data resources based on electronic individual-level data which can be triangulated with other data sources to validate inferences from big data methods. Proposed research may include: Data generated by this project are expected to adhere to the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles and to be shared in accordance with NIH's policies. Use of Common Data Elements in NIH-funded Research NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) encourage the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g. genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \" [Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cde/)\" to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects.

Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html). The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/index.html) [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
