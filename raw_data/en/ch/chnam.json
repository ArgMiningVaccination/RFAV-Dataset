Introduction Aquaculture is the global fastest growing animal food-producing sector. However, fast aquaculture development has led to the serious diseases and problems in relation to intensive culture. To counter the production decline, antibiotics have been used to control disease and improve survival but the practice carries many risks to human health and the environment [1-3]. The ban imposed against using antibiotics and other drugs as growth promoters in food animals lead to more research into replacements for growth and health enhancement [4,5]. Probiotics and prebiotics are widely used in aquaculture [6,7], but nucleotides are relatively new in aquaculture and their potential benefits and effects are not fully understood. This review discusses about the role of nucleotide supplemented in the diet for aquaculture species.2. Nucleotides as nutrients Nucleotides are natural biochemical that consist of a purine or pyrimidine base, a sugar and one or more phosphate groups, which can occur as subunit nucleobases or as polymeric nucleic acids. Nucleotides can be formed either by de novo synthesis or recycled from dying cells via the salvage pathway. During de novo synthesis, nucleotides are synthesized from amino acids and other molecules. Pyrimidines are formed from aspartate or glutamine, NH 3, and CO2, while purines are synthesized from glycine, glutamine, aspartate, and CO 2. Nucleosides are formed by attaching ribose to the purine or pyrimidine base, these nucleosides are added a phosphate groups (mono-, di- or tri-) to form nucleotides. Nucleotides can be formed to di- elimination of the ribose (or deoxyribose) moiety, which can be further catabolized. Alternately, these bases possibly be recycled via use of the 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to form 5' monophosphate by the phosphoribosyltranferases in the cell [8]. In the salvage process, nucleotides are synthesized from nucleosides and bases that ARTICLE INFO ABSTRACT Although long history application in infant formula, dietary nucleotide supplementation has been used only recently in the evaluation of growth performance, stress and pathogen resistance in aquaculture species. This paper addresses the present knowledge of the use of nucleotide supplemented in the diet for culture species. Research reveals that dietary nucleotide may have significant impact and is recommended to add to the feed of aquatic species to get better performance. However, more studies should also be conducted to have better understandings on dose requirement, duration of application, impact on different life stage and under different environmental stress and pathogens. Further study should also examine the effects of dietary nucleotide supplementation of intestinal microbiota and gut morphology, and immune response of aquaculture species.Article history: Received 29 Aug 2016 Received in revised form 13 Sep 2016Accepted 15 Sep 2016Available online from the breakdown of endogenous cellular nucleic acids [9]. This process can only happen in adults with as high as 75%-80% nucleotides derived from recycled cellular material. De novo synthesis is a complicated process and has a high energy requirement compared to salvage [10]. It was also stated that due to the high adverse energy of the phosphate groups, the absorption of dietary nucleotides by epithelial cells is difficult [11]. However, the phosphate groups deduct from nucleotides to form nucleosides, which are more easily taken up by intestinal epithelial cells, subsequently nucleosides are downgraded and metabolized into forms that can be salvaged by other cell types. Nucleotide, particularly ATP is also known as source of energy in cells for metabolism including biosynthetic reactions, motility, and cell division and even nucleotide synthesis. Because ATP cannot be stored, the consumption closely follows its synthesis [8]. Furthermore, pathways for the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines have differing requirements for ATP, with purines requiring 6 molecules of ATP (for AMP synthesis) and 7 for guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) synthesis, compared with 4 ATPs for pyrimidines biosynthesis. Therefore, nucleotide from diet might help to save energy. It seems, therefore, that the energy requirement for obtaining nucleotides via different pathways will occur in the following order from high to low: de novo , salvage and exogenous supplement. Quan et al . [12] revealed that dietary nucleotides can shorten the route to supply requirements to cells and may be more energy efficient, particularly in damaged tissues or when the animal is sick. When nucleotides supplied in the diet, the dependence on the de novo pathway should lessen, reducing the energy requirements by providing nucleotides to cells more directly. Nucleotide requirement is likely to vary with life stage. In fact, in young organisms new cell generation for growth and development greatly exceeds the very low levels of cell death [9], so the salvage pathway might not supply enough nucleotide to meet requirements. In addition, some tissues or cell types have lower capacity to synthesize nucleotides for themselves. These include the intestinal mucosa and bone marrow hematopoietic cells [13]. Furthermore, in some circumstance ( e.g. unhealthy, diseased, stress or food shortage), exogenous nucleotide supplied via diet resulted in significant improvement [14]. Evidence of this was provided in a study that showed that nucleotides did not enhance the immune cell growth when healthy, but they did improve the immune cell development and cytokine quantity when cells were co-cultured with influenza virus antigen [15]. Also, function of immune cells were affected by the supply nucleotide derivatives [16]. In the last two decades, increasing numbers of studies have indicated potential benefits of nucleotides in mammals, including humans. Nucleotides and nucleic acids are involved in many critical pathways, including the initial process of protein synthesis [17]; improved iron absorption of intestine [18], act as hormones and neurotransmitters and are present in some co-enzymes [19]. They improve gut mucosal surface, humoral and cellular immunity [20], accelerate hepatocyte growth [21] and improving liver function [16]. Dietary nucleotides also significantly reduce DNA damage in the immune cells of chicken when exposed to T-2 toxicity, with similar findings in pigs [22]. These benefits of nucleotides, only under certain circumstances, have lead to them being termed 'semi-essential' or 'conditional' nutrients [23]. Nucleotides also have been approved by the European Commission as a food supplement to infant formula as there is insufficient nucleotide in cow milk compared with human breast milk [24]. As such, nucleotide has been added to infant formula for many years proved the benefits without any negative effects reported [25,26] . 3. Dietary nucleotides in aquaculture 3.1. Use of nucleotide in aquaculture The application of nucleotide supplements in aquaculture diets is relatively new compared to mammalian and human counterparts. Knowledge to date and prospects for nucleotides in aquaculture have been reviewed by Li and Gatlin [27] and Ring\u00f8 et al .[28]. The underlying principles for nucleotide benefits in aquatic animals are still poorly understood, and although there are several empirical studies with varying results, it is hard to explain the benefits or otherwise without further background knowledge. Nucleotides currently used in aquaculture [29,30] are the same as those added in infant formulae [25], including 5 types of nucleotide . Nucleotides potentially improve growth, immunity, stress resistance or attractiveness of the feed [27,28] . 3.2. Dietary nucleotide role in growth, immunity and stress resistance In aquaculture, health benefits of dietary nucleotide supplement include improved survival and growth under stress [31,32] . The findings by Do Huu et al.[33] show that there is a requirement for nucleotide in the diet of Penaeus monodon (P . monodon ) for optimal growth. It is important that nucleotide can replace fish meal in the feed of shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei ) [34]. Also, L. vannamei fed 0.04% diet nucleotide could elevate nonspecific immune response, resistance, and growth of this species [35]. Indeed, application of nucleotide in the diet significantly enhances the growth performance in many fish species. It was reported that, nucleotide supplementation could partly replace fish meal in diet of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss [36,37] . Also research revealed that nucleotide mixture supplemented at a dose range between 0.05% and 0.20% increased growth of grouper, 4(10): 816-823 818 supplementation also improved the growth Sciaenops ocellatus [29,39,40] . Growth, protein efficiency, and feed Red sea bream, Pagrus major (P . major ), a recommendation of 1.0-1.5 g/kg mixed nucleotides added in the diet to boost growth, immune responses and stress resistance [43]. Hybrid tilapia , Oreochromis nucleotide in the diet [44]. Similarly, Nile tilapia increased growth and feed intake when fed nucleotide in the diet [45]. However, Yaghobi et al.[46] reported no influence of dietary nucleotide on growth, food conversion ratio and some haematological index of striped catfish, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus . Also, nucleotide supplementation did not significantly influence growth of fish fed diets with 30% to 50% soybean protein but could improve the non-specific immune and gut morphology of turbot [32]. In accordance to these findings, growth performance, proximate composition in juvenile turbot, Scophthalmus maximus did not influence by nucleotide diet [47]. Nucleotide supplementation in the diet also showed benefits to invertebrate. Growth performance, non-specific immunity of sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicas increased when fed nucleotide in the diet [48]. Growth of Pacific white leg prawn L. vannamei was enhanced by addition of 0.04% of purified nucleotide mixture to feed s[49]. Likewise, dietary nucleotide rise growth performance, feed utilization and boosted immune against air exposure in crayfish [50]. In addition, survival rate of Artemia fed nucleotide and challenge with Vibrio proteolyticus was higher than control as demonstrated by significantly higher survival [51]. Also, there was a significant growth and survival of Artemia when increased nucleotide (purine and pyrimidine) was added in the diet. It is possible that Artemia cannot synthesize nucleotide endogenously as other species do, thus the benefit of nucleotide diets in Artemia is clearer than in other animals [52]. Dietary nucleotides also improve growth rate under stress conditions in Atlantic salmon [29], grouper [30], red drum [38], and Pacific white leg shrimp L. vannamei [49]. It was reported that 0.15%- 0.20% nucleotide supplement improved growth and resistance of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss [37]. Nucleotides may also improve response to osmotic stress: Atlantic salmon fed dietary nucleotide at 0.25% and 0.5% for 8 weeks and then transferred to 18 ppt salinity for 3 days showed greater immunofluorescence of Na+, K+-ATPase in histology samples with the highest in the group fed 0.5% nucleotide [53], perhaps evidence of higher osmoregulatory capability in fish supplied nucleotide. Nucleotide supplement in the diets also seem to enhance the immune response of aquatic species. Neutrophil oxidative radical production is influenced by nucleotide supplement in red drum, S. ocellatus [38]. Carp, Cyprinus carpio fed with nucleotide supplemented diet days, clearance of a carp pathogen (Aeromonas hydrophila ) was enhanced, with no bacteria in the kidney, blood or liver and an increase in serum complement and lysozyme activities of the fish treated with nucleotides. Furthermore, supplemented nucleotide in diet enhances immune responses and enahance pathogen resistance in tilapia [31,44,45] . Growth performance, immune response and tolerance upon challenge to Aeromonas hydrophila were higher of 0.25% nucleotide in the diet could boost growth, immune and stress resistance of of Caspian brown trout [55]. Although immunity in arthropod invertebrates is very different to higher animals, nucleotide effects have also been shown here: using a range of concentrations of supplement (0%, 0.15%, 0.225% and 0.3%) of nucleotide feed giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii for 60 days resulted in higher phenoloxidase, total haemocyte count and total haemolymph compared in prawns fed higher levels of supplement [56]. In contrary, dietary nucleotide did not improve growth and body composition in pikeperch, Sander lucioperca , while significantly stimulate immune and reduce mortality when exposed to Aeromonas salmonicida [57]. Nucleotide content in animal tissues has been found to change with variations in environment [58-60] . In penaeid prawns, levels of ATP-related compounds in tissues were impacted by harvesting methods and species. IMP level in prawns ( Penaeus japonicus , P . monodon ) increased with increase of temperature and time exposed to air [59]. This increase in IMP as a result of change of environment has led to tissue levels of IMP being proposed as a stress indicator [59]. Nucleotide composition in tissues of crustaceans changes in stress environments and rapid changes in salinity cause a significant variation of nucleotide composition in different tissues of the kuruma prawn, Marsupenaeus japonicus (M. japonicus ) [58]. In addition, ATP is as the major source of cellular energy [61], so it is likely that during stressful conditions animals require more energy to cope with the changing environment. This energy could be supplied by guanine and adenine phosphate derivatives: levels of IMP, a major intermediate in ATP and guanosine-5'-triphosphate biosynthesis, were found to be high in stressed prawns, while adenine, particularly ATP, ADP and AMP levels dropped sharply, perhaps indicating rapid utilization in energy production [62]. It is possible that not all exogenous nucleotide addition will help stress resistance. Thus, requirement for individual concentration of each single nucleotide and their combinations as mixtures in the diet should be considered. The changing pattern of nucleotide related to environment differs depending upon tissues. Nucleotide in gills and in hepatopancreas but not in muscle was correlated with environmental nitrite levels in M. japonicus , increasing in gills but reducing in hepatopancreas [60]. Additionally, change of salinity caused a significant variation of nucleotide composition in different tissue of M. japonicus . There was an inverse relationship between salinity and nucleotide Do Huu Hoang /Journal 816-823819 in the hepatopancreas, while the nucleotide in the muscles and gills increased directly with increase of salinity [58]. Because some nucleotide levels drop rapidly under stress, it is possible that exogenous dietary nucleotide can provide nucleotide rapidly to the cells reducing energy requirement so animals can resist better under stress or challenge. Oulad et al . [53] reported that, in histology samples from fish fed 0.5% dietary nucleotide, the highest immunofluorescence of Na +, K+-ATPase, which were highly correlated to osmoregulation for species that live in estuaries where environmental salinity changes with the tides [63]. 3.3. Effects of high concentration of nucleotide in the diet Most studies to date have looked at commercial mixtures of nucleotides supplied at the manufacturers recommended dose. However, there is some evidence to suggest that excessively high levels of nucleotide may cause negative effects. According to Tacon and Cooke [64] nucleic acid extracted from bacteria, when used at low concentration of 2.5% and 5% supplementation did not impact growth and feed conversion, but at 10% inclusion, feed intake, growth and feed conversion ratio of trout were negatively affected. It was also demonstrated that 23% brewer's yeast or 6% RNA could replace the nitrogen source for fish meal in the diet and could enhance growth of juvenile gilthead sea bream. However, at higher concentration of RNA growth of this species was negatively affected [65]. Terrestrial monogastric animals cannot tolerate high doses of nucleotide in the diet as heightened rates of purine metabolism produce more uric acid, resulting in toxicity and consequential harm to the animals. Uric acid accumulation could be either from an increase of purine de novo synthesis and catabolism or caused by the reduction of uric acid excretion from urine [66]. Furthermore, metabolism of other nutrients can also be influenced negatively at high levels of dietary nucleotide [67]. The excessive concentration of nucleotide supplementation may diminish growth of prawn and the nucleotide requirement were higher when prawn smaller [33]. In addition, excessive of exogenous nucleotide might inhibit the immune response in red drum [38]. Another study on European sea bass larvae, Dicentrarchus labrax supplied 3 levels (0%, 1.1% and 5.7%) of live yeast, Debaryomyces hansenii to the diet and showed an increase in m RNA , trypsin and lipase, with the highest enhancement of weight gain, survival rate, activities of the intestinal enzymes alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase N, maltase and a reduction of the malformed larvae at 1.1% yeast supplied. In contrast, the weight gain of the group fed 5.7% yeast was similar to the fish in control [68]. These numerous studies indicate that animals only need a certain amount of nucleotide supplement and over dosage may cause a negative effect. As a consequence, the dosage response of dietary nucleotide supplementation requires substantial investigation and optimization.3.4. Effect of nucleotide on offspring and young stage animals As stated earlier, nucleotide requirement is likely to vary with life stage as new cell generation for growth and development in young organisms greatly exceeds the very low levels of cell death thereby reducing the availability of nucleotides via salvage [9]. However, research into requirements of early developmental stages, or effect of parental supplement on offspring in aquaculture, is very limited. Gonzalez-Vecino et al. [69] reported that dietary nucleotide supplement of haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus broodstock resulted in larvae with higher feeding success, low mortality, intestinal improvement and size compared to larvae from broodstock without dietary supplement. However, comparative studies between differing sizes and lifestages of the same species are few. Preliminary small-scale research on P . monodon and Penaeus japonicus indicated differences in effect of supplementation with commercial nucleotides on small and large animals in terms of haemocyte counts (total and differential) and growth [70]. Similarly, mitogenic response of B lymphocytes of rainbow trout fed nucleotide for 60 days was enhanced but not for 120 days. Perhaps the bigger somatic size of the fish at 120 days, and their slower metabolic rates reduced the requirement for nucleotides compared to younger stages [71]. More extensive studies to elucidate the requirements of animals of differing ages are required. 3.5. Effects of nucleotide feeding duration on animals The time required to detect any effect is still not known in most aquatic species and is likely to depend upon what parameters are under investigation. For example, it is likely to take longer to detect any effect on growth than it will to detect physiological changes such as immunity. For instance, a supplementation of 0.5% of Ascogen P in the diet of hybrid striped bass, feeding for 6 or 7 weeks, did not influence growth, whole body composition, hematocrit or serum lysozyme. However, there was significant increase in neutrophil oxidative radical production and survival rate after challenging with Streptococcus iniae . In addition, the commercial nucleotide mixture Optimun fed for 8 weeks to juvenile red drum, S. ocellatus did not show any response in terms of weight gain, feed efficiency, cortisol level related to density stress or survival rate following a parasite challenge with Amyloodinium ocellatum [72]. 3.6. Role of individual nucleotides in diets Almost all research to date in aquatic animals has investigated commercial mixtures that are high in nucleotides but are complex in their makeup. Few studies have investigated the roles of individual nucleotides though it is likely that different nucleotides have differing effects on immunity and cell development in aquatic animals. For example, cyclic nucleotides, particularly c AMP and c GMP Do Huu Hoang /Journal of Coastal Life Medicine 2016; 4(10): 816-823 820 regulate molting in crustacean, but this could be species specific [73]. Research by Lin et al.[30] on grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus fed diets supplemented with and cytidine monophosphate (1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1) or each single nucleotide at 1.5 g per kg of diet for 8 weeks indicated that single or mixed nucleotide are beneficial to growth and immunity in these fish, with 0.15% mixed nucleotide addition diet being optimal. However, in addition, AMP at 0.15% nucleotide enhanced the immunity of grouper more than other single nucleotides, while the nucleotide mixture improved both growth and immune response. Similarly, it was reported that supplemented 0.15% IMP and mixed-NTs could enhanced the growth and immune (the nitroblue tetrazolium and lysozyme activities) in juvenile red seabream, P . major [74]. An inclusion of 0.4% dietary inosine and 0.2% and 0.4% AMP significantly increased growth, immune response, oxidative stress resistance and intestinal health condition in red sea bream, P . major [75,76] . However, Rumsey et al.[67] found a significant reduction on growth rate, feed intake, and other parameters of rainbow trout when fed free nucleotide adenine (1.54%), 1.94% hyponanthine) did on feed intake or growth. Supplemented individual nucleotide in diet for prawn, P . monodon for 52 days confirmed the importance of guanine, along with inosine and adenine, in prawn diets, perhaps reflecting the relative energy ( ATP) requirements for synthesis of purines compared to pyrimidines. Although individual nucleotide showed benefits to aquaculture species, the mixture seems to gain better response in grouper [30]. Likewise, the commercial nucleotide mixture provided a better response in prawn, P . monodon [77] and in red sea bream, P . major [43]. More extensive research on individual nucleotides, and their structural derivatives, has been done in mammals: Brule et al. [78] fed a mmol/kg diet for 14 days. The urinary allantoin excretion was higher in rats fed xanthine and hypoxanthine, nucleosides and nucleotides in comparison to the control and there was no effect on weight and structure of kidney, urine volume, serum uric acid and creatinine. Adenine caused toxicity in rats such as reduction in weight, bigger kidney, higher urine volume, greater blood urea nitrogen amount, however; the toxicity caused by adenine only found as free form, but not when fed as nucleoside or nucleotide [78]. It was also found the same negative effects of excessive adenine diets on growth reduction and health of rats including kidney expansion, urine and plasma nitrogen quantity raise and confirmed that the removal of adenine from the diet show the recovery on health and growth of rats after 9 days. In contrast, guanine, xanthine and hypoxanthine did not show any influence on growth, while adenine and guanine diets could enhance the levels of those free nucleotides in the liver of rats [79]. It is possible that the increase in intracellular c AMP levels is the toxic cause of adenine to cells [27]. The existence of high levels of adenine is reported in soybean in some countries, which has led to a possible explanation for poor health associated with diets high in soybean [80]. 4. Future direction Whilst research on potential benefits of dietary nucleotide inclusion is progressing in many aquatic species [27], there are some areas that require further research and improved understanding, particularly against a background of changing natural ingredients in aquaculture feeds as a result of environmental and economic pressure. Optimum dosage of nucleotide supplemented in the diet shoud be determined for each species. In addition, the duration of feeding nucleotide diet to gain highest growth performance is not fully understood. Moreover, although it seems logical that there will be higher nucleotide requirement for mass tissue development in young stages of life, there is little research on nucleotide requirement at different stages of life. Further study should also examine the effects of dietary nucleotide supplementation of intestinal microbiota and gut morphology, and immune response of aquaculture species. Additionally, a major omission in previous research is that the level of nucleotides in the basal diets or in individual ingredients has not been determined, thus the actual nucleotide requirement for any species has not really been accurately determined. This is important because there are high concentrations of nucleotide found in food products such as seafood, beef as well as from plant sources such as corn and wheat [81,82] or seaweed [83]. Many of these, particularly fish and krill meal, are used core ingredients in aqua feeds. Most previous studies used ingredients such as fishmeal [38] or commercial mash as a base for experimental diets [84] without any determination of the nucleotide content in the finished diets used to feed animals in their experiments. So, the actual effects of the total nucleotides on animals are still not clear. In addition, most studies on dietary nucleotides to date used mixtures of nucleotides with one dose [29,38,40,49,72] . Some research on the effects of individual nucleotides on various species [75-77,85] . However, those studies only applied one dose of nucleotide in the diet. Therefore, it is still limited understandings on determination of requirement of individual nucleotides and at different life stages, duration of administration for each species. This is a serious omission in many aquatic species, as there are likely to be differing requirements for different nucleotides, reflecting the differing energy requirements for their synthesis or salvage, and differing absolute requirements for the end product in the relevant tissues. Furthermore, under different stresses, macronutrient requirements of aquaculture animals are different. Furthermore, cells involved in immune response do not synthesize nucleotides. Thus, nucleotides from dietary sources are preferably used at times of rapid growth or physiological stress. It is therefore likely that, along with the higher Do Huu Hoang /Journal of Coastal Life Medicine 2016; 4(10): 816-823821 requirement for other nutrients under stress conditions, nucleotide requirements will be higher under stress. Finally, any study on inclusion of small water-soluble molecules into aquaculture feeds should also investigate their stability and retention within the pellet. This is particularly important for aquaculture species as feed expose to water, allowing time for water- soluble molecules to leach into the environment, thereby reducing the amount available for the culture animal.
