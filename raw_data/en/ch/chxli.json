There are two approaches to health science: the study and [research](/index.php/Research) of the human body and health-related issues to understand how humans (and animals) function, and the application of that knowledge to improve health and to prevent and cure [diseases](/index.php/Disease). Health research builds upon the basic sciences of [biology](/index.php/Biology), [chemistry](/index.php/Chemistry), and [physics](/index.php/Physics) as well as a variety of multidisciplinary fields (for example [medical sociology](/index.php/Medical_sociology)). Some of the other primarily research-oriented fields that make exceptionally significant contributions to health science are [biochemistry](/index.php/Biochemistry), [epidemiology](/index.php/Epidemiology), and [genetics](/index.php/Genetics). See also [life sciences](/index.php/Life_sciences) and [life science academic disciplines](/index.php?title=List_of_academic_disciplines&action=edit&redlink=1). Applied health sciences also endeavor to better understand health, but in addition they try to directly improve the health of individuals and of people in general. Some of of services to improve people's health is referred to as health care ( [see below](#Application_of_health-related_knowledge_(health_care))). See also [branches of medicine](/index.php/Medicine#Branches_of_medicine). The health sciences industry, a multi-billion dollar buiness sector, is a cross-section of the life sciences and the health care and medical diagnostics industries. Medical research is [basic](/index.php/Basic_research) and [applied research](/index.php/Applied_research) conducted to improve the evaluation of new treatments for both safety and efficacy in what are termed [clinical trials](/index.php/Clinical_trial), or to develop new treatments (referred to as [preclinical research](/index.php/Pre-clinical_development)). The increased longevity of humans over the past century is due in large part to medical research. Among the major advancements in medicine have been [vaccines](/index.php/Vaccine) for [measles](/index.php/Measles) and [polio](/index.php/Polio), [insulin](/index.php/Insulin) treatment for [diabetes](/index.php/Diabetes), classes of [antibiotics](/index.php/Antibiotic) for treating a host of maladies, medication for high [blood pressure](/index.php/Blood_pressure), improved treaments for [AIDS](/index.php/AIDS), [statins](/index.php/Statin) and other treatments for [atherosclerosis](/index.php/Atherosclerosis), new surgical techniques such as [microsurgery](/index.php/Microsurgery), and increasingly successful treatments for [cancer](/index.php/Cancer). New, beneficial tests and treatments are expected as a result of the [human genome project](/index.php/Human_genome_project). Many challenges remain, however, including the appearance of [antibiotic resistance](/index.php/Antibiotic_resistance) and the [obesity](/index.php/Obesity) epidemic. Health care is the prevention, treatment, and management of illness and the preservation of mental and physical well being through the services offered by the [medical](/index.php/Medicine), [nursing](/index.php/Nursing), and [allied health](/index.php/Allied_health) professions. According to the [World Health Organisation](/index.php/World_Health_Organisation), health care embraces all the goods and services designed to promote health, including \"preventive, curative and palliative interventions, whether directed to individuals or to populations\". [[1]](#cite_note-1) The organized provision of such services may constitute a [health care system](/index.php/Health_care_system). This can include a specific governmental organization such as the [National Health Service](/index.php/National_Health_Service) in the UK, or a cooperation across the National Health Service and Social Services as in [Shared Care](/index.php/Shared_Care). There are a large number of terms [medicine](/index.php/Medicine) or [biomedicine](/index.php/Biomedicine), and [medical doctor](/index.php/Medical_doctor) or M.D. refer to the dominant conventional practices in the West. There are a wide range of traditional areas of health care. The most common areas are: [medicine](/index.php/Medicine), [nursing](/index.php/Nursing), [midwifery](/index.php/Midwifery), and various forms of therapy to supplement the healing process and restore proper activity (e.g. [Dietetics](/index.php/Dietetics), [recreational](/index.php/Play_therapy), [physical](/index.php/Physical_therapy), [occupational](/index.php/Occupational_therapy), [speech](/index.php/Speech_therapy), and [respiratory](/index.php/Respiratory_therapy)). Like health science in general, health care includes both the study and application of preventing and curing human diseases and disorders. Medical [doctors](/index.php/Physician) include [physicians](/index.php/Physician) and [surgeons](/index.php/Surgery). There are many different branches of medicine; the other health care professions also have specialties or focus on specific populations or settings of care. [Public health](/index.php/Public_health) studies the effect of environmental factors such as available health care resources on the health of the general population, often focusing on particular populations, such as mothers and children. [Dietitians](/index.php/Dietitian) educate people about proper [nutrition](/index.php/Nutrition), particularly specific dietary needs of populations such as people with [diabetes](/index.php/Diabetes), [breastfeeding](/index.php/Breastfeeding) women, and people with [celiac](/index.php/Celiac) disease. Other less common medical areas include [first aid](/index.php/First_aid) and [triage](/index.php/Triage). Dental health has grown in importance in recent decades making [dentistry](/index.php/Dentistry) a major field of health considered part of health science. [Veterinary medicine](/index.php/Veterinary_medicine) is the health science dedicated exclusively to the care of animals. Veterinary medicine is involved in preventing and curing animal diseases and disorders, inspecting animal originated food (like milk and meat) and animal husbandry. Health practices Conventional Western practiced in most countries other than the USA, is listed under complementary and alternative practices below) [Pharmacology](/index.php/Pharmacology) [Physical therapy (physiotherapy)](/index.php/Physical_therapy) [Psychology](/index.php/Psychology), USA is listed under traditional western practices above) Spiritually-based healing Traditional medicine and folk medicine science deals with human life, issues of [medical ethics](/index.php/Medical_ethics), an important area of ethics, arise frequently. Medical ethics includes questions on topics such as a patient's right to privacy. and [genetic engineering](/index.php/Genetic_engineering) are especially controversial issues directly related to health science. History of health science The foundations for the Health Sciences fields are as old as the human race. Humans have always been in need of solutions to address illness, injury, and various health related issues such as childbirth. With modern technology and the backing of the pure sciences, the scientific accuracy of these fields has greatly improved. Nevertheless, many cultures have used and continue to use various herbs and other culturally specific solutions to help solve health problems that may or may not be backed by any scientific support.
