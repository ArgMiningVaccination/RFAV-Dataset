Expand \" career ladder\" opportunities to allow for progression from current to higher level of licensure 6. Promote post-secondary certificate programs , potenti ally tied to wage increases to support retention and career path Next Steps : Identify actionable steps at state level 1. Review modeling to validate projected cost of wage increase for CNA's statewide 2. Identify funding source: Indust ry-recommended TN SNF Assessment or stimulus/federal funding 3.

The Guide is intended to prepare residents and their families should an acute change in condition occur or the resident is actively dying. How is this project impactful to the COVID -19 pandemic? -Reduce burden to hospitals for potentially non COVID -19 ED visits/hospitalizations -Reduces NH resident exposure to COVID -19 -Avoids a post -hospital visit quarantine period -Residents and their families are informed of treatment that can be safely provided in the NH, the risks and benefits of hospitalization and provide information about advance care planning. Those who have received the Guide will be better prepared to make an informed decision should an acute change in condition occur.Co-chairs Heather Gundersen, Deputy Commissioner for Administrative and Regulatory Services, Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Email: heather.Gundersen@tn.gov Janice Wade, CEO/President, Alzheimer's , Email: Bob.Vero@centerstone.org Jim Shulman, Executive Director, Tennessee Commission on Aging and Disability , Email: Jim.Shulman@tn.gov Julie Clark, Senior Quality Improvement Advisor, Alliant Health Solutions, Email: Julie.Clark@AlliantHealth.org Sally Pitt, Director, Office of Patient Care Advocacy, Tennessee Department of Health, Email: Sally.Pitt@tn.gov(1)To support and promote the mental health of three populations disproportionately impacted by COVID -19: long term care residents, staff, and caregivers; (2) To identify and work with stakeholder groups to better understand the unique needs and challenges of these target populations; and (3) To identify best practices and opportunities for real -time solutions that improve mental health.(1)Enhance communication and outreach to inform this population about what's happening in COVID -19 response and provide easy access to people in need of support. (2) Look for opportunities to improve access to healthcare without moving residents so that quarantines on return to the facility don't further impact their mental health.Co-chairs Rebecca Kelly, State Director, AARP, Email: RBKelly@aarp.org Amy French, Senior Manager of Programs and Alzheimer's Association, Email: afrench@alz .
