Waste management is a complex pro cess involving pick up, sorting, diversion and final disposal. Effective waste management reduces exposures to biological, chemical and physical hazard s and leads to employment, energy production and other benefits. It also has potential for adverse impact s on the physical, social and economic environment s and ultimately on the health and well -being of populations. Unless these impacts are properly considered, there is a risk of spoiling the benefits of waste management. Communities throughout British Colum bia (BC) are receiving proposals for thermal treatment of waste streams such as municipal solid waste, wood waste and other combustibles. The BC Environmental Health Policy Advisory Committee struck a working group in June 2010 to determine how health impa cts of waste management proposals should be assessed (hereafter referred to as the \"Working Group\"). The impetus was a number of requests for public health agencies and their staff to comment on health impacts of proposed facilities for thermal treatment of waste and production of energy. The Working Group chose to focus its assessment on municipal solid waste treatment facilities because there is a greater body of scientific evidence about its health effects and many of the general principles can be applie d to any type of waste management . This report completes the task of the Working Group. It provides a summary of what is known about health impacts of thermal treatment facilities, and unknown issues that require further study. It provides a framework for considering potential health impacts of waste management from the policy level to the operations of individual facilities. It proposes a process for health assessment that builds upon current regulatory processes, such as environmental impact assessment pr ocess, and addresses gaps where health assessment is currently inconsistent. The process is flexible and can be simple or elaborate as required. This approach to health assessment could be adapted for other health issues that involve complex technologies, multiple stakeholders and potential for environmental, social and economic impacts. In Section 1 we describe thermal treatment of MSW: technologies, emissions, and lifecycle considerations as relevant for health assessment. In Section 2 , we report on a rev iew of the evidence on health effects of thermal treatment of MSW, and lessons learned for human health risk assessment. In Section 3 , we integrate BC current practice with international experiences of health assessment and propose a process for health ass essment of waste management in BC. The appendices contain explanations of key concepts and detailed case studies. Many of the recommendations are complementary to processes currently underway in BC regional health authorities to improve health assessment f or major projects. Several health authorities have identified a need to address health impacts of resource extraction, transportation projects and changes to the built environment, and the recommendations in this report include developing health impact ass essment expertise that could be accessed by health authorities for waste management and other projects. This document provides some case examples of how such expertise has been used in other jurisdictions. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 2 Improving the health outcomes from waste managemen t is a task that involves many levels and ministries of government, many stakeholders and community groups. Public health professionals have an important role in leading and /or critiquing health assessments, sharing content expertise, and working with multiple stakeholder groups. It is critical that we use our skills to ensure that health is assessed for each of the policy and project options considered. Only then will we be equipped to take the opportunity provided by each waste management decision to sele ct those options that optimize health and well -being for all people in British Columbia. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 3 Introduction Public health practitioners are often either ill- equipped or poorly positioned to influence the proximal determinants of health.a 52 Decisions that shape t he physical, social and policy environments that favour health are made in ministries of government other than health, in regional policies and in official community plans. Nevertheless, public health practitioners have made major contributions in certain environmental issues, notably, the reduction of exposures to environmental toxins through their research and advocacy supporting removal of lead from gasoline, limiting the mining and use of asbestos and banning certain pesticides. In others, they are begi nning to play a role, such as in planning built environments (e.g., Dannenberg et al. 2011). Other issues, such as solid waste management, are just beginning to emerge as public health issues, driven in part by public conce rns about the potential health risks of pollution from solid waste treatment facilities. Solid waste management can be a highly controversial subject, conjuring unsightly images of overflowing garbage cans, toxic dumps and vermin. Considered unhealthy, was te is to be banished and disposed of in someone else's backyard. Waste management facilities sited in disadvantaged neighbourhoods can lead to real or perceived inequities in nuisance and exposures to hazards. 53 There can be little acceptanc e of waste as an inevitable product of modern living. Community opposition to waste facilities is often expressed through concern about health risks and both local public health practitioners and international scientific experts may be called upon to weigh in to the debate. 54 Faced with the task of presenting the evidence on potential adverse hea lth effects of waste management projects, public health practitioners may find that the causal links between waste facilities and health effects are either not well described in the literature or that the studies are based on outdated technologies with emi ssions that far exceed those of today. When approaching the task of preventing adverse health effects of waste management they may find that most interventions are outside the purview of public health departments. Thus intervening effectively to ensure tha t the potential ill effects of waste management are minimized is a challenging task for public health practitioners. The BC Environmental Health Policy Advisory Committee struck a working group in June 2012 to determine how health impacts of proposed changes to solid waste management should be assessed (hereafter referred to as the \"Working Group\") . The impetus was a number of proposed facilities for incineration of waste and production of energy. The Working Group chose to focus on municipal solid waste tr eatment facilities with the understanding that many of the general principles can be applied to any typ e of waste treatment facility. This report summarises the work of the Working Group. In Section 1 we describe thermal treatment of MSW: technologies, emi ssions, and lifecycle considerations as relevant for health assessment. In Section 2, we report on a review of the evidence on health effects of thermal treatment of MSW, and lessons learned for human health risk assessment. In Section 3, we integrate BC c urrent practice with international experiences of health assessment and propose a process for health assessment of waste management in BC. a Proximal determinants of health are those determinants which act directly to influence health. They include socioeconomic environment, physical environment, host constitution and the health system. Distal determinants of health influence the proximal determinants. They include social, political, legal, cultural and economic systems.52 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 4 Section 1: Overview of Thermal Treatment of Municipal Solid Waste Thermal treatment is a method of final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) . The other major method used in Canada is waste disposal in a sanitary landfill. In British Columbia, the majority of municipal solid waste is disposed in landfills. There is only one thermal treatment plant, a mass burn incinerator that converts waste to energy in Burnaby BC. This facility is described in detail in Appendix A. Municipal solid waste may undergo a variety of treatments prior to final disposal in order to remove usable by -products or produce energy (Figure 1). M SW may go directly from curb side pick -up to final treatment or it may be diverted to remove useful items for recycling and/or composting. Waste sorted by the householder into recyclables and compost (source segregation ) is said to be 'diverted' from the waste stream. More complete removal of recyclables and combustibles occurs in mechanical biological treatment (MBT). Waste that is picked up at the curb is delivered to a central MBT plant where it is mechanically sorted and treated. Mechanical sorting remo ves recyclables and combustible material. Sorting may precede or follow biological treatment , depending upon the design of the MBT facility. If unsorted waste is biologically treated, then bio -drying is used to reduce the waste and products are disposed in thermal treatment or landfill. If sorting precedes biological treatment then biological materials usually undergo anaerobic or aerobic digestion to produce biogas and compost -like outputs. In this latter scenario, the non -organic waste is sorted into recy clables and residual and the residual is disposed in thermal treatment or landfill. Thermal Treatment Technologies Waste- to-energy is a term commonly used to describe mass burn incineration, the most established thermal treatment. Pyrolysis and gasification are newer forms of thermal treatment that have much shorter track records in Canada (Table 1); although both pyrolysis and gasification plants have been operating in Europe and Asia since the early 2000s (DEFRA1 provides a detailed list of these plants). A more detailed technical review of waste -to-energy technologies and emissions is provided in a recent report commissioned by the BC Ministry of the Environment.2 There are several commercial technologies described for pyrolysis and gasification , each with its own specifications.1,3-5 We focus on a general overview of these technologies, rather than detail the specifications of particular commercial applications. Both untreated and trea ted waste can be used in each technology; however the waste stream must have sufficient caloric value to supply adequate energy output if the plant is to be economic ally viable. Mass burn incineration is the technology with the longest history and remains the dominant one in use today. The waste stream is burned in large volumes and at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen to achieve full oxidation to carbon dioxide and water. Heat generated may be used for local heating or converted to electricity. Major by -products are air emissions, waste water, and solid waste , including bottom ash and scrubbers. Pyrolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen at lower temperatures (470 -700\u00b0C). Products of pyrolysis include a synthetic gas (syngas) and solid residue. The syngas is further treated for use as a liquid fuel. Solid by -products include char residues from pyrolysis , which may undergo metals recovery and/or be converted to vitrified slag pellets b b The process of vitrification occurs at high heat (e.g. >1000 \u00b0C), and may produce gas which can be combusted for energy. for use in construction fill. The process of vitrifying occurs at high temperature, resulting in an inert material. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 5 Gasification involves partial oxidation of MSW to produce fuel which is cleaned, then used in heat - energy co -generation. By-products include solid materials (char) from the gasification process, air pollution control scrubbers, wastewater , and air emissions. Of the above technologies, only mass burn incineration is proven for management of large volumes of municipal solid waste. Pyrolysis and gasification technologies are under development and some pilot facilities exist, however, only limited data describing their operations are available (Table 1).2 Table 1.1 Examples of pyrolysis and gasification facilities in Canada Manufacturer Technology Location Operating Since Waste MSW volume Plasco Red Deer Pyrolysis/gasification Red Deer, A B Proposed MSW 200 tonne/day Plasco Ottawa Pyrolysis/gasification Ottawa, ON design Enerkem Gasification QC January 200 9 (gasifier), processing of syngas - proposed for Fall 2010 Wood waste (decommissioned electricity poles) Not listed Facility Emissions Emissions from thermal treatment include air emissions, liquid effluents , and solid wastes; each described in detail in a technical report commissioned by the BC Ministry of the Environment2 and a brief overview is provided here. Constituents of air emissions include particulate matter, acid gases (SOx, NOx, HCl and HF), heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, tin, arsenic, nickel etc), organic compounds (dioxin s and furans) , and products of incomplete combustion (CO and other organic compounds). Air emissions are either point source or fugitive emissions. Point source emissions are from a single source, such as the exhaust stack , and are usually the major source of emissions.2 Air pollution co ntrol measures , such as scrubbers and fabric filters reduce point source emissions considerably. Fugitive emissions to air occur when air is vented from an area- based source , such as a refuse holding or sorting area. Fugitive emissions can be effectively controlled by maintaining operations at negative pressure and through other design and operations measures. Some thermal treatment plants also generate wastewater effluent during operation; in addition to regular wastewater streams , such as runoff and sewa ge which can be handled in the municipal system. The main source of wastewater effluents from thermal treatment is the air pollution control system (APC). APC using wet scrubbers generates significant wastewater effluent, whereas using dry scrubbers genera tes a small amount of effluent. Wastewater effluent from wet s crubbers can be treated on site to render pollutant levels well below usual discharge standards; however, small amounts of heavy metals and some organics may remain. A detailed description of th e constituents of wastewater effluent after treatment is found in the technical report by Stantec.2 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 6 Solid wastes generated by thermal treatment plants will depend on plant design and the nature of waste streams, including: wastes removed prior to combustion, bottom ash, metallic scrap, air pollution control residues, char, residues from wastewater treatment, gypsum , and loaded activated carbon. The toxicity of these wastes varies; however, in most cases the wastes generated from air and water treatment are heavily loaded with metals and contain traces of dioxins and furans that must be handled as hazardous wastes; remainder of the wastes can be disposed of in a sanitary landfill. The largest solid waste stream is the bottom ash, which is 20 -25% of the original waste by weight or 5 -10% by volume.2 Lifecycle Consideratio ns Thermal treatment plants operate within a system of waste production, treatment and final disposal. It is important to consider the emissions the entire system. Waste transport from the site of production to the treatment facility is one of the major so urces of emissions in waste disposal. The human receptors for these emissions may differ, as different populations live along transport routes versus near the facility. Therefore both the facility emissions and the emissions from transport should be consid ered during environmental and human health impact assessment.

Adapted from DEFRA .6 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 8 Section 2: Health Effects of Thermal Treatment of Municipal Solid W aste: a review of the evidence Introduction There is considerable debate regarding the health impacts of thermal treatment of m unicipal solid waste. The conclusions of government and scientific reviews differ, despite a common evidence base (Table 4). Authors of reviews disagree on (1) which health outcomes, if any, were associated with incineration and (2) the certainty of the ev idence that incineration caused these effects. The most conservative assessment is provided by the American National Research Council who concluded that epidemiologic evidence from older facilities may prove useful in defining an upper range of health effe cts beyond those that would be associated with modern facilities.7 In contrast both the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and Health Protection Scotland agree that given the low emissions of modern MSWI they are likely to be associated with ver y small health effects, if any.8-10 The UK Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and Environment concludes that any increased risk of cancer near older incinerators was small and, although there are currently no concerns, the issue should be kept under review ; however they did not quantify this risk. 11,12 The authors of o ther reviews disagree about which health outcomes have suggestive evidence to support an association with MSWI. More inclusive reviews include birth defects and types of cancer,13 whereas less inclusive ones st ate that the evidence is inconclusive for all health outcomes.7 It is common for disagreement to occur in such instances when the evidence is poor or inconsistent . In order to make our own conclusions, we conducted a systematic review of the primary literaturec Which, if any, health conditions are associated with exposure to emissions from thermal treatment of MSW? to address the questions: Where there is evidence of an association, what is the certainty that the health effects were caused by exposure to emission s from MSW treatment? How generalizable are the published findings to British Columbia context in 2012? Methods Literature Search We conducted a systematic review of literature for all human health effects associated with incineration, gasification, pyroly sis, and oth er waste -to-energy facilities. Detailed search methodolo gy is available upon request . Briefly, o nce the literature was scoped using Google Scholar and Web of Science, the entire collection of Ebsco databases , available through the UBC library , was searched. Searches were restricted to peer -reviewed journals in English and the date range was initially set at 2000- 2010, although this limitation was removed and search strings re run to ensure that no impo rtant studies were overlooked. Papers pertain ing to medical waste or e lectronic waste were excluded. Bibliographies of most relevant articles were electronically and manually scanned (citation chaining, c Primary literature consists of the original peer -reviewed studies that form the evidence base for reviews of health effects. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 9 snowballing) to bui ld the library for this topic. Forward search strategies were also employed acr oss various databases (e.g., Ebsco, Scopus , and Google Scholar). Evidence Appraisal Primary studies were reviewed by two researchers (CE and EVB). All studies involving treatment of hazardous or other non -munici pal solid waste were excluded. Each study was assessed for methodological rigor , including exposure assessment, outcome ascertainment, and statistical methods. Where positive associations were found, findings were compared with those of other studies to determine an overall assessment o f the likeliho od of causation. Contextual Factors Key characteristics of the facilities were tabulated, including the dates of facilities operations and emissions levels. Emissions levels of dioxins/furans were sought for all positive studies. If these were not contain ed in the published literature, then authors were contacted to obtain results. Results Twenty -six primary studies met our initial search criteria (Figure 2 ). Thirteen of these studies were excluded because the waste stream included mixed h azardous or other non MSW waste. Only 13 primary studies assessed incinerators that exclusively burned MSW .

Thermal Treatment Facility Characteristics The only residual waste treatment technology assessed in th e epidemiologic literatu re was mass burn incineration. There were no epidemiologic studies of health effects of pyrolysis or gasification. The dates of incinerator operation were not clearly identified in the studies. Incinerator operation periods were rep orted as either : (1) the year of outcome ascertainment of health outcome or (2) the years the authors had established as the period during which an incinerator had to be operational in order to be included in the study (Figure 3 , Table 3.1 ). Many of the st udies involved incinerators that Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 10 were operating years to decades prior to the reported study period; although in these cases the periods of operation were not provided. Reported incinerator operation dates ranged from 1971 to 1998. Figure 2.2 Dates of i ncinerator operation for primary studies demonstrating health effects Exposure Assessment All seven studies focused their discussions and conclusions on dioxin concentrations, since these were the pollutants of greatest concern around these incinerators. However, exposure assessment methods were generally not specific for dioxins. The Japanese analysis estimated a spatial limit of health effects as the distance from the incinerator.14,15 The Canadian study16 set a distance for exposed versus unexposed at 5 kilometres from the facility . The French studies17-20 calculated emissions of metals and dioxins based on measurement and , when measurements were lacking, expert opinion of emissions concentrations based on incinerator characteristics . Expo sure assessment was then based on Gaussian plume models of ground level air concentrations of metals and/or dioxins at receptors. Since dioxin emissions were highly correlated with emissions of metals (Spearmann r = 0.64) ,17 dioxin exposures were used to classify levels of exposure. Overall, while dioxins are the basis for discussion and some exposure assessment, metals were emitted from the same facilities and, in France were correlated to dioxin emissions. Levels of Dioxin E missions The dioxin emissions concentrations were reported as peak dioxin emissions, and were estimated differently for those studies with single incinerators versus those with multiple incinerators. When there was a single incinerator, dioxin emissions concentrations were reported as the peak emission concentration from the incinerator. When there were multiple incinerators, dioxins emissions concentrations were reported as the peak emission co ncentration from the incinerator with the highest peak concentration. Reported dioxin emissions concentrations rang ed from 16,000 pg/m3 TEQ to 80, 000 pg/m3 TEQ (Table 2 ). 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Elliott 2004 Floret 2003 & Viel 2000 Viel 2008 Cordier 2010 Cordier 2004 Miyake 2005 Tango 2004 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 11 Table 2.1 Dioxin emissions in primary epidemiologic studies with findings of association between municipal solid waste incineration and health effects Location Peak dioxin emissions (pg/m3 TEQ) Date of incinerator operation reporteddHealth effects examined (* significant association) Date of ascertainment of health outcome Reference Japan, multiple sites 80,000 1996- 1998 Infant deaths*, very low birth weight, infant deaths due to congenital malformations, neonatal deaths, neonatal deaths due to congenital malformations, spontaneous fetal deaths, spontaneous fetal deaths with malformation s, female live births, low birth weight, very low birth weight 1997- 1998 Tango 200414 Japan, Osaka prefecture children Miyake 2005 15 France, Rhone -Alpes Region 16,000 1988- 1997 Clefts*, renal dysplasia*, 24 other anomalies (refer to appendix) 1988- Cordier 2003 1999 sarcoma* 1980- Viel 200021 Ontario and British Columbia, 1995 Higher self -report of awareness*, concerns* or actions* among residents livin g near landfills than residents living near incinerators 1990- 1995 Elliott 2004 16 # Both Viel 2000 and Floret 2003 studied the population around the same incinerator in Besancon, France Distance f rom Facility The distanc e of exposed populations from the facility was not consistently ascertained in all studies. The Japanese studies used spatial analysis that provided a 'limit of health effects' at 214 and 415 kilometres. The Canad ian study16 set a distance threshold at 5 kilometres for exposed populations . Most French studies17-19 did not use distance as a measure of exposure , but instead modeled ground level pollutant levels . A single French study used a spatial scan statistic to vary distances from a single facility in order to identify clusters. d Incinerator operation reported was either (1) the year of outcome ascertainment for symptoms or congenital defects or (2) the years in which the authors had set as the period during which an incinerator had to be operational to be included in the study.

We found 13 primary studies on associations between MSW incinerators but no studies on health effects of pyrolysis and gasification . The majority of primary epidemiologic studies linked health outcomes to dioxins although exposure assessments w ere not specific to a single pollutant , but either based exposure on: (1) distance from facility or (2) modeling of plumes to estimate ground level of dioxins . In the dioxin models, dioxin concentrations were highly correlated to metals . Therefore while th e papers base their conclusions on the health effects of dioxin exposures , individuals were exposed to several pollutants in pollutant mixtures, and the health effects may in fact be associated with exposure to this mixture rather than a single pollutant or group of pollutants . The reported dioxin emissions demonstrate that emissions from the studied facilities were very high, and often exceeded regulatory limits. This is suggestive of high emissions of other pollutants. Our review of the primary literature suggests that living within close proximity to older MSWI with high dioxin emissions (16,000 to 80,000 pg/m 3 TEQ) were associated with adverse health outcomes: congenital (clefts, dysplasia, urinary tract defects), non lymphoma, and self- reported symptoms in schoolchildren. Permitted dioxin emissions from modern MSWI in Canada, United Kingdom, Austria, Germany, and Sweden are in the range of 50 to 500 pg/m3 TEQ.2(p.9-48) The Canada Wide Standards for Dioxins and Furans Emissions from Waste Incinerators and Coas tal Pulp and Paper Boilers sets a target emissions for new and expanding MSWI at 80 pg/m3 TEQ,22 and the BC guideline for facilities combusting municipal solid waste is also 8 0 pg/m3 TEQ.23 Emissions permitting for US facilities are based on a different measure of dioxins that is not comparable to Canadian and European measures. In 2012, t he range of permitted dioxin emissions in Canada and Europe (50 - 500 pg/m3 TEQ) was 32 to 1600 times lower than those associated with adverse health outcomes reported in the primary literature (16,000 to 80,000 pg/m3 TEQ) . Gaps/Limitations Three major knowledge gaps were identified: (1) absence of epidem iologic studies on the health effects of mode rn MSWI , (2) absence of epidemiologic studies of health effects associated with pyrolysis and gasification facilities, and (3) absence of emissions inventories for pollutants other than heavy metals and dioxins ( e.g., ultrafines, nanoparticles). Lessons for Human Health Risk Assessment Human health risk assessment (HHRA) should be conducted for specific thermal treatment plants because there are knowledge gaps in the epidemiologic literature. HHRA risk estimates should be based on known toxicologic hazards of emitted pollutants rather than published risk estimates from the epidemiologic literature because the emissions from thermal treatment facilities in 2012 are well below those reported in epidemiologic literat ure and published risk estimates are not relevant to modern incinerators. If new studies are published that provide relevant risk estimates, then this will need to be re-examined. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 14 Generalizability to BC Context The only operating municipal solid waste incinerator in BC is the Metro Vancouver Waste -to-Energy Facility in Burnaby , BC. This facility is described in Case Study 1 in the appendices to this report . Dioxin/furan emissions measured in routine testing have been below the level of detection ( 5.1 p g/m3 TEQ) since th e facility was opened in 1988 .24 Dioxin emissions measured in 2007 using more sensitive equipment were 2 pg/m3.25(p.4 4) Published epidemiologic studies of health effects near incinerators involved incinerators with dioxin emissions that were 32 to 160 0 times greater than current regulatory standards, and 8000 to 40,000 times greater than emissions measured at the Burnaby MSWI. Burnaby incinerator operates to a standard that is better than the regulatory standard for all measured emissions, including: dioxin/furans, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and metals (cadmium, lead, mercury , and Classes , 1, 2 and 3 metals) . Future thermal treatment facilities will be required to operate to the regulatory standard.

We also examine existing policies and regulations that govern waste management in BC and identify when health effects are cu rrently considered within decision -making processes. We define the common methods of health assessment, and identify health impact assessment (HIA) as a promising tool. We describe eight case -studies from within BC and internationally, which illustrate how health assessments have been conducted for waste management policies, options and facility plans, and which comprise a wide range of health assessment methods, and contributions to decision -making processes. These examples provide models of public health professions working across disciplines to provide health input to decision -making processes. We also describe how stakeholders have responded to situations where the health effects of waste management proposals were not assessed. These inform our assessmen t of when HIA is a useful tool and when it may be unnecessary. We then focus on the organizational structures that supported HIA s in the case studies , in order to better understand what expertise and resources are necessary to conduct HIA . Finally we propo se a comprehensive approach to health assessment for waste management in BC. This approach incorporates lessons learned in the evidence review and case studies. It builds upon current health assessment processes in BC by addressing current gaps in health a ssessment. The process is flexible, and can be simple or complex depending on the specific information required for each waste management decision. The general process could be adapted for other health issues that involve complex technologies, potential he alth impacts and public concern. are unlikely to adversely impact health. Nonetheless some uncertainties remain, and we recommend tha t human health risk assessment be conducted. It is now recognised that the point source, the treatment facility emissions, are not the sole health concern, but instead it is a suite of activities along the entire system from waste production to disposal that influence health . The key factors are how much waste is produced, which substances are separated out, how waste is transported and the distribution of risks and benefits among population subgroups . Structural and socio -economic factors are at play, and regulatory and policy solutions, such as limiting waste production, reducing inequitable distribution of effects, and designing transport routes to avoid populations, will be most effective. Which waste management decisions have potential to affect health? A few key factors largely determine the nature and distribution of health outcomes arising from waste management policy and practice: the characteristics of the waste ; the scale of thermal treatment facilities ; the technologies used for thermal treatment; and emissions control and the location of the facility . Waste reduction, sorting and diversionf e Current regulations are those at the time of writing (Fall 2012). policies determine waste characteristics. Waste f Waste diversion is the removal of waste from the waste str eam for recycling, composting or other purposes prior to final disposal. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 16 characteristics, in turn, influence the waste transport volume, feasibility of treatment technologiesg The type of technology used for thermal treatment and emissions control will influence the composition of air emissions, water effluent, and solid wastes produced, as well as the energy offsets. The choice of facility site will influence the selection of transportation routes and therefore the populations that would be potentially exposed to traffic related impacts along those routes (i.e. effects of emissions, motor vehicle crashes). A combination of these factors will influence the nature and number of j obs created. and contaminants in emissions. MSW may be treated in a number of smaller neighbourhood scale facilities, a single large facility or a combination of these (Table 1). These key factors influence health through multiple pathways and mechanisms which may be grouped into those related to the changes in the physical environment and those related to changes in social determinants of health. Health effects relat ed to the physical environment may be further divided into those attributable to emissions to environmental media, and those related to other changes in the physical environment such as traffic, noise et cetera. This distinction is important, because emiss ions are regulated under WDA, whereas other changes to the physical environment are not and because different methods are used to assess health outcomes potentially arising from each type of change . Consider the volume of waste, for example. As the volume of waste is increased, there will be greater transportation requirements and associated fuel consumption and emissions. The waste transfer stations and disposal facilities must be either more numerous or larger, and ultimately have greater emissions to the environment with greater potential for health impacts. Emissions from transportation and treatment facilities will be greater, and the potential for direct health effects also greater. Of course, these factors may be mitigated by factors that reduce indiv idual exposure (e.g. , choosing transportation routes and facilities' sites distant from populations), appropriate air pollution controls and other factors. The increase in transportation will also lead to an increase in changes in the physical environment that are not related to emissions such as noise and traffic volumes, each with their own health impacts. Social and economic factors are also influenced through the volume of waste. A waste management system with greater capacity will employ more workers. Employment and relative economic status, in general, contribute to good health. Each waste disposal scenario is unique and will require individual assessment in order to determine potential hazards, population exposures and associated risks to health as we ll as potential health gains. Health effects of different waste management scenarios may have subtle difference that can be detected by modeling using local information. By teasing apart the myriad ways in which waste management affect s health, it becomes clear that the residual treatment facility is not the only, nor the most important, influence on health outcomes. Rather, decisions made throughout the process from waste management planning to facility implementation can have important health impacts . In order for decisions about these key factors to be optimized for health, health must be considered alongside economic, technical and other factors in these decisions. g Thermal treatment technologies have various requirements for volume and calorific value of the waste stream in order to be feasible.

Energy offsets: estimate health impacts based on amount of energy produced, type of energy production that is offset (emissions reductions) and changes in distribution of effects. Scale and location of facilities: estimate distribution of health effects among population subgroups related to location of the site. Options for scale and location should be compa red with regard to local effects, transportation routes, employment and economic impacts on the local economy, and health- related effects of land use trade- offs. Construction -related worker influx: estimate health effects of worker influx on communicable d iseases, social capital and cohesion, employment and economic impacts, access to health services.

However, there may be certain exposure scenarios for vulnerable populations that are not anticipated in the regulations. Therefore modeling these risks is recommended for each proposed facility. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 18 Health assessment in t he m unicipal solid waste treatment decision -making process in BC The decision -making process that leads to the operation of a MSW treatment facilityi (1) Policy : regional waste management policy is set, begins with MSW policy and is completed when the facility becomes operational. This process occurs in four stages (Figure 1): (2) Facility Options : the waste management facilityj (3) Facility Plan : the waste management facility plan is approved, and is chosen from submitted proposals , (4) Facility Operations : the facilit y is authorized to operate under permits from Ministry of Environment.

This limitation is based on the scope of the project as outlined by the Environmental Health Policy Advisory Committee. However, many of the general principles of health assessment presented here do apply to these other aspects of waste management. j The term 'facility' is used fo r clarity of writing, however it is recognised that a MSW treatment plan may include one or several facilities. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 19 Key decisions are made at each stage. During the policy stage the regional district determines the type of disposal method (e.g., landfill or thermal treatment), and waste diversion and reduction targets. This forms the basis of the request for proposals. During the options stage the regional district puts out an expression of interest followed by a request for proposals and selects the waste management facility. This decision determines the proponent, technologies for thermal treatment and emissions control, and the facility/facilities site(s ). The number and scale of facilities may be set during the policy stage or the options stage. The planning stage is when the details of construction and operations of the facility/facilities are laid out. Projects that meet certain criteria for the amount of waste handled or amount of energy produced will trigger the BC environmental impact assessment process (EIA).k The current practice of health assessment for waste management in BC is summarised in Table 2. In summary, health is usually, but not consistently, considered in the facility plan and operations stages only during EIA and WDA. Current practice has three major shortfalls . First , decisions made during policy and options stages have important implications for health, but impacts on health are not routinely considered during these earlier stages of the decision -making process. For example, decisions made at the policy and options s tages determine allowable waste volumes and constituents , waste reduction and diversion targets, energy offsets, technologies, scale and location, and costs (Table 2) . Therefore the health impacts of options considered at these earlier stages should be cha racterised and form part of the criteria to make those decisions alongside economic, political and other factors. Second, health assessment is not legally mandated with in the EIA process, but rather is at the discretion of the Executive Director of the EAO . The current practice is to conduct a health assessment when there are health concerns; however, with no legislated requirement, this could change at the Executive Director's discretion. Third , when health assessments are conducted during EIA and WDA proc esses, they are generally limited to the health effects associated with facility emissions to environmental media (i.e. soil, water, air) and do not consider effects mediated through other physical (e.g., traffic injury), social (e.g., employment) or other processes. If the full scope of health effects of these decisions is to be examined then health assessment during EIA should be broadened to consider the range of factors widely accepted to affect health (i.e. take a determinants of health approach) . EIA is a process that requires a detailed assessment of the environmental impacts of facility construction and operations. Under the Environm ental Assessment Act, the scope of the EIA is determined by the Executive Director of the Environmental Assessment Office (EAO), and historically has included an assessment of environmental effects and recommendations for permitting and monitoring criteria . Assessment of health impacts of a project may be conducted at the discretion of the Executive Director of the EAO. Upon review of the EIA the Minister of the Environment determines whether a project will: (1) receive an environmental assessment certificate allowing it to proceed with any conditions they consider necessary, (2) require further study or assessment or (3) be refused an environmental assessment certificate and thereby be halted. During the operations stage a facility is required to meet certa in emissions standards as outlined in the waste discharge authorizations (WDAs) issued by the BC Ministry of Environment (MOE). MOE specifies emissions monitoring requirements and these are often based on recommendations in the EIA. Different MOE regulatio ns and guidelines are applied to the construction phase versus the operations phase. Any upgrades to the facility may also need to be permitted by the Ministry of the Environment depending on the nature and scale of the modifications. k Environmental impact assessments are triggered when energy production threshold is 5 0 M W o r m a s s o f municipal solid waste incinerated 225 tonnes/day. The executive director of the Environmental Assessment Office may waive the project requirement if it is considered that the project will not have adverse environmental, economic, social, heritage or health effects and the Minister of Environme nt may designate a project reviewable if the project has significant adverse effect or if it is considered in the public interest.

Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 21 Health impact assessment: a tool for considering health in decision -making If health is to be considered at each stage of decision -making, then the health impacts must be characterized for these sta ges. Health impact assessment (HIA) is a process that can be used to identify and predict health impacts of policies and programs using quantitative and/or qualitative methods. A widely accepted definition of HIA is: \"a combination of procedures, methods a nd tools by which a policy, program or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population, and the distribution of those effects within the population\".55 HIA is designed to support decision -making by characterising and highlighting differences between the health effects of the different options that are und er consideration. Both positive and negative health impacts are considered. Evidence for the appraisal of health effects come from public health, epidemiology, toxicology, and perceptions of communities and other stakeholders and the methods for a particular HIA are chosen to elicit the information required to inform a specific decision. The guiding principles of HIA are democracy, equity, sustainable development, ethical use of evidence and comprehensive approach to health.56 Tools and approaches to HIA abound and can be found in the published literature and on the internet from government and organizations.56-59 The specific steps vary, but generally include (1) Screening, (2) Scoping, (3) A ppraisal, (4) Reporting and (5) Monitoring and evaluation (Figure 2). Each step will not be described here, but readers are directed to the guides cited above for further detail. One of the key principles of HIA is a broad definition of heath. HIA is based on the widely accepted tenet that factors beyond the simple absence or presence of disease affect people's health. These factors include biological, physical, community, social, economic and other determinants of health.54,l Those determinants that are potentially modified by waste management include those relating to the physical environment, as well as those related to the social factors. These are collectively referred to as the \"social determinants of health\" and include such factors as employment and working conditions , housing, and social exclusion . m HIAs range in their comprehensiveness. Rapid HIA is completed in a matter of weeks using existing knowledge and information and no stakeholder involvement. Intermediate HIA is completed within several months using analysis of previously collected data (often administrative data) and some stakeholder involvement. Comprehensive HIA takes months to years and involves collection of new data and significant stakeholder involvement. HIA may be independent or may be conducted within existing processes such as EIA or WDAs. An early step in the HIA is to identify those determinants of health that are most affected by the decision. Then the evaluation is focused on comparing how each option affects these determinants. l The Public Health Agency of Canada recognises 12 determinants of health: Income and social status; and literacy; Employment/Working conditions; Social environments; Physical environments; Personal health practices and coping skills; Healthy child development; Biology and genetic endowment; Health services; Gender; and, Culture.60 m The social determinants of health are a series of economic and social factors that influence people's health. They are variously defined and the conditions of living61 or using a list of specific determinants, for e xample the 14 social determinants of health framework: income and income distribution, education, unemployment and job security, employment and working conditions, early childhood development, food insecurity, housing, social exclusion, social safety netwo rk, health services, aboriginal status, gender, race, disability. 62 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 22 Health Assessment Methods HIA, EIA and WDA are all processe s used to assess health impact s. A variety of methods are used to characterise health impacts, and these are not limited to a specific process. Instead, some methods are better suited to address certain types of health impacts. The most common methods are described briefly here and in greater detail in Appendix E . Human health risk assessment (HHRA) is quantitative approach that uses associations between specific environmental parameters and health outcomes that have been established through epidemiologic and/or toxicologic research. HHRA uses these associations to predict health outcomes caused by projected environmental emissions. These predictions inform a risk management strategy that outlines project/policy options and associated health risks. HHRA is limited to substances/emissions that are measured and for which toxicity and dose -response relationships are known. Health outcomes arising from changes in the p hysical environment other than emissions (e.g. , noise) and those arising from changes in social determinants of health are not amenable to HHRA methods . Quantitative methods are also used to assess health impacts related to other non -emissions changes to the physical environment (e.g. noise, traffic) . These include GIS mapping and statistical techniques to demonstrate patterns in exposures through space and time. Semi -quantitative techniques such as ranking the likelihood and/or severity of effects on a Likert scale can be used across all potential health effects. This method is used to provide a comparative analysis of options ba sed on certain criteria. They are also effective at engaging a broad group of stakeholders in assessment, since they can be designed to be used by those without technical expertise. When stakeholders are included , the objectives of the assessment can be tw o-fold: (1) the prediction of potential health impacts and their direction (negative/positive) and (2) community involvement in decision -making. Qualitative techniques include narrative reports, case studies and scenarios. These are often employed to asse ss social determinants of health. The strength of qualitative techniques lies in their ability to bring together evidence from a broad range of sources and to provide an interpretation of potential outcomes based on analogy and scenario.

Given HIA's broad definition and the range of methods employed, it may be difficult to envision how HI A could be practically applied to municipal solid waste policies and projects. We conducted an environmental scan of health assessment (HA)n (1) What were the objectives and methods of the HA? for solid waste management. We sought case studies for each of the four stages, but only found them for the plan, o ptions and policy stages. This section provides critical analyses of eight of these case studies. Specifically we address the questions: (2) What were the roles of health assessment experts and those of stakehol ders in leading and/or conducting the health assessment? These are compared with case studies in BC where health assessment was not conducted. Detailed descriptions of the Kamloops and Toronto case studies are provided in Appendix E and F respectively . Health assessment in the Policy Stage: informing waste management policy Wales The country of Wales integrated health impact assessment into their development of a Draft Wales Waste Strategy.65,66,o The objectives o f this policy level HIA were to evaluate the potential environmental impacts and socio -economic impacts of national, regional and local waste management policies and to develop a health management plan with recommendations for national, regional and local levels. The HIA was conducted by a consultant group. A steering group comprised of government bodies and academicsp The HIA was comprehensive in its description of how HIA could be applied throughout waste management decision -making from policy to operations. It made specific recommendations for: (1) HIA at the regional level \"to support site and technology selection and inform decision making during specific applications and environmental permitting\" (p.46), and (2) HIA at the facility plan stage be coordinated with EIA. At the Plan Stage HIA was put forward not only as a method to characterise potential risks to public health but also as a tool to facilitate community understanding of the difference between actual and perceived risk. commented on the initial scoping and the final assessment. The health management plan provided a comprehensive assessment of the health impl ications of the policy for national, regional and local governments. n Health assessment refers to any process whereby the potential health effects of a policy, plan or project are predicted or described. It is a general term which encompasses human health risk assessment, health impact assessment and other processes with the objective of assessing health effects. o Two HIAs were performed in series: (1) an HIA of the three regional waste plans11 and (2) an HIA of the national Wales Waste Strategy.10 HIA at the regional level was used to compare scale, likelihood and distribution of health impacts of various waste management options, and is not discussed here. p The steering group was comprised of members of the Sustainable Development Commission, the Welsh Health Impact Assessment Support Unit, the Environment Agency, the Welsh Assembly Government and the University of Wales. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 25 Cardiff Two years after the Wales policy level HIA was completed, t he City of Cardiff (Wales) considered building a waste to energy facility to treat its MSW. An HIA for the proposed facility was completed by the Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit (WHIASU) in consultation with community stakeholders. However this HIA was excluded from local government processes, and community concerns were not heeded when the facility was approved.53 WHIASU experts suggested that the acceptance of the HIA at the local level was limited since HIA was not a statutory requirement, local planners did not understand the benefits of HIA, and they may have even perceived HIA as a protest tool.67 In contrast, the str ong support for HIA in the Wales Waste Strategy came after working closely with WHIASU over a number of years. Furthermore, HIA is a compulsory requirement for national and regional waste strategies in Wales. Vancouver Metro Vancouver developed a Solid Wa ste and Resource Management Plan in July 2010 which proposed waste management practices to 2020 including waste reduction and diversion targets, treatment methods, energy recovery and final disposal.68 The plan included economic and environmental assessments but not a health assessment. The completed plan was presented t o public health officials, municipal representatives, the public , and other stakeholders in a number of community consultations. The public health practitioners in the two affected regional health authorities were concerned with the absence of analysis of the public health impacts. There was also a high degree of community concern regarding the potential adverse environmental and health effects of a proposed waste -to-energy facility. The outcome remains uncertain since this process was still underway at the time of writing. Summary: health assessment in the Policy Phase These examples illustrate the benefits and limitations of HIA at the policy level. The Wales and Cardiff case studies illustrate that while health considerations may be well integrated into p olicy, politics at the local level may exclude health impacts during the planning and implementation stages. At the same time, the widespread education and capacity building conducted by WHIASU at the national level have led to understanding of and support for HIA principles that should trickle down to the local level with further capacity building. This illustrates the model where HIAs are integrated throughout waste policy, planning and projects. It was achieved through years of partnership between policy makers and planners and experts in HIA (WHIASU), and will require further partnerships with local government planners and decision -makers in order to be fully realised. In Metro Vancouver the absence of a health impact assessment likely contributed to the degree of public concern about the Solid Waste and Resource Management Plan in general, and specifically to resistance to a proposed waste -to-energy facility by multiple stakeholders. Nonetheless both Metro Vancouver and the public health practitioners ha ve engaged in communication with each other about health assessment for proposed facilities so it still remains to be seen whether a health assessment will be conducted and the nature of such an assessment. Health assessment in the Options Stage: comparin g health effects of proposed facility options Two case studies demonstrate the use of HA to compare waste treatment facility options. The objectives of the HA in each case led to two very different approaches. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 26 United Kingdom The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs used a standard HHRA methodology to estimate and compare health impacts of emissions from 10 hypothetical waste management treatment facilities representing five treatment technologies.8 This analysis was restricted to air emissions from waste facilities, which have be en identified as one of the key potential sources of health impacts. The authors concluded that all facilities, regardless of treatment technology, had minimal health effects. This assessment provided a comparison among treatment options in a standardised manner, but by design it was limited to a specific exposure -outcome pathway: exposures to air emissions and attributable respiratory, cardiovascular and cancer endpoints. It did not assess other emissions/exposure pathways, did not consider non -disease end points, and it did not model the distribution of health effects among population subgroups. Toronto City of Toronto Public Health oversaw an HIA to compare differential health effects of three waste treatment options under consideration in the 2010 -2021 wa ste management plan. The assessment was conducted by a consultant. Waste treatment options were evaluated across a broad range of health determinants based on 'level of concern' for health. The evaluation was conducted by a working group including City of Toronto public health and waste management staff members and the consultant. In the final analysis the environmental determinants (emissions to the environment, noise, et cetera) were found to best discriminate between the options, and formed the basis of the final ranking . The option that was favoured by the HIA was also the option subsequently selected by the waste management department using their own operational criteria. The report to the board of health suggests that this HIA influenced the waste mana gement department's decision on a mixed waste treatment option . 24 However, th e waste management department's decision was also influenced by their own internal process that favoured this option based on operational criteria. This HIA allowed a rapid evaluation of options across a range of determinants of health and brought together a working group from public health and waste management within the City of Toronto. Community stakeholders were not engaged in this HIA, but were engaged in a subsequent HIA at the Plan stage.q Summary: health assessment in the Options Phase However, it is difficult to assess the methodology used in th is HIA since criteria for assessing 'level of concern' were not described. Both of these examples demonstrate how HIA has been used to discriminate between options for treatment of residual waste in the proje ct planning stage for either hypothetical (UK) or proposed (Toronto) waste management facilities. At this stage the HIA has potential to influence the type of technologies and facility site; however in these examples HIA was restricted to comparing technology options. It is not clear whether these HIAs were used to inform decision -making because in the UK case the analysis was removed from a specific proposal, and in the Toronto case public health and solid waste management both favoured the same option, al beit using different criteria. In both cases the assessment focused on health outcomes mediated through environmental emissions. Although the Toronto case considered other social determinants of health in its initial analysis, these were felt to be less valuable in discriminating among options than environmentally mediated effects. In both cases the HIA was led by groups with expertise in health assessment, and other community stakeholders were not involved. qToronto Public Health conducted a second HIA once the site and facility for residual treatment were determined which is described in Appendix 3. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 27 Health assessment in the Plan Stage: evaluating health effects of a proposed facility Durham In Canada the usual practice is to conduct health assessment solely within the environmental impact assessment process. This is exemplified by the health assessment conducted within the EIA for a waste - to-energy project in Durham, Ontario. The primary objective of this assessment was to quantify health risks of emissions to environmental media (air, water, soil) using human health risk assessment ( HHRA ) methodology and to compare these to accepted standard risks. As is often the case, this HHRA was limited to effects of environmental emissions on a set of diseases rather than other social determinants of health. However, in addition to the quantitative results from the HHRA, the final report also listed potential effects on social, cultural, and economic environments, and proposed methods to mitigate impacts (for example, a community relations plan to mitigate potential effects on property values). The strengths of this assessment were the methodological rigor of t he quantitative assessment and that in contrast to typical HHRA within EIA, this analysis identified some potential effects on social determinants of health. Some weaknesses of this assessment include (1) incomplete assessment of determinants of health, (2 ) equity, the differential distribution of health effects among population sub - groups, was not formally considered, and, (3) the assessment was designed and conducted by a consultant under the directive of the EA office and did not involve a range of stake holders in either defining the scope or contextualizing the findings. These issues are common to health assessments conducted for the purpose of EIA, and are not limited to this project. Jersey The health assessment for a proposed waste- to-energy facility in Jersey,r UK took a completely different approach in both the definition of health and the methodology. This assessment was commissioned by the States of Jersey Department of Health and Social Services and conducted by an international consortium affilia ted with the World Health Organization.s Oversight was provided by a steering group composed of representatives from a range of stakeholder groups.t r Jersey is one of the Channel Islands situated i n the English Channel off of the French coast of Normandy. The objectives were to identify the potential health effects of a proposed waste -to-energy facility and to characterise their distribution. Health was broadly defined using a social determinants of health framework. The methods were highly participatory and focused on building consensus among stakeholders and community members (e.g., community consensus -buildin g meetings, Delphi method). The final analysis listed health impacts and classified them according to their direction (positive/negative), relative likelihood and latency. Recommendations included mitigation measures for these impacts. The strength of this HIA was its participatory approach: it brought stakeholders together and developed a common view of potential health impacts and mitigation measures. The major weakness was a lack of detail in the assessment, which the authors conceded was due to tradeoff s between the decision -making timeline and the comprehensiveness of this study. s International Health Impact Assessment Consortium at University of Liverpool.63 t The HIA steering group was comprised of representatives from the Departments of Health and Social Serv ices (Public Health), Transport and Technical Services, Planning, HIA and EIA consultants and the community. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 28 Kamloops The case study of a proposed microgasification plant in Kamloops demonstrates the possible pitfalls of not consulting communities early in the planning phase of a proj ect. A private corporation was proposing to build a plant to thermally treat logs impregnated with creosote using microgasification technology within the City of Kamloops, BC. The proponent did not consult either public health officials or the public until the project was well developed. In their assessment of permitting requests, public health officials assessed the health risks to be minimal but did not address some key concerns of the public. The public brought in an expert from the United States who pre sented on potential adverse health effects at a community meeting. By the time that a public consultation process had begun, many members of the public were highly concerned about health risks and they had a high degree of mistrust of both the proponent an d public health officials. The public had high degree of outrageu Summary: health assessment in the Plan Phase and the proponent withdrew the project. These examples of health assessment (HA) during the planning of individual waste management facilities illustrate the potential roles of HA at the Plan Stage. HA can be used to identify and characterise potential health effects and their distribution in the population. The methods of assessment may be quantitative or qualitative and suited to the objectives o f the HIA. It is not possible at this stage to use HA to inform either the choice of treatment technology or the site, since these were determined in prior stages. However, HA can be used to inform a health management plan that recommends measures to mitig ate adverse health effects and enhance health benefits. These HAs had different governance structures. In Durham consultants conducted the health assessment as part of an EIA process. In Jersey the department of health commissioned a consortium with expertise in HIA, and a multi -stakeholder board oversaw the process. The role of HIA in achieving a shared understanding among stakeholders should not be underestimated, as this was a key role for HIA in the Jersey case study and was identified as a potential co ntributor to public outrage in the Kamloops case study. Lessons Learned : health assessments for municipal solid waste policies and projects The case studies were examined to determine: (1) What were the objectives and methods of the HA? (2) What were the roles of health assessment experts and those of stakeholders in the assessment? Objectives and methods of the health assessment This series of case studies illustrate s health assessments at the policy , facility options and facility plan stages. They encompass hea lth assessments that that were limited to health impacts of changes to the physical environment and those that assessed health impacts of changes to the physical environment and the social determinants of health. Health assessments limited to assessment of health impacts related to changes in the physical environment did not go through the typical HIA process as outlined in Figure 2. Rather, they either used the EIA process (Durham) or conducted HHRA without record of screening or scoping (DEFRA). The metho d of assessment was a n HHRA approach based on HHRA where quantitative methods were used u Outrage is defined as excessive fear or anger about a small hazard and is related to factors such as trust, control, voluntariness, dread and fam iliarity.64 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 29 to assess health impacts. In order to use this approach, specific information about the facilities (e.g. scale, number, technologies, and adjacent populations) must be known and therefore they are suitable for estimating potential health impacts of proposed facilities, either for comparing proposals or informing approval of a single facility. This method is also applied at the operations stage, to model health impacts of emissions. We did not find an example of HHRA at the policy stage; however, it could be applied, for example to calculating potential health impacts of proposed waste reduction and diversion targets. Those assessments that did use the HIA process , whether at the plan, options or policy stage, generally shared a broader set of objectives: (1) to identify health impacts, (2) to characterise health impacts and their distribution, (3) to inform decisions, (4) to recommend ways to mitigate health impacts and measures to enhance health, (5) to identify stakeholder concerns and address them in the health assessment thereby facilitating a common understanding of health risks and benefits among multiple stakeholders. HIAs at each of the decision -making stages target ed their assessments to provide information for a specific decision. At the policy stage, arguably the decisions that will most affect health outcomes were made: how much waste will be allowed , how it will be segregated and in broad brush strokes where and how it will be treated. HIA was designed to evaluate social and economic implications of the decision and to develop a health management plan. At the options stage, HIA provided estimates of the different potential health impacts of various proposed facilities so that health benefits and risks of each scenario can be compared. At the facility plan stage, the inputs to a health assessment are more specific: the details of physical changes to the environment (e.g. emissions and traffic) and social determinan ts of health, population characteristics and vulnerabilities. At this stage the predictions of health impacts, regulatory and monitoring regimes and management plans are more specific. However, only minor changes to the waste management facility and operat ions can be made and therefore there is limited potential to influence health outcomes. The Kamloops, Vancouver and Cardiff case studies all illustrated that the concerns of the public and the public health communities can be heightened if health effects are not explicitly considered at the project and policy stages whereas the Jersey case study demonstrated how HIA can be used to identify and address public and public health concerns and reach a common understanding. The Cardiff case study also showed that even when HIA has broad community support it can be ineffective at informing decisions if it is excluded from planning processes. HIA is not the best tool for all situations. HIA is useful when there is a real or perceived risk to human health. In the for mer situation it can identify, characterise and propose ways to mitigate the risk, and in the latter it can characterise the risk and bring stakeholders' disparate views to a common understanding. HIA is useful when there are a number of options being cons idered and there are differences between them in the magnitude or health effects and/or the distribution of those effects among population sub -groups. At both the facility plan and facility operations stages standard planning and regulation for facilities may be sufficiently health protective, in which case HIA should only be considered if there is concern among stakeholders. In addition, HIA should be considered if there is a characteristic of the facility that renders it different from those with known or modelled impacts. For example, facilities using technologies which have not been tested at the scale of the proposed facility, and facilities which are closer to populations and vulnerable population subgroups. These are important considerations because i n these cases existing environmental and health protection regulations may not adequately protect health. HIA is generally not useful for projects operating far from populations, using known standard technology when existing regulations are protective of h ealth and there is no stakeholder concern.

Engage stakeholders in identifying measures to enhance health and mitigate potentia l harms associated with project/policy. Decision -makers are deciding from among several project/policy options. List health impacts and characterise their magnitude and distribution in the population. Compare options based on their health impacts and distribution of those among population subgroups. Roles of the health assessment experts and stakeholders The case studies illustrate a number of different models for governance and implementation of health assessments with variation in the roles of experts a nd stakeholder groups.v Three main parties may be involved in health assessment: experts in health assessment, stakeholders with specialized technical knowledge (e.g., waste management engineers, planners, and public health practitioners), and community st akeholders (e.g., residents and population sub -groups).w Experts in health assessment usually lead some or all of the assessment tasks: scoping the question, designing the assessment protocol, conducting the assessment and reporting findings. Stakeholders may take on a variety of roles from strictly commenting on results of the assessment to guiding the experts in designing questions and assessment methods or conducting the assessment themselves. The governance models for quantitative HAs were different from those for HIAs. For quantitative HAs, the process was led by technical experts within government (United Kingdom) or consultant groups (Durham). HIAs followed two different governance patterns. In the first, an advisory group/steering group comprised o f community and specialist stakeholders guided the HIA objectives and protocol and experts performed the assessment (e.g., Wales, Jersey). In the second, a small working group of stakeholders v The roles of proponents are not discussed here. Proponents provide technical specifications on proposed facilities. In those cases where a proposed facility is undergoing an environmental impact assessment in BC, the pr oponent is responsible for hiring the consultant to conduct the health assessment. In these cases the specifications of the health assessment are determined through the EIA process as conducted by the Environmental Assessment Office. w These parties may ov erlap. For example stakeholder with specialised technical knowledge may also have expertise in health assessment. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 31 with specialized knowledge (city staff with expertise in public health and waste management) conducted the assessment using a framework and information about the treatment options provided by a consultant with expertise in HIA (e.g., Toronto). The involvement of public health professionals and community stakeholders in governance of HIAs supports a more fulsome analysis of health impacts. Public health professionals were instrumental in commissioning and conducting the Toronto HIA, and were involved in governance of a number of other HIAs discussed here. Public health physicians are uniquely trained to assess the health status of populations and to evaluate scientific evidence about health impacts of interventions. They are skilled at examining a range of social determinants of health, and implementing measures to mitig ate harm and improve health. Medical health officers and environmental health officers are familiar with the unique populations and issues in communities. Some health authorities have additional staff with the skills to assess a variety of human exposures (i.e. risk assessors) and to consult with communities as to their concerns (i.e. community developers). Health authorities will inevitably be called upon to respond to concerns about any health effects of waste management in their jurisdiction. In addition , public health professionals may request a health assessment for waste management plans under development (e.g. Vancouver case study). If public health professionals are involved at the outset, then these health assessments can be conducted as part of plan rather than as an afterthought. Since public health professionals contribute key skills to HIAs, they should, at a minimum, be involved in scoping and reviewing HIAs. Community stakeholders have also made important contributions to HIA. One of the key ob jectives of HIAs in several of these case studies was: to identify community concerns about health impacts of policies, options and projects. Community input is key to addressing community concerns, developing common understanding of risks and benefits of projects, and can prevent unnecessary project delays or cancellation due to outrage. However, HIAs conducted by community groups and others that are outside of the decision -making process risk being ignored as shown in the Cardiff example. A range of healt h assessment experts were engaged in health assessments in these case studies and the types of health assessment experts corresponded to the methodologic approach. HHRA was conducted by either consultant groups as part of an environmental impact assessment (Durham) or government agencies with HHRA expertise (United Kingdom). Health impact assessment was commissioned by government agencies and led either by private consultants (e.g., Toronto, Wales), or by a consortium of agencies such as academics, World He alth Organization and public health departments (e.g., Jersey, Cardiff). HIAs only occurred when supported by experts in HIA methods from outside public health departments, either consultants or consortiums. Two consortiums were involved in conducting HIA s in the case studies. The Wales Health Impact Assessment Support Unit (WHIASU) is a university -based, government funded consortium whose goals are: (1) to support effective HIA practice, (2) to provide direct consultation to those performing HIA in Wales and (3) to build research and evidence to improve assessments of policies programs and projects. 69 One of the key roles of the unit is to educate various levels of government about the practice and value of HIA to inform decisions about policies, programs and projects. The Jersey HIA was conducted by a similar group based at the University of Liverpool, International Health Impac t Assessment Consortium (IMPACT). 63 Their objectives are to promote HIA in policy and planning through research, consultancy and training and capacity building. Like WHIASU, IMPACT partners with the WHO and health agencies. In contrast, IMPACT a lso partners with the European Commission and private developers, and it is international rather than domestic and it is self-financing rather than funded by a national government. There is no such consortium to support HIA practice in Canada. A number of groups have compiled HIA resources and case studies (e.g., National Collaborating Centre (NCC) for Healthy Public Policy 70 and NCC Environmental Health.71 Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 32 Propose d Approach to Health Impact Assessment for Waste Management in BC Key decisions that affect health outcomes are made each phase of decision -making: setting waste policy, deciding among waste treatment and facility options, planning waste facilities and ope rating them. HIA is a useful process to identify and characterise health impacts arising from physical, social and economic changes associated with waste management projects. HIA may also be instrumental in identifying public concerns about waste managemen t and facilitating discussion with the public. Therefore health impact assessment should be considered in each of these stages by screening to determine whether HIA is necessary. A proposed process for HIA for waste management in BC is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 .3 Proposed process for health assessment of waste management projects in BC All waste management decisions, whether at the policy, options, plan or operations stage should undergo a \"screening HIA\" to determine whether h ealth assessment is warranted. This would address a gap in the current process, where only decisions at the plan and operations stages have health assessments, but decisions at the policy and options stages have important health impacts. At the policy and facility options stages, the screening HIA should determine whether there is important health trade -offs among the options considered, including health outcomes related to changes in the Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 33 physical environment and those related to changes in the social and economic environments. At the facility plan stage, the screening HIA should determine whether health impact assessment may be adequately addressed by an integrated health and environmental impact assessment process with augmented health assessment (e.g., i ntegrated health and environmental assessment). At the facility operations stage the screening HIA should address whether existing regulations are health protective and whether there is widespread concern among community members and other stakeholders (see Table 3 for examples of situations where HIA is warranted) . Screening HIA should be conducted by the agency responsible for the decision, with expert input from public health practitioners. The outcome of the HIA screening will be a decision as to whether an HIA is warranted and what decision it will inform. If an HIA is warranted then the scope and methodology should be specifically targeted to address a defined decision. The scope, methods and timelines of the HIA would be determined in the scoping phase . The comprehensiveness of HIA may be limited by a number of factors including available resources and the timeframe of the decision -making process. During scoping these limitations should guide planning. In addition , the roles of various agencies should b e determined (i.e. Who governs? Who conducts? Who critiques? Who oversees implementation of recommendations?) . The governance structure of HIA should include a range of stakeholders representing public health, community, local government, relevant provinc ial ministries, and others in order to ensure a balanced approach and to achieve credibility with these stakeholders. HIA is most influential when it is integrated into the policy or planning processes and when HIAs are conducted outside of these processes they risk having their results ignored during decision -making. It must be clear whether public health agencies are engaged in HIA governance, leading the HIA or providing critical oversight of the process conducted by another group (e.g. consultant, propo nent, other government ministry, HIA consortium). The roles of HIA experts may include: Conducting health impact assessments using local health data Developing training and capacity -building for health authorities, city waste management engineers, Environ mental Assessment Office, various levels of government developing waste management policy and projects Providing resources and consultation to health authorities engaged in assessment of health impacts of waste management either through providing critical comments on external assessments or conducting their own assessments HIA is only possible when (1) there is access to expertise in HIA methods, and (2) sufficient resources are allocated to conducting HIA. HIA is a specific suite of methods that requires e xpert support. While health departments, waste management departments and other stakeholders are involved in HIA, all of HIAs in our case studies relied on access to HIA expertise from either hired consultants or consortiums with expertise in HIA. Regardle ss of which role public health agencies take on, there is a need to develop access to expertise in HIA. No HIA in any of the case studies was conducted by public health agencies witho ut external expertise. Those public health agencies that do conduct HIAs (e.g. Montreal Public Health, San Francisco Public Health) have staff and other resources specifically targeted for this role. BCCDC has conducted a regional scan of risk assessment capacity, and in BC, there is currently not sufficient capacity to conduct or critique HIAs for waste management or other large projects within regional or provincial public health agencies. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 34 Expert consultation could be funded by a variety of mechanisms including targeted allocation of permitting and licensing fees. Once establ ished, access to expert consultation for HIA should not be limited to waste management issues but should also be used for other environmental policies and projects with potential health effects. Once the HIA is completed and recommendations have been made, a mechanism is needed to ensure that recommendations are carried out. One of the major criticisms of HIAs conducted to date is that there is little follow -up to assess whether recommendations made in HIAs have been followed. Assessment and monitoring of o utcomes following HIA are important for ensuring that health recommendations are followed. In order to achieve this mechanism, options need to be developed by the Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Environment, Environmental Assessment Office and other relevant ministries and agencies. For example, HIA recommendations may be linked to other regulatory processes such as approval of environmental impact assessments, and permitting conducted through the Ministry of Environment. HIAs are based on best available evidence and best available technologies at the time of the assessment. However, both the state of the evidence of health impacts arising from physical, social and economic factors and the available technologies change over time. Therefore a mechanism sh ould be established to review health impacts of policies and facilities to ensure that they reflect the state of the evidence and use best available pollution control technologies. The approach to conducting regular review can be developed by the province. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 35 Recommendations The Waste- to-Energy working group of BC Environmental Health Policy Advisory Committee proposes a process for health assessment of waste management in British Columbia. 1. All waste management decisions should undergo a screening HIA to de termine whether HIA should be conducted, and if so, the nature of the HIA. All decisions regarding waste management policies, projects and operations should be screened for potential health impacts and, if warranted based on the screening process, then sho uld undergo a health impact assessment. At the policy and facility options stages, the screening HIA should determine whether there are important health trade- offs among the options considered, including health outcomes related to changes in the physical environment and those related to changes in the social and economic environments. At the facility plan stage, the screening HIA should determine whether health impact assessment may be adequately addressed by an integrated health and environmental impact assessment process with augmented health assessment (e.g., integrated health and environmental assessment). At the facility operations stage the screening HIA should address whether existing regulations are health protective and whether there is widespread c oncern among community members and other stakeholders. Screening HIA should be conducted by the agency responsible for the decision, with expert input from public health practitioners. 2. When HIAs are conducted, the scope and methodology of the HIA should be designed to address the specific decision that it will inform. The scope and methods of the HIA should be suited to the decision that it will inform. Rapid HIA may fit into tight timelines of planning and is valuable for identifying risks for well- established technologies, more comprehensive assessment may be needed when the policy or project has unusual or untested features (e.g., larger scale, closer proximity to populations). Risk assessment methods are valuable for quantifying disease outcomes of emiss ions, whereas qualitative methods are stronger where the risk relationship is less certain (as for many social determinants of health), for engaging multiple stakeholders, identifying and addressing public concerns. 3. Community stakeholders should be consult ed to identify their concerns about health impacts related to waste disposal policies, proposals and projects. This can be conducted at the level of the province, regional district and/or by proponents as suited to the situation. Community consultations ar e particularly important when community members are concerned about the health implications of a policy, options or project. The case studies demonstrate that when community members are not adequately consulted, there can be increased controversy, acrimony and in some case projects have been delayed or cancelled. In contrast, within HIA community members share in the conversations, and their roles can range from consultant to decision -making. Community consultations should not be restricted to a forum for c ommunity members to learn about policies, options or projects. At a minimum, community consultations should be used to elicit and list community concerns that will then be used to help frame the terms of reference for an HIA. This must be conducted early in the HIA during the scoping phase. In addition, community members should be given an opportunity to recommend measures to mitigate potential impacts and these should be considered in the recommendations. In some circumstances, community members may have a much broader role which could include conducting analyses and evaluations of potential health impact and/or other roles in the HIA. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 36 4. Public health agencies and their staff should play a key role in leading or critiquing health impact assessments of policie s and projects with environmental health implications, such as waste management. Public health agencies could either take the lead in conducting health impact assessments or they could provide critical oversight of the HIA process from scoping through ass essment and recommendations. Each of these models has been used in other jurisdictions and there are advantages and disadvantages to each. In certain policies and projects it may be more appropriate for health to take the lead, whereas in others the role o f critiquing may be more suitable. In either situation, public health professionals, including physicians, environmental health officers and others on their team should provide an analysis of whether to accept the adequacy of a health assessment. Public he alth and preventive medicine (PHPM) physicians are trained in assessing health of populations across the range of determinants of health and in the evaluation of scientific evidence including qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Medical health offic ers should work with public health teams to lead/critique the terms of reference for the health assessment and lead/critique the health assessments. In order to effectively fulfill these roles, public health professionals within health authorities will nee d to be augmented to include capacity to critique/conduct HIA including understanding HIA and HHRA processes, and will require access to expertise on health impact assessment and project -specific content. 5. The province should invest in building the required expertise and capacity to support the public health role in HIA for environmental health issues, in particular for waste management. Access to such expertise may be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms including establishing a provincial body with expertise in health agencies (e.g. PHSA, BCCDC) or within the Ministry of Health or the Office of the Provincial Health Officer. Alternatives would be to develop a list of approved consultants for HIA. The roles of HIA experts may include: Conducting heal th impact assessments using local health data Developing training and capacity -building for health authorities, city waste management engineers, Environmental Assessment Office, various levels of government developing waste management policy and projects Providing resources and consultation to health authorities engaged in assessment of health impacts of waste management either through providing critical comments on external assessments or conducting their own assessments Expert consultation could be funded by a variety of mechanisms including targeted allocation of permitting and licensing fees. Once established, access to expert consultation for HIA should not be limited to waste management issues but should also be used for other environmental policies an d projects with potential health effects. 6. The province should establish a mechanism to ensuring that recommendations from HIA are carried out. One of the major criticisms of HIAs conducted to date is that there is little follow- up to assess whether recomme ndations made in HIAs have been followed. Assessment and monitoring of outcomes following HIA are important for ensuring that health recommendations are followed. In order to achieve this Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 37 mechanism, options need to be developed by the Ministry of Health, M inistry of the Environment, Environmental Assessment Office and other relevant ministries and agencies. For example, HIA recommendations may be linked to other regulatory processes such as approval of environmental impact assessments, and permitting conduc ted through the Ministry of Environment. 7. Waste management policies and facilities should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the mitigation measures reflect the latest evidence and available technologies. This can be conducted at the level of the province, regional district and/or by proponents as suited to the situation. HIAs are based on best available evidence and best available technologies at the time of the assessment. However, both the state of the evidence of health impacts arising from ph ysical, social and economic factors and the available technologies change over time. Therefore a mechanism should be established to review health impacts of policies and facilities to ensure that they reflect the state of the evidence and use best availabl e pollution control technologies. The approach to conducting regular review can be developed by the province. 8. Human health risk assessment (HHRA) methods should be used to assess health impacts of all new MSWI and all major upgrades to existing MSW thermal treatment facilities. The epidemiologic literature on incineration is not directly generalizable to modern incinerators. Given that emissions from thermal treatment facilities in 2012 are well below those reported in epidemiologic literature, published risk estimates are not relevant to modern incinerators. Our evidence review identified three major knowledge gaps: (1) absence of epidemiologic studies on the health effects of modern MSWI, (2) absence of epidemiologic studies of health effects associated w ith pyrolysis and gasification facilities, and (3) absence of emissions inventories for pollutants other than heavy metals and dioxins (e.g., ultrafines, nanoparticles). HHRA should be based on known toxicologic hazards of emitted pollutants rather than pu blished risk estimates from the epidemiologic literature. If new studies are published that provide relevant risk estimates, then this recommendation will need to be re - examined. At each of the decision -making stages, HHRA should be conducted for specific scenarios. In the options stage HHRA should be conducted as part of the regional district assessment of options. In the plan stage HHRA should be conducted as part of the EIA. In the operations stage HHRA should be conducted by the Ministry of Environment in their WDA process. As upgrades of facilities are considered by Ministry of Environment, or changes to waste management factors (e.g. waste streams, volume, et cetera) by Regional Districts, then HHRA should be considered. 9. HHRAs should address the spec ific characteristics of the proposed facility thermal treatment technology, pollution control systems and transportation routes. The following factors should be considered in the HHRA: Air emissions of facility and waste transport Air, soil and water conc entrations at receptors Exposures related to handling and disposal of solid wastes Exposures of human receptors along transportation routes Exposures to other physical hazards (e.g. noise) Other factors identified by public health professionals, stakeholde rs or community members as appropriate Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 38 10. Thermal treatment facilities should use the best available pollution control technology and upgrade this technology as improvements are available in order to reduce emissions to levels at or below regulatory guideline s. This can be achieved during permitting by BC Ministry of Environment. The committee concludes that risk estimates from thermal treatment facilities in the published literature involved MSWI with dioxin emissions well above current regulatory standards ( 80 pg/m 3 TEQ) and are therefore not applicable to modern incinerators that operate within these standards. However, a number of uncertainties remain and Thermal treatment employs technologies for thermal treatment, air pollution control and transportation air pollution control that are developing over time. The types of by -products that are produced (e.g. air emissions, wastewater effluents, solid waste residue and solid wastes from air pollution control devices) will vary by facility and as new technologies are developed. We recognise that achieving the lowest possible emissions levels is optimal for health, and that regular upgrades to pollution control technologies are one mechanism to achieve this. 11. HHRA should model exposures and health outcomes for vul nerable populations as well as the general public. Certain populations such as the elderly, children, and developing fetuses are more vulnerable to some adverse health effects from exposure to contaminants. Public health practitioners are knowledgeable about the vulnerable populations within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the list of vulnerable populations should be determined based on the best available evidence and in consultation with local public health practitioners.

The facility manages approximately 20% of the Lower Mainland's waste, mainly from Burnaby, New Westminster, and the Nort h Shore.72 Technology, I nputs , and O utputs The MV WTEF manages Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). The facility has t hree mass burn processing lines; each one processes approximately 850 tonnes of waste per day (Table 6). Annually, 285,000 tonnes of MSW are turned into 940,000 tonnes of steam and 132 GWh of electricity72; daily o utputs include 130 tonnes of bottom ash and 30 tonnes of fly ash (Table 6 ). Figure 7 depicts the operation of a processing line. In 2003, a turbo generator was installed that uses the steam to produce electricity. In 2006, a $7 million upgrade was complete d to increase the amount of heat recovered from waste and , therefore , the amount of electricity produced.

See Table 10 for Metro Vancouver's figure s presenting the levels of various compounds with corresponding regulatory levels between 1998 and 2009.74 According to these figures, none of these compounds are currently above the regulatory level. Nitrogen oxides were elevated between 1988 and 1994/1995, and 'class 1 metals' (cadmiu m, mercury, thallium) were slightly elevated in 1999, but have since decreased. Soil and Vegetation M onitoring As part of the Greater Vancouver Regional District's (GVRD) ambient monitoring program, monitoring of the impact of the MV WTEF on the neighbo uring area's soils and vegetation was conducted. Incinerator pre-operational monitoring was conducted in 19 87 to develop background levels and then samples were collected for 3 consecutive years following the start -up of the incinerator in 1988.74 Soil and vegetation samples were collect ed from eight monitoring sites in Delta, Richmond , and Burnaby ; selected in the projected maximum fall out areas and to reflect both the diversity of land uses and native ecosystem in the vicinity of the incinerator. There were si x agricultural monitoring sites and two non -agricultural sites, representing native ecosystems, were added in 1988. Soil and vegetation matter were analyzed for six elements : [arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), and mercury (Hg)] (see Table 9 ) as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); vegetation samples were also analyzed for fluoride (F) and sulphur (S). Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 43 Table A.4 Average element concentration in surface soil75 The GVRD (1992) report concluded there was no evidence that the MV WTEF emissions had any adverse impact on soil and vegetation trace element or PAH levels. Cadmium at a particular site and nicke l at another site were elevated, but it is suggested that the probable cause is something other than the incinerator operation 75 (see Table 10 for details ). It does not appear that subsequent soil and vegetation monitoring continued, therefore it is not possible to assess a long- term trend. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 44 Table A.5 Information on elements sampled in soil and vegetation (1987 - 1990 )12 Elements Soil and Vegetation Sampling Arsenic Natural background level for arsenic in soil: 5 \u00b5g/g. Some monitoring sites slightly exceeded this background level, but the report concludes there is no evidence that arsenic ha s accumulated in surface soil during incinerator operation (note that levels in 1990 were below the 1987 level at 5/6 agricultural sites and below the 1988 level at both non- agricultural sites). Cadmium Natural background level: 1 \u00b5g/g. in all but one sit e; most of the time, annual average concentration of cadmium in soils remained below the natural background level. In 1989, one site's concentration approached the proposed remediation level of 5 \u00b5g/g. In 1990, the concentration decreased to levels very si milar to those of pre -incinerator start -up measured in 1987. The cadmium concentration in soils at all monitoring sites in 1990 was lower than in one or more of the previous sampling years. The report concludes that a relationship cannot be drawn between i ncinerator operation and measured concentrations in the soil. Lead The highest lead concentration (328 \u00b5g/g) in a single sample occurred in 1990 at a particular site; other samples from the same site ranged from 63 to 120 \u00b5g/g. After removing this sample from the data bank, the average value for the site was 92 \u00b5g/g; following a similar pattern observed at the other sampling sites. In 1990, the lead level decreased below 1989 levels and at several sites even went below the 1988 level. The site with the hi ghest lead level still had concentrations less than half of the proposed objective for soil remediation in BC. The presence of leaded gasoline is discussed as a factor. Mercury Annual average mercury concentrations in 1990 varied from 0.1 to 0.65 \u00b5g/g. Of the 8 sampling sites, annual average values decreased at 5 sites and increased at 3 other sites. In all cases, mercury levels are less than 1/3 of the proposed remediation objective for mercury. Note that data for mercury concentration in surface soil, analyzed by the cold vapour mercury method, is available for 1989 and 1990 only. Nickel Nickel concentration in surface soil increased in 1988 and 1989, but in 1990 the concentration decreased (at 5 sites, it even decreased below the 1988 level). In all but 2 sites, nickel levels remained below the natural background level. All annual averages were less than half the proposed remediation objective. Selenium Generally, concentrations of selenium in soils at all monitoring sites were close to or below natural background levels. Concentrations in surface soils decreased each year since 1987. Envi ronmental (EIA) and Health Impact (HIA) A ssessments There is no record of HIA being conducted. The BC environmental impact assessment legislation was not in place at the time of the MV WTEF start- up. Beyond the air emissions and early soil studies, there is no record of EIA.

In a pulse jet baghouse , the particulate matter accumulates on the outside of bags in which stiffeners are used to retain the shape. The particulates drop off the outside of the bags when a pulse of air is forced into the bag.76 Bottom ash - Solid waste that is not completely burned on the grate. Dscm - Dry standard cubic meter Fly ash - Solid and condensable particulate matter which leaves the furnace suspended in the combustion gases and are subsequently collected in emi ssion control devices. Mass burn processing - Mass burn plants are designed to burn unprocessed solid waste (waste processing is minimal, only involve s mixing and drying of wastes). This is distinguished from refuse derived fuel (RDF) plants which have was te pre -processing and sorting into resource streams.76 Municipal solid waste - As of 1992, the Waste Management Act defines MSW to mean : (a) refuse that originates from residential, commercial, institutional, demolition, land clearing or construction sources, or (b) refuse specified by a manager to be included in waste management. The definition of MSW implicitly excludes sewage sludge, agricultural waste , and indus trial wood waste. 77 Scrubbers - used to decrease acid gas emissions and increase condensation of metals and organics. There are a variety of designs. An alkaline reagent such as lime is injected for absorption and neutralization. In dry injection scrubbers, the alkaline reagent is used without water, producing a dry salty residue containing a combinatio n of alkaline and acidic agents. In wet -dry or spray -dry absorbers, both water and alkaline reagent are injected; the reagent enters th e scrubber in wet (slurry) form and exits as a dry residue, with the water having been eva porated in the scrubber.

Experts assessments were used to construct a semi- quantitative estimate of the emissions of each incinerator. The Delphi method was used to achieve consensus. A Gaussian plume model was used to compute 'immissions' for each category of pollutants within 10 km of the plant. 3 levels of dioxin exposure were used. Four categories of malformations: minor, chromosomal, monogenic and other. The 'other major anomalies' consists of 23 subgroups.

Distance within a prescribed area (app. 2 -5 km) around each site. Psychosocial impacts: concern about the facility, health concern about the facility, actions taken in response to facility concerns an d expressed intention to move due to concerns about the facility. The type of facility is the strongest predictor of residents' awareness, concern and action taken in response to concerns, with residents living near a landfill site having higher scores on these aspects.

Ecological - surveys among residents before and after the incinerator started working.

Interviews were conducted. Risk perception was assessed by 5 items: general evaluation of risk, the perceived likelihood of the incinerator provoking a series of negative consequences (headaches, respi ratory diseases, air pollution and auditory pollution). Psychological symptoms: stress; anxiety and depression. Perceived environmental quality and attitudes towards the incinerator were also assessed. Risk perception is more acute for residents living cl ose to the site, who also have a less favourable attitude; there is an habituation effect for those living closer to the incinerator: they now have less extreme attitudes and a lower estimation of risk; psychological symptoms are associated with socio- econ omic variables, but also with environmental annoyance; for those living close to the site, risk perception and the interaction between risk perception and environmental annoyance significantly increase the prediction of psychological symptoms. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 70 Appendix E : Health assessment methods There are two basic approaches to assessment of health impacts: human health risk assessment ( HHRA ) and sociologic methods (ranking and qualitative). HHRA is a quantitative method that arises from an epidemiologic and toxicological approach to human health impacts and models health outcomes attributable to specific environmental emissions. Sociologic methods use ranking and/or qualitative descriptions to compare health outcomes. These methods are described in more detail below. HHRA is quantitative approach that uses associations between specific environmental parameters and health outcomes that have been established through epidemiologic and/or toxicologic research to predict health outcomes caused by the environmental outputs of a project/policy. These predictions inform a risk management strategy that outlines project/policy options and associated health risks. HHRA is standard method with several steps (Figure 1). First the issue is identified and defined, the hazards are characterised including dose -response assessment and the exposures are assessed including pathways, populations and predicted intakes. These hazard and exposure assessments inform risk characterisation: the likelihood of adverse health effects is modeled and un certainty evaluated. During the final step, risk management, the assessed risk is placed into social, economic, environmental and political context and recommendations are made. HHRA methodology is strong at predicting health outcomes for projects or polic ies when the health effects of substances of concern are well established (i.e. dose -response relationships, effect estimates) and exposure can be accurately estimated (e.g mortality attributable to incremental increases in ambient fine particulate matter) . HHRA is limited to substances/emissions that are measured and for which toxicity and dose -response relationships are known. Furthermore HHRA is generally limited to disease outcomes. Other non -disease determinants of health, such as equity and employment with are generally excluded from the assessment. In contrast, the sociologic approaches are ideologically aligned with community -based health promotion models and the Ottawa Charter on Health Promotion. 78,79 The assessment itself consists of prediction of the direction and magnitude of potential health impacts. HAs true to this method emphasize participation as a key o bjective of the assessment, with stakeholders driving the process and performing much or all of the assessment. The objectives are not only the prediction of potential health impacts and their direction (negative/positive) but also community empowerment in decision -making. A broad range of health effects may be estimated including illness/disease as well as employment, social factors and other determinants of health; however in practice a smaller number of key health effects are selected for assessment. Recommendations often include actions to mitigate potential impacts. Published HAs are heterogeneous in terms of: which evidence to include, who is doing the assessment, the level of community/stakeholder participation, and whether equity will be considered. Most of these HAs follow some variation of the standard HIA process .

Termed 'microgasification ', this process uses heat, pressure, and steam to convert solid materials into a synthetic gas (syngas).81 The gas can then be used as energy for a variety of processes. ACC had proposed selling this energy from their proposed Kamloops plant to BC Hydro, a provincial Crown Corporation. Heat produced would also be potentially for sale. In August 2008, ACC proposed a plan to build a microgasification plant in Kamloops, British Columbia (BC), Canada to convert creosote -treated railway ties to energy. This case study will examine the permitting and review processes tha t went into examining the potential health and environmental impacts such a plant would have had on the residents of Kamloops. This is NOT an attempt to conduct an environmental or health impact assessment on this proposal. Summary of Events In August 2008 , the ACC proposed a plan to build a microgasification plant in Kamloops, British Columbia (BC), Canada to convert creosote -treated railway ties to energy. Kamloops is a mid -sized city of approximately 92 000 people in the interior of British Columbia.82 Figures 8 and 9 show the proposed locat ion of the plant in relation to populated residential areas in Kamloops. In August 2009, the ACC applied for an air discharge permit from the Ministry of Environment (MoE). Previously (April 2009), t he MoE met with ACC representatives for a pre -application meeting ; consultation requirements and scope of the environmental impact assessment were agreed upon at that meeting. Subsequently, the ACC conducted its consultation and fulfi lled its legal requirements without MoE involvement. Under the Public Notificat ion Regulation of the Environmental Management Act , the ACC was required to notify the public by placing an advertisement in the Kamloops Daily News and the BC Gazette. Upon advertising, the public had 30 days to provide comments; no comments were received during those 30 days. The public started to become aware of the issue following an August 22, 2009 news story in the Kamloops Daily News , detailing ACC's plans for a microgasification plant3. Following the news story, the MoE extended the 30 -day public co nsultation period ; this period ran from June 15, 2009 to January 7, 2010. Over 100 residents expressed their concerns directly to the MoE. These concerns were summarized in a letter the MoE sent to the ACC in September 2009 requesting additional informatio n in support of their air discharge permit application. This was provided by the ACC to the MoE in October 2009. On August 30, 2009, a citizens group ( Save Kamloops ) organized in opposition to the ACC's building of a microgasification plant in Kamloops and brought in Paul Connett PhD, a professor of chemistry at a New York state liberal arts college, to speak at a public meeting. The next day he addressed Kamloops city councillors about the pl ant. Following the presentation on September 1, 2010, city counci llors voted unanimously to oppose the microgasification plant. Dr. Connett's presentation highlighted : the inexperience of the operator, the scaling up of the North Dakota research project from a small scale operation to a commercial operation, the fact th at commercial gasification plants have had a poor track record in that their actual environmental record is worse than modeling, the potential health effects of burning creosote -treated railway ties, and the disposal of toxic by -products. The presentation also convinced those in attendance that the microgasification plant was an \"incinerator in disguise.\" Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 73 Following a comprehensive and rigorous review of the proposal by professional ministry staff, who are also residents of Kamloops, a permit was granted by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) January 7, 2010. However, w ithin 30 days a private citizen appealed the decision. A public forum of over 500 residents, hosted by the Kamloops Chamber of C ommerce, was held in March 2010 to solicit public opinion. Reacti on was unanimous at the public forum. Residents were concerned with t he untested microgasifier plant and any adverse health effects that may follow. Shortly thereafter, the ACC's CEO stated that the plant would not be built in Kamloops. However, t he permi t remains valid. An appeal to the environmental appeal board , initially scheduled for December 2010, has been postponed indefinitely due to the fact that the ACC no longer has plans to build a plant in Kamloops. Figures 8 and 2 depict the proposed location of the microgasification plant in relation to the rest of Kamloops. It is important to note the proximity of the Kamloops Indian Reservation to the proposed site. Although the name of the ACC involves the term \"Aboriginal\", it was not on Aboriginal land. However, the ACC could have easily moved across to the Indian Reservation and not needed a MoE permit or Interior Health Authority approval.

Their main reactor is 1 megawatt (MW) based on a combustion of about 1.5 to 2 tons of biomass per hour or 15 000 tons per year. The ACC claims that although the Kamloops site was proposed to process railway ties, their technology enables any type of biomass to be utilized. Figure F.3 Downdraft microgasification process Assessment of Health Impacts Kamloops is a mid -sized city of approximately 92 000 people in the interior of British Columbia.82 Figures 8 and 9 show the proposed location of the plant in relation to populated residential areas in Kamloops. The west end of Kamloops is directly downwind of the proposed plant, and would therefore be most affected by air emissions. Heal th effects were not assessed by the ACC and the BC MoE as part of their waste discharge permitting process for a Biomass to Energy facility. However, the ACC did conduct internal reviews on which this case study will focus. The Interior Health Authority was also consulted on the entire project ; their main concern was with potential health impacts associated with air emissions from the plant. In a December 7, 2009 letter , the following recommendations were outlined for the ACC: best available technology be u sed to achieve the lowest possible emission levels; a sufficient sampling regime be in place; contingency plans be incorporated into the permit ; operation of the flare stack should function on restri ctive operating conditions only; noted program to scre en railway ties to limit potential contaminants being introduced to the process should be c learly defined and administered; operation is conditional on the use of CP (Canadian Pacific) railway ties only; a dust control monito ring program should be in place ; Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 76 fire prevention and control measures are maintained to the satisfaction of the Kamloops Fire Department. In BC, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is triggered when the proposed project will gen erate more than 50 MW of energy or if more than 225 t onnes per day of municipal waste is incinerated.84 Thus, an EIA was never done as the threshold to trigger an EIA was not reached. The following evaluation of the assessment process undertaken by the ACC and the MoE is based on the Health Impact Assessment framework for municipal solid waste management developed by Toronto Publ ic Health. 85 Environmental Factors Air Q uality : An air quality assessment was done by Stantec consultants for t he ACC. This assessment was subsequently reviewed by staff at the MOE. The proposed site of the microgasification plant sits next to the Domtar pulp mill. The maximum rate of air emissions discharge from the pulp mill is 26 000 m 3/minute with a maximum con centration of particulate of 230 mg/m3. The estimated maximum rate of air emissions discharge from the ACC plant is 300 m3/minute with a maximum concentration of 5 mg/m particulate matter.86 The ACC also conducted its own independent airshed modeling and research on emissions associated with gasification and creosote. Medical Health Officers and Environmental Health Officers at the Interior Health Authority and environmental health scientists at the BC Centre for Disease Control were consulted. The BC Lung Association also reviewed the permit. Assuming that the plant ran according to its specifications, none of these organizations had any concerns regarding the potential health impa ct of the plant. H ealth of the population , with respect to air quality , was adequately taken into account, based on the internal air quality assessment, airshed modeling, and research on emissions done internally by the ACC. Modeling shows very low particu late matter emissions, as low as a single wood -burning stove. Odour: Assessed by bot h the MOE and internally by the ACC, t hey conclude d that due to the small size of the plant, any odour would be negligible. Possible impacts on odour to health (e.g., qual ity of life) were addressed and noted to be negligible. Surface Water Q uality : The permit requires the ACC to \"make all reasonable efforts to construct and maintain surface water diversion works to prevent surface water from entering or leaving active areas of the site.\" The following environmental factors were not explicitly addressed: groundwater quality, soil quality, land use, vegetation noise, and the built environment Other Determinants of Health The only determinant of health mentioned was the socio -economic benefit of the creation of up to 25 jobs. However, the health impacts of this were not assessed. The following factors were not addressed: Access to services, such as health services, social services, education, transpo rtation, and leisure activ ities; Lifestyle factors, such as diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, drug use, and sexual behaviour; Equity factors, such as age, sex, minorities or other disadvantaged groups, and ability. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 77 Overall Evaluation After reviewing the above informat ion, the MOE concluded that the environmental impact would be minimal. The major emission, particulate matter to th e air, was found to be very low. The Ministry's risk rank value, based on a quantitative environmental risk asses sment, was considered to be low -risk. Therefore, a waste discharge permit was granted January 2010. Discussion and Future Directions In this case study of the proposed microgasification plant in Kamloops, a limited environmental assessment was done. Because of the small size of this facility (1MW), a formal environmental impact assessment was not triggered. However, experts from the MoE staff, including an air quality meteorologist, a chemist, a chemical engineer, and an environmental protection officer, have reviewed technical infor mation and evidence to support the application. MoE staff also conducted its own independent airshed modeling and research on emissions associated with gasification and creosote. A formal review was provided only by the company involved. Despite the concl usion of low health risk based on environmental assessment, other key social determinants of health were not addressed in the process: lifestyle (such as diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, drug use, and sexual behaviour), equity , and socio -econ omic issues ; for example, perception by the adjacent residents that the plant would decrease the land value and thereby affect their socioeconomic status, and ultimately their health. While the ACC did address the economic benefits of potentially providing up to 25 jobs for the community, they did not address the potential negative socio -economic effects of the plant. At a public forum held in March 2010 to elic it public reaction, l ocal residents opposed the plant. Participants were concerned with the fact that a plant of this type had never been used to convert creosote -treated railway ties to energy. They were concerned with the environmental and human health effects from emissions of such a plant. Moreover, Terry Lake, a Kamloops -North Thompson Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) , suggested that \"...public consultation is important and, in this case, it should have been done ahead of time to avoid the problems that arose.\"87 A systematic Health Impact Assessment (HIA), taking into consideration determinants of health, may have alleviated some public concerns. It has been proposed internationally that Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) b e conducted as part of an EIA.88 In future, plans to i mplement the practice of HIAs should be done in the context of EIAs. A formal EIA was not done in this case. HIAs can be a method of involving the public in projects of local significance. The perception of risk to public health must also be considered. A thorough and complete HIA and EIA will not alleviate fears of the public unless improvements in risk communication are made as well. Letters to the editor at the Kamloops Daily News echoed the frustration of the citizens of Kamloops \u2014\"Experimental gasifier immoral,\"89 \"Are you willing to gamble with creosote ?\"90 and \"Everyone should say no to evil plan .\" were some of the titles of letters to the editors during the winter of 201 0. These letters illustrate the disconnect between the perception of risk in the public and the scientific facts of the review process. Conclusions A limited environmental assessment was done on the proposed microgasification plant in Kamloops. Given the assessment that risks to health were minimal, a formal health impact a ssessment (HIA) was not conducted. It is possible that an HIA may have addressed and mitigated some of the concerns from the residents of Kamloops. However, earlier, more active, public consultation may have been particularly effective to allay concerns of the public , since their perception was greater than scientific evaluation of the risk. This consultation could have been part of the HIA or stand -alone. Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 78 Appendix G : Toronto Public Health - Health Impact Assessment Case Study Background The City of Toron to had a goal to divert 70% of its residential solid waste from landfill by the year 2010. In addition to existing waste diversion programs, it is believed that a new mixed waste processing facility is needed to process residual waste. A study was undertak en to define a preferred residual waste management strategy for the planning period 2010 to 2035. City Council could then use this information to make decisions regarding the development and implementation of a residual waste system or the development of o ne or more waste processing facilities. Seven potential residual waste diversion technologies x were evaluated using screening criteriay. Two technologies met the criteriaz Table G.1 TPH HIA Framework - determinants of health indicators and w ere then compared to landfill for all waste without a mixed waste processing f acility (the status quo). This comparison involved the use of a Health Impact Screening Assessment in accordance with the Toronto Public Health (TPH) Health Impact Assessment (HIA) Framework (see Table 13). Further , an economic evaluation and Life Cycle As sessment of potential environmental benefits or impacts associated with each of the processing options were also conducted.

This tool prioritized the technology options based on their potential impacts on determinants of health, consistent with the determinants of health categories identi fied in the HIA tool for TPH. A MS Excel workbook with worksheets was the tool that allowed for selection and ranking of factors to be used to evaluate technology options and ranking of each technology with respect to the factors, resulting in identificati on of different options regarding the r elative concern to human health (see Figure 11 and Figure 12 ). Figure G.1 Environmental option comprehension summary Health assessment for thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in British Columbia December 2012 Britis h Columbia Centre for Disease Control 80 Figure G.2 Social -economic decision factor summary Determinants of Health The TPH HIA Framework i dentifies the following 5 categories of determinants of health: Environmental Factors (air quality, odour, surface water quality, groundwater quality, soil quality, land use, vegetation, noise , and built environment); Access to Services Factors (health s ervices, education, social services, transportation , and leisure); Lifestyle Factors (diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, drug use , and sexual behaviour); Equality Factors (age, sex, minorities or disadvantaged group, and ability); Social- Economic Factors (income/poverty, employment, education, family cohesion, community & social cohesion, crime, housing, and social exclusion) Table 14 provides an example of the evaluation of Environmental and Social- Economic Factors categories. From the 5 categories of health determinants, t he screening tool identified Environmental Factors as having the greatest possible impact on human health for the mixed waste processing options under consideration (the decision tool identified odour, noise, built environment, groundwater quality, air quality , and surface water quality as the environmental factors with the greatest importance). General TPH HIA Process HIA aims to identify what potential changes in the determinants of health might result from a policy (or program or project) and what effects these changes might have on the health of a population. The HIA should also assess the distribution of potential health effects on different sub -populations to identify potential health inequities.2 The overall TPH HIA proces s is presented in Figure 13 . Identification of the determinants of health that need to be evaluated to understand the potential health impacts of the proposed project/policy is specifically mentioned as being an important part of the Scoping Phase of the H IA.
