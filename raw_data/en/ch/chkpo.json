These low-copy number cell populations are believed to be resistant to conventional chemo and radiotherapy. It was reported that metabolic adaptation of these elusive cell populations is to a large extent responsible for their survival and distant metastasis. Warburg effect is a hallmark of most cancer in which the cancer cells prefer to metabolize glucose anaerobically, even under normoxic conditions. Warburg 's aerobic glycolysis produces ATP ef ciently promoting cell proliferation by reprogramming metabolism to increase glucose uptakeand stimulating lactate production. This metabolic adaptation also seems to contribute to chemoresistance and immune evasion, a prerequisite for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Though we know a lot about metabolic ne- tuning in cancer, what is still in shadow is the identity of upstream regulators that orchestrates this process. Epigenetic modi cation of key metabolic enzymes seems to play a decisive role in this. By altering the metabolic flux, cancer cells polarize the biochemical reactions to selectively generate \"onco- metabolites \"that provide an added advantage for cell proliferation and survival. In this review, we explored the metabolic-epigenetic circuity in relation to cancer growth and proliferation and establish the fact how cancer cells may be addicted to speci c metabolic pathways to meet their needs. Interestingly, even the immune system is re-calibrated to adapt to this altered scenario.Knowing the details is crucial for selective targeting of cancer stem cells by choking the rate-limiting stems and crucial branch points, preventing the formation of onco-metabolites.

Located at the apex of the pyramid of tumor cells, they foster the very nature of malignancy and thus play a vital role in regenerating the heterogeneous cell population, unrestrained proliferation, metastatic dissemination, and sustaining therapy. CSCs were rst identi ed in AML, using cell surface markers, followed by other solid malignancies such as brain,breast, colon, pancreas, etc. Despite their heterogeneity amidst different tumor bulks, CSCs of almost all the subsets possess identical genetic backgrounds viathe acquisition of stemness genes, expression of markers like CD44, CD133, ALDH,activation of speci c signaling pathways, etc. As a result, the study of CSCs has not been restricted to just cell surface markers;instead, other complementary methods have been envisaged to measure the functional activation of CSCs on a molecular level. Accumulating shreds of evidence have also suggested striking parallels between metabolic phenotypes and CSCs in particular. Metabolic vulnerability is believed to be the hallmarks of these CSCs, thus providing another broad eld of research. Yet another novel eld of CSC interactions is how the epigenetic system harnesses tumorigenesis and stemness of the CSCs andcancer cells. However, another element of the tumor microenvironment is the immune system in tumorigenesis, which plays a supportive and inhibitive role in the development of CSCs an d cancer. Though these three d o m a i n so fC S C ss t a ya si n t e g r a le l e m e n t so ft h et u m o r microenvironment, they participate quite inclusively properties of the immune systemplay hand in hand to develop the framework of CSCs and the cancer cells, thus establishing cancer to be one of the leading causes of death globally. Analogous to a hive 's queen bee, that the queen bees produce and nurture worker bees, killing the queen bee has always led to the hive 's demise. Similarly, destroying the CSCs has always been the appeal to eradicate tumor bulks. Though having an aberrant clinical behavior, several studies have helped determine the prognostic signi cance of CSCs and thus have suggested profound implications for cancer treatments. Combinationaltherapies of intra/inter phenotypic features of CSCs have been the demand for treating CSCs, because of its relapsing nature. In this perspective, the emerging elds of the CSC domains, viz CSC metabolism, CSC epigenetics, and CSC immunology, havebeen elucidated. Although domain-wise reviews are available in the literature, no collective review has been made to put forward into a single picture. In the present study, an effort has been made to congregate the epitranscriptional and immunogenic orchestration of genetic and metabolic programming and how they further impede the CS C microenvironment. The signicance of biomarkers to detect CSC and cancer bulk populations has also been discussed. Further, the review will discuss the prospects of targeting all the above phenotypes for CSC therapy. Cancer stem cell metabolism Since the discovery of CSCs, the role of metabolism in such cells has profoundly been studied. It has been conclusivelydemonstrated that the origins of these CSCs are substantial because of the upsurge of mutational events occurring in non- tumor cells, further characterized by elevated metabolic activities and plasticity. Characterized by high proliferation rates, their energy demand usually leads t o increased biosynthesis of macromolecules and tight regulation of the cellular redoxstatus ( 1). Thereby, they can be designated as metabolic omnivores, as they can sustain on a wide range of substrates to produce ATP molecules. Moreover, it has been observed that these CSCs have a noticeable ability to adapt to changes according to their physiological environment by selecting themost ef cient substrate. CSCs follow a different metabolic phenotype; however, their characterization is still contentious ( 2). With discrepancies in the biological function of normal differentiated tumor cells andCSCs, it has been observed that CSCs mimic the metabolic phenotype of the stem cell hierarchy. It was expected that CSC metabolism would conversely orient towards mitochondrial OXPHOS, unlike the widely accepted aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) ( 3). However, only a few studies support the fact that the primary metabolic phenotype of g e h o g ;H I F ,H y p o x a, Tumor al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in frontiersin.org 02mitochondrial based on samples of glioma (4), PDAC ( 5) and leukemia stem cells ( 6) show a positive response; still, data obtained from breast CSC samples showdiscouraging responses in this regard ( 7). Further, another misleading interpretation comes from the fact that cell cultures are based on non-physiological high glucose concentrations; thereby, there are possibilities that CSCs must be shifting their primary metabolic phenotype toadapt to the environmental changes. Factors such as biochemical reactions, paracrine cross-communications, and local ecological factors actively stimulate self-renewal pathways for maintaining aC S Cn i c h e( 8). Though evidence for glucose-based and mitochondrial oxidation has been broadly accepted, it has alsobeen observed that lipids and amino acids, like lysine and glutamine, may also act as alternative metabolic fuels for CSCs (9). The following section describes the above in detail. Metabolic pro le of CSCs Glycolytic pathway CSCs usually exhibit an enhanced glucose metabolism pathway, with higher glucose uptake, lactate production, expression of glycolytic enzymes, and high ATP content. Several studies show that CSCs tend to follow a glycolytic pathway to meet their glucose demands. In certain tumors, it has also been observed that deprivation in glucose intake induces in vitro depletion of CSCs. The increase in the expression of proteins and other factors associated with glucose metabolismc o n f e r sal o n g e rl i f e s p a nf o rC S C s( 10). This was further discussed by Cluntun et al., that CSCs rely on glutamine metabolism, too as glutamines are carbon and amino-nitrogen sources ( 11). CSCs from CD133+ hepatic, breast, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows a preferential inclination towards aerobic glycolysis ( 12). Methylation of Fructose Biphosphate-1, FBP1 and enzymes has been seen to helpglycolysis retain stemness features in an aggressive form of breast cancer, BLBC ( 13). However, overexpression of FBP-1 and an increase of ROS have shown commendable results in thereduction of CD44 high/CD24low/EpCAM+in BLBC, thereby reducing their tumor-forming capability in vivo (13). This phenomenon was later amended by Peng et al. that BLBCs show profound levels of PDK 1, which is known to inhibit mitochondrial OXPHOS ( 14). A depletion of PDK1 drastically decreases the presence of ALDH-1 positive BLBCs, therebydecreasing tumor spheroid forming ability. A similar response was also noted when snail-mediated lowering of cytochrome C oxidase and FBP1 expression inhibited OXPHOS and activated glycolysis ( 15). Snail also plays a vital role in regulating glucose flux and PPP by inhibiting phosphofructokinase platelets (PFKPs), under conditions with nutrient de ciency ( 16). It hasalso been profoundly noticed that CSCs exhibit an upregulationin glycolytic ( in coordination with other epigenetic factors like PKM2, also has been seen to mediate the metabolicsignature of CSCs and promote glycolysis ( 19). PKM2 following Oct4 and b-catenin has been seen to express glycolytic gene expression, hence promoting stemness quality in cells ( 20-22). Many hypotheses have also con rmed the role of hypoxia as one of the characteristic features of the CSC niche. Glucose has alower diffusion rate than oxygen; however, the solubility of glucose is higher than that of oxygen, which also delineates the credibility of a glucose-based metabolism in CSCs. Thereby, in a hypoxic niche, the cells compensate for their low oxygen conditions by inducing HIFs, which mediate the expression of a considerable number of genes involved in this regard. HIF-1 a and the mTOR/Akt/beta-catenin stem cell regulatory pathwaystimulate the transcription of the essential GLUTs and almost all the glycolytic enzymes, namely, LDH, GLUT, HK2, MCTs thereby endorsing that hypoxic conditions favor a glycolytic based metabolism ( 23-25). In sum, the above observations help us postulate that activation of the glycolytic phenotype favors stemness in CSCs. OXPHOS and mitochondrial biogenesis Despite the above-reported studies, an overwhelming amount of publications signify that CSCs use mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS predominantly. In fact, Sato et al., intheir experiment, demonstrated the reprogrammed metabolome analysis of the CSCs viathe TCA cycle ( 26). Compared to non- CSCs, it was determined that activation of TCA cycles could be acharacteristic feature of CSCs. A similar trend was observed in small lung cancer cells when CSCs were compared based on dependence upon OXPHOS and mitochondrial function ( 27). Convincing results were also reported concerning CD133+glioblastoma ( 28), ROS lowquiescent leukemia stem cells ( 6), ovarian ( 29), and PDAC ( 30) to privilege OXPHOS as their metabolic phenotype. Furthermore, Janiszewska et al. showed that glioma-spheres were outlin ed by oncofetal insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IMP2), a pivotalOXPHOS regulating factor ( 28). A study performed on CD133 + CD49f+hepatocellular carcinoma cells showed that NANOG 's pluripotency factor contribu tes towards reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism to meet cellular demands ( 31). NANOG ChIP-seq analysis and metabolomic pro ling determined that OXPHOS and FAO are NANOG-mediatedoncogenic pathways. NANOG silencing leads to increased OXPHOS activity and downregulation of both transcripts and protein levels of FAO-associated genes.Sahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 03Yet another study found out that transcription co-activator PGC-1a is a vital factor in stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS, enhancing the cancer cells 'metastatic, migratory and invasive capability ( 32,33). However, it has also been observed that inhibition of PGC-1a leads to a reduction of stemness properties in breast ( 32-35). Interestingly, overexpression of MYC genes curbed via negatively controlling the expression of PGC-1a . It has been observed in breast tumor cells that this c-Myc oncoprotein has been shown to promote mitochondrial glutaminolysis as a part of its reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Being a global transcriptional regulator, MYC signi cantly induces changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics to promote thebiosynthesis of metabolic precursors and cell development. MYC establishes a stereotypic gene expression in human tumors and has an inverse relationship with YAP/TAZ activity to drive clonogenic growth ( 36). Apart from these epigenetic factors, fluence CSC metabolism ( 37). Studies also show that the metabolic pro le of epithelial ovarian CSCs is characteriz ed by high glucose intake and elevated PPP and OXPHOS. Elevated OXPHOS and reduced glycolysis activity were also de liberately expressed by high telomerase activity (hTERT-high) CSCs, isolated from lungand ovarian cancer models ( 38). The CD44 +CD117+cells of the ovary give rise to a substantial amount of mitochondrialreactive oxygen species (ROS) and die when the mitochondrial respiratory chain is blocked ( 29). However, research shows that CSCs show a signi cantly lower amount of ROS, re flecting that CSCs have enhanced ROS defenses, contributing to an increased expression of free radical scavenging system compared with their non-tumorigenic cells counterparts ( 39). Several other mitochondrial carriers like SLC25A10 and NT5M were seen to be upregulated in varied cancer cell lines. Further analysis has shown that this SLC25A10 upregulation dysregulates a diverse amount of processes such as gluconeogenesis, urea cycle, FAO etc. However, overexpression o fN T 5 Mh a sb e e ns e e ni nm a i n t a i n i n gd T T Pl e v e l so f mitochondria, hence maintaining mitochondrial DNA synthesis and preserving its DNA copy number. Other genes associated with dTTP syntheses like RRM2, TYMS, and TK1 have also been seen to be overexpressed (as high as 20-folds) incancer cell lines in vivo . This elevated dTTP pool plays a vital role in providing genetic stability, counteracting the imbalancesoccurring in the mitochondria thus protecting the mitochondrial genome ( 40). Apart from generating ATP molecules for cancer cells, mitochondria communicate with the cytosol, release cytochrome C to commence cell death, and release ROS and other metabolites ( 41-43). They also appear to be responsible for regulating the stemness of CSCs irrespective of the metabolicphenotype of the CSC ( 27,30,39). Based on the aboveobservations, it can be deduced that mitochondrial health plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of CSCs. Alternative metabolic phenotypes of CSCs CSCs also happen on phenotypes, other than glycolysis and OXPHOS to sustain self-renewal, maintain stemness features and avoid anoikis. As mentioned above, CSCs from hepatocellular carcinoma cells rely on FAO as one of the metabolic phenotypes ( 31). Pasto et al. also stated an overexpression of genes associated with PPP and FAO inovarian CD44 +CD117+cells ( 29). Promoters of FAO genes dehydro genase short chains) and ECHS1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase short chain 1) have been seen to bind with NANOG and trigger lipid biosynthesis to maintain stemness in CSCs ( 44). Upregulation of CD36 also plays a vital role in fatty acid import, thus promoting fatty acid synthesis.Recent advances in proteomics have indicated that fatty acid metabolisms play an essential role in redox homeostasis and determining the metabolic fate of CSCs. Mitochondrial FAO also plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcriptional factors. Key enzymes e e n overexpressed in many forms of human cancers. Upon activation of EGFR signaling, the interaction between SREBP1 and PKM2 potentiates SREBP genes to turn active, triggering lipid biosynthesis ( 44). In addition, metabolic rewiring between PPP and glycolysis has also been noticed in glioblastoma CSCs. PPP enzymes were overexpressed in acute oxygenation regions and under- expressed in the hypoxia-mediated areas, unlike glycolysis- based enzymes, where the reverse occurs ( 50). Intriguingly, glutamine has been identi ed as an EMT-associated metabolite, demonstrating its role in CSCs from several tumors ( 26,51). Recent studies have revealed that the c-Myc gene and Dlx2/GLS1/Glutamine axis enhances glutaminaseexpression (the enzyme responsible for catalyzing glutamine to glutamate), signature metabolism ( 52,53). The glutamine uptake in CSCs has also been 2 (ASCT2). Glutamateoxaloacetate transaminases are responsible for converting glutamate-derived aspartate to oxaloacetate, also show an elevated expression in CSCs ( 54). Epigenetics of CSCs: Does it rewire the CSC metabolism? Epigenetic regulation governs a cell 's fate, followed by chromatin remodeling, lead ing to a normal somatic cellSahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 04becoming its stem cell counterpart. A similar change in the epigenetic landscape in tumor-initiating cells can give rise to potential CSCs. Epigenetic chromatin remodeling; however, several other methods have been identi ed in the recently ( Figure 1). However, it has also been noticed that aberrations in these epigenetic/genetic factorsand several cellular signaling pathways, demonstrating that thesepathways also choreograph the metabostemness (as coined by Menendez), thus manipulating the metabolic programming of CSCs intrinsically. As further explained by Waddington 's buffering and canalization theory, metabostemness is driven bybasically methods; the rst including the modi cation and methylation of DNA and histones, accounting to thereprogramming of metabolism and the second, comprising of the oncometabolite which decipher their presence in the form of chromatin modeling. This reprogramming also encompasses the impairment of the hallmark tumour microenvironment features thus remodeling both the epigenetic landscape and the dynamic metabotypes of CSCs ( 55). This epigenetic mediated switching of metabolic phenotypes also intervenes with the energy blockadesenunciated during CSC treatment protocols, thereby promoting theflexible metabolic bona de of CSCs and hence expanding their resilience of stemness. The further section describes thevarious reports of how epigenetic codes in fluenced the metabolic fates of CSCs and potentiated a positive feedback loop forsignaling pathways in CSCs.Role of signaling pathways in CSCs influencing metabolism A complex array of metabolic pathways generating different metabolites not only carried the flux of matter but also bioactive molecules that can in fluence other metabolic pathways or signaling cascades ( Figure 2). Wnt signaling The Wnt signaling cascade is a mysterious complex encompassing 19 Wnt ligands and more than 15 receptors orchestrating many developmental processes like regulating cell homeostasis and maintaining adult stem cells in their pluripotent state ( 56). It encompasses three signaling pathways, canonical (mediated through b-catenin-T cell- specic transcription factor), non-canonical factor), and canonical Wnt-calcium intracellular pathway activates when Wnt ligands bind Frizzled receptors, G-protein-coupledreceptor family, and a low-density lipoprotein related protein (LRP 5 and 6) on a neighboring cell ( 58). After the Wnt signaling gets activated, the b-catenin drives cellular responses viathe transactivation of target genes and LEF/TCF transcription factor ( 59). FIGURE 1 Crosstalk between epigenetics and metabolism.The crosstalk between epigenetics and metabolism is implicated in a variety of contexts related to disease progression. The availability of modi ers like metabolites, co-factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and other environmental factors like nutrition, exercise, and the gut microbiome, modulate the dynamics of the genome, thus contributing towards metabolic and epigenetic control and disease progression.Sahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 in Oncology frontiersin.org 05Aberrant activation of the Wnt/ b-catenin pathway has also been linked with DNA methylation through subsequent silencing of various Wnt inhibitors like WIF-1, AXIN2, SFRP- of Wnt regulators like DKK3 NKD1 has also been correlated with gastric cancers ( 63). Apart from methylations, dysregulation of the pathway is also mediated by several histonemodi cations. Recruitment of SIRT1, EZH2 and PCR2 and decreased acetylation of H3K16 and increased H3K27trimethylation has been eminent with deregulation of several Wnt antagonists ( 64). Wang et al. demonstrated the relevance of lncRNAs as epigenetic modulators of the Wnt signalingpathway, when they lncTCF7 induced TCF7 expression by recruiting SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling in liver CSCs, thus promoting self-renewal and tumorigenesis in the liver ( 65). Experimental evidence suggests that Wnt signaling is activated in several malignan cies, including CRC, breast, leukemia, lymphoma, medulloblastoma, and hepatocellular(66). In addition, Wnt activation has been seen in non- m e l a n o m ac u t a n e o u st u m o rc e l l so fm u r i n em o d e l sa n d potentially in humans ( 67). It also exerts in fluence -2 (Dlx-2), a protein-coding gene, also has been seen to trigger the glycolytic switch stimulated by Wnt/TGF- band represses mitochondrial biogenesis by upregulating expressionof snail and inhibiting mitochondrial complex IV, i.e. COX. Glutaminase-1, a predominant molecule expressed during glutamine metabolism has been seen to be induced by Wnt/ TGF- bin a Dlx-2 dependent pathway ( 68). Hedgehog signaling The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for developing embryos, tissue homeostasis, and EMT transition (69). The three HH homologs of the HH pathway -Sonic, Desert, and Indian mediate the Patched receptor 's (PTCH1) FIGURE 2 The metabolism-epigenetics axis of Cancer Stem Cells. Transformation of Stem cell to Cancer Stem cells along with metabolic reprogramming and Tumour metabolome several pathways, thus integratingmetabolism of dysregulate glucose and glutamine metabolism, contributing to enhanced production of acetyl Co-A and a-ketoglutarate. This enhanced production in fluences HAT activity, hence increasing the acetylation pro le of cancer cells. A similar response is also observed in NADH/ NAD+ activity wherein the activity of Sirtuins changes. Other metabolites like D2HG and SAM, also play a vital role in epigenetic modi cations, eliciting and inhibiting HMT/ DNMT activities. Energetic stress is also observed due to activation of AMPK leading to histone phosphorylation. Thedysregulation of the metabolic homeostasis, stemness and pluripotency of the normal/ cancer cells towards cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells exploit these alteredmetabolic pathways for their bene t and survival.Sahoo et Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 06inhibitory effect on Smoothened (SMO), thereby allowing Gli transcription proteins to get isolated. When activated, Gli proteins (Gli-1 and Gli-2) are released to facilitatetranscription of target genes, thereby mediating the HH signaling transduction. It has been observed that the HH pathway gets stimulated through up-regulation of Gli by several intracellular signals, which are conveyed by several other epigenetic factors and signaling pathways like cations and DNA methylations also play a major role in regulating the HH pathway. Enhanced expressions of the Shhligands have been seen in breast and gastric cancers due to hypomethylation of the Shh promoter ( 75,76). Similar activity with NF- B led to the activation and transcription of Shh, resulting in the upregulation of the ligand, thus promoting self-renewal and invasiveness of varied cancers ( 77). The Gli proteins have also been associated with HDAC1 in virtue of apositive autoregulatory loop, thus dysregulating neural progenitor and tumor cells 78). However, deregulations in this HH pathway implicate tumorigenesis and tumor growth. Several studies have suggested the role of HH signaling in various CSCs, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, colon cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CMC) ( 79-81). In addition, HH signaling was also seen in glioma spheres of nude mice and humans ( 82). Concerning metabolism, the HH pathway has been associated with lncRNAs like breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4), a downstream target of YAP. It enhances the expression of YAP-dependent glycolysis activators, viz. HK2 and PFKFB3, thus making YAP/BCAR4 signaling axis a potential target for breast cancer treatment ( 83). PKM2 also has been seen to be associated with transcriptional repressorTGF- b-induced factor homeobox 2 (TGIF2) to repress the transcription of E-cadherin by inducing HDAC3. Notch pathway Like Wnt and HH pathway, Notch signaling occurs between neighboring cells viatransmembrane protein ligands (Delta 1/3/ 4 and Jagged 1/2) ( 84,85). The interaction initiates by binding the ligands, Notch intracellular- domain (NICD), by -secretase. NICD then translocates into the nucleus, interacts with recombination signal binding proteinfor immunoglobin kappa J region (RBPJ- )t like MYC and HES1 ( 86,87). It is regarded as highly conserved, it helps regulate cell fate specication, stem cell differentiation, stem cell renewal and triggers multiple aspects of cancers. Aberrations in the Notchsignaling pathway have been shown to regulate tumor progressions in leukemia, breast, colon (CRC), pancreas,glioblastoma, lungs, and multiple myeloma. Notch has also been seen to synergize with HIF-1a and induce metastasis, and also maintaining stemness characteristics. Neural and breast CSCs show overexpression of the notch genes, leading to increased formation of progenitor cells. On the contrary, several studies also support the role of Notch signaling as a tumor suppressor. They have been seen to impair epidermal differentiation and skin barrier integrity in skin cancers. Inanother study, Notch signaling has been shown to induce cell death by increasing p53 activity in cancers like HCC, cervical cancers, and Ewing 's sarcoma ( 88). Overexpression of Jagged2 was also associated with HDACs leading to subsequentactivation of Notch signalling in multiple myeloma ( 89). Jin et al. also demonstrated the interaction of serine-threoninekinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) with EZH2 and PRC2 of H3K27 on and HES5 promoters, leading to regulating stemness potential in CSCs ( 90). In addition to modulating the epigenetic landscapes of CSCs, the role of Notch signaling has also been seen in regulatingmetabolites and metabolic enzymes both directly and indirectly. Notch signaling stimulated transcriptional factors like HIF-1 a, MYC, p53, and many others show active participation inconferring advantages in virtue of metabolic pathways for survival and proliferation of both cancer bulk cells and CSCs. For instance, HIF-1 aacts as a pivotal regulator of glycolytic enzymes, including GLUT3, HK, lactatedehydrogenase, and 91,92). It also downregulates OXPHOS and oxygen intake by inducing PDK, thus destabilizing the TCA cycle ( 23,92). HIF-1/ PKM2 positive feedback loop also enhances the stimulation ofglycolysis mediating proteins, thus enhancing the glycolytic switch of oncogenic cells ( 93-95). On the contrary, MYC has been seen to increase mitochondrial OXPHOS and ROS,enhancing resistance towards chemotherapy in TNBC ( 96). Intriguingly it has also been documented that MYC/PGC-1 a balance in pancreatic cancers governs metabolophenotype and CSC plasticity (30 ). Besides, p53 also regulates metabolic changes by inducing several other transcriptional factors and PANK1 have been seen to be affected with the expression of p53 ( 68). It upregulates the expression of respiration by p53 is further in fluenced by GLS2 where the amino acid metabolism decreases ROS levelsthus protecting cell DNA damage. Aerobic glycolysis is inhibited by the expression of TIGAR and repression of glucose transporters 1, 3, and 4, which altogether decrease glucose intake. It is also associated with AMPK and PTEN- mechanisms, further inhibiting the Warburg effect and enhancing gluconeogenesis. Several shreds of evidence haveSahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org inhibition of NADPH and and PPP, due p53 ( 22,68). Epigenetic regulations of STEMNESS OF CSCs in few cancers DNA methylation-demethylation DNA methylation refers to the process of methylation of cytosine residues of the CpG dinucleotides present DNA, using DNMTs -DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT 3B. DNMT1 is recognized as a maintenancemethyltransferase, which ensures the accuracy of replication of inherited epigenetic patterns. DNMT3A and DNMT 3B are required for de novo DNA methylation at unmethylated CpG sites ( 97). Though DNMTs have distinct roles, they ally to safeguard DNA methylation around the genome loci, viz. CpG islands (CGI) loci are obstinate to de novo DNMT3A2 action, which results in DNA methylation ( 98). However, these DNMT- dependent workouts play a vital role in the regulation of maintaining cellular identity, stemness of a cell, and regulation of CSCs ( 99). Studies have demonstrated an association between PcG (Polycomb group) targeted methylation in cytogenetically-normal AML (100). A comparative study showed that hypomethylation was reported in a total of 68 differently methylated regions of breast CSCs, like that of non-breast CSCs ( 101). DMNT3A-knockout derived myeloid carcinomas led expansion of preleukemia stem cells, indicating thatmethylation aberrations induce the growth of CSCs ( 102). Notably, several pioneer epigenetic changes, including genesilencing and tumor progression, occur due to DNA demethylation. It is the process of removing methyl groups from cytosines of DNAs through the conversion of 5-methyl cytosine by ten-eleven translocation proteins deaminase (AID). TET enzymes, TET1 and TET2, promote gene expression of pluripotency genes Oct 4 and facilitate the formation of iPSCs ( 103). Oncogenic dysfunction due to DNA methylation is also induced by endogenous metabolite levels and other environmental stress and vice versa ( 104). Recruitment of DNMTs at the FBP1 promoter was seen to be critical for the expression of FBP1 in BLBCs thus promoting glycolysis ( 13). Epigenetic inactivation of FBP1 has also observed in HCC, gastric,and colon cancers due to promoter hypermethylation ( 105, 106). Goel et al. also previewed the cance of methylation- in tumour infected demethylases (JHDMs)and TETs also have been seen to be associated with a- ketoglutarate and succinate which further control the TCA cycle(22,108). Yet another linkage of metabolism with methyl transferis the usage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as substrates. SAM is spawned from the coupled cycles of methionine and folate, often called one-carbon metabolism. This one-carbon metabolism involves the synthesis of micronutrients like zinc, methionine and the family members of vitamin B and hence is profoundly found active in cancers ( 109). However, the transfer of the methyl group from SAM to the substrate forms S-adenosyl homocysteine(SAH), which further builds up to the level viaacetylation, methylatio n, ubiquitylation, or phosphorylation ( 110). These alterations in histone landscapes help establish cellular identity, signifying that they may be involved in acquiring stemness within the cells. In particular, repressive complexes Polycomb group complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) mediated overexpression of EZH2 have been shown to induce tumorigenesis and show relevant characteristics of CSCs in cancers like prostate, breast, PDACs, and different types of lymphomas ( 111). Several studies have demonstrated that BMI-1 reinforces bivalent histone domains in multipotentprogenitor cells and is implicated in the maintenance and invasiveness of cancers like leukemia, GBM, human nasopharyngeal cancer, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer (112 -115 ). Similarly, Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) has also shown in the Wnt pathway leading tointestinal adenoma, AML, non-small cell lung 116 -120 ). Likewise, histone deacetylase (HDAC) tumorigenesis of the lungs by inhibiting Stat3 ( 121). Higher levels of HDACs have been associated with advancedtumorigenesis and poor prognosis ( 122). HDAC7 protein level was overexpressed in human pancreatic cancers, breast CD-10 positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 123 -125 ). It was determined by Chang et al. that upregulation of HDAC7 wasinvolved in regulating cell proliferation, cell death, differentiation, and metastati c properties, signifying the invasiveness of the associated with CSC-suppressor miR-34a ( 127), a potential functional signature for the prognosis of glioma andosteosarcoma ( 128,129). Theoretically, active chromatin at promoters can change cellular identity, i.e., de-differentiation and, most importantly, switching to CSCs. A direct association between CSC generation and bivalency was shown in CD44 +breast cancers ( 130), where t h er e s p o n s eo fZ E B 1w i t hT G F bled to an increase in transcription of ZEB1, which further led to switching of non- CSCs to CSCs. Expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 cancer cells ( 131). Similarly, other bivalent genes are involved in regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation.Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3) mediates PRC2 in binding to target genes and promotes the expression of pluripotency in ESCs. Pcl3 was also found to be elevated in multiple primary tumor samples viz. cancers of the colon, epithelial, skin, uterus, cervix, and liver. Overexpression of such factors in such cancers can be potentiallyused for diagnostic purposes ( 132,133). Concerning metabolism, several shreds of evidence of like 2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), fumarate, and succinate fumarate hydratase, and succinate dehydrogenases induce alterations in the histones and DNAs, which thereby illustrate a metabolic pseudohypoxia, accumulating (D2HG). This D2HG further occupies the a-ketoglutarate binding sites, thus inhibiting JHDMs, a major family of enzymes responsible forthe regulation of histone methylation. Some reports have also shown the intervention of D2HG with the stability of transcriptional factors HIF1 and HIF2, which further target the hypoxic metabolic pathway, however, the accuracy of the results remains contentious. Mutations in IDH enzymes have also been seen to upset the NADP/NADPH ratio and alter the forward-backward reactions of a-ketoglutarate to isocitrate while consuming NADPH, thus altering the metabolicmicroenvironment of tumors ( 136,137). Nucleosome remodeling in CSCs The basic unit of DNA packaging is the nucleosome, consisting of DNA wrapping eight histone proteins, two eachof H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The presence of nucleosomes usually decides the sensitivity of gene expression in the chromatin, preventing access to the transcription machinery. Hence, nucleosome positioning also plays a vital role in the pluripotency of stem cells and the formation of CSCs ( 138). Four families of ATP-dependent Mi-2/CHD ( 139, 140). Aberrant mutations in these complexes, however, have been linked with cancer. Mutationsin SWI/SNF and hSNF5/INII have shown a distinct role in the aggression of tumors like malignant rhabdoid tumors, ovarian clear cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, GBM, HCC etc ( 141 -160 ). Likewise, research carried out by Lee et al. showed that INO80 subunitswere frequently present in high copy numbers in the colon,suggesting that they promote colon cancer ( 161). Zhang et al., 2017 de ned the role of INO80 in the enhancement of non-small cell lung cancer and revealed a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting cancer transcription networks using INO80 ( 162). Similar results were obtained by Zhou et al., where INO80governs tumor growth in melanoma ( 163). It was also found that INO80/NANOG was overexpressed in cervical cancers, suggesting that INO80 can ac t as a potential therapeutic method for treating cancers ( 164). Reprogramming of metabolic cofactors also possesses signi cant alterations in atin remodeling from the aspect of CSCs. Metabolic cofactors like NAD, FAD, PARP, SAM, LSD1, transformational changes in chromatin structure ( 54,165). PGC-1a has been known to be associated with SIRT1 and AMPK to perturb the metabolicstature of cells. In addition, this SIRT1 has been seen to facilitate NAD+ dependent deacetylation of target molecules and orchestrate metabolic agitations stimulating transcriptional factors like PPARs, p53, FOXO etc. NAD+/NADH ratio also helps in maintaining stemness features, mitochondrial quality, and active aerobic glycolysis, thus highlighting signi cance of SIRT1 as a metabolic game-changer ( 54). Other factors like BAF/PBAF also regulate the energy metabolism pathways in cancer, thereby being a critical regulator of metabolic homeostasis ( 166). Role of miRNA are small non-coding RNAs that regulate post- transcriptional gene expression by destabilizing the mRNA and translational silencing. These miRNAs have been seen playing acrucial role in maintaining stemness in both normal stem cells and CSCs. Deregulated expressions of miRNAs have been seen to play a critical role in tumor initiation and prognosis. Though genetic modi cations in these miRNAs are crucial for initiating tumor suppressor genes, several theories have hypothesized theunderlying oncogenic potential of miRNAs associated with the maintenance, growth, and function of CSCs ( 167). Some signal Notch, HH, JAK/STAT, NF- B etc., are often distorted due to the dysregulated expression of mi RNAs, further orchestrating carcinogenesis and regulation of CSCs. However, several miRNAs such as miR-134, mirR-296, and miR-470 suppressed the expression pluripotency Oct4, Sox2 and NANOG. Similarly, let-7 and miR-200 inhibited the expression of Lin 28 and c-Myc, respectively, which were notable self-renewing factors. Further, recent studies about the r e g u l a t o r yf u n c t i o n so fm i R N A so nC S C sa r e summarized below.Sahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 09Prostate cancer The aberrant overexpression inhibiting SFRP1 GSK3 b(168). Further, miR-424 and mir-7 were found upregulated in prostate tumors and featured enhanced cell migration and invasion, increased stemness characteristics, and formation of prostatospheres ( 169, 170). However, several miRNAs like miR-34a (via KLF4/PI3K/Akt/p21 pathway), and miR-320 (via Wnt/ b- catenin signaling) inhibit prostate CSC growth reduce stemnessand metastatic features. Class III HDACs like SIRT1, is also overexpressed in prostate tumors, where they inactivate other tumor suppressors like HIC1 and activate tumor-promoting genes like p53, N-Myc, in KAT7 and KAT2A are also noted prostate Enhanced stemness markers such as CD90, EpCAM, and Oct4 due to exposure to arsenic also led to the spheroid formation in liver CSCs ( 174). Negative regulation by miR-612 and CD-133 reduced stemness and metastatic characteristics in HCCs and subsequently inhibited the of Sp1 and NANOG ( 174 -183 ). PAD4 of citrullinate several histones like H2A, H3, H4, also found to be overexpressed in HCCs, thus contributing to tumorigenesis. Besides, b3/Wnt and miR-221/222 (via PTEN signaling), signifying that the listedmiRNAs are required for the maintenance of the CSCs. However, unlike other cancers, up-regulation of other miRNAs inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in triple- negative breast cancer to reduce tumor growth, potentiate theeffectiveness of therapeutic therapies and modulate signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting the renewal of CSCs ( 186 -194 ). In fact, A D 4w e r ea l s os e e nt ob em u t a t e di nb r e a s t cancer ( 173). Lung cancer Poor regulation of miRNAs plays a vital role in cellular apoptosis, proliferation, in flammatory response, maintenance of stemness, and metastasis development of the lungs. Associatedwith self-renewal of lung CSCs and tumor differentiation, Shi et al. showed that miR-34a demonstrated negative regulation of tumor properties in CD44 hi lung CSCs and non-small cell lung lungs ( 200). Downregulation of tumor suppressor miR-128 showed tumor differentiation and metastasis by targeting ERK/AKT and p38 signaling pathways ( 201). Alike HCCs and cancer, lung cancers (esp NSCLCs) show upregulated expressionof PAD4, compared to their normal or benign hyperplastic tissues ( 184). Other than that, HDAC1 Class I and HDAC 2 display an overexpressed state in lung tumors, lower expression of HDAC9 and HDAC10 are linked to poor prognosis in the same. Histone targets like H3K9, H3K36, and H4K20 have also been seen to be associated with several lines of lung cancer ( 173). Pancreatic cancer Several reports revealed the role of miRNAs associated with the maintenance of stemness, cancer invasiveness, andmetastasis of pancreatic ( 202). Dysregulated expressions of miR-744 are often related to Wnt/ b-catenin signaling, one of the main pathways and drug show an overpowered expression in pancreatic cancers, which further leads to poor survival. Low levels of SIRT7 substrate H3K18ac also display a poor prognosis in PDACs, thus contributing to the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancers ( 173). Metaboepigenetic regulation of pro/ anti-tumor immune response CSCs are endowed with various biological characteristics, which re flect the heterogeneity of these stem cells. However, to promote and maintain tumorigenesis, many a time, these characteristics also play an interdisciplinary role within each other. The immune system 's role which has been primarily attributed towards eliminating CSCs, plays a dual role in both promoting and eliminating cancer progression, suggesting CSC 's enhanced immunoediting mechanisms. This enhancedimmunoediting mechanism is primarily regulated by several metabolic and epigenetic factors which decide the fate of the immune responses, thereby promoting cancer progression. Playing as major hallmarks of immune cell phenotype, both metabolism and epigenetics have displayed several pieces of evidence in reinstating tumorigenesis and metastasis in CSCs. In virtue of these factors, tumor cells induce changes in the immune microenvironment by modulating innate immune cells like macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs and transforming the environment into an immunosuppressive one. In this part of the review, interactions of CSCs, the oncometabolite, and the epigenetic factors with the immune system will be discussed, as well as we will highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting immune cell interactions to invade CSCs. Possible interactions have been summarized below and in Table 1.Macrophages Macrophages are notable leukocytes that have roles in tissue homeostasis and immunity. Depending upon the tumormicroenvironment (TME), these macrophages, also referred to as TAMs, exhibit (M1 macrophage) and anti-tumor (M2 macrophage) characteristics ( 212- 214). Several cance of TAMs in mediating immune- stimulatory agents and the destruction of tumor bulks. On the contrary, there is also evidence where they have been seen to participate in tumorigenesis, promoting cancer motility and metastasis of CSCs ( 215 -217 ). The diversity of such functions is governed in response to local signals (chemokines andcytokines). Though TAMs mostly show an M2- like phenotype, a high M1/M2 ratio is tried to maintain so as to suppress cancer entities. These functional changes also are dependent upon the underlying metabolic changes, thus specifying the complex relationships of metabolic and functional reprogramming of macrophages. In the early stages of tumors, TAMs produce cytokines like milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (MFG-E8) and IL-6, which activate several signaling molecules and pathways in CSCs, like STAT3 and Hedgehog, thereby mediating DNA damage, cancer-related in flammations, and drug resistance (218). They further modulate CSC plasticity by producing factors like TNF- a,T G F - b1, which is supported by other stromal collagen bers and stemness factors like IL-8 and CXCL12 8). conditions also favor hypoxic factors like HIF-1 promote VEGF-A production, a major proangiogeniccytokine ( 219). However, the M1 macrophages try to restrain tumor growth by releasing type 1 pro-infl ammatory cytokines. By upregulating IFN-g , they characterize the secretion of several ROS and TABLE 1 A summarized interaction between CSCs and the immune system.

These, in turn, drive the recruitment of T H1 cells, thereby amplifying a type 1 response. This is further supplemented by a shift in ironhomeostasis, which contributes to bacteriostatic effects ( 220). In relation to metabolism, Liu et al. in their experimentcomprehended a similar analysis on tumor-extract stimulatedbone-marrow-derived macrophages (TES-TAMs), and found an upregulated aerobic a blend of M1/M2 phenotype upregulation of HK2 PLIN2 221). An upregulation of cytokine production and aerobic glycolysis was also discovered by Artset al. using immunohistochemistry, showing enhanced expressions of PFKFB3 and PKM2 in TAMs of thyroid carcinomas ( 222). It was also further supported by Penny et al. when they inhibited HK2 with 2DG and showed disruption inprometastatic phenotype in PDAC cell lines ( 223). REDD1/ mTOR was also seen to be upregulated in hypoxic TAMsleading to suppression of glycolysis and increased angiogenic responses ( 224), thus potentiating the fact that the general preference of TAMs is aerobic glycolysis and furthermetastasis is promoted and regulated by the expression of HIF-1 a/mTOR. This regulated expression also further induces an elevated ARG1 and VEGF expression, which also plays apivotal role in tumor progression using the ARG1-dependent polyamine synthesis pathway, thus enhancing the polarization of the macrophages towards an M2-like phenotype. Several shreds of evidence have also stated the signi cance of FA metabolism in influencing the tumoricidal and immunogenic functions of TAMs, viz. overexpressed prostaglandin production, activation of PPARb /gviaIL-4/STAT6 acid accumulation, and Concerning the epigenetic modi cations relevant to TAMs, several reports have reported the switch of the M2 phenotype toM1 due to these changes, TET2, H3K4 methyltransferase, SMYD3, HDAC9 are some of the speculated factors known to be associated with M2 polarization. In fact, this TAM polarization is also associated with TLR4 ligands and LPS, which result in a shift towards glycolysis and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis. The glycolytic shift is accompanied by an increase in lactate which inhibits class II-HDACs. Asmentioned above, TET and JHDM, the two crucial oncometabolite also serve as vital metabolic STAT6/PPAR g/PGC-1 aand the mTORC2- IRF4 signaling axes also play a pivotal role in the regulation ofOXPHOS and mitochondrial biogenesis, thus modulating the polarization of TAMs ( 229). Besides, dysregulation of NF- B signaling in overexpression in Lewislung carcinomas, and CSF-1R inhibition in have shown robust regression of tumor bulks, thereby potentiatingepigenetics as a therapeutic opportunity in treating cancers(230 -232 ). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells MDSCs are immature granulocytes which exert an immune-suppressive phenotype in the CSC niche. They havebeen seen to suppress NK cells, natural killer T cells, and other T-cell responses, thereby modulating the innate immune system and releasing reactive nitrogen and oxygen species ( 233 -235 produce VEGF CCL2, CCL15, and CXCL12 also mediate MDSC recruitment, which further suppresses the immune function, thereby facilitating CSC maintenance ( 205). Several evidence has been reported indicating that MDSCs induce stemness genes and drive the EMT in CSCs. They have also been seen to express a dynamic metabolic flux, with increased carbon metabolism, i.e. enhanced glycolysis, PPPand TCA cycle. Owing to the high glycolysis and glutaminolysis rate s, several pathways g, AMPK, STAT, PGE2 pathways support cellular proliferation for the synthesis of glucose, fatty acids, proteins, and nucleic acids. U nder hypoxic mTOR stimulates enhanced glucose, transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and a repressed OXPHOS, thus mediating the switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis in MDSCs. Besides, carbon metabolism, MDSCs also show an upregulated expression of FA transport proteins, FA translocase CD36, CPT1 and CPT3, thus suggesting FAO as one of the generic fuels for MDSCs ( 238, 239). G-MDSCs in certain tumors express higher levels of Arg1, whereas M-MDSCs express an overexpressed iNOS to catabolize Arg1 to inhibit MDSC functions, thus acids with MDSC metabolism ( 240). Epigenetic modi cations also have been seen to result in a heritable regulation of MDSCs leading to the reframing of the tumor microenvironment of several cancer species. In addition, to support tumor growth and progression, they have been seen to stimulate factors like VEGF, b-EGF, MMP9, and other angiogenesis factors ( 241 -243). Higher expressions of Arg1 and STAT3 have led to the accumulation of MDSCs in cancer models, thus suggesting their tumor-suppressive functions. In astudy by Sahakian et al., HDAC11 was noted to be a regulator of MDSC maturation, thus indicating its role as a gatekeeper in myeloid differentiation ( 244). Concerning microRNA interference, miR-210 enhances the expression of CXCL12, IL-16, Arg-1 in MDSCs, thereby establishing a link between microRNAs and MDSC mediated immune suppression. The expression of miR-101 in ovarian cancer cells and prostaglandin E2 in cervical cancer cells is mediated by MDSCs, thus demonstrating their role in tumorigenesis and metastasis associated with MDSC development and differentiation, and if regulated can promote overall tumor immunity ( 244). In addition, MDSCs have been seen to foster STAT3 signaling in breast CSCs and PDACs by inducingstemness factors like IL-6 and (NO), which subsequently increase ALDH1 +CSCs ( 247,248). Regulatory T Cells T regulatory cells (Tregs) orchestrate the function and activation of other immune cells and play a crucial role incontrolling T cell-mediated autoimmunity ( 249). In regard to cancer, CSCs alter the immune landscape and promote theexpansion of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic Tregs. Several studies have shown that CSCs from glioblastoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, mesothelioma cell lines, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma impairs the production of effector T stimulates CSCs also produce TGF- bpathway members, which act in concert with the regulation of Tregs. With increased tumor formation, this TGF- binhibits the accumulation of CD8+ T cells and secrete inflammatory cytokines such as IFN- g, TNF, IL-6, and CCL2, thereby stemness in ( 254). On the contrary, Tregs also produce TGF- b, which promotes invasion, angiogenesis and drives the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process ( 255). Furthermore, Tregs also influence the expression of programmed cell death 1 on CD8 + T cells and enhance VEGF levels in the presence of hypoxia, which promotes angiogenesis, thereby affecting the stemness and progression of CSCs ( 256,257). In addition, recent studies have shown that FOXP3+ Tregs induce IL-17, which under a hypoxiccondition, potentiates CSC development in CRCs. Further results showed that IL-17 acts in a STAT3 dependent manner ( 258). Expression of FOXP3 is also mediated by notable metabolic factors like PPAR g, HIF-1 a, and mTOR and PD-L1, which are maintained by the balance between glycolysis and FAO in Tregs,thus caveating the control of metabolism over differentiation of Tregs (228 ,259- 261). Depending upon the tumor microenvironment, Tregs avail alternate substrates for their metabolic sustenance. In stea dy states, they are known to display an enhanced glycolytic rate and lipid biosynthesis withthe hyperactivation of mTOR. During proliferation, they increase the expression of GL UT1, activate mTORC1, and display a comparatively higher glycolytic activity, therebysuggesting that Tregs are the most enthusiastically proliferating compartment in vivo (262- 265). However, deletion of PGC-1a function both in vitro , hence suggesting the role of OXPHOS in the proliferation of Tregs ( 266,267). Yet, anotherinteresting theory also suggests the engagement of epigenetics inthe differentiation program of Tregs. The role of Enolase/MYC Binding Protein-1 aalso has been associated with the expression of glycolysis and FOXP3 splicing variants ( 268). Suppression of EZH2 in the tumor microenvironment also has shown sustained generation of Tregs from na\u00efve precursors, thus potentiating tumor growth ( 269). Evidence has also stated that enhanced expression of tryptophan metabolizing enzyme IDO also leads to increased Treg cell in ltration in several cancers like CRC, HCC, and cervical cancers, and also has been seen to increase thefrequency of metastasis in these cancer lines ( 267). Neutrophils Neutrophils account for the maximum amount of leukocytes in the human blood. Thus, apart from eliminating pathogens and maintaining a circuit of adaptive immunity, neutrophils constitute a vital portion of the immune cells invading the CSC niche. Several studies have demonstrated the role of TANs in cancer progression and metastasis. However, similar to TAMs, TANs also show a cytokine-driven polarisation wherein they can be modulated into a pro- (N2) or an anti- (N1) tumorigenic phenotype. The extent of neutrophil in ltration was suggested by Hira et al. when they examined glioma stem-like cells in high-grade glioma patients ( 270). A similar prognosis was also obtained in cases of aggressive forms of renal cell carcinoma, melanoma,CRC, head and neck cancer, pancreatic neoplasia, and micro- papillary carcinomas ( 271,272). TANs shown to facilitate metastasis by suppressing NK-cell mediated clearanceof tumor cells and recruiting TAMs at in the secretion of IL-8, However, display an antitumor N1 phenotype with increased tumorcytotoxicity and escalated levels TNF- a, and NET (neutrophil extracellular trap) ( there expression promotes CD8 +Tc e l l recruitment and activation, thereby potentiating the antitumoreffect, thence suppressing tumor growth ( 211). Metabolically, TANs like other immune cells strongly rely on aerobic glycolysis and PPP as their dominant form ofmetabolism. Mitochondrial action also progressively diminishes as neutrophils mature, as they lose their c-kit expressions; however immature neutrophils and glucose- restricted tumor microenviro nment rely on mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby maintaining a local immune suppressionand ROS production ( 276). This comes in line with the fact that NADPH, an important cofactor for NADPH oxidase isproduced by the PPP pathway, also stimulates neutrophil microbicidal functions. Yet, another function of neutrophils,Sahoo et Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 13the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a of several epigenetic elements, i.e. DNA, histones, antimicrobial- peptides; also works in virtue of the metabolic shift towards glycolysis, glucose uptake, and PPP ( 277,278). NETs also have been associated with several metastatic factors and otherproin flammatory adhesion molecules, which further contribute to cancer-stimulated organ failures, thus demonstrating thecharacterization of NETs towards tumor progression ( 228,279). Therapeutic advances Targeting CSCs viametabolism Classically, the metabolism signature of CSCs is quite different from that of regular cancer cells, which offers novelopportunities to target CSCs speci cally. Several approaches have been made targeting glycolysis, mitochondrial biogenesis,OXPHOS, PPP, and FAO. Drugs have been developed targeting glycolysis to suppress GLUT1 and regulate pyruvate metabolism. Glycolysis blockers along with competitive inhibition of phosphoglucoisomerase induced cell death in human CD44 +/CD24lowbreast CSCs (only, not their non-CSC equivalent) ( 280). Similar approaches were tried with prostate CSCs, which resulted in induced cell death, reduced tumor spheroid formation, and higher dependency on glutamine, which can further be treated with glutaminase blockers ( 281). GLUT1 inhibition in vivo byCD133 +afliated CSCs (glioma, pancreatic and ovarian CSCs) (282). Experiments by Li et al., and Isayev et al., extended the knowledge about anti-cancerous properties of 3-bromopyruvate (3BrP) ( 51,283). 3BrP is clonogenic RPMI8226 myeloma cells, KG1 leukemia cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, DU145 prostate cancer cell line by inhibiting ATP-dependent ef flux pumps ( 284). Yet, another promising candidate in this eld turned out to be metformin, an anti-diabetic drug. Compelling evidence showed that metformin induces an energy crisis by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I and impairing the ability to switch to glycolysis, subjecting to cell death ( 30,285). Suppression of mitochondrial OXPHOS by blocking ETC complexes also helps in modulating CSC populations ( 30). Treatment with oligomycin targets mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase and +/CD117+ovarian, and CD87+lung CSCs ( 29,281, 286). SLC25A10 inhibition in combination with radiation therapy has shown also signi cant improvements in treating cancers, especially solid tumors with hypoxic cell fractions ( 40). Considering the importance of lipid metabolism in CSCs, drugs intervening in different aspects of fatty acid metabolismhave yielded positive results. Inhibition of FASN has showedsuppressed tumor growth in On the other hand, mTORC1 downregulates SIRT4, which is a critical negative regulator for glutamine metabolism. However, mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin targets show ef cacy in deregulating the mTOR pathway, destabilizing metabolism of the CSCs ( 289). These mTOR inhibitors have shown potency in reducing angiomyolipomas 'tumor growth in clinical trials of tuberous sclerosis ( 290). Recent studies have also shown that combined therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs and Vitamin C induces an effective treatment mechanism. Vit. C interferes with the metabolic interests of the CSCs and also disturbs the epigenome regulation in them ( 291). Further research should focus on using Vit. C as a viable source to facilitate cancer treatment.Furthermore, evaluating a combined drug-controlled process aiming to destroy metabolic adaptability would condemn CSC survival. Targeting CSCs viaepigenetics and metabolic blocks As a whole, several characteristic metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic signatures can act as biomarkers for detecting CSCs.Over the past couple of decades, numerous methods have been envisaged regarding the dysregulation of cell signaling or cell surface proteins to treat CSCs. DNMT inhibitors were among the rst epigenetic therapeutic molecules which were incorporated for cancer treatment. Low doses of these inhibitors show profound efcacy in decreasing DNA methylation, thereby reducing tumorigenesis. Transient exposure to such low-dosedinhibitors induced antitumor response and decreased stemness properties in primary leukemia and epithelial tumor cells. DNMT inhibitors like decitabine and azacitidine have been broadly used to treat cancers of the breast, colon, and lungs. They have also shown signi cant downregulation of stemness factors like NANOG Knockdown mediated cancer stemness ( 294). Administration of SGI-110, along with other chemotherapeutic drugs, has repressed the stemness properties of ALDH+ ovarian cancer cells and inhibited tumorigenesis ( 295). Clinical trials with SGI- 110 are still ongoing to treat various other CSCs like Liver,Leukemia, Ovarian, etc. Yet, another procedure for treating CSCs is targeting histone modi motility. However, effective LSD1inhibitors and analogs have shown tumors and CSCs ( 296). HDACs have also been known to remove additional acetyl groups, thereby stimulating gene expressions. HDAC inhibitors like vorinostat and romidepsin have been approved to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. HDAC inhibitors have also been shown to repress stemness in certain CSCs by re programming cancer cells. Gottlicher et al. demonstrate d that valproic acid, a potent HDAC inhibitor known to be an antiepileptic drug, relievesHDAC mediated transcriptiona l repression, which further induces apoptosis of carcinoma cells, hematopoietic stem cells,and leukemia blasts from AML patients. This was further amended by Travaglini et al., that valproic acid reprograms the malignant mammary epithelial cells to a more physiologic phenotype and improves the sensitivity towards chemotherapic treatment ( 297,298). Yet, another inhibitor of class I entinostat, has been shown to decrease tumor-initiating cellsfrom triple-negative breast cancer, hence reducing expression of several stemness factors like BMI-1, NANOG, and Oct-4. They have also led to prevent tumor formation at primary sites and distant metastasis ( 299). Similarly, miRNAs also play a crucial role in regulating CSCs, which can become therapeutic tools when exploited. MiR-34a has been associated with CSCs of the prostate and pancreas, which, when supplemented with inhibitors of DNMTs and HDACs, lead to inhibition of stem cell proliferation and metastasis ( 172,300). Suppression of miR-200c and miR-9 were found to be associated with the treatment of breast CSCs andinhibiting tumor formation in the breast ( 301,302). MiR-126, when inhibited, led to the eradication of leukemic cells in AML(303). Combinations of anti-miRNA when complemented with chemotherapeutic drugs, suppress stemness markers and stem cell properties of the tumor ( 304).Targeting CSCs viaimmunotherapy As discussed above, it can be postulated that CSCs can shape the immune system to harness their own needs. Vice versa, the inltrating immune cells interact with CSCs change their immunogenic signature, and promote stemness, tumorigenesis,and metastasis of CSCs. However, the review also mentions the anti-tumorigenic potential of M1-TAMs and N1-TANs, and if appropriately modulated, might improve the clinical outcome of the patients. However, as mentioned earlier, immune cell-CSC interactions, including M2-TAMs, N2-TAMs, Tregs, and MDSCs, can be fruitful therapeutic structures if reversed using signaling techniques. Possible therapeutic strategies have been summarized in Table 2. Innate immune response to CSCs As frontline workers of the immune system, the natural killer (NK) cells constitute the primary lymphocytes responsible for invading tumor cells. However, regarding CSCs, the role of NK cells remains quite contentious. For example, Wu et al. suggested that CD133+ and CD133- cells in brain CSCs adopt a mechanism to escape immune response mediated by MHC1 or NK cell-activating ligands, thereby making them obstinate to the innate or adaptive immune monitoring. Further, treatment of CD133+ cells with IFN- grenders them sensitive to NK cells in vitro (332). Similar observations were reported in the case of breast CSCs, where CSCs dodge NK cell-mediated MICA and MICB (MHC I-related chain A and B), the two ligands for the stimulatory NK cell receptor NKG2D due to aberrant expression of ( 333). However, conversely, certain CSCs like glioma, colorectal and oral squamous carcinoma have expressed a signi cant amount of NK cell receptors, thereby mediating NK cell TABLE 2 A summarized form of immunotherapies = Combinational therapy). Immunotherapies Type of Melanoma, Colon Cancer, Cervical cancer (310) CSC vaccines DC vaccination Breast CSC, Prostrate CSC, Lung metastasis, Melanoma, Squamous cell carcinoma (311 -314 ) DNA vaccination Renal Cell Carcinoma, Lung (315 -318 ) T cell-basedimmunotherapyCSC-primed T cells Breast CSC, Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma, Pancreatic CSC, Lung CSC (319,320) CSC-CAR T cells Melanomas, TNBCs, Head -307 ). con flicting results thereby help us determine that CSCs in different tumor systems foster different sensitivities. Yet another mode of therapy is done by gdT cells of the V g9/ Vd2 phenotype, a part of the innate immune family. Human Vg9/Vd2 cells have been seen to be effective against colon CSCs, ovarian CSCs, and neuroblastoma. Zoledronate-activated gcells showed positive responses against breast CSCs, solid tumors like ovarian, melanoma, colon, and cervical and enhanced the potential of CD8+T cells viathe IFN-g driven overexpression entirely relies on the production of effector T cells, accompanied by the adoptivetransfer of CD8 +T cells back into patients. For CSC-primed T cells, CSCs derived from carcinoma cell lines like breast, head,and neck, and pancreas could induce a CD8 +T cell response. Adoptive therapy with ALDH-speci c CD8+T cells could be used to kill ALDHhiCSCs in vitro , thereby suppressing tumor growth and metastasis ( 319). Similar techniques were adopted by Luo et al. when they used CSC lysate-pulsed dendritic cells to stimulate CD8+T cells to inhibit lung CSCs. Their study showed that ALDHhi-CD8+T cells mediated antitumor effects, thereby suppressing tumorigenesis and metastasis ( 320). Nevertheless, CAR T cells also symbolized to be successful immunotherapy. Using ex vivo genetic crafting, T cells can be genetically engineered to manifest a T cell receptor or CAR to recognize TAAs and inhibit tumor growth. CSC antigens like CSPG4 in melanomas, TNBCs, GBMs, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma and mesothelioma ( 321), CD 133 prostate ( 325), used as targets for CAR T-cell based immunotherapies. Neoantigens, which can beidenti ed efciently by T cells, also show promising CAR T cell therapy candidacy. Monoclonal antibody-based immunotherapy mAb-based immunotherapy has been considered a successful cancer therapy in the 21stcentury. Immunomodulatory drugs, demonstrated by anti-PD-1, anti- PD-L1, ts targeting anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, have shown profoun d success in clinical trials against cancer. The expression levels of CSC markers also act as attractive targets for antibody-based immunotherapy. For, e.g., anti-CD44 mAb inhibited tumorigenesis of murine tumors and showed regression in human melanoma metastasis (326,327). CIK cells bound with anti-CD3/anti-CD133bispeci c antibodies were used to inhibit the growth of CD133hiCSCs of the liver and pancreas ( 328). HER2-targeting antibodies, like trastuzumab and pertuzumab, also dramatically reduced CSC populations inGBMs and Breast CSCs. However, as CSC markers are not genuinely de ned for speci cs u b s e t so fC S C s ,s i n g l em A b therapy may cause side effects to neighboring normal cells.Moreover, combinational therapy using mAb cocktails canefciently eradicate CSC populations while reducing the side effects to other normal cells ( 329 -331 ). CSC based vaccines Immunotherapeutic strategies are based on the endogenous activation of T-cell resp onses to malignant cells via administering tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to patients, which is successfully performed using vaccines (Dendritic cell, peptide, whole-cell or genetic). Speci cally, the DC-mediated tumor immune response is stimulated by CSCs, which act asantigen sources ( 334,335). However, it has been observed that enriched immunogenic CSCs are more effective than their non-stem counterpart. Administration of dendritic ell vaccines to syngeneic tumor models of immunocompetent mice has led to a substantial decrease in lung metastasis, squamous carcinoma cells, prostate CSCs, and regression in tumor models of melanoma D5 cancer SCC7 ( 311 stimulating CD8 +and CD45+T cells ( 314). On the contrary, DNA vaccinations have been used as a new strategy to target cancers. They involve injecting genetically engineered plasmids for direct production of antigens, leading to a culminating immune response, thereby preventing cancer. Albeit in clinical trials, several DNA-based vaccines have successfully elicited antigen-speci c T cell immune responses. In human castration-resistan t prostate cancer, both PAP (prostate acid phosphatase) and PSA (prostate-speci c antigen) is administered using DNA-based vaccinations ( 315, 316). Immunization with CSC-speci c DNAJB8 expression plasmids also showed commendable anti-tumor responsecompared to immunization with TAA survivin (expressed in renal cell carcinomas) ( 317). Polakova et al., in their experiment, also used DNA vaccinations to induce antitumor effect against mouse oncogenic Sox2-expressing lung TC-1/B7 tumor cells (318). In sum, it can be said that CSC-DNA vaccines hold great potential to serve as a tool for immunotherapy, and they willturn out to become a great asset in cancer therapy in the years to come. CSCs are regulated via three perspectives, namely metabolism, epigenetics, and immunology. It has been identi ed that CSCs leads to self-renewal ability andtherapeutic resistance. Immune cell-CSC interactions have also been seen to alter the functional and genetic makeup of both the immune cell subsets and CSCs, leading to impaired CSC recognition and eliminatio n by the immune system. With several processes in hand, CSCs evolve with varied niches and render their blood-based biomarkers: Metabolic and epigenetic pro ling for early cancer detection and treatmentoutcome Manifesting properties like self-renewal cations, and immunogenic rewiring, cancer cells and their stem cell analogous can be considered different from na\u00efve cells. With varied such properties, they characterize themselves with several markers, which are also known as biomarkers. Facilitating with the molecular de nition of tumor, these biomarkers are subject to dynamic modulation and are expected to enhance ourunderstanding of tumor metabolism, epigenetic and immunogenic in fluence. This would further provide insights into new therapeutic approaches for eradicating CSCs and theirtumor bulks. Enhanced carbon metabolism also plays a prominent and fundamental change in many cancers irrespective of their nature of origin or subsequent histological changes, thus entailing a great potential as cancer biomarkers. Enhanced glucose uptake using GLUTs and HK2 levels ( 336) has been observed to be efcient candidates for conferring the glycolysis metabolism inside tumors. Mutations in IDH enzymes also implicate metabolic rewiring, thus providing references to tumors ( 337). Positron emission tomography (PET) and radiotracers palmitate,11C-glucose,11C-acetate, etc. also associated with perfusion and metabolic index of speci c cancers ( 338). Cancer, also being a cluster of alterations, confers a broad spectrum of genetic/epigenetic alterations, mutations, gene ampli cation, accompanied by varied methylation and acetylation changes. With DNA hypo- and hyper-methylationbeing the apparent epigenetic events responsible for promotingcancer, several studies have also shown the involvement of DNMTs in developing abnormalities in na\u00efve cells. Blood/ serum gene panels have shown promoter hypermethylation of several genes like GSTP1/TIG1/PTGS2/RPRM for prostate carcinomas ( 339), APC, RAR H2A in breast cancer, H3K27 in midline gliomas are some of the notable expressions associated with early cancer detections ( 347). MicroRNAs and lncRNAs also play a critical role in detecting tumors and have already been described in thereview. Immuno-speci c are also seen to be expressed in many malignant tumors ( 339,348). However, to date, identifying markers to speci cC S C s remains a challenge, as most of the CSC biomarkers label aheterogeneous stem cell population. However, combinations of extracellular and intracellular markers give prominence towards the isolation and characterization of speci c CSCs. A short summary of some prominent CSC markers showingprominent prognostic approaches towards speci cC S C models is also pointed out (also in Table 3 ). Conclusion With advances in technology, our understanding of CSCs and cancer have strengthened dramatically. The crosstalk amongmetabolic, epigenetic, and immunological aspects involved in CSC generation and recurrence substantially enhance tumorigenesis and metastasis. Several shreds of evidence have indicated that it is not just a speci c domain that orchestrates tumor formation; instead, each and every domain has its role indeveloping the CSC niche ( Figure 3). Though the origin of CSC has always been a contentious matter, it can be postulated thatCSCs show stemness features and are resistant to chemo/ radiotherapy alone. Thus, targeting the CSC population would g i v eb e t t e ri n s i g h t si n t oa n t i - t u m o rt r e a t m e n t ,t h e r e b yeradicating cancer. Identifying the CSC with speci cc e l l surface markers as mentioned before, forms fundamentally therst step in targeting the CSC. There are several universal CSC markers, with a few been extensively used in multiple studies. ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2 are used to isolate CSC populations, with their expression related to stemness. Theyseems to be associated with different cancers in a context speci c manner ( Figure 4). While it is downregulated in few cancers, it is upregulated in few others indicating a complex interplay between cells and environment.Sahoo et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.955892 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 17A coordinated effort has been made to present all the interdisciplinary domains of CSCs under the purview of a single review in an elegant manner. The various dimensions of CSC, viz metabolic, epigenetic, and immunogenic interactions of the CSC population with the host organism, have been elucidated. Further discussion has also been made on treating these CSC subsets and cancer populations using novel therapeutic methods. We believe that the combined therapeutic trials 'success will de nitely provide a promising path to pursue in future. However, the authors feel that there arestill areas that require further investigation and research. In particular: \u0081To obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the driving of CSC initiation from normal na\u00efve cells. \u0081To be able to differentiate the mechanisms followed byCSCs, na\u00efve cancer cells, and normal stem cells. \u0081To ascertain the relative inter-contribution of themetabolic, epigenetic, and immunogenic domains, to FIGURE 3 Pictorial representation of the different functional domains of Cancer Stem Cells. Epigenetic mechanisms have a profound in fluence on regulating the activities of key metabolic enzymes. Several of the enzymatic reactions, in turn, produce metabolites and onco-metabolites that in turn orchestrate key signaling pathways. TET ( Ten Eleven translocases) are one such mediator. Epigenetic mechanisms in turn also regulatemitogenic signals and alter the way cell interacts with their surroundings.TABLE 3 A summarized form of certain CSC markers expressed on their target CSCs.
