First, as of May, 2022, the WHO estimates that almost one billion people globally remain unvaccinated against SARS -CoV-2.4 Second, affordability continues to be an obstacle to global vaccine accessibility , including the cost of low -temperature storage and transport .5,6 Third, the protection against infection provided by vaccine -induced or infection -induced immunity wanes with time, which has led to frequent booster vaccine doses.7 Fourth , SARS -CoV-2 variants of concer n (VOC s) capable of evading natural or vaccine -induced humoral immunity continue to emerge.8 Finally, as SARS -CoV-2 becomes endemic, worldwide immunization of the pediatric population , including of infants, remains an unmet need.9 Protein nanoparticle vaccines, compared to isolated protein subunits, are more readily taken up by antigen -presenting dendritic cells10,11 and the multivalent presentation of the antigen facilitated by the nanoparticles promotes receptor clustering and subsequent activation of B cells.12,13 Indeed, candidate ferritin -based nanoparticle vaccines have shown robust humoral immune responses against SARS -CoV-214-16 and other viral glycoproteins,17-21 including showing safety and efficacy in clinical trials .20,22 Previously , we introduced a protein nanoparticle -based vaccine candidate , SC-Fer, which displays a truncated form of the prefusion SARS -CoV-2 spike - protein (2P)23 mRNA vaccines1,24. Importantly, SC-Fer also contains a deletion of 70 amino acid resi dues from the C -terminus of the spike ectodomain . This deletion remove s a highly flexible region that is not well resolved in cryo -EM structures25-27, and that contain s immunodominant , linear (i.e., not conformational) epitopes frequently targeted by antibodies in convalescent COVID -19 p lasma28,29. Removal of these immunodominant linear epitopes and multivalent presentation of the modified spike protein on a ferritin nanoparticle substantially improved the neutralizing potency of elicited antisera to other tested vaccines in mice14. .

Previous work has shown that the HexaPro SARS -CoV-2 spike protein has increased stability and expression relative to the 2P version26. We found that DCFHP is more stable to thermal denaturation than SC -Fer. In addition, we show that DCFHP can be generated in a Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell line at levels exceeding 2 grams per liter . Our vaccine formulation, DCFHP -alum, consists of DCFHP antigen formulated with , referred to herein as alum ) as the only adjuvant.30 Aluminum salt adjuvants are the most common ly used adjuvant in human vaccines licensed by the FDA and regulatory agencies worldwide , and have been administered to billions of individuals over the past 90 years31-33. Moreover, alum inum salt adjuvants are currently used in infant vaccines against hepatitis B, diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and pneumococcus infectious agents34, with an excellent safety profile .35,36 We show here that DCFHP -alum elicits a robust and durable immune response in mice against SARS -CoV-2 VOCs . Additionally, w e demonstrate that DCFHP -alum remains stable at temperatures ranging from 4\u00b0C to 37C for at least 14 days, as assessed by immunization studies in mice. Thus, we anticipate that local distribution of the DCFHP -alum vaccine could be feasible without refrigeration. Finally, we demonstrate that a two -dose intramuscular immunization regimen in rhesus macaques with DCFHP -alum elicits antisera with durable, rob broad of VOCs, including the Omicron subvariants BA.4/537 and BQ.1 ,38 along with a balanced and Th2 immune ( NHP ) antisera also show robust and durable neutralization activity against the phylogenetically divergent SARS -CoV-1 pseudovirus .39 Boosting the se immunized NHPs after ~1 year with a third dose -alum elicits a robust, broad -spectrum, anamnestic neutralizing antibody response. Taken together, these results suggest that DCFHP -alum may provide a n affordable and effective solution to pediatric and worldwide vaccination against SARS -CoV-2 and present the possibility of a n effective, once -yearly booster. .

DCFHP maintains the 2P substitutions23 and deletion of 70 C -terminal spike ectodomain resi dues contained in SC-Fer,14 but also incorporates four proline residue substi tutions and a modification to the mutated furin cleavage site , as described in (Fig 1A) . As expected, DCFHP is at higher levels than SC -Fer following transient transfection in Expi293F cells (SI Fig 1A -B). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified DCFHP showed the expected monomeric molecular weight of ~160kDa (Fig 1 B). Additionally , size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC -MALS) analysis shows that the nanoparticle has a molecular weight (~3.4MDa ) consistent with a ferritin -based nanoparticle displaying eight copies of the SARS -CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer (Fig 1 C). Differential scanning DSF) experiments indicate that thermal denaturation of DCFHP occurs at higher temperatures compared to SC -Fer, and these changes are similar to those observed between the 2P and HexaPro variants of the spike trimer26 , suggesting that HexaPro mutations induce simi lar stabilizing effects in the context of the Biolayer cryo-electron microscopy (cryo -EM) of DCFHP shows a multivalent eight copies of the SARS -CoV-2 trimer arrayed radial ly from a ferritin core (Fig 1D, SI Fig. E -F), as was observed previously with SC-Fer.14 Collectively , these data suggest that the spike component of DCFHP maintains the same native conformation as in SC-Fer, with increased stability and expression levels conferred by the HexaPro substitutions .

Indeed, though the response was diminished compared to alum + CpG, DCFHP -alum elicited strong pseudoviral neutralizing titers of approximately 104 in mice (SI Fig 2 B). Under these conditions, DCFHP is 100% bound to alum30. To investigate the stability of the DCFHP -alum vaccine , samples were stored at 4C, 27C, or 37C for varying times and the immunogenicity of the se stored samples was evaluated in a single - dose mouse immunization study . Remarkably, the DCFHP -alum vaccine remained similarly immunogenic across all temperatures and storage periods , as measured in pseudov iral neutralization assays (Fig 2). We conclude that DCFHP -alum is stable , as measured by mice immunogenicity studies, after storage for at least two weeks at 37C .

To do so, multiple copies of a codon -optimized DCFHP gene were inserted into CHO -K1 cells using a Leap-In transposase at ATUM ,45,46 a engineering company (see M ethods) . As anticipated47, N-glycosylation profiles of these proteins expressed transiently in Expi293 versus stably in CHO cells differ30 but they are similarly immunogenic in mice, as measured in pseudoviral neutralization a ssays30. Following preliminary analysis of expression in pooled cells, 125 single -cell clo nes were evaluated for high levels of cell growth and productivity , resulting in 24 lead clones (SI Fig 3A -C). Among these, we chose clones (SI Fig 4A -C) that showed favorable expression and nanoparticle assembly, SDS -PAGE , respectively ). In this manner , we identified five CHO -K1 stable cell clones (SI Fig 4A) that express DCFHP at a high nanoparticle:monomer ratio (SI Fig 4B), with expected stability (SI Fig 4C), and exceptional yield (>2 g/L, Fig 4A). Additionally, we were able to optimize the purification of the nanoparticle s over our previous method14. The CHO cell -derived supernatant was supplemented to . The nanoparticle -containing flowthrough was concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography purification (see M ethods) . These change s enabled rapid and simplified nanoparticle purification , with increased yield, while maintaining high overall purity. DCFHP -alum is robustly i mmunogenic in non -human primates (NHPs) Encouraged by results demonstrating that sera from mice immunized with DCFHP -alum showed potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus , sought to investigate the immunogenicity of the DCFHP -alum vaccine in NHP s. DCFHP purified from engineered CHO -K1 cells was used for the immunization of ten m ale rhesus macaques , aged between 3 and 9 years (SI Table 1) . The ten NHPs were divided into t wo groups to test the effect of a short and .

Longer gaps have been found to produce more robust immune responses in other vaccines .48 We primed both NHP groups on day 0 and boosted at either day 21 (group A) or day 92 (group B) (Fig 3A and SI Table 2). DCFHP -alum elicited a neutralizing immune response 21 days after a single immunization in both groups (Fig 3 B). While the response was substantially improved following a booster dose in both groups, the delayed boost elicited better neutralizing antisera, as assessed 14 days post boost (Fig 3C and D; SI Table 3) ; on average, group B showed approximately a 4-fold increased neutralizing response relative to group A against divergent VOCs. Remarkably , DCFHP -alum vaccination of NHPs neutralization of pseudotyped SARS -CoV-1 (Fig 3C and D), which is distant from SARS -CoV-2 on the beta sarbecovirus phylogenetic tree.39 When tested against authentic SARS -CoV-2 virus, consistent with the results in pseudoviral assays, sera from the NHPs showed neutralization against the Wuhan -1 virus and VOCs (Fig 3E). Notably, a ferritin -based SARS -CoV-2 vaccine candidate that elicits similar neutralizing titers to those described here has been shown to confer protection in hamster49 and NHP challenge models.16 .

T he fast-phase accounts for approximately 50% of the total decay ( SI Fig 6 B and SI Table 4). Simple modeling of these data with a single -phase decay shows a half-life of ~one year, with a poorer fit than for biphasic decay (SI Fig 6 A and SI Table 4). Similar trends are seen following the boost for group B (days 106 - 337), although with greater variability, presumably because our long -term data for group B is sparse ( SI Table 4). In either case, a substantial portion of the serum neutralizing activity appears to decay v ery slowly with time following immunization of NHPs with DCFHP -alum. To explicitly test the potential of DCFHP -alum as an annual vaccine, we gave a second boost to all NHPs on day 381 . Animals in both groups A and B showed a strong anamnestic immune respo nse with average NT50 values against Wuhan -1, BA.4/5 , SARS -CoV-1, and BQ.1 of approximately 104, 103.5, 103, and 103 respectively (Fig 5A -H, data for BQ.1.1 shown in SI Fig 7 ). The responses for the animals in group A is particularly striking given that their responses had generally waned prior to the second boost ( compare Fig. 4A and B and SI Fig 5A to Fig. 5 A -C). .

These findings challenge the notion that bivalent vaccines are required to address the COVID -19 pandemic . In addition, while there is continued discussion surrounding annual COVID -19 vaccine boosters,51-53 little to no work has been done to test the capacity of vaccine s to elicit neutralizing antibody response s with durability of ~one year and to elicit a sub sequent response following an annual booster dose. Our results show that DCFHP -alum can elicit durable, broad -spectrum neutralizing BA.4/5, BQ.1, and SARS -CoV-1) in NHPs. We also show that a robust, anamnestic response can be el icited following a second boost after ~one year. Several studies of COVID -19 vaccines have established that a cell-culture pseudovirus neutralizing titer of ~102 translates into human vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease of ~90% .52-56 In addition, clinical trials have es tablished a correlation between anti -SARS -CoV-2 monoclonal antibody levels (i.e., humoral immunity alone) and protection from COVID -19.57,58 Indeed, SARS -CoV-2 variant booster vaccines have been accepted by the FDA and EMA for emergency use authorization using neutralizing antibody titer as a correlate of protection.59,60 Accordingly, if our NHP results are reproduced in clinical tria ls, we anticipate that DCFHP - alum could be widely used as a booster vaccine for individuals who have been previously vaccinated with other COVID -19 vaccines, and in unvaccinated individuals that have been previously infected with SARS -CoV-2. Together, thes e two categories encompass a large fraction of the world's population. As such, DCFHP -alum would be an attractive annual vaccine that could circumvent the need for continual variant chasing. We also envision that DCFHP -alum could enable global access to CO VID-19 vaccination given its low projected cost of goods, high scale of production, and favorable broad -spectrum profile. Our results show that a DCFHP stabl y integrated CHO -based cell line could enable low - cost, large -scale production . Assuming a vaccine dose of <100 micrograms and a purification yield of >10%, we anticipate production of thousands of DCFHP vaccine doses per liter of engineered CHO -K1 cell culture . As well, the DCFHP -alum formulation is stable for at least two weeks at .

Taken together , DCFHP -alum is an excellent candidate for development as a new COVID -19 vaccine, offering broad -spectrum protection, and providing the opportunity for global access without the cold chain distribution challenges encountered with other vaccines .61 Finally, we anticipate the potential use of DCFHP -alum as an important primary vaccine in previously unvaccinated and uninfected individuals, especially in pediatric populations, including infants. Aluminum salt adjuvants are commonly used in infant vaccines and as part of routine childhood immun ization schedule s, and their excellent safety profile has been established over decades.31-36 In infants and other DCFHP -alum vaccine recipients na\u00efve to SARS - CoV-2 infection or vaccination , we would anticipate robust, cross -reactive responses similar to the na\u00efve NHPs studied here. Since primary immunization of NHPs with DCFHP -alum provides remarkably broad protection against VOC s, DCFHP -alum may be an ideal way to establish initial immune imprinting62-64 against SARS -CoV-2 in infants. .

The antibod ies with variable HC/LC were cloned between the CMV promoter and the bGH poly(A) signal sequence of the CMV/R plasmid to facilitate improved protein expression. The variable region was cloned into the human IgG1 backbone. This vector also contained the HVM 06_Mouse (P01750) Ig HC V region 102 signal peptide to allow for protein secretion and purification from the supernatant. Lentivirus plasmids The 21 -amino acid C -terminally truncated spike proteins with native signal peptides were cloned in place of the HDM -SARS2 -spike -delta21 gene (Addgene plasmid, 155130). This construct contains a 21 -amino acid C -terminal deletion to promote viral production, contained in all SARS - CoV-2 variants of concern. The SARS -CoV-1 spike contained an 18 -amino acid C -terminal deletion. The other viral plasmids that were used have been previously described,1 in -house for all nanoparticle pro duction.

Protein production Transiently expressed proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells. Expi293F cells were cultured in media con taining 66% Freestyle/33% Expi media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and TriForest polycarbonate shaking flasks at 37\u00b0C in 8% CO 2. The day before transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to a density of 3\u00d7106 cells / mL in fresh media. The next day, cells were diluted and transfected at a density of approximately 3 -4\u00d7106 cells / mL. Transfection mixtures were made by combining the following components and adding the mixture to cells: maxi -prepped DNA, cultur e media and FectoPro (Polyplus) at a ratio of 0.5 -0.8\u00b5g:100\u00b5l:1.3\u00b5l to 900\u00b5L cells. For example, for a 100 -ml transfection, 50 -80\u00b5g of DNA would be added to 10mL of culture media, and then 130\u00b5l of FectoPro would be added to this. After mixing and a 10- minute incubation, the resultant transfection cocktail would be added to 90mL of cells. The cells were harvested 3 -5days after transfection by spinning the cultures at >7,000g for 15minutes. Supernatants were filtered using a 0.22 -\u00b5m filter. Prote in purification \u2014 Fc Tag -containing proteins All proteins containing an Fc tag (for example, IgGs and hFc -ACE2) were purified using a 5 -ml MabSelect SuRe PRISM column on the \u00c4KTA pure fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Cytiva). Filtered cell supernatants were diluted with a 1/10 volume of 10\u00d7 PBS. The \u00c4KTA system line - 1\u00d7 PBS; and Sample lines - H2O. The protocol washes the column with A1, followed by loading of the sample in Sample line 1 until air is detected in the air sensor of the sample pumps, followed by 5 column volume washes with A1 and elution of the sample by flowing of 20ml of A2 (directly into a 50 -ml conical containing 2ml of 1M Tris pH 8 .0). The column was then washed .

The resultant Fc -containing samples were concentrated using 50 -kDa or 100 -kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrators. Protein purification \u2014 His-tagged proteins Expi293F expressed SARS -CoV-2 RBD, containing a hexa -His tag was purified using HisPur Ni -NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expi cell supernatants were diluted with 1/3 volume of wash buffer (20mM imidazole, 20mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 150mM NaCl), and the Ni -NTA resin was added to diluted cell supernatants and then samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C while stirring overnight. Resin -supernatant mixtures were added to chromatography columns for gravity flow purification. The resin in the column was washed with 20mM imidazole in 1xPBS, an d the proteins were eluted with 250mM imidazole in 1xPBS. Column eluates were concentrated using centrifugal concentrators followed by size -exclusion chromatography on an \u00c4KTA pure system. \u00c4KTA pure FPLC with a Superose 6 Increase gel filtration column (S 6) was used for further purification. OnemL of sample was injected using a 2 -ml loop and run over the S6, which had been pre -equilibrated in de -gassed 20mM HEPES and 150mM spike ferritin nanoparticles were isolated as previously described.3 Briefly, they were purified using anion exchange chromatography, followed by size -exclusion chromatography using an SRT\u00ae SEC -1000 column. Expi293F supernatants were concentrated using a AKTA Flux S column (Cytiva). The buffer was then exchanged with 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 v ia overnight dialysis at 4\u00b0C using 100 kDa molecular weight cut -off (MWCO) dialysis tubing. Dialyzed supernatants were filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter and loaded onto a HiTrap\u00ae Q anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0. Spike nanoparticl es were eluted using a 0 -1 M NaCl gradient. Protein -containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 100 kDa MWCO Amicon\u00ae spin filter, and subsequently purified on a AKTA Pure system (Cytiva) using an SRT\u00ae SEC -1000 SEC column equilibrated in 1X P BS.

Prior to samples were supplemented with 10% glycerol, fil tered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter, snap frozen, and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. DCFHP purification was done similar to above except via flowthrough anion exchange followed by size -exclusion. Two buffers were initially prepared (buffer A: 20mM Tris pH 8.0, fer 8.0, 1M NaCl). Filtered Expi293F or CHO supernatant was diluted with buffer B by 1/5 volume to a final concentration of 200mM NaCl. The HiTrap\u00ae Q anion exchange column was washed with 5 column volumes ( CV) sequentially with buffer s A, B, A, prior to sample loading. Diluted sample containing 200mM NaCl was added to the column and the flow through was collected. One 5mL HiTrap\u00ae Q anion exchange column was used for every 200mL of diluted media. Multiple columns were joined in series for lar ger sample volumes. 100 kDa MWCO Amicon\u00ae spin filters were used to concentrate and buffer exchange the sample with 2 washes with 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5. After the final wash, the sample was concentrated and filtered with a .22\u00b5m filtered. The filte red sample was then loaded onto an SRT SEC -1000 column preequilibrated with 20mM tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl. The nanoparticle containing fractions were pooled as indicated in SI Fig 1. Samples were routinely concentrated to .5 -1mg/mL and flash frozen in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM 5% sucrose (weight:volume) buffer. Formulation with (Invivogen ) was done by first extensively mixing (inversion 50 times) of the alum adjuvant and then mixing with appropriately diluted immunogen, at least 15 minutes prior to immun ization. SDS-PAGE Analysis For the SDS -PAGE quantitation of DCFHP, samples diluted 10X in 1xPBS were mixed with the 2X reducing SDS sample buffer (900 \u00b5L 4x SDS PAGE sample buffer (Biorad) + 100 \u00b5L \u00df - mercaptoethanol + 2 ml of water) at 1:1 ratio and 10 \u00b5L of the mixture was loaded the 10 -well 4 - 20 % SDS-PAGE gradient gel.

Production of this cell line is described in detail in ref.10 with the addition of stable TMPRSS2 incorporation. ACE2/TMPRSS2/HeLa cells were plated 1day before infection at 10,000 cells per well. Ninety -six-well white -walled, clear -bottom plates were used for the assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a white seal was placed on the bottom prior to readout. As previously described,3 on the day of the assay, dilutions of heat inactivated serum were made into sterile D10 medium. Samples were analyzed in technical duplicate in each experiment. Virus - only wells and cell -only wells were included in each assay. Add itionally, a COVA2 -15 positive neutralization control was included in each assay to confirm replicability of the experiment. A virus dilution was made containing the virus of interest (for example, SARS -CoV-2) and D10 media (DMEM HEPES). Virus dilutions into media were selected such that a suitable signal (>1,000,000RLU) would be obtained in the virus -only wells. Polybrene was present at a final concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL in all samples . 50 \u00b5L of heat inactivated sera was mixed with 50 \u00b5L viral dilution to make a final volume of 120\u00b5l In each well. The inhibitor (serum dilution) and virus mixture was left to incubate for 1hour at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, the medium was removed from the cells on the plates made 1day prior. This was replaced with 100\u00b5l of inhibitor/virus incubated at 37\u00b0C Infectivity readout was performed by measuring luciferase levels. 48 hours after infection, the medium was removed from all wells and cells were lysed by the addition of 100\u00b5l of a 1:1 dilution BriteLite assay readout Elmer) and 1xDPBS (Gibco) into each well.

Half -life values were calculated starting from the maximum serum titer obtained for each sample. Half -life values were first calculated via a 1 phase decay, which, when unconstrained, demonstrate d high plateau values of serum neutralization around 103, demonstrating the importance of constraining the plateau value to close to 0. Constraining the plateau to log(100), we tested both one -phase (monophasic) and two -phase (biphasic) decay. The fast pha se of the two -phase decay fit well for all animals (SI Table 5) but given the slow decline of neutralizing titers, there was not enough data to fully fit the slow phase decay for some animals, specifically those in group B. in such cases where estimated ha lf-life was >5000 days, 5000 days was used for average calculations shown in SI Table 5. LOQ was set as the neutralizing titer of day 0 serum or the lowest serum dilution tested, whichever was higher. For samples with different LOQs on the same graph, the average value was used. ELISA RBD (5\u00b5g/mL) was plated in 50\u00b5l in each well on a MaxiSorp (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microtiter plate in 1xPBS and left to incubate for at least 1hour at room temperature.

When 50% CPE was detected, the contents were collected, clarified by centrifugation and stored at -80\u00b0C as a passage 0 stock. 1:10 diluted passage 0 stock was used to inoculate at approximately 80% CPE. All viral stocks were sequenced to confirm lineage, and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) was determined by titration. Live SARS -CoV-2 virus 50% CPE endpoint neutralization CPE endpoint neutralization assay s were performed following the limiting dilution model using sequence -verified viral stocks of in BSA -PBS and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 100TCID 50 of each virus and incubated for 1hour at 37\u00b0C.

Positive and negative controls were included as well as cell control wells and a viral back titration to veri fy TCID 50 viral input. Individual wells were scored for CPE as having a binary outcome of 'infection' or 'no infection', and the ID 50 was calculated using the Spearman -Karber method. All steps were done in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory using approved prot ocols.

(B) Representative flow plots from NHP PBMCs stimulated with DMSO (top) or spike protein peptides (bottom), gated as in A were further gated based on intracellular cytokine activity. Stimulation results in positive populations when staining fo r intracellular cytokines (bottom). Percent positive cells denoted on plots. Percent positive was determined by subtracting the percent positive in the DMSO sample to that in the stimulated sample. .
