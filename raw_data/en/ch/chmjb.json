In addition, a teaching pack, including an edited film, will be created and disseminated to journalism and media teachers. Sarah Norcross Progress Education Trust When It Takes More Than Two \u00a317,382 Donor conception is an important part of fertility treatment. In 2008, there were 6391 treatment cycles using donated sperm, eggs and embryos in the UK. The 'When It Takes More Than Two' project will clarify public and professional understanding of donor conception, particularly in relation to identity, parenthood, genetics, donor information and screening. The project will disentangle what the term 'parent' means in various scientific and social contexts, and improve understanding of the relevant genetics. This is crucial, because donors are often marketed on the basis of characteristics whose heritability is complex or even non-existent. The Progress Educational Trust will organise three public events; source and write case studies, a heredity factsheet and key definitions; conduct an online poll; and publish and disseminate a variety of related materials. Matthew Piper University College London Living Healthier for Longer: Research to enhance lifelong health \u00a38,000 Ageing and age-related diseases impose a serious social and economic burden on society. Recent research indicates that age-related diseases are symptoms of an underlying disease: ageing itself. Thus by treating ageing, we could simultaneously treat all diseases of ageing. Remarkably, scientists have recently discovered ways to extend healthy lifespans in laboratory organisms, and the data indicate these interventions could potentially benefit human ageing. This project will exhibit this research from the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing at the 2012 Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition. Jody M Mason University of Essex Using Digital Art to Raise Awareness of Alzheimer's Disease \u00a330,000 This project aims to create an interactive game to convey Alzheimer's disease pathology at the cellular level, as well as potential therapeutic intervention approaches. With an ageing population and the number of people with dementia set to double every 25 years, it is clear that without better therapies young people of today will become the carers of those with Alzheimer's disease tomorrow. Through an informal and unconventional approach, this game will seek to engage players with an understanding of the mechanisms of the disease progression and the drugs and methodologies being researched to try to halt it. Matthew Hurley University of Nottingham CF-unlocked - an online conference breaking down barriers of cystic fibrosis \u00a329,623 CF-unlocked aims to facilitate the dissemination of information and engender collaboration between researchers and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The project will narrow the gap between individuals with CF and the wider scientific community caused by patient segregation. By their mid-teens, the majority of people with CF will have lung infections with bacteria that are transmissible to others with the condition. For this reason, people with CF are strongly discouraged from meeting in person, and so are actively excluded from meetings that are held. This project will provide online events for researchers and patients, bypassing the infection control concerns and enhancing the positive aspects of patient/scientific conferences.
