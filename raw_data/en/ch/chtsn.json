This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease4Truthfully, your health is determined by many factors, including energy levels, exercise habits, diet, stress levels, exposure to toxins, and simply how you feel. Many of these factors are easily measured in quantitative form, such as blood pressure and body mass, while others are more subjective and difficult to assess, like emotional health and energy levels. CHAPTER ONE: Obstacles That Impede Wellness and Longevity in Modern Society There are many ways to measure health and wellness. For some people, it's how they look and feel, while for others it's things like cholesterol levels and weight. Along with personal risk factors, we face health challenges simply because of the world in which we live. In our modern world, high-stress jobs and jam-packed schedules leave little time for exercise and quality sleep. We have seemingly endless access to processed foods and are accustomed to a diet that lacks many important nutrients needed for good health. The consumer products we use may increase exposure to toxins, further endangering health. In fact, these same poor lifestyle factors can also affect your metabolic health. Unhealthy eating and physical inactivity threaten your metabolic health, which can lead to further, serious problems. Lifestyle choices are the foundation for wellness. 5Vitamin D 95% Vitamin E 94% Magnesium or MineralPercentage of dietary intakes belo w the EAR (in adults 19 and older) Among many effects, what you eat has a major impact on your health status, weight, and emotional state. As mentioned, the typical modern diet is full of highly processed food and lacks vital nutrients. Your specific nutrient requirements depend on several distinguishing factors. While amounts and types of nutrients a person needs can vary, most of us aren't likely to reach daily requirements for several key vitamins and minerals. Nutrient requirements are determined by the amount of a vitamin or mineral needed to minimize a nutrient deficiency based on age, sex, and several other factors. Each group has a specific set of general nutritional requirements that help them stay healthy. The estimated average requirement (EAR) allows an individual to compare his or her nutritional intake to requirements based on age, sex, and so on. The chart on the right shows the number of American adults who aren't reaching their daily nutritional requirements for specific vitamins and minerals. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Oregon State University Micronutrient Information Center, ninety-four to ninety-five percent of American adults aren't reaching requirements for vitamins D and E, and nearly half of Americans (or more) don't fulfill nutrient requirements for magnesium, vitamin A, calcium, and vitamin C.Nutrient Deficiencies 6Whenever you consume the proper amount of a vitamin or mineral, your body receives specific health benefits. If certain nutrients are missing, then your body isn't receiving the resources it needs to function properly. While some food cravings can be psychological, most are the result of nutrient deficiencies. Your body is an incredibly complex system that's always trying to attain perfect balance or homeostasis, and to this end it provides you with a wide range of subtle signals designed to incentivize you to perform proper bodily maintenance. Food cravings are just one example of a signal your body uses to tell you it's out of balance. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to serious issues or make existing conditions even worse. Depending on the deficiency, your body may suffer from a wide range of issues like fatigue, weak bones, threats to cardiovascular health, and more.Nutrient Defeciencies can contribute to: The standard American diet is a top contributor to early hormone imbalance. The two biggest factors that slow metabolism are inactivity and poor dieting. Poor dieting goes beyond eating high-calorie foods. It also factors in the nutrients you consume. If you're experiencing a vitamin deficiency, your metabolism is going to struggle. There's an emotional aspect to cravings as well. Scientists suggest carb cravings occur because of the effect carbs (especially sugars) have on your brain. Consuming sugary foods increases the levels of the \"feel-good\" hormone serotonin, making you correlate feeling good with consuming carbs. So eating carbs can actually make you want more. What's the solution? For many people, supplementation can provide their bodies with adequate vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to support healthy overall function. Fatigue Weak Bones Threats to Cardiovascular Health ...and moreLots of food sources provide vitamins and minerals, but American adults are generally falling short in meeting their daily nutrient requirements. For most of those people, overall health would improve by making dietary adjustments, removing stress, exercising every day, getting adequate sleep\u2014the list goes on and on. However, implementing and maintaining such changes isn't always as easy as it sounds. Unfortunately, health often takes a back seat to other tasks like taking care of family and work and keeping up with other everyday demands.CHAPTER TWO: The Supplementation Debate While dietary supplements usage is a widely debated topic (and has been for years), the fact remains that many people aren't getting the nutrients their bodies need through food alone. 8Whether you're using supplements to make up for nutrient deficiencies, to support your personal health journey, to help with aging concerns, or to round out a healthy lifestyle, supplements can be effective for a variety of people across different stages of life. Additionally, today's healthy foods are different from the historic diets your genes are programmed for. For thousands of years, agricultural breeding has had the goal of improving yield and taste. And because many micronutrients don't taste good, they've been inadvertently bred out of food. The ugly wild apples you see in the image have about a hundred times more phytonutrients and a lot more vitamin C than the apples you buy in the grocery store today! And this is just one example of what happened to the entire food supply. This can be part of why even healthy modern diets sometimes fail to meet recommended daily allowances (RDA) and micronutrient requirements.Rather than simply falling short in maintaining good health, many turn to dietary supplements to promote better overall wellness. Supplements aren't a substitute for exercise and healthy eating, but they can help promote a healthy body when used in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle. Along with satisfying nutritional deficiencies that may be lacking in modern diets, some people choose to supplement as they seek to bolster their bodies. Certain supplements are designed to support heart health, and others are useful for promoting healthy bones.* For others, supplements provide a healthy way to handle the aging process.* As expected, many people notice they feel different as they age and use supplements to promote overall wellness as their bodies go through these changes.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseasedTERRA created the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae (LLV) with this fact in mind. Each complex blend has a specific job that assists with optimal health. Whether you're starting to feel the effects of aging or just want to promote a healthier lifestyle, LLV is designed to support your body's health, energy, and longevity.* Today, we'll be discussing the benefits of LLV products and how they can support a healthy lifestyle so you can look and feel your best.CHAPTER THREE: Your Body Can Thrive Your body has an amazing capacity to thrive when you give it what it needs!10 The three LLV products have been specially formulated to provide the body with antioxidants, support immune health, promote healthy energy levels, and offer proper nutrients that might be missing from your diet.* These products\u2014Alpha CRS+\u00ae, xEO Mega\u00ae, and Microplex VMz\u00ae\u2014use safe ingredients and CPTG\u00ae essential oils to provide people with a healthy way to promote vitality and wellness.* Absorption\u2014also known as bioavailability\u2014is key for supplemental support of the body. Two processes, chelation and full spectrum ratios, have been shown to improve bioavailability and play off our understanding of nutrition synergy. Because the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack provides its elements in chelated, full spectrum, and introduces them in a protein matrix, the digestive system is more capable of recognizing them as food and using them as opposed to excreting them. To give you a better idea of the overall benefits of these products, let's talk about some of the most appealing attributes of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae. The specialized formulas created for the products offer powerful antioxidants, provide immune support, and promote increased energy levels, while also providing essential nutrients and safe ingredients.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease11Energy Support While several factors can influence your energy levels, energy production typically begins in your cells. Many people blame a lack of energy or vitality on \"getting old.\" But you can help your cells efficiently produce chemical energy to keep your levels high. All energy is produced in microscopic cellular structures known as mitochondria. Mitochondria combine oxygen and food molecules to produce chemical energy. As you get older, you usually experience a decline in the number of mitochondria in your cells, which means less chemical energy is being produced. With a lack of chemical energy coming from your cells, people typically experience decreased vitality and energy. While energy levels can be influenced by aging, you can help protect your mitochondria and cells so they continue producing energy efficiently. By providing your body with antioxidants, you can protect your cells from threats that may lower their ability to produce chemical energy. You can also support healthy production of cellular energy by giving your body energy- producing nutrients. LLV provides the body with powerful antioxidants and essential nutrients you might not be getting in your regular diet.* Both elements can help protect your cells and allow your body to efficiently produce cellular energy, giving you the vitality you need as you go through the aging process.* Nutrient Support As mentioned, many of us aren't receiving proper nutrients through diet alone, so supplementation can serve as a healthy option for nutrient support. LLV products provide a balanced blend of vitamins, including antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E; an energy complex of B vitamins; and natural vitamin D3.* LLV also includes whole-food ingredients to help boost nutrient intake and enzymes to help the body digest and absorb these nutrients.*Antioxidant Support Cellular health plays a major role in living a long, healthy life. Healthy cells are threatened by molecules known as free radicals, which can damage healthy, functioning cells, thus speeding up the aging process. Free radicals typically enter the body through breathing and food metabolism, but they can also come from pollution, sun and radiation exposure, and smoking. You can neutralize free radicals with antioxidants. Your body can manufacture some antioxidants, and others can be found in certain foods. Because you often don't receive enough antioxidants from diet alone, it can be helpful to provide the body with antioxidants through supplementation. The products in the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack (LLV) include antioxidants. In particular, they contain polyphenols\u2014an especially powerful group of antioxidants that help protect against free radical damage.* Immune Support Without a strong immune system, maintaining good health is nearly impossible. Inadequate sleep, poor nutrition, high stress levels, and other factors can lead to a weakened immune system, which can jeopardize your health status and put you at risk of bigger health issues. Each LLV product provides specific benefits for immune function.* Alpha CRS+\u00ae has a potent blend of antioxidant molecules that help with immune support.* By using essential fatty acids and essential oils like Clove, Frankincense, and Mega\u00ae offers several immune- supporting properties.* Microplex VMz\u00ae provides vitamins and minerals that provide immune support.* Taking all LLV products daily can support healthy immune function\u2014a major factor in a healthy lifestyle.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease12Safe, Effective Ingredients Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack is that each product contains natural, safe, potent, and effective ingredients. With so many kinds of supplements on the market, it can be difficult to find an effective product without questionable contents. LLV uses ingredients that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These ingredients are tested for purity and guaranteed to be safe for human consumption. dTERRA also uses CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade\u00ae essential oils as part of the proprietary LLV formulas. CPTG\u00ae essential oils come from pure, natural plant sources and are always tested for safety and efficacy. By combining potent, high- quality essential oils with other natural extracts and ingredients, dTERRA ensures the safety and quality of each supplement. For some, supplementation is difficult because certain ingredients can cause stomach discomfort or interfere with food sensitivities. None of the LLV products contain genetically modified material or milk products.Invest in Your Health Your health is an important investment. When you have to purchase a different supplement for each desired benefit, the cost of staying healthy can rise quickly. Each of the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae (LLV) products contains ingredients that provide multiple benefits\u2014like those we just talked about\u2014in an affordable way so you can maintain good health. To obtain the equivalent of LLV ingredients and benefits, you'd have to purchase $200-$300 worth of supplements. LLV combines several wellness benefits in each product, making it the most convenient and cost-effective method for promoting a healthy lifestyle. LLV also has a 30-day money-back guarantee if you feel like the products aren't delivering your desired benefits. Now that we've discussed the benefits of LLV as a whole, let's look at each product individually to learn about the ingredients and properties that make it useful for promoting a healthy lifestyle. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease CHAPTER FOUR: Alpha CRS+\u00ae Alpha means first, CRS is an acronym for cellular renewal system, and the plus sign was added to emphasize improvements made to the original product.14DNA Protection Another way to promote healthy cellular function is by protecting cellular DNA, which regulates all activity within and between cells. DNA is found in the nucleus of each cell, regulating the communication and activity that goes on among the millions of cells in your body. A healthy cell is supposed to reproduce, perform specialized functions, and self-destruct when it's no longer effective to make room for new, healthy cells. When cellular DNA and other cell structures are damaged, the process of cell reproduction, function, and renewal can derail. Ingredients The Alpha CRS+ antioxidant cellular longevity polyphenol blend aims to do as the name suggests: prolong the longevity or lifespan of cells with polyphenols.* Remember, polyphenols are a powerful group of antioxidants known to protect cells against free radical damage. Free radicals can potentially damage cellular DNA, mitochondria (the molecules that produce chemical energy), and other important cell structures, but consuming antioxidants like polyphenols can help protect cells and their structures.* Other ingredients in Alpha CRS+ and their benefits: Boswellic healthy cellular biloba botanical extract supports mental clarity and energy.* dTERRA tummy tamer blend of botanical extracts helps prevent stomach upset.* The Alpha CRS+ formula is placed in sodium lauryl sulfate-free vegetable capsules.PURPOSES Antioxidants We've already discussed the importance of providing the body with antioxidants to protect against cellular damage from free radicals\u2014 unstable molecules that can harm or even destroy healthy cells, speeding up the aging process. Antioxidants are stable molecules known to neutralize free radicals. Antioxidants can help protect DNA and other cell structures from damage, promoting healthy aging. Along with helping protect your cells from free radicals, antioxidants can assist with keeping the heart, cardiovascular system, brain, and nervous system functioning properly.* Alpha CRS+ provides a healthy source of antioxidants to promote lifelong health and vitality.* Antioxidants can be found in many natural whole foods. However, it can be difficult to get adequate amounts of antioxidants daily from diet alone. By providing the body with antioxidants, Alpha CRS+ aims to make up the difference, supporting vitality and promoting healthy aging.* Vitality & Improved Energy Levels Your cells' health status can often determine the health of other body parts, including tissues and organs. Because energy production is part of healthy cellular function, you can feel decreased energy and performance as you age, as that's when your cellular function typically deteriorates. Alpha CRS+ provides cells with essential nutrients and protection from toxic stressors like free radicals to promote healthy cellular function.* Helping cells function properly supports healthy energy production, which can translate to vitality and wellness.* If you've experienced feelings of decreased energy over the years, Alpha CRS+ can promote healthy energy levels by protecting cells during aging.**These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseaseCHAPTER FIVE: xEO Mega\u00ae The x stands for astaxanthin (a standardized extract of microalgae), EO stands for essential oil, and Mega represents the omega benefits provided by this complex.17PURPOSES While Alpha CRS+\u00ae aims to provide the body with antioxidants and cellular protection, xEO Mega is designed to offer essential fatty acids (EFAs) that help bodily systems function healthily.* The body requires essential fatty acids for key functions like cell growth, brain development, muscle activity, immune function, joint health, and more.* Certain fatty acids are produced naturally in the body. However, essential fatty acids can't be produced by the body and must be obtained through diet. Several types of essential fatty acids exist, but the most common ones are omega-6 and omega-3. Though you can provide your body with these essential fatty acids with the food you eat, the typical modern diet usually contains too many omega-6 essential fatty acids in vegetable oils and hydrogenated or trans fats. While you do want some omega-6 to provide your body with essential nutrients, overconsumption has been linked to poor health. In contrast, scientific evidence suggests increasing dietary intake of omega-3 essential fatty acids can provide significant health benefits. Studies have shown some of these health benefits include positive effects on cardiovascular health, brain function, immune function, joint health and mobility, and the skin.* To maintain a healthy body and lifestyle, you must keep a proper balance between omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids by decreasing dietary intake of foods high in omega-6 and increasing intake of foods high in omega-3. Omega-3 essential fatty acids can come from fish, canola and olive oils, and some nuts and seeds. xEO Mega provides the body with the proper balance of essential fatty acids through a unique blend of marine- and land-sourced fatty acids and other plant- based ingredients.Ingredients xEO Mega contains a propriety blend of CPTG\u00ae essential oils, marine- and land-sourced omega fatty acids, and plant-based ingredients, which work together to provide the body with several important benefits. As discussed, some fatty acids are produced naturally in the body, while others must be obtained from food. It's possible to provide your body with sufficient omega-3 essential fatty acids through sources like canola oil, nuts and seeds, and fish. However, many people are increasingly concerned about the level of toxins and heavy metals found in the ocean, so daily fish consumption isn't an option everyone is comfortable with. Some nutritional experts even warn against eating fish too frequently to protect the body against exposure to toxic pollutants. Thankfully, the xEO Mega formula contains marine- and land- sourced omega fatty acids to provide the body with the proper balance of essential fatty acids and their benefits. Each serving of xEO Mega contains pure micro- filtered marine lipids, which provide high levels of essential fatty acids. The xEO Mega formula also provides useful fatty acids with pomegranate seed oil and Ahiflower seed oil. Main ingredients include: Marine and plant omega blend: This blend of concentrated, pure fish and Ahiflower seed oils provides useful essential fatty acids. Natural vitamins D and E: xEO Mega includes 800 international units (IU) of natural vitamin D and 60 IU of natural vitamin E. Vitamin D plays an essential role in bone health and growth and can promote healthy immune function, as well as healthy responses to cellular stress.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease18 Astaxanthin: Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant carotenoid harvested from microalgae. It's coupled with natural vitamin E to deliver circulatory and systemic benefits.* Essential oil blend: This essential oil blend provides the body with antioxidants to promote healthy cells.* Using essential oils in the xEO Mega formula also helps protect the essential fatty acids used from oxidation and rancidity, as the essential oils act as a natural preservative system. xEO Mega includes a proprietary blend of Clove, Frankincense, Thyme, Cumin, Wild Orange, Peppermint, Ginger, and German Chamomile essential oils. The xEO Mega formula is encapsulated in convenient, vegetarian-friendly softgels.Benefits The combination of powerful ingredients and essential oils in xEO Mega make it an incredibly effective supplement, providing the body with a healthy balance of essential fatty acids and other benefits. Promotes heart and circulatory health.* Supports healthy joint function and comfort.* Provides immune-supporting nutrients.* Supports healthy function of the brain, eyes, and nervous system.* Promotes healthy skin.* Provides antioxidants and supports healthy cellular responses, healthy immune function, and digestive calmness.* Provides a wide range of omega-3 essential fatty acids from marine and plant sources to help maintain a healthy balance of vital nutrients.* Offers systemic and circulatory benefits.* Provides natural sources of vitamin D and E. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseasevEO Mega\u00ae For those who don't wish to consume fish or marine-based products because of diet restrictions or personal preferences, dTERRA created vEO Mega. Alpha CRS+\u00ae and Microplex VMz\u00ae are already considered vegetarian-friendly, but the marine omega blend in xEO Mega\u00ae means it can't be labeled as vegan. With vEO Mega, dTERRA has made it possible for those who only wish to use products with plant ingredients to still benefit from increased intake of essential fatty acids. Instead of using a blend of fish oils, the vEO Mega formula uses plant and algae-based sources to provide a unique blend of essential fatty acids. While the ingredients are slightly different from xEO Mega, vEO Mega makes it easy for those who want to use vegetarian supplements to obtain essential fatty acids and enjoy their benefits.CHAPTER SIX: Microplex vMZ\u00ae Microplex is a combination of the words micronutrient and complex, VM stands for vitamins and minerals, and the z represents improvements made to the original product.21The Microplex VMz formula also promotes bioavailability, meaning your body recognizes and absorbs the vitamins, minerals, and food nutrients. Sometimes vitamins and minerals can be difficult for your body to recognize or absorb, so Microplex VMz uses a special patented glycoprotein matrix to assist with bioavailability. Plus, the formula also contains a blend of enzymes and mineral cofactors to enhance digestion and the assimilation of nutrients.* Main ingredients include: Balanced blend of essential vitamins: Antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E;* energy complex of B vitamins;* and natural vitamin D for enhanced bioavailability* Whole-food botanical blend: Kale, dandelion, parsley, kelp, broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, and spinach Enzymes to aid in digestion and of Calcium, iron, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, and chromium dTERRA tummy tamer botanical blend: Peppermint leaf, ginger root, and caraway seed extracts The Microplex VMZ formula is contained in sodium lauryl sulfate-free vegetable capsules and doesn't have any genetically modified materials.PURPOSES Along with antioxidants and essential fatty acids, your body needs essential vitamins and minerals to keep its systems functioning properly.* Essential vitamins and minerals can't be produced in sufficient quantities by the body, so we must rely on diet to provide the proper amount of nutrients. Unfortunately, most modern diets lack a variety of vitamins and minerals, often resulting in nutritional deficiencies. Microplex VMz is designed to provide you with adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals to promote optimum health when combined with a well-balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.* By taking it daily, you can give your body the vitamins and minerals needed for good health. Using its specialized formula, Microplex VMz delivers vitamins that are deficient in modern diets, like vitamins A, B, C, and E. The formula also gives the body minerals like calcium, magnesium, and zinc, which can promote bone and metabolic health.* We know from the estimated average requirements (EAR) chart that more than ninety percent of American adults don't reach the daily requirements for vitamin E, and roughly half of Americans don't fulfill nutrient requirements for magnesium, vitamins A and C, and calcium. While it's possible to reach these requirements with a healthy diet, that's easier said than done. Using Microplex VMz daily in conjunction with other healthy habits gives your body an adequate amount of nutrients it might otherwise be lacking. Ingredients Presented in a food-nutrient complex, Microplex VMz provides a variety of vitamins and minerals that help with the growth, function, and cell maintenance.* The supplement formula provides a blend of antioxidant and energy complex vitamins, as well as minerals that are beneficial for metabolism and bone health.**These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any diseaseBenefits With so many powerhouse ingredients and desirable benefits, it's easy to see why Microplex VMz is a must-have product in the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae. Provides 22 essential vitamins and minerals to support the normal growth, function, and maintenance of cells.* Fights free radicals with the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E.* Supports healthy metabolism and cellular energy.* Supports bone health with calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D.* Supports healthy immune function.* Supports healthy digestion.* Includes a patented glycoprotein matrix for enhanced bioavailability.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This formula still includes the vitamins and minerals found in the original Microplex VMz, as well as the dTERRA tummy tamer blend and a vegan-friendly patented glycoprotein matrix to help enhance bioavailability.* The Vegan Microplex VMz formula is encapsulated in sulfate- free vegetable capsules and doesn't contain any genetically modified materials.24One study using the United Kingdom Biobank found that for those without multiple conditions, a really healthy lifestyle increased average life expectancy at age 45 by 7.6 years in men and 6.5 years in women when compared with the unhealthiest lifestyles. CHAPTER SEVEN: Incorporating LLV into Daily Life The healthier the lifestyle, the greater the increase in life expectancy. The dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack (LLV) yields the best results when used alongside a healthy, well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and other healthy habits. Alpha CRS+\u00ae, xEO Mega\u00ae, and Microplex VMz\u00ae have been specially formulated to support optimal health when combined with the dTERRA wellness philosophy\u2014which includes healthy lifestyle choices and responsible medical care. As you incorporate LLV into your life, consider the following aspects of promoting a healthy lifestyle: Nutrition and digestion: Provide your body with important nutrients through a well-balanced diet that includes whole foods like fruits and vegetables. Support a healthy digestive system that can breakdown and optimize nutrient absorption. Movement and metabolism: Move daily and keep your metabolic function strong, healthy, and fully optimized for greater energy, stamina, and ideal weight and body composition. When combined with nutrition and digestive health, these factors are the keys to more life in your years.Nutrition and Metabolism Nutrition and metabolism have a synergistic effect on your health and overall wellness. While nutrition is the process of nutrient acquisition from your environment, you probably know metabolism as the chemical process your body uses to transform the food you eat into fuel. However, there's a lot more to your metabolic health! Your metabolism influences your energy, weight, body composition, sleep, and even cognitive performance. Studies have found persistent disturbance of nutrient metabolism or energy homeostasis\u2014caused by either nutrient deficiency or excess\u2014induces cellular stress, leading to metabolic dysregulation and tissue damage and eventually to the development of acquired metabolic syndromes. In September, dTERRA is releasing an incredible new system of products that are specifically designed to strengthen and optimize your metabolic function. Some of the latest research at Harvard and other institutions shows metabolic health and healthy aging are inseparable. That means the stronger and healthier your metabolic function, the younger you'll feel from the inside out. Scan the QR code below to learn more! "}
