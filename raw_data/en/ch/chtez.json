SIBO is a big root cause of bloating and IBS, and it's often overlooked. That's because SIBO does not show up on an endoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, or even CT scan! Not many providers are knowledgeable in treating SIBO with herbal antimicrobials. This is why I wanted to make this protocol available and accessible to everyone. In this video, I present my [4 Phase Herbal Protocol for SIBO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHATkKdznIA), which is now [available to the public and shipped throughout the United States](https://dr-rajsrees-public-supplement-store.myshopify.com/collections/sibo-treatment). My goal in spacing out the phases was to create a protocol that is easy for anyone to follow and also effective at addressing the root causes of SIBO. This allows you to try each phase, one at a time, and observe how it affects you. This also reduces the chances of side effects. I explain how best to take each supplement and review the SIBO diet in detail. This protocol has been proven effective by hundreds of patients in my practice. It's also the very protocol I used to heal my own SIBO! This was an exciting project for me, from preparing the content, creating all the original graphics, to recording and editing. Hope you enjoy the final video! Be sure to post all your questions and comments. Thank you for your support and I look forward to hearing from you! Warm regards, Rajsree Nambudripad, MD "}
