Community Consultation: Focus Groups . This ch apter presents the study aims, method, and results of this study seeking the views and experiences of autistic people, family members, and practitioners . 6 2. Project Administration 2.1 Chapter overview This chapter provides a summary of how the Guideline update project was administered. It begins with a statement of the purpose of the Guideline, scope, and target users to provide context for readers , drawing on the same information presented in the Draft updated Guideline document. This chapter also includes a summary of the people involved in the Guideline update process and project governance . 2.2 Guideline Purpose and Objectives This Guideline was developed to support clinicians involved in clinical assessment that may result in a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which is currently in its 5th edition (DSM -5-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2022) and the World Health Organization 's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, which is currently in its 11th edition (ICD -11; World Health Organization, 2019) . The specific objectives were to develop a Guideline that: 1. Describes a rigorous framework for accurately determining whether an individual meets the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of autism . 2. Outlines a comprehensive approach to identify related support needs. 3. Contains sufficient flexibility to apply to the assessment of a child, adolescent or adult of any age, gender, cultural or language background, communication or intellectual capacity, and medical complexity, living anywhere in Australia . 4. Describes a feasible process for clinical service providers to administer across the full breadth of community settings in Australia, including public and private healthcare settings . 5. Meets the needs and expectations of individuals being assessed and their caregivers. 2.3 Scope The Guideline is focused on assessment that is conducted where a clinical diagnosis of autism is being considered. The process includes making a referral, Assessment of Functioning, Medical Evaluation, and Diagnostic Evaluation. The scope of the Guideline update - which is unchanged from the original Guideline -was determined prior to the commencement of the research and community consultation activities, and is summarised in Table 2.1. 7 Table 2.1. The scope of the Guideline. Aspect In Scope Out of Scope Recipients of services Children, young people, and adults of all ages, for whom a clinical diagnosis of autism may be relevant. Children, young people, and adults not meeting this criterion. Focus of assessment Assessment where a diagnosis of autism is being considered. This includes assessment of individual characteristics, strengths, and supports needs, whether or not the assessment leads to a diagnostic evaluation and decision. Assessment where a diagnosis of autism is not being considered, or that focuses solely on goal setting and/or support planning. Outcomes of assessment Sharing and documentation of findings, as well as recommendations for supports where relevant. The provision of supports following assessment and diagnosis, irrespective of whether a diagnosis of autism was given. In presenting the scope, two considerations are highlighted: 1. People access medical and allied health assessments for a variety of reasons. For example, a person may seek an assessment if they have a difference or delay in development, are experiencing restrictions and/or barriers in life activities, and/or may have a diagnosable condition. A person may also access an assessment to better understand their experience of the wo rld, but not be seeking a clinical diagnosis. In each case, the practitioner would work within their scope of practice to meet the client's needs. The Guideline, rather than attempt to account for all possible reasons for assessment, and provide Recommendations for all aspects of practice, focuses specifically on clinical diagnosis of autism. 2. It is critical that an assessment for autism takes place in the context of a broader neurodevelopmental and behavioural assessment. This Guideline is intended to oper ate within the assessment processes applicable for children, adolescents, and adults presenting with characteristics of a broad range of neurodevelopmental conditions. 2.4 Target users The primary target users of this Guideline are Australian practitioners who conduct assessments that may result in a clinical diagnosis of autism. Secondary target users of this Guideline include the following groups: 8 1.Individuals who have characteristics that may be explained by autism diagnosis, as well as others (e.g., partn ers, family) can use this Guideline to understand how to initiate, and what to expect from, assessment for autism. 2.Australian medical, nursing, allied health , and education professionals and organisations who work with children, young people, and/or adults who show characteristics of autism can use the Guideline to know when and how to make a referral for autism assessment. 3.Australian medical, nursing, allied health , and education professionals and organisations who work with autistic people can use this G uideline to understand what assessment should involve to ensure recommendations are implemented and duplication of services is avoided. 4.Australian training providers, including peak bodies and tertiary institutions, can usethis Guideline to tailor educational and clinical resources, courses, and qualifications to ensure participants achieve the learning outcomes required to contribute to assessment for autism, where doing so will be within their scope of practice andconsistent with Guideline Recommendatio ns. 5.Australian funding bodies can use this Guideline to align resource allocation with therecommended process for assessment and diagnosis of autism. 2.5 Guideline f unding The Guideline w as developed (2018) by A utism C RC w ith support from the N ational Disability I nsurance A genc y, including f unding t o support the coordination o f the p roject (by Dr Kiah Evans), for the p ublic co nsultation a ctivities and for a n honorarium t o the Steering Committee members . The a uthors who led the original relea se - Andrew Wh itehouse, Valsamma E apen, M argot Pri or and John W ray - received no p ersonal financial or o ther remuneration for their in volvement in the proj ect. As part of NHMRC methodological review, they wi ll assess whether funding source for dissemination and implementation has been identi fied. David Trembath (Griffith University; Telethon Kids Institute) and Goo dall (Gri ffith University) were appointe d Co-c hairs of the Guideline Development Group, and Griffith University and Telethon K ids Institute received fu nding from Autism CRC to support this work. Dav id's contributions were in-k ind, with funding used to employ Emma Goodall and research fellows/assistants to support the work, to support community consultation activities, and to pay honoraria to the GDG members. 9 2.6 Process for ensuring editorial independence from funders The GDG had complete editorial independence from Autism CRC in updating the Guideline , with each entity having clearly defined roles and responsibilities. In chronological order, the mechanisms to ensure editorial independence included: Conceptualisation: The GDG responsible for the 2018 release of the Guideline recommended that it be updated within 5 years, consistent with NHMRC requirements. Commissioning: Autism CRC released a call for applications for funding to lead the update of the Guideline in 2022. The call was open to all Autism CRC member organisations. David Trembath led an application that was successful. Autism CRC invited David Trembath and Emma Goodall to Co- chair the update of the Guideline. David Trembath and Emma Goodall consulted with Autism CRC regarding aims, scope, and representation, but retained complete independence in all aspects of the proposal. Funding agreements: Autism C RC engaged Griffith University and project partners involved in the update (Telethon Kids Institute, University of Queensland, Victoria University of Wellington) via formal funding agreements. The funding agreement stipulated that each party would ensure that research was conducted in accordance with the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (National Health and Medical Research Council [NHMRC] , 2018), which highlights the importance of honesty, rigor, and transparency: all of which rely o n editorial independence. Conduct: The GDG were responsible for all aspects of project design and delivery. Autism CRC involvement was limited to (a) receiving updates on progress towards agreed project milestones in accordance with the funding agreements and (b) facilitating the community consultation through sharing information (e.g., overview of activities, invitations to participate) via the Autism CRC website and database, and via social media. The GDG were responsible for drafting the information that Autism CRC share d with the community. All research activities were approved by the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee and implemented using Griffith University research infrastructure (e.g., M icrosoft Teams for focus groups, REDCap for online surveys). Autism CRC w as not involved in evidence synthesis nor formulation or refinement of the recommendations. External consultation: The GDG were responsible for all consultation regarding the contents of the G uideline, including liaising with and incorporating feedback from the Reference Group. Draft Guideline: The GDG were responsible for drafting the Guideline. Autism CRC had access to a copy of the Draft Guideline as it was developed to assist with formatting and graphic design. Autism CRC had authority to make changes to the formatting (e.g., organisation branding) and phrasing (e.g., in order to prepare plain language summaries in consultation with the GDG and to improve accessibility) but did not have authority to make changes to the meaning of any statement or recommendation in the Guideline. 10 2.7 Guideline Development Group The Guideline Development Group was established in accordance with the NHMRC (2011) requirements to lead the research and community consultation process. Terms of Reference The Terms of Reference are presented in Appendix 2.1 and include the following information about the project : Background . Purpose of the Guideline Development Group . Anticipated timeline . Membership of the Guideline Development Group . Appointment of Chair . Responsibilities of Project Team Members. Meetings . Code of conduct for the Project Team . Reporting. The Terms of Reference were signed by each GDG member. Meetings were held monthly from October 2022 to March 2023, and will continue to June 2023. Recruitment The members of the GDG were identified and appointed via a three -stage process. In the first stage, the Co-chairs identified a range of perspectives that were critical to updating the Guideline . These perspectives included lived expertise (autistic people, family members), clinical expertise (medical and allied health), expertise in human ethics, and the lived expertise of one or more Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander person/s. The Co -chairs also identified research expertise that would be relevant, including in relation to co -designed research, systematic reviews, community consultation, and Guideline development. Finally, the Co -chairs considered the nee d for continuity from the 2018 release of the Guideline through the update, to ensure the accurate interpretation of the original context, questions, evidence, and Recommendations. In the second stage, the Co-chair s identified people who had knowledge, sk ills, and experience relevant to each of these required perspectives, and distributed invitations via email. Consideration was given to ensuring diversity within the GDG . The email included an introduction to the project and Terms of Reference. The Co- chair s made themselves available to meet with invitees to discuss the Terms of Reference. In the third stage, the invitees returned the signed Terms of Reference to confirm their role within the GDG. 11 Member s The members of the GDG, including name, pos ition, affiliation, role, and expertise are presented in Table 2.2.

Rachelle Wicks led coding of the qualitative data from community consultation, and preparation of evidence summaries. Emma Hinze led coordination of the analysis of qualitative data in systematic reviews and data collected during community consultation activities. Declar ation of Interests The following process was adopted to en sure the declaration and management of any competing interests, in accordance with the NHMRC Guidelines for Guidelines (2016): Develop a conflict -of-interest policy The following information constitutes the conflict -of-interest policy used in the development of the Guideline. Determin ing if an interest is a conflict of interest Members of the GDG who were directly responsible for the design and conduct of research activities ( Emma Goodall, Wicks) each disclosed conflicts of interest using the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interests form ( https://journals.sagepub.com/pb - assets/cmscontent/HPQ/coi_disclosure.pdf ) at the outset of the project, and these forms were made available to one another to review. No major conflicts of interest were identified. All members of the GDG were required to complete the same form prior to having input into the drafting of Guideline recommendations. GDG Co-chairs reviewed all forms and identified processes that would be put in place if required (e.g., self -abstaining or asking group member to abstain from one or more aspects of the guideline development process). Appoint an independent chair Autism CRC invited Emma Goodall and David Trembath to act as Co-chair s based on their experience and demonstrated track record of co -designed and ethical research in related projects that included the National Disability Insurance Agency commissioned synth esis of evidence for non-pharmacological supports for autistic children and their families (Whitehouse et al., 2020 ) and developed of the Autism CRC National Guideline for supporting the learning, participation, and wellbeing of autistic children and their families in Australia (Trembath et al., 202 2). The Co-chair s had no financial interests relevant to update the Guideline to declare . 15 Select development group candidates As indicated above, members of the GDG were selected through a process that involved the Co-chair s first identifying perspectives and expertise that are critical to the development of the Guideline, and then inviting relevant people. Disclose interests th roughout development All GDG and Reference Group members were required to declare any potential conflicts of interest that arise during the guideline development process by (a) updating their form and (b) notifying the Co-chair s at the start of the following meeting (standard agenda item). GDG members were advised to notify the Co-chairs of any changes in their declarations, prior to providing feedback on any documents outside of GDG meetings (e.g., feedback on the Draft G uideline). The exception s to this approach were members of the GDG directly involved in day -to-day work on the Guideline (Emma Goodall, Wicks) who were required to notify this same group of any new disclosures as they arose and no later than the next weekly working group meeting. Manage conflicts of interest It was planned that c onflicts arising would be managed according to recommendations in the NHMRC Guidelines for Guidelines (2016) including members recusing themselves and/or being excluded from aspects of the guideline development process, removing a member from the GDG should a serious breach in relation to disclosures occur, and refusing sponsorship where a conflict exists. All decisions were to have be en discussed and documented within the GDG and published in the technical manual that accompan ies the Guideline . It is noted that these actions have not been required during the update of the Draft Guideline . Publish declarations of interest in the Guideline The declarations of interests for all GDG members are provided in Appendix 2.2. Guideline Development Group meetings The GDG met via videoconference on a monthly basis from October 2022 to March 202 3. Additional monthly meetings are scheduled for April, May, and June 2023 . Each meeting followed an agenda, focusing on (a) updates on Guideline activities and (b) discussion and decision -making within the GDG. Minutes of each meeting, along with a rolling record of actions arising and any supporting documents , were circulated between meeting s. The primary focus of each meeting was: October 2022: Introduction of members, project overview, discussion of GDG functioning , and overview of current GDG priorities. November 2022: Progress report on community consultation and umbrella review , discussion of timeline, and overview of the NHMRC and GRADE Evidence to Decision process. 16 December 2022: Progress report on community consultation and umbrella review , and discussion of Australian context and language choices. January 2023: Progress report on community consultation and umbrella review , and discussion of method for analysing Expression through Art submissions February 2023 : Update on method for analysin g Expression through Art submissions and reviewing draft updated Recommendations. March 2023: Review of Recommendations and Evidence to Decision Judgements. 2.8 Reference Group To support its work in community consultation, the GDG formed a Reference Group, comprising of representatives from organisations with members that play a critical role in assessment and diagnosis of autism or support and reflect the views of autistic people and family members; that represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, and represent Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities; or that were from a relevant Government Department (Department of Social Services, Department of Health) o r agency (National Disability Insurance Agency). Terms of reference The Terms of Reference are presented in Appendix 2.3 and include : Background (to the project) . Purpose (of the Guideline Development Group) . Anticipated timeline for the project . Membershi p of the Reference Group . Appointment of Chair . Responsibilities of Project Team Members. Meetings . Code of conduct for the Project Team . Reporting. The Terms of Reference were signed by each Reference Group member ahead of the first of three meeting s held during the Guideline development process in December 2022 and March 2023. A further meeting is scheduled for June 2023 . Recruitment The members of the Reference Group were identified and appointed via a three -stage process. In the first st age, the Co-chair s identified a range of perspectives that were critical to updating the Guideline . The Co-chair s also identified the need for represent ation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, represent ation of culturally and 17 linguistically diverse communities, and representation from the key Government agency : the National Disability Insurance Agency. In the second stage, the Co-chair s identified organisations, peak bodies, and agencies that are relevant to each of th e aspects identified and sent an email invitation to a representative (typically CEO) of each organisation , peak body, or agency inviting their participation and requesting they nomina te a representative to attend Reference Group meetings . The email included an introduction to the project and Terms of Reference. The Co -chair s made themselves available to meet with invitees to discuss the Terms of Reference. In the third stage, the nomi nees returned the signed Terms of R eference to confirm their role within the Reference Group . Members The members of the Reference Group are presented in Table 2.3.

This included members completing declaration of interests form s that will be published with the final version of the updated Guideline . Given that the Reference Group did not input into the formation of the draft Recommendations, some flexibility was given for members to complete their Declarations of Interest form s. Reference Group Meetings The Reference Group met via videoconference on two occasions (November 2022, March 2023 ) with a third meeting scheduled for June 2023 . Each meeting followed an agenda, focusing on (a) updates on Guideline activities and (b) discussi on of these activities. Minutes of each meeting, along with a rolling record of actions arising and any supporting documents , were circulated between meetings. The primary focus of each meeting was: November 2022: Introduction of members, project overview, confirming processes for governance and communication, overview of methodology, and review of proposed timeline. March 202 2: Summary of progress towards update of the Guideline, including research and community consultation activities, and review of upcoming stages of Guideline development. 2.9 Other people who contributed to the Guideline update.

Guideline Development Group: Multiple people with lived expertise of autism were invited to be members of the GDG. Four members are autistic, 3 members are parents of autistic children, and others have family members who are autistic. Reference Group: Two organisations were specifically invited to join the Reference Group. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network - Australia and New Zealand is run by and represents autistic people. Autism Awareness Australia is run by and represents parents and other family m embers of autistic people. Community consultation activities: A series of research studies were conducted as part of the Guideline update process to inform the recommendations. These were separate to the Public Consultation on the Draft updated Guideline and were used to gather evidence to inform the revising of recommendations. The activities include d: Focus groups for autistic people , family members of autistic people , and practitioners . An online community survey that was open to all member s of the community including autistic people , family members , practitioners and organisations. 21 2.11 Involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and culturally and linguistically diverse communities For a Guideline to serve the needs of all Australians, it is critical that the guideline development process includes proper consideration of issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. These considerations include recognising the enduring impact of historical injustices, discrimination, and marginalisation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples; the importance of understanding and embracing culturally -bound understandings of family practices and disability; and the need to ensure that every Australian has access to culturally -responsive and appropriate health and education services, delivered by people with appropriate knowledge, skills, understanding, and experience. The GDG took the following steps to ensure the Guideline Recommendations were responsive to these and other considerations relevant to these peoples and communities. First, the Guideline Development Group included Aboriginal representation. Second, the Referen ce Group included representatives from the peak organisation serving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples: The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO). 22 \u00fc3. Guideline Update Methodology 3.1 Introduction The methodology and findings that contributed to the development of the original Guideline are outlined in detail in the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia (2018) full Guideline document and the supporting Administrative and Technical Report. This report focuses on the methodology used to update the Guideline . This chapter focuses on the application of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Developmen t and Evaluations (GRADE) framework that was used to update the Guideline. The detailed methodology and findings of each of the research activities completed as part of the Guideline update process are presented in subsequent chapters ( Chapters 4-6). 3.2 NHMR C Guidelines for Guidelines At the time of the Guideline update, the NHMRC did not yet have published guidelines for Guideline updates. As such, the Guideline update process adhered closely to the approach described in the Guidelines for Guidelines handbook used for the development of Guidelines (NHMRC, 2016) . The phases of updating the Guideline included planning, revising , and reviewing the Guideline. The phases of implementing and further updating the Guideline will be outlined in the final version of the updated Guideline. In adhering to the handbook, the Guideline Development Process also met the NHMRC Standards for Guidelines: Standard 1 - Be relevant and useful for decision making Standard 2 - Be transparent Standard 3 - Be overseen by a guideline development group Standard 4 -Identify and manage conflicts of interest Standard 5 - Be focused on health and related outcomes Standard 6 - Be evidence informed Standard 7 - Make actionable recommendations Standard 8 - Be up -to-date Standard 9 - Be accessible 3.3 GRADE GRADE provides a systematic approach for developing practice recommendations (Sch nemann et al., 2013 ). The process involves (a) identifying clinical questions, (b) collecting relevant research evidence, (c) using the evidence to answer the clinical questions, and (d) in doing so formulate recommendations. I n determin ing the grade of recommendations, the GDG must consider the certainty of evidence for the recommendation, the benefits and risks, the values and preferences of the people whom the recommendation will affect, resource implications, impact on health inequities, 23 acceptability to the people whom the recommendation will affect, and feasibility of implementation. These steps, as they were applied in this Guideline update process, are outlined below. 3.4 Guideline development process Step 1: Establishing the Guideline Development Group (GDG) Purpose: The GDG was responsible for reviewing and refining the guideline questions, gathering updated evidence through a systematic review and community consultation, and using the updated evidence, alongside the original evidence, to revise - and then grade the strength of -recommendations using an Evidence to Decision (EtD) process. The GDG will also be responsible for considering community feedback on the Draft updated Guideline during the consultation period, making revisions if appropriate, and endorsing the final version of the updated Guideline for public release. Process: The process for determin ing the roles, and people who ultimately filled those roles, is presented in Chapter 2. Briefly, it included t hree stages, the first of which was to identify relevant perspectives to inform the Guideline development process, to identify people who could contribute those perspectives, and then invite participation including agreement with the Terms of Reference. People involved : A detailed description of the seventeen -member GDG is provided in Chapter 2. Briefly, a mong the 17 -member group were autistic adults; parents and other family members of autistic children, including individuals with complex support needs; an Aboriginal person; a person with expertise in ethics and research integrity; practitioners with experience across government and non -government sectors; and researchers with expertise in the guideline development process, including community consultation. Step 2: Revising Guideline ques tions Purpose: Asking relevant questions is critical to the development and update of a useful Guideline. Process: The GDG reviewed questions that formed the basis of the original version of the Guideline and considered whether any changes were required. In considering possible changes, the GDG reflected on (a) whether the questions remained relevant, (b) if any new questions should be added to reflect changes in the community and practice, and (c) if re - wording and/or organisation of questions could improve readability and reduce repetition within the Guideline. The updated Guideline questions were as follows: 24 Section Question Guiding principles What guiding principles should be followed in the assessment and diagnosis of autism? Foundations of assessment What should be the process for assessment and diagnosis of autism in the Australian context? What knowledge, skills, training, support, and regulation are required to conduct components of the Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation? What settings are appropriate for assessment? How should information be collected in an assessment? How should information be shared? When should referral for health, education, disability, social, and/or community supports be considered? How should the quality and safety of the assessment and diagnostic process be optimised? Making a referral for assessment When should a referral for autism assessment be initiated? Who should initiate a referral for autism assessment? What information should be collected? What should be the outcome once a referral for assessment has been considered? Comprehensive Needs Assessment When should an Assessment of Functioning be conducted? Who should conduct an Assessment of Functioning? What information should be collected as part of an Assessment of Functioning? What should be the outcomes of an Assessment of Functioning? When should a Medical Evaluation be conducted? Who should conduct a Medical Evaluation? 25 What information should be collected in a Medical Evaluation? What should be the outcomes of a Medical Evaluation? Diagnostic Evaluation When should a Diagnostic Evaluation be conducted? Who should conduct a Diagnostic Evaluation? What information should be collected in a Diagnostic Evaluation? What information should be considered in making a diagnosis? How should a diagnostic decision be made? What should be the outcomes of a Diagnostic Evaluation? Within GRADE, questions are typically asked using a consistent format that specifies the population (P = population of interest ), intervention (I = intervention/support/assessment that is being trialled), comparison (C = the alternative to the intervention /support/assessmen t), and outcome (O = the outcome of interest ). Such questions should be relevant to the community. For instance, a question that seeks to answer whether one type of assessment is more effective than another in accurately diagn osing autism, could be framed as \"In people seeking an assessment for autism (Population), is Assessment A (Intervention) more accurate than Assessment B (Comparison), in diagnosing autism (Outcome)?\" To answer this question, there must be sufficient studies involving the specific population, types of assessmen ts, and outcome of interest to enable a meta -analysis to be completed , which involves quantitatively combining data from across studies. However, this situation is uncommon in relation to research involving autistic people for several reasons including: Few or no studies available to answer question s that are most relevant to practice . Where studies are available , they vary in terms of the participant characteristics; assessments examined ; and how outcomes of interest are measured. Where studies are available, they also vary in terms of methodological quality including the clear and complete reporting of data needed to complete meta - analyses. The challenge with using the Population, Intervention /Assessment , Comparison, Outcome (PICO ) format extends beyond consideration of whether empirical evidence is available to answer a particular question. Two broade r challenges that were particularly relevant to th e update of this Guideline were as follows: Many questions parents and practitioners want answered do not align with the PICO format , such as \"What guiding principles should be followed in the assessment and diagnosis of autism ?\" Conceivably , if there were two or mo re studies comparing different guiding principles used in the assessment and diagnosis of autism and the 26 impact of these on client experience and diagnostic accuracy, it would be possible to compare the approaches to see which was more appropriate . However, doing so would rely on there being existing sets of guiding principles to compare, and then there being sufficient empirical evidence to compare them. At the same time, taking this approach would limit the answer to th is question to consideration of just principles that have been compared, whereas consulting the autistic and autism communities is likely to yield far more diverse views and preferences in relation to what constitutes appropriate guiding principles and how should they be selected. Related to the previous point, answering PICO questions relies on quantitative data. Yet, when it comes to understanding the views and experiences of autistic people , their families, and the broader autistic and autism communities, qualitative data are just as important. Therefore, questions need to be asked in a way that allows people to share a broad range of, at times differing, views and experiences. Given these challenges and limitations with adopting the PICO format, the GDG elected to formulate questions in a way that would prioritise the ir relevance to everyday practice. Doing so was consistent with the NHMRC Standard 1 (Be relevant and useful for decision making) to ensure Standard 7 (Make actionable recommendations) could be achieved. For this same reason, the Recommendations included in the Guideline are consensus -based recommendations, drawing on evidence from the research literature, combined with evidence collected through detailed community consultation from the original Guideline development and through the Guideline update process . People involved : The questions were developed and endorsed by the GDG. Step 3: Gathering evidence Purpose: For a Guideline to be relevant it must be evidence -based. For the updated Guideline, evidence -based refers to being consistent with an evidence-based practice framework, that combines the best available research evidence, with evidence from clinical practice, and the views and priorities of autistic people . The purpose of gathering new evidence was to ensure that recommendations were relevant and/or could be revised in a systematic way, consiste nt with GRADE, and reflecting multiple converging sources of evidence. Process: The GDG designed a series of research activities to gather recent , best available evidence from the published research literature and from the community. This involved undertaking a systematic review of recent published evidence as well as two community consultation activities. Ethical approval for the consultation activities was granted by the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee (202 2/780). The research activities were: 1. An umbrella review of recent evidence in relation to assessment and diagnosis of autism (Chapter 4). This was a systematic review of systematic reviews that examined evidence relating to: ( a) existing guidance for assessment and diagnosis, (ii) clinical tools and processes, ( b) considerations regarding personal and environmental factors, and ( c) experiences of the autistic and autism communities. 27 2. An online survey designed to understand experiences and current views and preferences of the autistic and autism communities regarding assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia (presented in Chapter 5). The survey was open to all members of the autistic and autism communities (including children). 3. A series of focus groups designed to provide an opportunity for autistic adults, family members, and practitioners to reflect on and discuss their experiences, views and preferences regarding assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia (presented in Chapter 6). The research and consultation activities were designed such that, across the collective set of activities, the GDG was able to collect evidence from all key stakeholders, including autistic children and adults, as well as members of the broader autistic and autism communities (i.e., organisations, support people, researchers , educators ). The populations represented by each evidence source are summarised in Table 3.1. All evidence collected through the research and consultation activities was used to inform the revision and update of recommendations through the Guideline. Table 3.1. Sources of evidence and populations represented. Sources of evidence Populations represented (i.e., research activity) Autistic Autistic Autistic Family Practitioner Organisations Other children young adults members s community people members Systematic review of recent evidence Online survey Focus groups People involved: The research activities were developed by the GDG and informed by the research consultation activities undertaken as part of the development of (i) the original version of the Guideline (Whitehouse et al., 2018 a) and (ii) the National Guideline for supporting autistic children and their families (Trembat h et al., 202 2). The day-to-day work of gathering and synthesising evidence was undertaken by nine members of the GDG (Nicole Dargue, ). The coding and analysis of data was undertaken by these same nine members of the GDG, with additional research support for qualitative data coding provided by Libby Groves, Veronica Frewer, Briohny Dempsey , and Amy Giesberts. 28 \u00fcStep 4: Reformatting the Guideline Text The original Guideline was developed according to NHMRC Guidelines for Guidelines handbook (2016) but did not use the GRADE method for moving from evidence to Recommendations. To ensure that GRADE could be applied when updating the Guideline, some reconfiguring of Recommendations and accompanying text was required, prior to applying GRADE. The process of reconfiguring the text also provided an opportunity to align formatting with the approach taken with Autism CRC's National Guideline for supporting the learning, participation, and wellbeing of autistic children and their families in Australia (2022). Aligning the formatting in this way should help practitioners in moving seamlessly from one Guideline to the other when working with autistic children and will lay the foundation for similar consistency for other Guidelines in the future. The process of reconfiguring the Recommendations and accompanying text involved five steps. First, all text from the original Guideline was transferred to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and organised according to the original Guideline questions. Second, this text was re -organised according to the updated Guideline questions. Third, the Recommendations and accompanying text related to each of the updated Guideline questions was reviewed, individually and as a group. Fourth, the text was reconfigured into a set of revised Recommendations, Good Practice Points, and if relevant accompanying text. At this point, no changes in the scope or meaning of th e Recommendations was allowed, only changes to the way the information was presented. Fifth, the Chair of the original Guideline Development Group (Andrew Whitehouse) reviewed the original and reconfigured text to ensure continuity in scope and meaning of Recommendations between the original Guideline and updated draft Recommendations, Good Practice Points, and accompanying text. Step 5: Moving from evidence to Recommendations An iterative process, built around an Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework, was used to move from evidence to recommendations (Alonso -Coello, Oxman et al., 2016; Alonso - Coello, Sch nemann, et al., 2016). The process was led within the GDG by a Draft Recommendations Working Group (DRWG; Nicole Dargue, research staff (Veronica Frewer, Libby Groves) to analyse data from the community consultation activities and review the draft updated Recommendat ions in light of the evidence generated. Evidence review and preparation of draft 1 of updated Recommendations Members of DRWG and research staff reviewed the draft updated Recommendations against evidence from the umbrella review and community consultation activities. In doing so, they considered if each Recommendation should be retained in its original form, be revised based on new evidence, or be removed based on new evidence. The team also considered whether one or more new Recommendations should be added. Proposed edits, along with the supporting evidence from the umbrella review and/or community consultation were documented first in an excel spreadsheet that contained the evidence 29 \u00fcsummary for each Recommendation, and second in the draft updated Guideline. One co - Chair reviewed the proposed edits and either endorsed them immediately or sought further clarification and consensus with the team before endorsing. The second Co -chair and all members of the DRWG reviewed the edits and any disagreements were discussed until consensus was achieved. Guideline Development Group review of Draft 1 of updated Recommendations The DRWG shared the draft updated Recommendations and Good Practice Points with the GDG. The GDG provided feedback at the monthly meetin g and via suggestions in shared documents. Grade of Recommendation judgements and preparation of Draft 2 of updated Recommendations Members of the DRWG incorporated feedback provided by GDG members to further update Recommendations and Good Practice Points. The DRWG also independently completed a review and judgement of each Recommendation against the seven criteria required within the GRADE Evidence to Decision framework (Alonso -Coello, Oxman et al., 2016; Alonso - Coello, Sch nemann, et al., 2016). The jud gements related to certainty of evidence, benefits and risks, values and preferences, resource implications, equity considerations, acceptability, and feasibility. The judgements occurred over five rounds, with the first involving independent review, followed by consensus review , and then review by the broader GDG . Based on the judgements, each Recommendation was then classified as either a 'strong' Recommendation or a 'conditional' Recommendation, as per the GRADE process and reflecting the confidence in the clarity of the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences. In the case of this Guideline, 'conditional' Recommendations indicated: uncertainty around alignment with values and preferences of autistic people and their family ; a possible reduction in health equity across populations; uncertainty around the acceptability of the Recommendation for practitioners; and/or a possible lack of feasibility in implementation. The classifications reflect the judgements of the GDG, based on the available evidence and other relevant considerations such as alignment with international conventions. The complete set of judgements is provided in the Supporting Evidence document accompanying this Guideline. The grade of Recommendations does not reflect whether a Recommendation should be implemented or prioritised. All Recommendations within the Guideline represent good practice and should be implemented. Rather, the grade of Recommendations (strong, conditional) is intended to support users in considering a range of factors when implementing a given Recommendation, such as the benefits and harms, resources needed, and the acceptability to individuals, families, and practitioners. A grading of a Recommendation as 'conditional' reflects a judgment that there are key factors to consider during implementation. Further information on the grading of each Recommendation is provided in the Supporting Evidence document. 30 The DRWG prepared the Draft updated Guideline and shared it with the GDG . The document w as reviewed and then discussed by members at a meeting of the GDG. The GDG endorsed the documents, subject to further minor edits and formatting. Step 6 : Public consultation on Draft updated Guideline The GDG prepared the Draft updated Guideline and supporting documents (Summary of Evide nce, Administration and Technical Report, and Easy Read summary) for public consultation . Ahead of public consultation The public consultation on the draft updated Guideline complied with Section 74A of the Commonwealth National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 and accompanying regulations. The following activities were undertaken ahead of the public consultation period: Autism CRC updated its webpage devoted to the Guideline update to reflect the upcoming consultation period and the in vitation to participate. Autism CRC announced the upcoming public consultation period, via an email distributed to people who had registered specifically for updates on the Guideline, as well as people who were on the Autism CRC communications database mo re broadly. Key professional and consumer organisations were identified through the Reference Group and were invited to provide feedback. Further announcements were made via Autism CRC social media, and then re -posted by GDG members. A Co -chair of the GDG emailed the Office of the Director General, Chief Executive or Secretary of each state, territory, and Commonwealth Health Department to prepare those offices for the publication of the Draft updated Guideline . 3.5 Recommendations and Good Practice Points The Evide nce to Decision ( EtD) process resulted in a set of Recommendation s and G ood Practice Points, which were formulated and presented in a way that met the following requirements: Consensus- based Recommendations Using the GRADE methodology, recommendations may be described as evidence -based or consensus -based. Evidence -based recommendations are typically based on evidence derived from one or more systematic reviews containing meta -analyses of empirical data, that are relevant to one or more clinical questions presented using the PICO format. Consensus -based recommendations are typically based on sources of evidence, other than those described for evidence -based recommendations, such as through non -systematic reviews, evidence derived through consensus-based processe s (e.g., Delphi studies), and qualitative data pertaining to re levant stakeholders' views and experiences. 31 For this Guideline, the GDG was unanimous in endorsing the formulation of consensus- based recommendations, for the following reasons (also explained in Section 3.4): The questions that are most relevant to prof essional practice rarely align with the PICO format. There is a lack of empirical evidence on which to make judgements, even if the PICO format was deemed appropriate . The GDG determined that it was critical to gather evidence from all relevant stakeholde rs across the autistic and autism communities, including autistic children, their families, and practitioners to ensure the Recommendations are relevant, acceptable, and feasible. All Recommendation s are clearly labelled as C onsensus -Based Recommendations . Recommendations are defined as \"Key elements of practice that must be followed for a practitioner to deliver evidence -based supports.\" Good Practice Points were linked to specific Recommendation s and defined as \"Elements of practice that provide critica l context to that Recommendation , such as how a Recommendation should be operationalised in clinical practice, or how it is applied to a specific population or under specific circumstances.\" 3.6 Language used in formulating Recommendations and Good P ractice Points In drafting the Recommendation s and G ood Practice Points, the GDG adhered to the following three requirements: The wording must be in plain English, specific, unambiguous, employ consistent terminology, and accessible to autistic people, family members, and practitioners. The wording must convey one or more specific actions that practiti oners should take. The wording must reflect the evidence on which the Recommendation or Good Practice Point is based, in terms of both strength and precision . 32 4. Recent evidence in relation to assessment and diagnosis for autism: An umbrella review 4.1 Background A synthesis of existing research evidence is critical to the development and update of any Guideline. This evidence can be used to inform the recommendations and to identify factors (e.g., certainty of evidence, feasibility) that should be considered when they are implemented (NHMRC, 2016). 4.2 Aims The aims of this umbrella review w ere to synthesise data from existing systematic reviews regarding the following aspects of assessment and diagnosis for autism: (a) existing guidance; (b) clinical tools and processes; (c) considerations regarding personal and environmental factors; and (d) experiences of the autistic and autism communities. 4.3 Research Questions The umbrella review aimed to answer the following research questions: 1. What recommendations have been made to guide medical and allied health practitioners in assessing and diagnosing autism? 2. What clinical tools and processes contribute to timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis for autism? 3. What were the considerations regarding personal and environmental factors in assessment and diagnosis for autism? 4. What were the views and experiences of the autistic and autism communities regarding assessment and diagnosis for autism? 4.4 Design This project was an umbrella review, which involved systematically searching for and selecting relevant systematic reviews, then synthesising and presenting data f rom the selected reviews. This umbrella review was conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Joanna Briggs Institute manual for evidence synthesis (Aromataris et al., 2020) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) statement (Page et al., 2021). 33 4.5 Method Eligibility Systematic reviews (SRs) were included in the umbrella review if they met all the following criteria: 1. The SR was a meta -analysis or a narrative synthesis (i.e., a SR without a meta -analy sis). A review was considered \"systematic\" if it: (1) included a clear statement of the purpose of the review; (2) described the search strategy (e.g., key search terms, multiple relevant databases, specification of search limits); (3) indicated the criteria used to select studies for inclusion; (4) presented all findings relevant to the main purpose of the SR; and (5) used a method of quality appraisal for each included study. 2. The SR reported on assessment and diagnosis for autism. SRs including diagnosis for other conditions in addition to autism could be included if results were reported separately for autistic individuals. 3. The SR focused, at least in part, on one of the following four areas: a. Recommendations to guide medical and allied health practitioner s in assessing and diagnosing autism. b. Clinical tools and processes that contribute to timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis for autism (e.g., consideration of diagnostic accuracy, location of assessment, single vs. multidisciplinary team, professional knowledge and experience etc.). c. Considerations regarding personal (e.g., gender, age) and environmental (e.g., residential location, financial resourcing) factors in assessment and diagnosis for autism. d. The views and experiences of the autistic and autism communities regarding assessment and diagnosis for autism. 4. The results of the SR were relevant to one or more of the following questions related to guiding clinicians' practice in assessment and diagnosis: a. What guiding principles should be followed in the assessment and diagnosis of autism? b. In making a referral, conducting a functional, medical, and/or diagnostic assessment: i. When should this be considered? ii. Who should be involved? iii. In what settings should it occur? iv. What knowledge, skills, training, and support were required? v. What information should be collected? vi. How should information be collected 34 vii. How should decisions be made? viii. What should be the outcomes? ix. How should information be shared? c. How should the quality and safety of assessment an d diagnostic services be ensured? 5. The SR was published as a thesis, conference paper, scientific report, or peer -reviewed journal article. 6. The SR had a full -text copy available in English. 7. The final literature search was conducted in the last 6 years (20 17-2022). If the search end date was not stated, then the SR was published in the last 6 years. There were no restrictions placed on the design of the studies included within each SR. SRs were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: 1. The SR fail ed to meet one or more of the above inclusion criteria. 2. The article was an umbrella review or \"review of reviews\". 3. The SR incorporated theoretical studies, text, and opinion as their primary source of evidence. 4. The article was a protocol for a SR only. 5. The SR focused exclusively on research related to understanding aspects of autism outside of the assessment and diagnostic process (e.g., aetiology, neuroimaging techniques, prevalence, developmental trajectories, factors impacting likelihood of autism including biomarkers, accuracy of screening tools and universal screening programs). 6. The SR had been superseded by an updated version of the same review (completed after full -text review of all SRs for all other eligibility criteria) 7. The SR was presented in a report, that has since been superseded by a scholarly publication (completed after full-text review of all SRs for all other eligibility criteria). Search Strategy A literature search was conducted in October 2022 using the following databases: PsycINFO, Edu (ERIC), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus, EBSCO Education Source, Web of Science, and Epistemonikos. The search terms were: (Autis* OR pervasive OR PDD* OR pervasive child development disorder* pervasive childhood developmental disorder* OR PCDD* OR disintegrative disorder*) AND (diagnos*) AND (systematic evidence synthes* OR meta -analy* OR meta -regress*). The full search strategy for each database is provided in Appendix 4.1. Ancestral searches were also completed for the reference lists of included SRs. 35 Study Selection All studies retrieved from the database searches were imported into the Covidence software platform. Duplicates identified by the software were automatically removed prior to screening. Two reviewers ( Rahcelle Wicks and either Hannah Waddington or Nicole Dargue ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the studies against the inclusion/exclusion criteria and excluded articles if they met one or more exclusion criteria. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved via consensus. If an agreement could not be reached, another member of the research team was co nsulted ( David Trembath ). The percentage of agreement [agreements/(disagreements + agreements) \u00d7 100] for the title and abstract screening was 87.6%. Next, two reviewers ( Rachelle Wicks and either Hannah Waddington or Nicole Dargue ) independently screened the full -text reports of all potentially relevant articles according to the eligibility criteria. Once the authors finished individually screening all full-text reports they also reviewed all SRs to determine whether they (a) had been superseded by an updated version of the same review or (b) were reports which have been superseded by a scholarly publication and should thus be excluded. No reviews were excluded for this reason . Again, any disagreements were discussed and resolved v ia consensus with another member of the research team if needed. The percentage of agreement for the full -text 87.2%. Data Extraction Characteristics of the Included Systematic Reviews Two reviewers ( Libby Groves , Rachelle Wicks) read the SR in full, inclu ding supplementary material relevant to answering one or more of the Guideline questions. These reviewers extracted the following information about the SR characteristics: (a) title, (b) authors, (c) year of publication, (d) aim(s)/objective(s) of the SR, (e) the type of SR (i.e. , meta -analysis with narrative synthesis), (f) search details, (g) number of studies included, (h) population/s included, (i) concept/context, (j) design/s of included SRs, (k) quality of included studies including the assessment tool used, (l) sources of funding and conflicts of interest, (m) location(s) in which data for included studies was collected. The full list of extraction questions is included in Appendix 4.2. The reviewers then categorised the SR into one or more of the fo llowing four categories, based on the focus of the review: (a) SR focused primarily on recommendations to guide medical and allied health practitioners in assessing and diagnosing autism (Recommendation focused), (b) SR focused primarily on clinical tools and processes that contribute to timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis for autism ( Process focused), (c) SR focused primarily on the considerations regarding personal and environmental factors in assessment and diagnosis for autism ( Factor focused ), and (d) SR focused primarily on the views and experiences of the autistic and autism communities regarding assessment and diagnosis for autism ( Experience focused ). 36 Any disagreements were discussed and resolved via consensus between the two reviewers. The percentage of agreement [agreements/(disagreements + agreements) \u00d7 100] for the title and abstract screening was 78.6%. Qualitative Evidence from Systematic Reviews related to Guiding Clinicians' Practice Coding framework Following the Framework method of analysis (Gale et al., 2013) , a coding framework was developed to be used across all research activities (umbrella review and community consultation activities) undertaken as part of the Guideline update . The codes within the framework reflected the guiding principles that should be followed by practitioners and the processes engaged in during the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism. A series of codes were developed for each Guideline question, with more than one code able to be applied where relevant. For guiding principles, a preliminary set of codes was developed, drawing on the guiding principles used in the National guideline fo r supporting the learning, participation, and wellbeing of autistic children and their families in Australia (Trembath et al., 2022), and preliminary screening of the first 100 participants who responded to the community consultation survey (see Chapter 5) by members of the working group ( Emma Hinze and David Trembath ). In applying the coding framework, the coding team had the option of applying an 'other' code to any comment that they felt did not fit with an existing code. This ensured that novel, including contrasting, views could be accounted for in the coding process. Adopting a coding framework meant that the GDG could code responses in a consistent manner across the umbrella review, and community -consultation activities (i.e., online survey and focus groups), thereby ensuring that views and experiences could be compared and contrasted during the process of formulating Recommendations and making judgements within the evidence -to-decision framework. The code book, that contains the complete framework, al ong with instructions to coders (addressed below) is provided in Appendix 4.3. Coding process (all research activities) Two members of the Working Group ( Emma Hinze, Rachelle Wicks) Frewer , Libby Groves ), completed the coding of evidence collected as part of the Guideline update. The team comprised people with a combination of relevant professional experience and, for two members, lived experience of autism. Most members of the coding team had prior experience coding the National guideline for supporting the learning, participation, and wellbeing of autistic children and their families in Australia (Trembath et al., 2022). The following processes were used to support the coding team to complete the coding: David Trembath (Co -chair) and Emma Hinze (GDG) worked together, supported by the GDG, to establish the processes that would be used to code the data and 37 support the coding team in their work. The code book was created along with all administrative processes required to securely and reliably manage the data and coding processes. Research assistants ( Briohny Dempsey , Veronica Frewer , Libby Groves ) were invited to participate in the project via email, which briefly outlined the Guideline project and their proposed contributions. A variation to Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee to support each person's involv ement was granted. David Trembath and Emma Hinze m et with the coding team to: o Provide an overview of the project. o Review the processes that would be used in data management and coding. o Review the codes relevant to each person's role in the coding. o Answer any questions arising. Each member of the codi ng team was then given access to the code book and relevant data. Emma Hinze was responsible for coordinating data management and fielding queries on a daily basis, with David Trembath available to support Emma Hinze at all times. All members of the coding team had previously received training in NVivo which was used to support the coding process. The instructions that were to be followed are presented in Appendix 4.3, but in brief included: o Reviewing the code book o Within NVivo, reviewing evidence (either from SRs or community consultation) and coding according to the framework o Completing memos in which the coding team was asked to reflect on any patterns they were seeing in the data (e.g., prominent themes); differences, contrasts, and/or contradictions in the responses; any challenges they were experiencing in assigning codes; suggestions for possible new or revised codes; reasons for why they may have coded a specific way or anything else that they, at that time, f elt was important. These memos (reflections) were used to help create an audit trail, to inform the coding process and interpretation of the data, and to support the coding team in their work. During coding, the coding team met on a weekly basis to discuss the coding process, as well as to discuss their experience of completing the coding. This meeting was open to all members of the GDG involved in data gathering and coding. The rationale for this meeting was two -fold. First, the meetings provided an addit ional opportunity to ensure fidelity within the coding process (i.e., in addition to standardised training, standardised coding, and on -call support at all times). Second, the meetings provided an opportunity for team members to share and debrief about their experiences. It became apparent, from the first day of data gathering and coding, that the personal insights and experiences shared by members of the autistic 38 and autism communities in the community consultation activities were often very confronting in terms of the challenging circumstances people had found themselves in, were experiencing currently, or foresaw themselves and their loved ones experiencing in the future. The focus of the debrief was to share individual feelings, support each other, and i dentify if any further support was required. Doing so ensured each team member was supported, and in doing so ensured the process was carried out with fidelity. Coding process and credibility (umbrella review) One reviewer ( Rachelle Wicks) read the Abstra ct and Results section of each SR, and coded evidence relevant to the Guideline questions using the coding framework described above. All sections of the coding framework could be applied. A quote matrix was created using a list of quotes exported from NV ivo to Microsoft Excel. To check the reliability and credibility of the data extraction, the second reviewer ( Libby Groves ) read the Abstract and Results section of each SR, and identified and coded any relevant text that was not picked up by the first re viewer ( Rachelle Wicks). These quotes were then exported to Excel and reviewed by the first reviewer. The percentage agreement (number of quotes with agreement/total number of quotes \u00d7 100) for this coding was 100%. The second reviewer also checked that each quote extracted by the first reviewer in the quote matrix related to the allocated Guideline question. Again, agreement for this coding was 100%. Applying codes in the development of evidence summaries for Recommendations and Good Practice Points (all activities) . The following process was developed, and implemented by members of the GDG , Libby Groves) to ensure that qualitative data gathered during the research activities could (a) be considered in a systematic manner when supporting and formulating Recommendations and Good Practice Points and (b) used to populate the evidence summaries for each Recomm endation in a consistent manner. Implementation of the process with fidelity was supported by (a) documenting the process, (b) producing a video to explain the process that was used to support implementation (including worked examples), and (c) daily inter action with Microsoft Teams to support implementation. Each person involved in this process was assigned a section of the guideline and provided with associated evidence drawn from the research activities. Figure 4.1 presents the decisions each panel member made when reviewing the evidence for their assigned section, in relation to each code, and determining if/how it would inform revisions to existing Recommendations, the formulation of new Recommendations , and the development of Good Practice Points. Thos e involved in the development of evidence summaries also reviewed any evidence c oded as 'other', to ensure that information that did not fit within the coding framework was considered collectively (when viewed alongside the complete set of data) to ensure that novel Recommendations and Good Practice Points could emerge. Following application of the process outlined in Figure 4.1 draft Recommendations and Good Practice Points were then reviewed by the GDG. 39 Figure 4.1 Applying codes in the development of evidence summaries for Recommendations and Good Practice Points. 40 Study Quality Assessment Risk of Bias was independently assessed by two reviewers ( Libby Groves and Rachelle Wicks) using an adapted version of the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses (CACSRRS ; Appendix 4.4) created by the Joanna Briggs Institute (2020). The form comprises 11 items related to the quality of: (a) the review question, (b) the inclusion criteria, (c) the search strategy, (d) the sources and resources, (e) the criteria for appraising the studies, (f) agreement between raters on extraction and quality appraisal, (g) the methods used to combine studies, (h) the likelihood of publication bias, (i) recomm endations for policy and/or practice, and (j) directives for new research. Any disagreements were discussed and resolved via consensus, without input from a third reviewer. The percentage of agreement [agreements/(disagreements + agreements) \u00d7 100] for quality assessment was 81.3%. The original CACSRRS was developed to assess SRs pertaining to supports/interventions. The review questions for these SRs could, thus, be answered using a Population - Intervention -Comparison -Outcome (PICO) format. However, the research questions being addre ssed in this Umbrella Review, and thus the eligibility criteria adopted, mean that PICO was not relevant to the majority of the included SRs. Therefore, the reviewers instead determine if the review presents one or more aims/questions that specify the popu lation, concept, context (PCC approach; Peters et al., 2020). For example, an SR focussing on experiences should detail (a) the types of participants sought for inclusion, (b) the specific experience(s) examined by the SR, and (c) the settings in which the y were assessed and/or diagnosed, if relevant. Each item was rated dichotomously, with \"yes\" indicating a low risk of bias for that item, and \"no\" indicating a high risk of bias for that item. The item regarding the likelihood of publication bias was rate d for meta -analyses only and was rated 'not applicable' for all other SRs. SRs were not excluded based on methodological quality. A summary rating of 'high' was awarded for systematic reviews that meet 80% of items using the CACSRRS. Systematic reviews th at meet fewer than 80% of items using the CACSRRS were rated as low. 41 4.6 Results Study selection The PRIMSA flow diagram in Figure 4.2 represents the study selection process ( Page et al., 2021 ). The database search yielded 2,698 records across databases and 866 records once duplicates were automatically removed. One -hundred -and -thirty two articles proceeded to full-text review and 105 articles were excluded at this stage (see Appendix 4.5). The most common reason for exclusion was the article was not relevant to either the research question or to guiding clinicians' practice . During extraction, 6 additional articles were excluded because they did not contain quality assessments and, theref ore, were not deemed to be systematic. This resulted in the inclusion of 1 5 SRs from the database searches . Citation searches identified seven additional potentially relevant records, of which six were excluded (see Appendix 4. 6). This result ed in the inclusion of a total of 16 SRs in the umbrella review (See Appendix 4.7). 42 Figure 4.2 PRISMA flow diagram National Guideline for supporting autistic children and their families Administration and Technical Report 43 Study characteristics Of the 16 SRs included in the umbrella review, three (19%) were meta -analyses with narrative synthesis, and 13 (81%) were narrative syntheses. The majority of SRs (n = 13; 73%) were published in 2021 and 202 2, with the remainder (n = 3, 19%) published in 2018 or 201 9. The number of studies included in SRs ranged from 6 (Dorlack et al. , 2018 ; Guan et al. , 2022) to 56 (van't Hof et a l., 2020), with a median of 20. Each SR specified the final year of the search, and 13 (73%) SRs mentioned the presence or absence (i.e., since database inception) of a starting year limit. Of these, 10 (77%) placed a limit on date, whereas 3 ( 23%) included all prior published research. The authors of 12 SRs (75 %) provided information regarding sources of funding to conduct the SR and sources of funding were declared for seven of these ( 44%). The authors of 10 SRs reported that they had no conflicts of interest, while the remaining authors did not report on this. A detailed outline of study characteristics is provided in Appendix 4.8. Focus of reviews Eight SRs (50%) had a sole focus and the remaining eight SRs (50%) focussed on two areas related to assessment and diagnosis for autism . As such, the sum of the below exceeds 16. Five SRs (31%) examined recommendations to guide practitioners in assessing and diagnosing autism (Recommendation -focussed). Nine SRs (56%) focussed on clinical tools and processes that contribute to timely diagnosis for autism (Process- focussed) . Four SRs (25%) examined considerations regarding personal and environmental factors in assessment and diagnosis for autism (Factor -focussed ). Finally, six SRs (38%) focused on the views and experiences of the autistic and autism communities (Experience -focussed). Study designs Ten SRs (63%) specified the design of at least one of the included studies. There was considerable variation in the designs of the studies included in the SRs. Four SRs (40%) included studies that used qualitative approaches only (e.g., thematic analysis, grounded theory, phenomenological analysis), four SRs (40%) includ ed studies that used quantitative approaches only (e.g., analyses of longitudinal cohort data, randomised controlled trials, pre-post study designs) , and two SRs (20%) included studies that used either qualitative or quantitative approaches . Participants All SRs provided some detail about the participants in the original studies. Eight SRs (50%) included studies involving children , adolescents, and /or adults with an autism diagnosis or at high likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis. Eight SRs (50%) included studies involving parents and/or family members of individuals with an autism diagnosis, such as mothers, fathers, grandparents, and aunts. Seven SRs (44%) included p ractitio ners involved in assessment , diagnosis, and/ or provision of support for autism. There was wide variation in practitioner roles, which included paediatricians, psychologists, educators, speech language pathologists, and nurses. One SR (6%) included general 'community members'. 44 Some SRs are included in the above frequencies multiple times due to including studies involving individuals from more than one of the above categories. Only six SRs (38%) stated the total number of included participa nts which ranged from 342 (Legg & Tickle, 2019) to 120,540 individuals ( included in the narrative synthesis; Loubersac et al., 2021). Study location Thirteen SRs (81%) provided information about the geographical locations at which the original studies had been conducted. Twelve SRs (92%) included studies conducted in North America or Europe. This was followed by six SRs (46%) which included studies conducted in Australia , and five (38%) which included studies conducted in Asia. Three SRs (23%) included studies conducted in Africa or the Pacific. Finally, only one SR included studies conducted in South America/the Caribbean (8%). Note that some SRs are included numerous times in the above frequencies due to including studies from multiple geograp hical locations. Quality of SRs The quality of SRs, assessed using a modified version of the CACSRRS (Joanna Briggs Institute, 2020), yielded scores of 5 to 7 out of 11 for the three included meta -analyses, and 2 to 10 out of 10 (mode = 8) for the 13 narrative syntheses. Seven SRs (44%) were considered \"high quality\" because they met 80% of the items, and the remaining nine SRs (56%) were considered \"low quality\". The only SR to score maximum points was conducted by Legg et al. (2019). A full summary of item scores and totals for each SR is provided in Appendix 4.9. Common areas of strength (criterion met for 80% of SRs) were in the inclusion of a clear statement of the review question (Item 1) , appropriate inclusion criteria ( Item 2), the us e of independent reviewers to assess critical appraisal (Item 6), appropriate methods for combining study findings (Item 8) , and suggestions for future research (Item 11). Common areas of weakness (criterion met for < 80% of SRs) related to the absence of a clear search strategy (Item 3), appropriate sources including grey literature (Item 4), lack of an appropriate critical appraisal tool (Item 5), adoption of methods to minimise extraction errors (Item 7), and well-supported recommendations for policy/practice (Item 10) . Of the three SRs (65%) that included a meta -analysis, only one included an assessment of potential publication bias (Item 9). The quality of studies included within SRs was assessed by the original review authors using a variety of tools (see Appendix 4.8). The most common of these were Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme, 2019 ) tool for qualitative studies which was used in five studies (31%) . The Scientific Merit Rating Scale (National Autism Center, 2015 ), and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( Whiting et al., 2011 ) were each used in two SRs (13%) , while the remaining tools were only used in one SR . Eleven SRs ( 69%) were identified as including at least one study at high risk of bias, three (19%) as including at least one study with moderate risk of bias, and two (13%) as only including studies at low risk of bias. 45 Evidence from Systematic Reviews related to Guiding Clinicians' Practice The quantitative summ ary of the quote matrix is included in Appendix 4.10. Thirteen SRs included at least one quote pertaining to Principles. The number of SRs with quotes related to each principle ranged from one for 'evidence-based' to ten for 'timely and accessible .' No quotes were extracted from any of the SRs for the 'neurodiversity-affirming', or 'respecting Australia's First Nations Peoples' principles. All 16 SRs included at least one quote related to the process of assessment and/or diagnosis. The number of SRs w ith quotes related to each aspect of the process ranged from three for 'decision making' , 'outcomes, 'other', and 'when' to 13 for 'knowledge and training '. No quotes were extracted from any of the SRs for the Quality and Safety domain . Full list s of the evidence quotes for the Principles and the Process of Assessment and/or Diagnosis are included in Appendices 4.11 and 4.12 respectively. 46 5. Community Consultation: Online Survey 5.1 Background Integral to the update of the G uideline was consultation with the autistic and autism communities. Consistent with the recommendations in the Guidelines for Guidelines handbook ( NHMRC, 2016) , community consultation w as conducted to ensure that all relevant stakeholders within Australia were provided with the opportunity to inform the update of the Guideline. This was key to enhancing the relevance and acceptability of the updated Guideline to the autistic and autism communities. The consultation process was also conducted to (a) complement other research evidence, and ( b) gather information and insight from relevant stakeholders where research evidence is currently lacking. This consultation activity adopted a n online survey methodology . This approach was used to enable broad participation and input from all relevant stakeholder s, including children , young people and adults , who identified as members of the autistic and/or autism communities. 5.2 Aim The aim of the online survey was to understand the experiences , views , and preferences of the autistic and autism communities regarding assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia . 5.3 Research questions What are the experiences, views , and preferences of the autist ic and autism communities regarding the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia? What are the autistic and autism communities' views on best practice for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia ? What are the autistic and autism communities' views on the current version of the Guideline? Is there anything that should be changed or addressed in the updated version? 5.4 Design An online survey methodology was adopted . This was a one -off survey, accessed via a link on the Autism CRC website and hosted on Griffith University REDCap . Participants had flexibility and autonomy in choosing what questions they would like to answer. They were able to complete the survey independently or with support. The survey included speech -to- text and text-to -speech functionality as well as the option to submit a n artwork instead of text responses. 47 The survey was open to individuals of any age for 4 weeks, from 7th November to 5th December 2022. 5.5 Method Ethical approval for this community consultation activity was provided by Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee (202 2/780). Eligibility All relevant stakeholders across the autistic and autism communities were eligible to participate in the online survey, including Autistic people of any age (with or without a formal diagnosis) Parents, caregivers, and family members of individuals on the autism spectrum Practitio ners involved in assessment and/or diagnosis of autism Members of o rganisations/bodies/groups that have an interest in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism Any other relevant stakeholders (e.g., informal support people, researchers, educators) Recruit ment Participant recruitment for community consultation activities was predomin antly facilitated by Autism CRC . Autism CRC initially advertis ed the community survey by emailing members on their mailing list (n= 25,432 recipients) and posting information on their social media channels (Twitter, Facebook) . The Guideline Development Group also shared the invitation to participate in the community consultation activities with (a) organisations who had provided feedback (during the public consultation period) on the National Practice Guideline for supporting autistic children and their families (n=39) , and (b) organisations that support or represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (n=10). Over the 4 -week community consultation period, Autism CRC sent two reminders of the community consultation activities via email to people on their mailing list. In addition, Reference Group members were kindly requested to advertise the community consultat ion activities through their organisations/mem bers. Members of the GDG also promoted the community consultation activities throughout their professional networks and social media pages . After accessing the online survey link , prospective participants were presented with a short video outlining what participation in the survey would entail and highlighting accessibility features of the survey platform. Following this, participants were presented with a Participant Information Statement and Consent Form. All participants were required to provide informed consent before accessing the survey questions . For individuals who were under the age of 18, or could not provide informed consent independently, a parent or 48 guardian was asked to provide consent on their behalf and assist them (as necessary) to complete the survey. Tools The development of the draft online survey was informed by: (i) the structure and content of the online community consultation activities used as part of the development of the National Practice Guideline for supporting autistic children and their families in Australia (Trembath, 2022 ), (ii) the content of the Delphi survey used as part of the development of the 'National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders' (Whitehouse et al., 2018 a,b), and ( iii) the set of questions developed by the Guideline Development Group guiding the update to the Guideline (see Chapter 2 ). An iterative approach was taken to the design of the online survey. Members of the Working Group (Rhylee Sulek, David Trembath , Kandice Varcin ) led the initial drafting of the survey. All members of the Working Group were invited to provide input on the dr aft survey. The draft version was then sent to the broader GDG for review and feedback. The Working Group members addressed feedback from the GDG and made changes to the survey, as appropriate. The revised version of the survey was coded in REDCap (a secure web-based application for survey development and distribution) and piloted by members of the Working Group for clarity and functionality. Feedback provided through the piloting process led to further minor modifications before the final survey was finalised ahead of distribution . The survey was intended to be able to collect the views, preferences and experiences of as many members as possible of the autistic and autism communities (of all ages) with an interest in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism . In addition to demographic information, the final survey (see Appendix 5.1) included open -ended questions tha t were structured to collect information related to: (i) people's current views and/or experiences of assessment and/or diagnosis in Australia (which could be submitted as text or as piece of art), (ii) important considerations for each aspect of the assessment and/or diagnosis process covered by the Guideline (i.e., guiding principles, referral, assessment of functioning, medical evaluation, diagnostic assessment, safety and wellbeing), and (iii) the original Guideline and the update (e.g., anything that should be changed or addressed, and barriers and enable rs to implementation of the Recommendations ). Participants were provided with multiple pathways to navigate through the survey, including the capacity to skip sections and/or exit the survey at multiple points. In addition to the option to submit views and perspectives on assessment and/or diagnosis as text or artwork, there were other accessibility features enabled in the survey. These included speech -to-text and text-to -speech options throughout the survey, the option to save and return as many times as someone needed , and the option to complete the survey with support or independently . The final survey was estimated to take between 1 0 to 60 minutes to complete depend ing on which questions participants chose to answer. 49 Analysis Coding process and credibility (community consultation activities) Qualitative data gathered via the online survey were analysed using the coding framework outlined in Chapter 4 . The coding team (Briohny Dempsey, V Groves , Emma Hinze, Rachelle Wicks) were each assigned a set of survey questions, and coded all participant responses for their assigned section/s. M ember s of the coding team applied the relevant section of the coding frame work to participant responses (i.e., coding team member assigned the Principles questions applied the codes outlined under the corresponding section of the codebook) . While section three of the online survey (i.e., participant views about the existing guideline) was originally intended to be code d against 'Principles' it became apparent that many pieces of evidence were being coded as 'other'. A decision was made to read each participant response individually to determine whether the evidence supported already identified R ecommendations and Good Practice Points . Where new evidence was emerging, these quotes were used to either (1) support propos als for new Recommendations and Good Practice Points, or (2) support introductory or guiding text featured throughout the Guideline. As indicated in Chapter 4 , multiple approaches were used to help ensure the credibility of the coding process (i.e., akin t o reliability in quantitative research) including employing people with relevant expertise ( i.e., previous coding of the Supporting Children's Guidelines), using a standardised code book and training procedures, ensuring on -call support on a daily basis an d weekly team meetings for fidelity and support purposes, and ultimately presenting evidence using people's own words in preparing the evidence summaries. In addition, a credibility check was completed for every quote identified during the coding process was developed. The credibility check was intended to (a) ensure that quotes were attributed to codes accurately and (b) ultimately provide readers of the Guideline with information to inform their interpretation of the data. The instructions were to: Review the contents (quote/s) one cell (participant) at a time. Ask yourself \"Is this quote relevant to the code that has been applied?\" If the answer is yes, proceed to next step. In some cases, you may find that the quote is ambiguous because you are o nly reviewing part of a participant's more expansive response or due to the participant's expression. It is not intended that each quote will be a complete and cohesive statement in relation to the code, and so provided that in your judgement the quote app ears to be relevant, it can be marked yes . If the answer is no, ask yourself \"Is this quote potentially relevant to addressing one or more other guideline questions? If yes, highlight the quote in yellow. 50 If no, highlight the quote in red, indicating t hat the quote does not appear to fit the current code, and does not appear relevant to addressing one or more guideline questions. This approach resulted in the classification of each quote in each code as either 'relevant to the Guideline and code,' 'relevant to the Guideline, but cannot establish relevance to code,' or 'does not appear to be relevant to the Guideline.' The proportion of responses related to each classification is provided in the Results section for each community consultation study. It is important to note that the person completing the credibility check was reviewing the coded data, not the original transcripts. Accordingly, they did not necessarily have knowledge of the context (e.g., broader statement) from which the quotes had been extracted, which may account for some of the disagreements. 5.6 Results Participant c haracteristics One thousand people accessed the online survey. Of those, 810 participants provided informed consent to participate. Amongst those, five people provided informed consent, however, indicated in response to the final survey question that they would not like their information to be used. As such, the fin al number of pa rticipants who provided consent for their information to be used was 805. Participants brought a range of (and often, multiple) perspectives to the survey including 232 people who identifi ed as autistic /person on the autism spectrum , 325 parents/caregiver s/family members of someone on the autism spectrum, 298 practitioners, 115 members of orga nisations/bodies/groups that have an interest in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism, and 72 people that identified as bringing ' other' perspectives . Demograph ic information for each group (as self -identified by the person completing the survey) is presented in Tables 5.1 - 5.5. Autistic people/people on the autism spectrum Table 5.1 Demographic information for people who identified as autistic /on the autism spectrum in the online survey (n=232).

State/Territory Autistic people resided in the following States/Territories within Australia: Australian Capital Territory: n= 19 (8 %) 3 (1%) participants were not currently residing in Australia (and as such, were unable to progress any further through the survey). 2 (0.9%) participants did not provide a response. Autism diagnosis 172 (74%) people had received a formal diagnosis of autism. 10 (4%) people were currently being assessed for a possible diagnosis of autism. 36 (16%) people self- identified as autistic but had not received a formal diagnosis of autism. 7 (3%) people chose not to share additional information about their diagnosis. 7 (3%) people did not provide a response. Age at autism Of those who had received a formal diagnosis, 169 (98%) people reported their diagnosis age at diagnosis, with the average age 35.98 years (SD = 14.8), and ages ranging from 2 years to 78 years. 3 (2%) participants who had received a formal diagnosis did not provide a response. Level of support - diagnosis Of people with a formal diagnosis, the following level s of support were reported by participants to participate in everyday activities at the time of their diagnosis : 52 66 (38%) people reported Level 1 (required some support). 66 (38%) people reported Level 2 (required substantial support) . 3 (2%) people reported Level 3 (required very substantial support) . 23 (13%) were unsure. 10 (6 %) preferred not to say. 3 (2%) participants did not provide a response. For people that specified a level of support (as Level 1, 2 or 3): 28 (21%) selected that level as they felt it was most appropriate at the time they were diagnosed 105 (7 8%) selected that level as it was the level assigned by the practitioner at the time of diagnosis 2 (1%) participants did not provide a response. Level of support - The following levels of support were reported by participants to participate in current everyday activities at the current time: 74 (32%) selected Level 1 as most representative. 69 (30%) selected Level 2 as most representative. 9 (4%) selected Level 3 as most representative. 44 (19%) were unsure. 19 (8%) preferred not to say. 17 (7%) participants did not provide a response. Familiarity with the Of autistic people/people on the autism spectrum completing the online survey: National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism in Australia 106 (46%) had read or used the previously published 'National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia' (2018) 122 (53%) had not read or used the previously published 'National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosi s of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia' (2018) 4 (0.4%) participants did not provide a response. 53 Parents , caregivers or family members of people on the autism spectrum Table 5.2. Demographic information of parents , caregivers or family members of people on the autism spectrum (n=325). Parents , caregivers or family members of people on the autism spectrum Other perspectives Parents , caregivers or family members of people on the autism spectrum brought the following additional perspectives: Autistic person /person on the autism spectrum: n= 93 Practitioner: n=61 Member of an organisation/body/group that has an interest in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism: n= 31 Other: n=27 Relationship Family members of people on the autism spectrum self-identified as : Parents/caregivers : n=277 Kinship carers/foster carers: n=2 Children of autistic : Spouses : n=12 Grandparents : n=8 Aunts/uncles : n=7 Siblings : n=15 Other /non-specific relation (e.g., support person, family member ): n=3 19 (6%) participants did not provide a response. Age of people Parents , caregivers or family members of people on the autism spectrum , completing the completing the survey, were in the following age brackets: survey 18-25 years (young adult) : n=12 (4%) 26 years or older (adult) : n=256 (79%) 4 participants (1%) did not provide a response. *It appeared that there was an error in reporting on this question in some age brackets . 36 (11%) people indicated that they were 0 -12 years of age and 17 (5%) indicated that they were 13 -17 years of age . However, upon closer inspection of the data, it appeared that these respondents had provided the age of their child (rather than their own age). Age of family 28 family members indicated that their family member/s on the autism spectrum members on the contributed to the responses in the survey. The family members on the autism autism spectrum spectrum contribu ting responses were the following ages: contributing to 0-12 years (child): n=10 (29%) 18-25 (adult): n=6 (17%) Aboriginal and/or 12 parents , caregivers or family members (4%) identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Torres Strait Strait Islander . 306 parents , caregivers and family members (94%) did not identify as Islander Peoples Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander. 7 (2%) participants did not provide a response. State/Territory Parents , caregivers and family members of autistic children resided in the following States/Territories within Australia: Australian Capital Territory: n= 5 (1.5%) participants were not currently residing in Australia (and as such, were unable to progress any further through the survey). 6 (2%) participant s did not provide a response. Family members on 301 parents, caregivers and family members provided information about 425 family the autism members on the autism spectrum. spectru m 5 (1.5%) parents, caregivers or family members chose not to share additional information about their family member's diagnosis. 19 (6%) parti cipants did not provide a response to these items. Of those that did provide information, family members on the autism spectrum were in the following age brackets: 0-12 years older (adult): n= 72 (17%) 1 (0.2%) participant did not provide a response. Family members autism diagnosis Of th e 425 family members on the autism spectrum , 358 (84%) had received a formal diagnosis of autism. 67 (16%) had not yet received a formal diagnosis. 55 Family members Of the 358 family members on the autism spectrum that had received a formal age at autism diagnosis, the average of diagnosis was 9.25 years (SD = 9.39), with ages ranging diagnosis from 1 year to 73 years. 7 participants did not provide their family member's age at diagnosis.

Readers are reminded that the person completing the credibility check was reviewing the coded data, not the original transcripts. Accordingly, they did not necessarily have knowledge of the context (e.g., broader statement) from which the quotes had been extracted. Artwork submissions As part of the community consultation process, participants were invited to submit an artwork instead of and/or alongside providing written responses to questions presented in the community survey. A total of eight artwork submissions were received, with two excluded from analysis (due to containing only text responses) . The remaining six artworks were analysed according to the coding scheme presented in Appendix 4.3 (i.e., the coding scheme applied across all community consultation activities). Two autistic m embers of the working group jointly viewed and discussed potential coding for each submission until consensus was reached. The results from the artwork submissions analysis are included in Table 5.6. 66 6. Community Consultation: Focus Groups 6.1 Background Integral to the update of the Guideline was consultation with the autistic and autism communities. Consistent with the recommendations in the Guidelines for Guidelines handbook ( NHMRC, 2016) community consultation was conducted to ensure that all relevant stakeholders within Australia were provided with the opportunity to inform the update of the Guideline. This was key to enhancing the relevance and acceptability of the Guideline to the autistic and autism communities. The consultation process was also conducted to ( a) complement the current research evidence, and /or (b) gather information and insight from relevant stakeholders where research evidence is currently lacking. This consultation activit y was conducted to ensure that the experiences, views , and preferences of autistic individuals, their family members, and practitioners involved in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism were captured in the update of the Guideline. 6.2 Aim The aim of the focus groups were to understand the experiences , views , and preferences of (a) autistic people , (b) family members of autistic people, and (c) practitioners regarding assessment and/or diagnosis of autism . 6.3 Research question What are the experiences, views , and preferences of autistic people, family members, and practitioners regarding assessment and/or diagnosis of autism in Australia? 6.4 Design A qualitative methodology approach was adopted, with a series of nine online focus groups run between November 15th to December 2nd, 2022. Three of the focus groups were open to autistic adults, three were open to family members of autistic individuals and three were open to practitioners. 6.5 Method Ethical approval for this community consultation activity was provided by Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee (202 2/780). Eligibility Autistic adults, family members , and practitioners were eligible to participate in the focus groups. To participate, all individuals had to be aged 18 years or over and reside in Australia. 67 Recruitment Participant recruitment for the focus groups was predominantly facilitated by Autism CRC. An invitation to register interest in attending a focus group was distributed to members of Autism CRC mailing lists. In addition, links to access the focus group registration survey were made available via the social media (Facebook and Twitter) accounts of Autism CRC . Members of the GDG also promoted the focus group s throughout their professional networks and social media pages. After following the registration link, prospective participants were presented with a Participant Information Statement and Consent Form and required to indicate consent before providing their details and preferences to attend an online focus group. The registration survey for the first round of focus groups was closed following a two-day recruitment period , due to total registrations exceeding available place s (n=142 registrations for 72 positions) . Registered individuals were allocated to a focus group based on their preferences and in consecutive order of receiving their registration, with 12 individual s allocate d to each of the six groups and five waitlist positions available. A further three focus grou ps were advertised due to overwhelming demand, with recruitment occurring over a five-day period. Individuals who were not allocated to a group in the first round were contacted and provided an opportunity to indicate their preferences to attend one of the additional groups . A random number generator was then used to assign the remaining registered individuals (n=1 04 new registrations , n=5 individuals from round one ) to one of the three additional groups , with 12 individuals allocated to each of the six groups and five waitlist positions available . All registered participants were emailed to indicate their assignment to a focus group, waitlist, or to direct them to the online survey if they were not allocated. A total of n ine focus groups were conducted, three for each participant group. Tools Participants completed a demographic survey (see Appendix 6.1) upon registering (round one) or were sent a link to the demographic survey following assignment to a group (round two). The demographic surveys were coded in REDCap (a secure web-based application for survey development and distribution). Focus Group Question Guide A semi -structured question guide was developed and used across all nine focus groups. The questions developed for the focus groups covered the same three overarching questions posed to participants who completed the online survey: 1. What is, or was, good about the way assessment and/or diagnosis happens in Australia? 2. What is, or was, bad about the way assessment and/or diagnosis happens in Australia? 3. What would like to see change in the way assessment and/or diagnosis happens in Australia? 68 Thinking to the future What principles are important for the assessment and diagnosis process? What can practitioners do to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals and their families? Focus g roup facilitation Each focus group was facilitated, via Microsoft Teams, by two members of the GDG across a three -week period ( 15th November - 2nd December 2022). Each group was facilitated by a co-chair (either David Trembath or Emma Goodall ), while the second facilitator first facilitator was responsible for (a) coordinating the meeting, (b) introducing the Guideline development process and providing an orientation to the Focus Group , (c) facilitating the discussion, and (d) summarising and concluding the meeting. The second facilitator was responsible for facilitating the discussion via the 'chat' comments (an option available to all participants throughout the entirety of the focus group, as an additional or alternate method of contributing) . Participants were invited to have their video function turned on for the focus group, but this was not a requirement. Participants were also invited to share information in the way they preferred (i.e., through verbal discussion or writing responses using the 'Chat' function). Each focus group followed the same schedule : Fifteen minutes prior to the meeting, the two facilitators joined Microsoft Teams to review planning for the focus group. At the scheduled start time, participants were admitted to the meeting . Facilitator 1 present ed the introduction to the Guideline development process and focus group orientation (1 5 minutes) . Facilitator 1 presented the three focus group questions , one at a time (allowing approximately 30 minutes per question ). Facilitator 1 invite d the participants to briefly introduce themselves the first time they shared responses to posed questions. Facilitator 1 present ed a summary of the focus group outcomes, an overview of the next steps, and thanked the participants for their contribution (10 minutes) . A copy of the PowerPoint presentation that was used for all eight focus groups is provided in Appendix 6.2. Analysis Coding process and credibility Focus group transcriptions were auto generated by the Microsoft Teams platform. Transcriptions were deidentified by a research assistant prior to analysis . De-identified transcriptions files were uploaded to NVivo software for analysis. 'Chat ' comments and any 69 further information provided to the facilitators following focus groups were copied from Microsoft Teams into a Word document and deidentified for ana lysis. Information collected during the focus groups were coded according to the 'Principles' section of the coding framework outlined in detail in Chapter 4. This approach - rather than coding according to each section of the code book (e.g., making a referral, conducting an assessment ) was adopted a priori in the first instance, given that focus groups - by their nature of encouraging discussion - may see part icipants talk in relation to more than one aspect of the Guideline at once (e.g., a person simultaneously talking about the referral process and their experience of diagnosis at the same) . However, to ensure that no specific insights, experiences, or suggestions that may be relevant to formulating Recommendations and Good Practice Points were missed, the GDG also reviewed every transcript ( discussion and chat) generated from the groups in full to ensure that all information was considered in relation to all Guideline questions, Recommendations and Good Practice Points. The processes to ensure credibility of the coding undertaken were identical to those outlined in Chapter 5. 6.6 Results Participant characteristics A total of 246 registrations for 96 focus group positions (i.e., 12 slots across 8 focus groups) were received. Of these, 68 participants attended their allocated focus group . One participant was excluded from all analysis following their participation in a focus group as they did not meet criteria for inclusion (i.e., were not an Australian resident) . While many participants held multiple perspectives (e.g., an autistic individual who was also a practitioner , see Figure 6.1 ), 21 (31.3%) participants attended focus group s where the common shared experience was being an autistic adult, 19 (28.4%) participants attended focus groups where the common shared experience was being a parent or caregiver of a child on the autism spectrum, and 27 (40 .3%) participants attended focus groups where the shared experience was being a practitioner who provides assessment and/or diagnostic services to individuals on the autism spectrum . Of the 67 participants who were included in analysis, 66 provided some details about themselves , and their child(ren) where relevant, through the online demographic survey (see Table 6.1). 70 71 Figure 6.1 Unique and shared perspectives of focus group participants.

This was the first national practice guideline in Australia , and has underpinned fundamental changes in the way autism is understood, assessed, and diagnosed in the Australian community. The Guideline, herein referred to as the Assessment and Diagnosis Guideline (ADG) for brevity, was endorsed by the National Heal th and Medical Research Council and a range of relevant professional associations. Autism CRC has also supported the implementation of the ADG through a range of implementation activities, along with the efforts of an Expert Reference Group commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Social Services to inform its impl ementation and evaluation. Given that nearly 5 years has passed since publication, as per NHMRC requirements, it is important that the ADG be updated. This process will occur in a manner consistent with the NHMRC Standards for Guideline Development. In June 2022, Autism CRC made a call for applications for investment to support the update of the ADG. A group of five organisations - Griffith University, Telethon Kids Institute, Autism New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington, and University of Queensland - were successful in an application to undertake this work, which will occur between 01/09/22 and 30/06/23. The process for updating the ADG will be led by a Guideline Development Group (GDG ). The GDG will bring together members with diverse lived and professional expertise relevant to the Guideline, in keeping with NHMRC Guidelines for Guidelin es Process. The GDG will be responsible for overseeing the update of the GDG. The role of a GDG member includes providing input into planning, advice in relation to Guideline activities, feedback on summarised information gathered through research and community consultation activities, and feedback on draft documents. Additional roles, where relevant, may be negotiated with the co - Chairs based on members' interests, experience, and expertise. Each member of the GDG will be responsible for abiding by the Terms of Reference, attending monthly meetings, reviewing documents, and providing endorsement or otherwise of the final documents. The specific r ole, responsibilities, and accessibility will be considered in an individualised way for each GDG member. Purpose Autism CRC has asked A/Prof David Trembath and Dr Emma Goodall to form a GDG that will be responsible for leading the update of the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia. The GDG will exist for the duration of the project . Anticipated timeline for the project The project commenced on 01/09/22 and will be completed on 30/06/ 23.

Update of the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism in Australia Appendix 2.3 Reference Group - Terms of Reference Update: National Guideline for Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia Terms of Reference for the Reference Group Date distributed: 1 9/10/22 Background In 2018, Autism CRC published the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia. This was the first national practice guideline in Australia , and has underpinned fundamental changes in the way autism is understood, assessed, and diagnosed in the Australian community. The Guideline was endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council and a range of relevant professional associations. Autism CRC has also supported the implementation of the Guideline through a range of implementation activities, along with the efforts of an Expert Reference Group commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Social Services to inform its impl ementation and evaluation. Given that nearly 5 years has passed since publication, as per NHMRC requirements, it is important that the Guideline be updated. This process will occur in a manner consistent with the NHMRC Standards for Guideline Development. In June 2022, Autism CRC made a call for applications for investment to support the update of the ADG. A group of five organisations - Griffith University, Telethon Kids Institute, Autism New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington, and University of Queensland - w as successful in an application to undertake this work, which will occur between 01/09/22 and 30/06/23. The update of the Guideline will be led by a Guideline Development Group (G DG), which will bring together members with diverse lived and professional expertise relevant to the Guideline, in keeping with NHMRC Guidelines for Guidelines Process. A Reference Group, made up of representatives of key stakeholder organisations from th e autistic and autism communities, will also support the update of the Guideline. The Reference Group will provide key stakeholder organisations with a direct way to engage in the update process, including (a) sharing the organisations' views, (b) ensuring the organisations' members are aware of opportunities to participate in community consultation activities, and (c) providing feedback (as organisations and/or feedback from individual members) on the draft updated Guideline when it is ready for Public Con sultation. The Reference Group will provide advice and support in relation to these matters, but will not have any direct input into the revision process (e.g., revising specific Recommendations). Purpose Autism CRC has asked Dr Emma Goodall and A/Prof Da vid Trembath to form a GDG that will be responsible for leading the update of the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia. The GDG will exist for the duration of the project . Anticipated timeline for the project The project commenced on 01/09/22 and will be completed on 30/06/ 23. The initial phase of the project involves establishing the Guideline Development Group and Reference Group. The involvement of organisations (and their representatives) in the Reference Group will commence on the date of signing and returning (via email) this Terms of Reference and conclude on 30/06/23. Membership of the Reference Group Stakeholder organisations represented in the Reference Group will be determined by the co -chairs of the project ( Dr Emma Goodall and A/Prof David Trembath), informed by the 'Guideline for Guidelines' recommendations provided by the National health and Medical Research Council. Stakeholders will be asked to nominate one indi vidual to represent their organisation on the Reference. A proxy may attend a meeting if the nominated individual is unable to attend. The Chair must be informed of the substitution at least one working day prior to the scheduled nominated meeting. Appoin tment of Meeting Chair Dr Emma Goodall and/or A/Prof David Trembath will Chair the Reference Group meetings. Responsibilities of the Reference Group Members The responsibilities of the members are as follows: Complete a written Declaration of Interest form at the commencement of involvement, and update the Co -Chairs of any changes during the term of the Reference Group. Share the views of the organisations and members they represent, on issues that are relevant to the update of the Guideline.

Before starting coding for the day, please review the ' Coding Questions & Comments' Tab in Teams to see if there have been any updates 2. Find the file you have been allocated in Teams . Your file will be located in your own Teams folder located in the 'Data Files NVIVO ' folder. Your files will be dated, so please take note to select the most recent file (This should be the file available) 3. Save the file in a folder on your computer that is safe and can be easily fou nd and deleted when coding is complete. 4. Open NVIVO - (If you have not already setup your NVIVO settings, please ensure the settings are set to remind you to save the file at least every 15 minutes and add a two letter initials for identifying purposes. For example, David would add DT in the initial sections.) 5. Check which questions you are required to code (see colour coding below, the u pload notification will confirm the questions requiring coding) and have a printed copy of the code book beside you for your reference. 6. Review the codes and definitions to clarify your understanding. 7. You might find coding one column (i.e., participants' responses to a question) at a time to be easier, as each column will have a specific set of codes to consider within the coding framework. Therefore, double check you are coding each response to the correct codes assigned. 8. In situations where the participant's response appears relevant to the question they were asked, but does not clearly meet the definition of one or more codes , then code as 'other.' 9. Please write a journal/reflection on the process, during each coding session. This should be done in NVIVO memo feature. Plea se reflect on any patterns you are seeing in the data (e.g., prominent themes); differences, contrasts , and/or contradictions in the responses; any challenges you experienced in assigning codes; suggestions for possible new or revised codes; reasons for why you may have coded a specific way or anything else that you, at that time, felt was important. Th ese memos not only provide you with a great way to document the process and a source for recalling what you did and why , but are also a key aspect of the methodology and thus important to analysing and interpreting the data. 10. Once you have finished coding all responses in your file, save the file and upload into your Teams Data Files NVIVO Return folder. There is no need to change the file name. 11. Please notify Emma, in the Teams channel ' Data Management ' or in chat when you have completed and uploaded your assigned response. Likewise, this channel also notifies when a new data file for coding ready for each coder. 12. IMPORTANT - Please DO NOT change any of the comments and responses. Only assign codes, as any changes to the text will impact file merging. If you have any questions with coding, please ask via the ''Coding Questions & Comments' Tab in Teams in the first instance, as this will provide us with a central and consistent way of documenting and responding to these questions. You can share a chat message via the Teams chat or contact Emma/David directly if you want to alert them to the new question/comment. Please do not hesitate to any questions or share comment s as this is an important part of the process.

Table 4. Codes and definitions. Code Definition Principles Individual and Family Centred: Assessments should be individual and family -centred, with their unique reasons for seeking assessment, preferences, and circumstances respected, valued , and supported. Strengths -focused: Assessments and the sharing of findings should focus on the individual's strengths including personality traits, interests, functional skills, and supports that are personally meaningful to them and promote their learning, participation, and wellbeing. Holistic: Assessments should seek to understand all aspects of the individual, their family, and context, their life history and future aspirations, to the extent that is relevant to the purpose of the assessment and that they are comfortable to share. Comprehensive: Assessments should involve the gathering of all relevant information from all relevant people. Appropriate: Information should be gathered and shared in ways that are valid, accurate, respectful, and relevant for the individual, their f amily, and the context. Helpful: Assessments should answer the questions individuals and families have, provide a pathway to supports where relevant, and involve sharing findings in ways that are relevant to the people and for the purpose intended. Ethical: Assessments should be conducted in ways that are ethical, to protect the rights of individuals and their families. Evidence Based: Assessment and diagnosis practices should reflect the best available evidence from research, evidence from clinic al practice and lived experience, and the preferences and priorities of the individual and their family. Culturally safe: Practitioners should acknowledge and respect the values, knowledge, preferences and cultural perspectives of the individual and their family; adopt culturally safe practices; and reflect on their own cultural knowledge and competency in their practice. Neurodiversity - affirming: Assessment and diagnosis should be neurodiversity -affirming, embracing each person's uni que understanding of other people and the world around them. Respecting Australia's First Nations Peoples: [To be developed - for the SCG we had Supports should be culturally safe for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, built on an acknowledg ment of the barriers to accessing supports that they may experience, an understanding of current and Codebook for ADG Update 2022 -2023 8 of 8 historical truths and their enduring impact; and respect for deep connection to Country, language, customs, and traditions.] Competent: Practitioners involved in assessment and diagnosis should have qualifications, knowledge, skills, experience, supervision, and professional regulation that is relevant to assessment and differential diagnosis of autism. Timely and Accessible: Every pers on should be able to access assessment and diagnostic services in a timely accessible manner, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how much money they have. Coordinated: Practitioners should contribute to a coordinated approach to assessment and diagnosis, that increases access and reduces burden for individuals and their families.

Client and family - centred Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents' relationships with professionals were negatively affected by a perceived lack of acknowledgement of their concerns. Parents described feeling unheard with dismissal of their concerns, resulting in distress, anger, humiliation, and frustra tion (Frye, 2016; Ryan & Salisbury, 2012). At times, parents reported that the concerns they raised were deferred at more than one visit, resulting in a delay in the eventual diagnosis. Marginalisation, silencing of their concerns, and lack of support we re reported, as well as health professionals not acknowledging the importance of parents' concerns (Bultas & Pohlman, 2014). Parents report hesitation by health professionals with parents feeling that their concerns were not being taken seriously, result ing in losing valuable time for early intervention. The process of negotiating knowledge was considered to be a continued struggle to advocate for their child's needs (Carlsson et al, 2016). Legg & Tickle, (2019) Parents mostly reported positive interactions with assessing clinicians but remained aware, and in some respects cautious, of clinicians' power. Parents seeking support have a need to be taken seriously by professionals when raising concerns about their children. This point offers professionals the first opportunity to build a positive relationship with parents. Good communication from professionals towards both parents and children promoted good relationships between parents and professionals. Such rela tionships are likely to have been containing for parents who have concerns about their children and promote positive engagement in the assessment process. Parents are likely to be more satisfied when assessments include more time building relationships be tween the professional and the child and when information is provided to the parents, including through observation of assessments. Fathers may have additional or alternative support needs to mothers following diagnosis. It is possible this in part arises from their sense of being excluded earlier in the process and that more inclusive relationships with professionals could promote later emotional adjustment. Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Parents also expressed frustration, knowing their daughter was developing atypically, yet not receiving validation from medical professionals about their concerns. Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) Parents report feeling discomfort in sharing concerns with healthcare providers and community members, fearing that their c hildren will be judged or shunned and that their parenting skills will be questioned. 2. Strengths -focused Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents also described that the methods by which health professionals assessed their child were compromised. Assessments were typically conducted in environments unfamiliar to the child, which impacted on the opportunity to observe the child's full potential (Carlsson, Miniscalco, Kadescjo, & Laakso, 2016). Parents experienced the use of overt medical language and an over -empha sis on negative outcomes when communicating with professionals. Brown et al. (2021) This was further compounded by a lack of accessible information about ASD supports available and the insensitive way some healthcare professionals disclosed the diagnosis, with an overemphasis on the negative aspects of the condition (Burrell et al., 2017; Potter, 2017). Legg & Tickle (2019) Delivery of diagnosis was criticised for being too brief with a lack of sensitivity and a focus on negative aspects. 3. Holistic Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents recognised that the characteristics of autism contributed to the issues they faced in obtaining an appropriate diagnosis and suppor t. Parents stated: \"Because he looks like a normal child, people don't see the autism and don't understand\" (Midence, 1999, p. 280) and \"It was a battle getting anyone to understand our problems and believe that she was something other than naughty.\" (Tiss ot, 2011, p. 7). Parents described this process as trying to make the invisible characteristics of their child visible (Hoogsteen, 2013). Howes et al. (2021) It was noted by some professionals that there was a lack of family support available, although, some services offered \"whole family support needs\" but this was not consistent across all the services discussed within Crane et al. (2018, p. 3768) study. Legg & Tickle (2019) Some fathers had not felt sufficiently included in the diagnostic process. Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Arguably, this could be framed as females diagnosed with ASD needing additional behavioural problems to improve their chances of receiving a diagnosis. It would seem that social difficulties became more pronounced in girls over time, or that compensatory mechanisms such as camouflaging are less successful, against the higher social demands of teenagers. The study also included the parent -completed Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), on which current communi cation skills were reported to be significantly better for ASD boys than girls. This again indicates greater problems for diagnosed girls and the possibility of girls needing more ASD traits than boys to gain an ASD diagnosis. Salomone et al. (2016) foun d that for verbally able individuals (i.e. those with phrase speech) in a population -based sample, girls had a significantly higher age of diagnosis than boys. This gender difference was not seen for non -verbal or minimally verbal children. These results i ndicate that verbally able girls may be waiting longer for a diagnosis, thereby supporting Dworzynski et al.'s (2012) suggestion that additional language (or other) difficulties are often necessary for girls to receive an ASD diagnosis in contrast to boys. Studies indicated that males show more RRBIs than females (Duvekot et al. 2017; Tillmann et al. 2018), and that RRBIs are more predictive of an ASD diagnosis in males compared to females. The number of stereotyped behaviours in boys significantly decreased between five and 10 years of age, whereas it remained at a consistent level across th ese ages in girls with ASD. Tillmann et al. (2018) found that girls with an ASD diagnosis exhibited fewer RRBIs than boys, however non -verbal intellectual functioning accounted for and attenuated these differences. Boys who had an additional diagnosis were diagnosed significantly later than boys who did not. When observing social interactions from a distance, girls with ASD behaved like neurotypical girls, i.e.' spending a significant amount of time talking and weaving in and out of groups; yet, it wa s only upon closer inspection of the quality of interaction with peers that social challenges were perceived. By contrast, it was easier to identify social challenges in boys with ASD at a distance. The authors argued that using camouflaging techniques to mask social difficulties makes girls with ASD more vulnerable and less likely than boys to be identified within a school setting. Girls with an additional diagnosis were diagnosed later than girls who did not have an additional diagnosis. It has also bee n suggested that cognitive impairment increases the likelihood of having a documented ASD diagnosis for boys, but not for girls. Girls with an IQ of 70 or less were less likely than boys with an IQ of 70 or less to have a documented ASD diagnosis. This may suggest that once a cognitive impairment had been identified in a female, it is less likely that an ASD assessment will take place. Another paper using in -depth interviews, this time with parents, adolescent autistic daughters, and siblings, suggested t hat ASD females are less likely to be identified until the social demands they experience exceed their compensatory strategies. Mothers interviewed in one further paper, by Cridland et al. (2014), reported negative consequences from their daughters imitat ing social behaviours during assessment, and clinicians therefore being unable to identify their autistic behaviours. Parental reports of RRBI symptoms were significantly less predictive of an ASD diagnosis for females than for males, indicating that eve n with high scores in this domain, there was less of a link to diagnosis for females. Boys were more likely than girls to have a diagnosis of ASD even when both sexes had documented ASD symptoms in educational and clinical records. They concluded that this may result from an 'interpreting bias', where the observed experiences differ from the expected behaviours dependent on sex bias. They highlighted that clinicians evaluating girls, compared to boys, with a complex developmental profile may be more likely to exclude a classification of ASD if other conditions are present, due to this bias. 4. Helpful Boshoff et al. (2019) Our findings highlight the intense emotional journey for parents during identification of their initial concerns and the formal process of diagnosis, and their perceptions of not being supported by others on this journey. Marginalisation, silencing of th eir concerns, and lack of support were reported, as well as health professionals not acknowledging the importance of parents' concerns. Some parents described the formal process of diagnosis as a struggle, initiating a pattern of persistent behaviour by pa rents and a sense of distrust with medical professionals. Although parents described feeling empowered at the end point of this process, they also described feeling alone. Despite obtaining the knowledge they needed, they still needed to process the acco mpanying emotions and resulting decisions. Brown et al. (2021) Some fathers described healthcare professionals not discussing the diagnosis and prognosis with them, with a need to provide information in language they could understand (Manor -Binyamini, 20 19). Howes et al. (2021) Multidisciplinary teams were thought to support parents' experience of the diagnostic process, as they allowed parents \"time to talk\" and gave clarity about the diagnostic process. The professionals from Rogers et al. (2016) wanted to offer long -term sup port to people with autism, but acknowledged that this is not possible for many services and that in -service support was also lacking for people who had received a diagnosis. Legg & Tickle (2019) Professionals were represented as withholding information and scrutinising parents and child as well as providing help, guidance and support. Parents admired the professionals' expertise and were grateful for the service received. Diagnostic process was hard to understand, and parents did not understand roles of professionals. Parents were unaware of potential support available following diagnosis. Frequent criticisms were lack of support during and after assessment. Parents wanted a quicker, easier process with more coherent structure and content. Parents suggested information leaflets provided at the time of diagnosis could be valuable. Parents suggested they would like more information about the range of intervention and educational programmes available and local support groups. Delivery of diagnosis was criticised for being too brief with a lack of sensitivity and a focus on negative aspects. Lack of adequate information and support at the time and following diagnosis was highlighted. Some parents reported feeling abandoned by se rvices after the diagnosis was given, leading to disappointment and frustration: Following my son's diagnosis, I received a leaflet and that is all. Any help and support I have subsequently received, I have sought out and paid for myself ... (Potter, 2017, p . 101) Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) Parents with limited English -proficiency are more likely to endorse distrust in the HCP as a barrier to service use (Zuckerman et al., 2017); to report receiving conflicting information that is not explained clearly ( Stahmer et al., 2019); and to describe feeling discriminated against by professionals for not speaking English (Burke et al., 2019). 5. Evidence -based Ellison et al. (2021) All of the assessment studies included in this review demonstrate the feasibility of using telehealth to accurately assess not only for diagnostic purposes, but to also conduct other forms of assessments with children with ASD. 6. Culturally safe Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents from a Latino background described the specific issues they faced as a result of communication difficulties (Blanche et al., 2015). In their experience, service providers did not emphasise the need for a diagnosis and access to services, which they perceived may have been due to language barriers. Pare nts from different cultural backgrounds reported communication (Luong et al., 2009) and interaction difficulties (Jegatheesan et al., 2010), perceived to significantly impact on the relationship between parents and provider Brown et al. (2021) An awarene ss of ASD from a cultural perspective is required, with the need for further research reflecting the range of experiences and essential cultural perspective. Howes et al. (2021) Language or cultural differences were reported to increase the difculty of diagnosing, such as needing a translator if there was a language barrier. Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) Latinx and Black American parents are often met with providers who suggest a ''wait and see'' approach and normalize their behavioral con cerns; Spanish -speaking and Black American caregivers often understand this to be a reaction to their race or culture and feel invalidated. Racial and ethnic disparities are exacerbated by a lack of culturally competent healthcare. 7. Respecting Australi a's First Nations Peoples. Nil Nil 8. Neurodiversity affirming Nil Nil 9. Competent Boshoff et al. (2019) \"When I first presented with my children, I had to tell them what to do and that was the frightening part...could not tell me what to do with them...We lost tremendous amount of time.\" Brown et al. (2021) It was reported that some health professionals lacked detailed knowledge about ASD and the implications arising from the condition, thereby provoking emotions including denial, confusion, sha me and disbelief in some fathers. Fathers also detailed how they struggled with the limited knowledge about and implications of an ASD diagnosis and prognosis by some healthcare professionals (Manor -Binyamini, 2019; Potter, 2017). Clark & Fung (2022) The results reported by these studies suggest that by completing specialized training programs related to autism, physicians were more knowledgeable on topics related to the condition, more confident in their ability to provide care to autistic individuals , and more likely to screen their patients for autism spectrum disorder. Studies measuring self -efficacy found significant improvements in the outcome measure following the completion of a specialized autism training program. For example, one study found that physicians became more comfortable with identifying the symptoms of ASD, making appropriate diagnoses and referrals, and providing care to autistic children. Another study found that levels of self -efficacy remained increased six months following t he completion of a training program (van 't Hof et al., 2021), suggesting that these educational programs are able to have a lasting impact on physicians' confidence in their ability to provide care to autistic individuals. Howes et al. (2021) A perceive d lack of knowledge of how a person with autism presents was suggested to cause a delay in autistic traits being noticed. A lack of facts on ASD meant that some professionals felt they could not convey clear messages to parents about the diagnosis. Penne r et al. (2017) described that professionals experienced diagnosis of both very young children and older children to be more challenging, and that girls were felt to be more difcult to diagnose, due to the differences in their presentation. Legg & Tickle, (2019) Highlighted need for early diagnosis and better recognition of developmental problems by health professionals. Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Reports of healthcare professionals being reluctant to diagnose a female as autistic and a lack of awareness of ASD in females due to a perceived higher incidence of ASD in males. Mademtzi et al. (2018) reported a parent feeling the need to exaggerate their daughter's impairments to gain a diagnosis; 'I felt that I needed to make my daughter look more impaired than she actually was, in order to get diagnosis and needed services'. 10. Timely and Accessible Boshoff et al. (2019) Positive relationships with professionals were reported by parents who experienced a timely diagnosis. The need to take act ion was reported as more challenging for parents from socioeconomic disadvantage or with cultural backgrounds different to that of the professionals (Luong et al., 2009), as well as for those living in rural areas (Divan et al., 2012). For rural families, complications included access to services, limited local expertise in autism, needing to attend multiple consultations, and not receiving satisfactory answers (Divan et al., 2012). Parents described the time of waiting as very difficul t as they were overwhelmed with worry and concern for their child. \"...It just seems to take an awfully long time to diagnose and its valuable time early on. A lot of time is wasted\" Guan et al. (2022) Two studies evaluated the change in wait time before and after implementing the training program. These 2 studies compared the wait time to see an ASD specialist versus the wait time to seeing a trained PCP. Another study evaluated the change in time to diagnosis by measuring the number of days from recei pt of the parent- completed intake package to the date the final diagnostic International Classification of Diseases code was entered. All 3 studies reported the wait time to see a trained PCP was approximately 50% the length of the wait time to see the t raditional assessment team. Howes et al. (2021) Some professionals discussed how the appointment time slots were not \"adequate to assess an autistic spectrum,\" which was a recurrent perspective in professionals who diagnosed other conditions in their practice. Additionally, t he time taken to diagnose was further scrutinized under the context of services lacking the capacity to meet the demand, such that people are referred into services but then wait a long time to be assessed and receive a diagnosis. The time taken to be see n by other professionals, for participants who did not make the diagnosis alone, was discussed as a barrier and professionals stated that this impacted their ability to diagnose early. When faced with long referral times, some professionals chose to diagn ose themselves, rather than refer to a specialist (Penner et al., 2017). They explained that getting support for people with autism as quickly as possible was a key priority. Legg & Tickle (2019) While some parents were satisfied with timing of referral or assessment, others found the process overly long and this had an emotional impact on them. Time delays in assessment likely contributed to ongoing concerns and confusion and further added to parents' emotional difficulties. Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Families experienced difficulty obtaining early diagnosis and problems having to justify requests for services. Strict diagnostic criteria also led to delayed diagnosis for females, with one parent saying their daughter was declined diagnosis because 'sh e's two points above the cutoff score'. Loubersac et al. (2021) The diagnosis of ASD was, on average, earlier in areas with a higher median income. A significant 15 -month age difference at diagnosis was reported by Thomas et al. [33] between children w ho live in a zone with a high median income (> $90,000) and those living in a zone with a lower median income (< $30,000). Those children living in a high median income area also received more assessments, which may have contributed to their earlier diagno sis. African American children were diagnosed approximately 1.4 years later than Caucasian children, with the difference being identical after adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status. Living in an \"urbanized\" area to be associated with a lower age at diagnosis of ASD. Children residing in rural or semi -urban areas w ere mostly diagnosed later, after the age of seven years (85%). Sainsbury et al. (2022) Hatakenaka et al. (2016) found that the ASD + ADHD group waited 5 months longer than the ASD only group for a diagnosis of ASD after the first visit, and the ADHD only group waited 8 months longer than the ASD group for a diagnosis (no statistical analysis performed ). Stevens et al. (2016) found that the ASD + ADHD group waited 1.3 years longer than the ASD only group for a diagnosis after first seeking medical assistance. Valentine et al. (2021) Investigated referrals before and after the introduction of a teleh ealth service. They found that implementing a diagnostic consultation service for ASD, in partnership with an early intervention service, increased referrals for diagnostic evaluation and the likelihood of families attending appointments. Families from r ural areas reported geographical and time barriers to accessing traditional healthcare. These barriers were reduced with remote diagnoses, leading to high levels of satisfaction. 11. Coordinated Nil Nil Update of the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism in Australia Appendix 4.12 Umbrella Review Evidence Quotes - Process of Assessment and/or Diagnosis Research question When - Evidence is presented in relation to when should this be considered? Legg & Tickle (2019) Highlighted need for early diagnosis and better recognition of developmental problems by health professionals. Information would support both professionals and parents to recognise differences in language, communication and behaviour as possible indicators of autism as early as possible. Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents described occasions where their concerns were dismissed or ignored by paediatricians, resulting in parents pressuring their pediatricians into referrals and further assessments until they obtained a diagnosis. (Stoner et al., 2005). Parents' persistence was rewarded by obtaining a diagnosis. Howes e t al. (2021) When faced with long referral times, some professionals chose to diagnose themselves, rather than refer to a specialist (Penner et al., 2017). They explained that getting support for people with autism as quickly as possible was a key priority . Some professionals also used a \"wait and see\" approach toward diagnosis, due to the worry that putting a family through the diagnostic process and the outcome not being ASD is \"not a wonderful thing to go through\". Who - Evidence is presented in relation to who should be involved? Valentine et al. (2021) Families could be coached to complete ASD assessment activities with young children via videoconferencing and clinicians could make accurate diagnoses remotely. Ellison et al. (2021) Video conferencing was utilized to coach parents in implementing modified Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2002) -Module 1 activities and presses with their children compared to an in -person autism assessment utilizing thes e same presses. No difference between diagnostic consistency was found between groups; inter -rater agreement was not significantly different on the ADI -R and only one significant difference for an item on the ADOS was found. Further, high parent satisfacti on was reported for both conditions. After radonmized group assignment, remote assessors randomly provided prompts to parents using an adaptation of the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (Stone et al., 2000) via VC or used the TELE -ASD-PEDS to guide parents to lead specific social tasks with their children (Corona et al., 2021). Both of these telehealth administrations were used to establish diagnostic accuracy; across the sample, diagnostic accuracy was 86 -77% of parents reported that they would prefer both to play and observe the child during the remote assessment instead of just playing with the child or just observing (Corona et al., 2021). Remote real -time coaching was effective in having parents administer the functional analys is and was successful with identifying the social function of the behaviors consistently (Wacker et al., 2013). Results were comparable to previous functional analysis studies where theses assessments were conducted in -home with parents but the telehealth administration was a more cost -effective strategy Legg & Tickle (2019) Diagnostic process was hard to understand, and parents did not understand roles of professionals. Some fathers had not felt sufficiently included in the diagnostic process. Fathers felt excluded. Fathers may have additional or alternative support needs to mothers following diagnosis. It is possible this in part arises from their sense of being excluded earlier in the process and that more inclusive relationships with profess ionals could promote later emotional adjustment. Howes et al. (2021) Professionals reported difculties with consistency of diagnostic categorization, and that the different sources of expertise on ASD were difcult to integrate into one uniformed view. The benets of multidisciplinary teams were noted. Multidisciplinary teams helped compensate for the clinical setting of a formal diagnostic assessment, by allowing observations to take place in a variety of environments. Multidisciplinary teams were thought to support parents' experience of the diagnostic process, as they allowed parents \"time to talk\" and gave clarity about the diagnostic process. Parental understanding was understood to impact assessment processes. Part icipants in Finke et al. (2010) acknowledged the importance of listening to parents as their awareness of their child's behaviors could be important in heightening the professional's \"concern\" that a diagnosis should be explored. When faced with long refe rral times, some professionals chose to diagnose themselves, rather than refer to a specialist (Penner et al., 2017). They explained that getting support for people with autism as quickly as possible was a key priority. Professionals in the Finke et al. ( 2010) study indicated a preference of which specialists they would refer to, but a lack of these specialists meant this was not always possible. Guan et al. (2022) A small number of patients were included in studies that reported accuracy (n 5 14 - 38). Di agnostic agreement between the trained providers and the expert teams ranged between 74% and 100%. Notably, each of these studies reported absolute agreement, without adjustment for chance agreement; the rates of ASD diagnosis by the expert teams ranged fr om 41% to 78%. PCPs reported their impression as to whether the child had ASD and stated the specific DSM IV diagnostic subtype. Full agreement between the trained PCP and the expert teams was 92% for the presence/absence of ASD and 87% for specific subty pes. There were no significant differences in respect to parents' perception of shared decision making or family -centered care between the traditional model and the trained PCP model. Settings - Evidence is provided in relation to in what settings should it occur? Valentine et al. (2021) Families could be coached to complete ASD assessment activities with young children via videoconferencing and clinicians could make accurate diagnoses remotely. Juarez et al [21] reported on 2 studies, of which 1 compared a telediagnosis to a face - to-face assessment. This study demonstrated that, compared to gold- standard tools, remote ASD diagnostic consultations resulted in clinicians correctly diagno sing 78.9% (15/19) of children. No children were inaccurately diagnosed with ASD. Following referral, 56 (89%) of the 63 families chose to receive further appointments via telehealth services rather than face -to-face services. These barriers were reduced with remote diagnoses, leading to high levels of satisfaction. Ellison et al. (2021) Findings, although still emerging, encouragingly suggested that services via telehealth were equivalent or better to services face -to-face. Results support the benefits to using telehealth with individuals with ASD. Video conferencing was utilized to coach parents in implementing modified Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2002) -Module 1 activities and presses with their children compared to an in-person autism assessment utilizing these same presses. No difference between diagnostic consistency was found between groups; inter -rater agreement was not significantly different on the ADI -R and only one significant difference for an item on the ADOS was found. Further, high parent satisfaction was reported for both conditions. After radonmized group assignment, remote assessors randomly provided prompts to parents using an adaptation of the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (S tone et al., 2000) via VC or used the TELE -ASD-PEDS to guide parents to lead specific social tasks with their children (Corona et al., 2021). Both of these telehealth administrations were used to establish diagnostic accuracy; across the sample, diagnostic accuracy was 86 -77% of parents reported that they would prefer both to play and observe the child during the remote assessment instead of just playing with the child or just observing (Corona et al., 2021). Based on these two studies, it does appear that well-established diagnostic measures of ASD (i.e., ADOS and ADI -R), as well as other measures of ASD symptomology, can be used via telehealth successfully as accurate alternatives for identifying children with ASD rather than solely relying on in -person a ssessments. Remote real -time coaching was effective in having parents administer the functional analysis and was successful with identifying the social function of the behaviors consistently (Wacker et al., 2013). Results were comparable to previous funct ional analysis studies where theses assessments were conducted in -home with parents but the telehealth administration was a more cost -effective strategy. All of the assessment studies included in this review demonstrate the feasibility of using telehealth to accurately assess not only for diagnostic purposes, but to also conduct other forms of assessments with children with ASD. Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents also described that the methods by which health professionals assessed their child were compromised. Assessments were typically conducted in environments unfamiliar to the child, which impacted on the opportunity to observe the child's full potenti al (Carlsson, Miniscalco, Kadescjo, & Laakso, 2016). Other parents also reported that they did not feel that the communication style used with their child was optimal. One parent said \"Maybe they are good at it, but I don't always agree with what they say, that's what it feels like ... I see him in so many other situations than they do, so it doesn't feel like the way they describe him always applies.\" (Carlsson et al., 2016, p. 333). Meimei & Zenghui (2022) Reese et al.'s study found that there was still e xcellent diagnostic agreement between clinicians and other teams in the video conferencing setting. Real -time videoconferencing achieved the same results (sensitivity = 0.84, accuracy = 0.88) as the psychometric properties of in -person assessments (sensiti vity = 0.88, accuracy = 0.78), consistent with a previous review Ju\u00e1rez et al. studied the preliminary feasibility, accuracy, and clinical utility of diagnosing ASD via televideo conferencing. This study showed that telemedicine procedures were as capable as in -person assessments at identifying children diagnosed with ASD. Although the TELE -ASD-PEDS is not designed for screening and diagnosing ASD, preliminary data suggest that it is a useful and valid ASD diagnostic tool. The benets of multidisciplinary teams were noted. Multidisciplinary teams helped compensate for the clinical setting of a formal diagnostic assessment, by allowing observations to take place in a variety of environments. Guan et al. (2022) Two of the 6 studies include d self -reported changes in provider practice and perceptions.21,23 The first found that the providers' comfort level for discussing ASD diagnosis increased. They also noted a large, statistically significant shift in reports of practice behavior, with 68% of providers reporting that they were more likely to conduct ASD assessments within their practice at the end of the training program. Knowledge and training - Evidence presented in relation to what knowledge, skills, training, and support are required? Dorlack et al. (2018) For Module 1, pooled sensitivity was similar for the ADOS -G algorithm (Pooled Random Estimate -0.90), the ADOS -2 algorithm with words (0.90, 95% CI 0.87 -0.93), and the ADOS -2 having some words (0.88, 95% CI 0.82 -0.94, Table 2). Pooled specificity estimates for the Module 1 algorithms of the ADOS -G, ADOS- 2 used with children having no words, and ADOS -2 used with children having some words were 0.71 (95% CI 0.70- 0.88), respectively. Paired comparisons found that specificity of the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children having some words increased by 7% (0.07, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.25), while specificity o f the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children having no words decreased by 8% ( 0.08, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.21), although neither of these measures were statistically significant. Sensitivity measures remained similar across the ADOS -G and ADOS -2 algorithms, with observed changes < 3%. For Module 2, pooled sensitivity was 0.72 for the ADOS -2 algorithm administered to children < 5 years old, and 0.89 (95% CI 0.67 -0.92) for the ADOS -2 algorithm ad ministered to children older than or equal to 5 years of age. Pooled specificity estimates for these three administrations were 0.90 (95% CI 0.83 CI 0.66- 0.88), respectively. Paired comparison analyses found that sensitivity for the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children < 5 years old remained unchanged from ADOS -G (0.01, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.26). Sensitivity of the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children 5 years and older was increased by 9% from the ADOS -G (0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.21), although it was not statistically significant. Specificity measures were reduced by 8% for the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children < 5 years old ( 0.08, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.05) and by 10% for the ADOS -2 algorithm used with children 5 year s of age and older ( 0.10, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.07). However, none of these differences were statistically significant. For Module 3, pooled sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66 -0.84) for ADOS -2 algorithm . Pooled specificity estimates for the Module 3 ADOS -G and ADOS -2 (95% CI 0.57- 0.87), respectively. Paired comparison analyses found that sensitivity of the ADOS -2 algorithm was significantly improved by 8 % (0.08, 95% CI 0.03- 0.13) from ADOS -G. Specificity -2 algorithm was decreased by 7% ( 0.07, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.12) from ADOSG, although it was not significant. Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) They report that HCPs lack cultural knowledge and implicitly criticize or question child -rearing practices and competence (Burkett et al., 2015). Clinicians (a) are less likely to recognize the signs and symptoms of ASD in Latinx children (Zuckerman et al., 2013). The most widely used ASD assessment tools are normed on predominantly White samples, and administration guidelines have little guidance regarding cultural considerations (Harris et al., 2014). Loubersac et al. (2021) The results suggest that the diagnosis of ASD occurs earlier i f there is a delay in social communication or the presence of intellectual disability. Two studies found a significant association between more severe impairment in social communication, as measured by the ADI -R [50, 72], and an earlier diagnosis of ASD, whereas two other studies found no significant association. A significant association was not found between the AoD and higher scores in the area of social interaction disruption measured by the ADOS. One study [40] found that children with a higher score in the RRB domain of the ADI -R were diagnosed earlier, whereas another study found opposite result [50] with a higher score in the RRB domain of the ADI -R associated with a later AoD. One study [42] found no significant association using the same to ol. Furthermore, the RRB score measured with the ADOS did not appear to be significantly related to the AoD [50, 58]. An association between delayed intellectual development and an earlier diagnosis of ASD was found in seven [36, 40, 49, 55, 66, 74, 75] o f the ten studies [28, 36, 38, 40, 49, 55, 58, 66, 74, 75] that analyzed this factor. Children with ASD and comorbid ADHD were diagnosed more than one year after those without comorbid ADHD. Lower language level (measured by PLS -4) was significantly asso ciated with earlier diagnosis. Children who only started using sentences after 33 months of age were diagnosed approximately three years before those without a language delay. Darcy -Mahoney et al. (2016) [39] found a significant association between the A oD and the mother's marital status, with children of mothers who were married being diagnosed earlier (mean AoD = 53 months) than those who are divorced (mean AoD = 63 months). Valicenti -McDermott et al. (2012) [34] found no link between AoD and bilingual ism in the home. African American children were diagnosed approximately1.4 years later than Caucasian children, with the difference being identical after adjusting for gender and socioeconomic status. Bickel et al. (2015) [37], who studied the associatio n between the AoD and having a sibling with ASD, found that the presence of sibling with ASD is a significant predictor of earlier AoD. Living in an \"urbanized\" area to be associated with a lower age at diagnosis of ASD. Lebersfeld et al. (2021) ADOS -2 performance was stronger than the ADI -R. ADOS -2 sensitivity and specificity ranged from .89 -.92 and .81- .85, respectively. ADOS -2 accuracy in research compared with clinical settings was mixed. ADI -R sensitivity and specificity were .75 and .82, respectively, with higher specificity in research samples (Research = .85, Clinical = .72). Estimates of overall Se (.89 -.92) and Sp (.81- .85) of the ADOS -2 as well as individual estimates for identified articles. When all articles were incl uded, the DOR was higher for research compared with clinical samples; however, inclusion of the setting covariate was not significant (p =.071). Exclusion of the outlier had little effect on Se of the clinical sample but increased the Sp of the clinical sa mple from .80 to .90, which is higher than specificities reported in research samples (.81 and .83; Table 4). Interpretation of the SROC plot (Fig. 3) for all three setting types (clinical, research, and both) when all articles were included in the analys is and the Gotham et al. (2007, 2008) ASD vs. NS accuracy estimates were used (Approach 1) suggests research samples have higher levels of accuracy compared with clinical samples and combined clinical and research samples. When the outlier (Sp =.44) was re moved from the analysis (Fig. 4), and the ASD vs. NS accuracy estimates were used (Approach 3), visual inspection of the SROC curve suggests there was not a difference between accuracy of the ADOS -2 in research and clinical settings, and accuracy of the AD OS-2 for studies including both research and clinical evaluations was lower than either research or clinical settings individually. The ADI -R pooled Se was .75, Sp was .82, and individual articles ranged widely (Se =.33 -1.00, Sp =.61 -1.00. Clinical and research samples had comparable Se (clinical = .71, research = .73) but articles utilizing both research and clinical samples had higher Se (.82). Sp was higher for research samples (.85) compared to clinical samples (.72) and those including both research and clinical evaluations in the study (Se =.85 -1.00; Sp =.44- 1.00) are presented in Table 4 and Fig. 5. These estimates were generally comparable to published algorithms (Table 5). Clark & Fung (2022) The results reported by these studies s uggest that by completing specialized training programs related to autism, physicians were more knowledgeable on topics related to the condition, more confident in their ability to provide care to autistic individuals, and more likely to screen their patie nts for autism spectrum disorder. Despite the variations in training duration and frequency, all of the studies that utilized the ECHO training model reported some level of positive outcomes (Bellesheim et al., 2020; Giachetto et al., 2019; Mazurek, Stobbe, et al., 2020); however, not all of the studies showed the same level of success. Two of the three ECHO studies that measured knowledge and self -efficacy reported significant changes to both outcome m easures (Giachetto et al., 2019; Mazurek, Parker, et al., 2020), but another was only able to significantly increase self -efficacy and had no impact on knowledge. Of the 17 included studies, 10 (59%) measured physician knowledge, eight (47%) measured phys ician self -efficacy, and 11 (65%) measured some aspect of physician behavior, mostly related to ASD screening. Most studies reported improvements in one or more of these outcome measures, and these improvements were seen across all participant groups regar dless of their training level. Medical students saw improvements in symptom identification and diagnostic accuracy following an online -only training program. One study utilized the Autism Spectrum Disorder Knowledge Questionnaire -Physician Edition (AKQ -P) to show that an educational program led to an initial increase in both general autism knowledge and physician -specific autism knowledge. While physician -specific autism knowledge remained increased at six months post- training, general autism knowledge did not (van 't Hof et al., 2021). Another study measured both the objective and self -assessed knowledge of residents and found that both had been significantl y increased after they participated in a case - based training program. Studies measuring self -efficacy found significant improvements in the outcome measure following the completion of a specialized autism training program (Table 1). For example, one study found that physicians became more comfortable with identifying the symptoms of ASD, making appropriate diagnoses and referrals, and providing care to autistic children. Another study found that levels of self -efficacy remained increased six months follow ing the completion of a training program (van 't Hof et al., 2021), suggesting that these educational programs are able to have a lasting impact on physicians' confidence in their ability to provide care to autistic individuals. Boshoff et al. (2019) A prominent parental experience amongst studies was reports of experiencing problems with first line health professionals in the early identification of children with ASD and access to services. Parents reported being presented with a variety of uns atisfactory explanations as alternatives to autism (Altiere & von Kluge, 2009). Meimei & Zenghui (2022) Reese et al.'s study found that there was still excellent diagnostic agreement between clinicians and other teams in the video conferencing setting. Real -time videoconferencing achieved the same results (sensitivity = 0.84, accuracy = 0.88) as the psychometric properties of in -person assessments (sensitivity = 0.88, accuracy = 0.78), consistent with a previous review. Ju\u00e1rez et al. studied the preliminary feasibility, accuracy, and clinical utility of diagnosing ASD via televideo conferencing. This study showed that telemedicine procedures were as capable as in -person assessments at identifying children diagnosed with A SD. Although the TELE -ASD-PEDS is not designed for screening and diagnosing ASD, preliminary data suggest that it is a useful and valid ASD diagnostic tool. All diagnostic tools used a comprehensive set of observables. The DSM -5 diagnostic criteria were used by NODA, TeleNP, and the tool proposed by Ju\u00e1rez et al. to diagnose ASD. Although BOSA uses a standardized coding manual developed in -house, the score still corresponds to the DSM- 5 checklist and the ADOS -2 score. Moreover, TeleNP also used the child hood autism rating scale (CARS -2), the NEPSY second edition (NEPSY -II), Delis -Kaplan executive function system (DKEFS), vineland adaptive behavior scales, third edition (VABS -3), and autism diagnostic observation schedule, second edition (ADOS -2). Ju\u00e1rez e t al. used STAT, clinical best estimate (CBE), Mullen scales of early learning (MSEL), VABS -2, and ADOS -2 as other observables. The most commonly used diagnostic tool is the ADOS - 2. Assessment tools such as the TELE -ASD-PEDS and the study by Reese et al. a lso used a full range of observables, both of which used the ADOS -2; Reese et al. also used the Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R) for assessments. Among the studies reporting psychometric information (n = 15), 8 reported sensitivity and specific ity values equal to or greater than 75%. However, it should be noted that sensitivity values below this threshold may not indicate poor psychometric properties as the tool may be reliable for detecting specific subgroups of ASD patients. The study by Dow et al. had a better sensitivity (0.86 -0.96) than that by Reese et al. [37] (0.88), while the application studied by NODA and Ju\u00e1rez et al. [19] presented a sensitivity between 0.79 and 0.85. However, both NODA and Ju\u00e1rez et al. [19] reported specificities greater than 0.94, while the specificity of BOSA fluctuated between 0.70 and 1. van't Hof et al. (2021) Results showed the current mean age at diagnosis to be 60.48 months (range: 30.90 - 234.57 months) and 43.18 months (range: 30.90 -74.70 months) for studies that only included children aged 10 years. Numerous factors that may influence age at diagnosis (e.g. , type of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, additional diagnoses and gender) were reported by 46 studies, often with conflicting or inconclusive results. Multiple studies indicated that autistic disorder is associated with a lower age at diagnosis and A sperger's syndrome with a higher age. Comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, along with ASD, is associated with a higher age at ASD diagnosis. In 17 studies, there was no difference between the age at diagnosis for boys and g irls, whereas five studies reported a higher age at diagnosis for girls. We included 56 studies that reported the mean and/or median age at ASD diagnosis, of which 46 reported an overall ASD mean age at diagnosis between 30.9 and 574.4 months. Of the 56 studies, 24 reported an overall ASD median age at diagnosis (only or combined with mean age at diagnosis score) between 28 and 96 months. Several studies reported the age at ASD diagnosis for distinct ASD subtypes. For instance, the mean age at diagnosis for autistic disorder (eight studies) ranged between 33.8 and 194 months and the median age at diagnosis (nine studies) between 30 and 68.1 months. For Asperger's syndrome, the reported Christensen mean age at diagnosis (seven studies) was between 59.5 an d 316 months and the median age at diagnosis (nine studies) was between 30 and 84 months. For pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified (PDD- NOS), the reported mean age at diagnosis (eight studies) ranged between 34.60 and 211 months and th e median age at diagnosis (five studies) ranged between 61 and 114 months. Four studies reported a median age at diagnosis between 49 and 56 months for PDD - NOS and ASD -other together. One study reported that the median age at diagnosis for autistic disor der and PDD- NOS combined was 34.8 months. For ASD -other (two studies), the mean age was between 43.1 and 50.7 months and a median age at diagnosis was between 33 and 47.0 months. In total, the meta -analysis included 35 papers (reporting on 55 study samples with a total study population of 66,966 individuals with ASD) across 35 countries that led to a mean age at diagnosis between 30.90 and 234.57 months. The meta -analysis shows a mean age at diagnosis of 60.48 months (95% CI: 50.12 - 70.83). Of the 35 studies, nine reported age at diagnosis estimates ranging from 30.90 to 74.70 months in 23 countries (26 study samples with a total study population of 18,134). Mean age at diagnosis of 43.18 months (95% CI: 39.79 -46.57) for children aged 10 years. The exclusion of three studies with the 95% CI bars well outside the range of the main group in the forest plot in Figure 2 (Begeer et al., 2013; Kentrou et al., 2019; Rutherford et al., 2016) lowered the age at diagnosis to 52.48 months (95% CI: 47.47 - 57.49) for instead of 60.48 months (range: 30.90 -234.57 m). Regarding children aged 10 years, the exclusion of one study with the 95% CI bars well outside the range of the main group in the forest plot (Hrdlicka et al., 2016) resulted in a lower age at diagnosis of 41.99 months -74.70 m). a wide variety of factors that could affect the average age at diagnosis of ASD. These factors are: (1) clinical characteristics, (2) sociodemograph ic characteristics, (3) parental concern, (4) interactions of healthcare and education systems, (5) geographic region and associated characteristics, and (6) cohort and period effects. Four studies found that children/adolescents with autistic disorder we re diagnosed the earliest, followed by children with PDD -NOS and children with Asperger's syndrome were diagnosed the latest. The lowest age at diagnosis for children with autistic disorder, followed by children with PDD -NOS/Other ASD and children with As perger's syndrome. Later age at diagnosis for children with Asperger's syndrome than those on the autism spectrum (Crane et al., 2016) and autistic disorder and PDD -NOS. No differences were reported in the adult population. Three studies reported differ ences in age at diagnosis based on ASD severity. Two of these showed that ASD severity is negatively associated with age diagnosis, indicating an earlier diagnosis is made in children with higher severity scores. Moderate ASD is being diagnosed earlier th an mild and severe forms of autism. Children with Asperger's syndrome or Pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified, were referred for diagnostic assessment later than children with Atypical autism. High functioning children (i.e. with Asperger's syndrome) were diagnosed at a later age (Hagberg & Jick, 2017) and children with a high ADOS -2 comparison score tend to be diagnosed earlier than children with a minimal to low score (H\u00f6fer et al., 2019). A diagnosis of attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and major congenital anomaly was associated with a older age at ASD diagnosis. Children with additional diagnoses, especially those with ADHD, dyslexia or dyspraxia, were diagnosed later than ch ildren without these conditions. Children with an ADHD diagnosis were often three (Wei et al., 2018) or four years older (Miodovnik et al., 2015) when they were diagnosed with ASD. Children with more complex diagnoses (with ADHD before ASD diagnosis, and those diagnosed with ADHD at the same time as their ASD or later) were more likely to be diagnosed with ASD after age 6 years compared to children with only ASD. Some children with a later ASD diagnosis were more likely to have co -occurring ADD/ADHD than children without ASD; this was true only in non- Hispanic -white and non-Hispanic black children (NHB), but not in Hispanic -English or other Hispanics. Age at diagnosis was younger for children with ASD and comorbid disorders (epilepsy, auditory deficits, genetic/metabolic disorders) than children not on the autism spectrum. Children who spoke in only single words or echoing were diagnosed earlier than children with better verbal skills. Epilepsy and Cerebral palsy had no effect on the age at diagnosis of ASD. Children with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and ASD were diagnosed at an older age than children with only ASD but not Tourette syndrome. Lower age at diagnosis in children with ID (IQ<70) than in children without ID (IQ>70). Another study found th at an ASD diagnosis in children with IQ<85 was made earlier than in children with IQ>85 (H\u00f6fer et al., 2019). Frenette et al. (2013) found a significant lower mean age at diagnosis in children without ID than with ID, but this disappeared in regression an alyses. Cognitive impairment was associated with a younger age at diagnosis (Montiel -Nava et al., 2017). However, Brett et al. (2016) found that learning/intellectual disability did not affect the age at diagnosis in a regression model controlling for mult iple covariates. There was conflicting evidence from studies on verbal skills and age at diagnosis. One found that age at diagnosis was significantly higher for children who used complex sentences than for both non -verbal- and minimally verbal children. H owever, they found no differences in the age at diagnosis of non -verbal children and minimally verbal children (Salomone et al., 2016). Children who spoke in only single words or echoing were diagnosed earlier than more verbal children, and language delay explained 8% of the variance in age at diagnosis (Brett et al., 2016) Positive association between verbal (and composite) IQ score and age at diagnosis, indicating that children with no language delay were diagnosed significantly later (by 3 years) than children with language delay (Goodwin et al., 2017). Info collected - What Evidence is presented in relation to what Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) The most widely used ASD assessment tools are normed on predominantly White samples, and administration guidelines have little guidance regarding cultural information should be collected? considerations (Harris et al., 2014). Racial and ethnic disparities are exacerbated by a lack of culturally competent healthcare. Bashoff et al. (2019) Due to the invisible nature of autism, professionals often need to take parents' word for reported observations which may not be displayed during consultations (Midence & O'Neill, 1999). Meimei & Zenghui (2022) All diagnostic tools used a comprehensive set of observables. The DSM -5 diagnostic criteria were used by NODA, TeleNP, and the tool proposed by Ju\u00e1rez et al. to diagnose ASD. Although BOSA uses a standardized coding manual developed in - house, the score still corresponds to the DSM -5 checklist and the ADOS -2 score. Moreover, TeleNP also used the childhood autism rating scale (CARS -2), the NEPSY second edition (NEPSY -II), Delis -Kaplan executive function system (DKEFS), vineland adaptive behavior scales, third edition (VABS -3), and autism diagnostic obser vation schedule, second edition (ADOS -2). Ju\u00e1rez et al. used STAT, clinical best estimate (CBE), Mullen scales of early learning (MSEL), VABS -2, and ADOS -2 as other observables. The most commonly used diagnostic tool is the ADOS -2. Assessment tools such as the TELE -ASD-PEDS and the study by Reese et al. also used a full range of observables, both of which used the ADOS -2; Reese et al. also used the Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R) for assessments. Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Girls with ASD used gestures more vividly than boys. Girls with ASD made significantly more mistakes than boys on an emotion recognition test. Watson (2014) found that all participants (n = 13 females with a clinical ASD diagnosis) reported having a co -occurring condition (e.g., ADHD), with 10 out ofthe 13 participants receiving their co -occurring diagnosis prior to ASD. Boys who had an additional diagnosis were diagnosed significantly later than boys who did not. Girls with an additional diagnosis wer e diagnosed later than girls who did not have an additional diagnosis. It has also been suggested that cognitive impairment increases the likelihood of having a documented ASD diagnosis for boys, but not for girls (Giarelli et al. 2010). Girls with an IQ of 70 or less were less likely than boys with an IQ of70 or less to have a documented ASD diagnosis. This may suggest that once a cognitive impairment had been identified in a female, it is less likely that an ASD assessment will take place. Howes et al. (2021) Professionals reported difculties with consistency of diagnostic categorization, and that the different sources of expertise on ASD were difcult to integrate into one uniformed view. Parental understanding was understood to impact assessment processes. Participants in Finke et al. (2010) acknowledged the importance of listening to parents as their awareness of their child's behaviors could be important in heightening the professional's \"concern\" that a diagnosis should be explored. Standard assessments need to be supplemented with a personal approach to decide what works for the child. Info collected - How Evidence is presented in relation to how should information be collected? Valentine et al. (2021) Families could be coached to complete ASD assessment activities with young children via videoconferencing and clinicians could make accurate diagnoses remotely. Juarez et al [21] reported on 2 studies, of which 1 compared a telediagnosis to a face - to-face assessment. This study demonstrated that, compared to gold- standard tools, remote ASD diagnostic consultations resulted in clinicians correctly diagnosing 78.9% (15/19) of children. No children were inaccurately diagnosed with ASD. Stainbrook and colleagues investigated referrals before and after the introduction of a telehealth service. They found that implementing a diagnostic consultation service for ASD, in partnership with an early intervention service, increased referrals for diagnostic evaluation and the likelihood of families attending appointments. Rivera -Figueroa et al. (2022) The most widely used ASD assessment tools are normed on predominantly White samples, and administration guidelines have little guidance regarding cultural considerations (Harris et al., 2014). Ellison et al. (2021) One study (Reese et al., 2013), randomly assigned participants to either the in -person administration group or VC administration group. Both groups were administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (Rutter et al. , 2003). Video conferencing was utilized to coach parents in implementing modified Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2002) -Module 1 activities and presses with their children compared to an in -person autism assessment utilizing these sam e presses. No difference between diagnostic consistency was found between groups; inter -rater agreement was not significantly different on the ADI -R and only one significant difference for an item on the ADOS was found. Further, high parent satisfaction wa s reported for both conditions. After radonmized group assignment, remote assessors randomly provided prompts to parents using an adaptation of the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (Stone et al., 2000) via VC or used the TELE -ASD-PEDS to guide parents to lead specific social tasks with their children (Corona et al., 2021). Both of these telehealth administrations were used to establish diagnostic accuracy; across the sample, diagnostic accuracy was 86 -77% of parents reported that they would prefer both to play and observe the child during the remote assessment instead of just playing with the child or just observing (Corona et al., 2021). Based on these two studies, it does appear that well -established diagnostic measures of ASD (i.e ., ADOS and ADI -R), as well as other measures of ASD symptomology, can be used via telehealth successfully as accurate alternatives for identifying children with ASD rather than solely relying on in -person assessments. Primarily, all of the assessment stu dies included in this review demonstrate the feasibility of using telehealth to accurately assess not only for diagnostic purposes, but to also conduct other forms of assessments with children with ASD. Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents also described that the methods by which health professionals assessed their child were compromised. Assessments were typically conducted in environments unfamiliar to the child, which impacted on the opportunity to observe the child's full potenti al (Carlsson, Miniscalco, Kadescjo, & Laakso, 2016). Other parents also reported that they did not feel that the communication style used with their child was optimal. One parent said \"Maybe they are good at it, but I don't always agree with what they say, that's what it feels like ... I see him in so many other situations than they do, so it doesn't feel like the way they describe him always applies.\" (Carlsson et al., 2016, p. 333). Meimei & Zenghui (2022) Reese et al.'s study found that there was still e xcellent diagnostic agreement between clinicians and other teams in the video conferencing setting. Real -time videoconferencing achieved the same results (sensitivity = 0.84, accuracy = 0.88) as the psychometric properties of in -person assessments (sensiti vity = 0.88, accuracy = 0.78), consistent with a previous review Ju\u00e1rez et al. studied the preliminary feasibility, accuracy, and clinical utility of diagnosing ASD via televideo conferencing. This study showed that telemedicine procedures were as capable as in -person assessments at identifying children diagnosed with ASD. Although the TELE -ASD-PEDS is not designed for screening and diagnosing ASD, preliminary data suggest that it is a useful and valid ASD diagnostic tool. Howes et al. (2021) Tools and professionals judgments and individual differences were acknowledged frequently in Some professionals stated that weaknesses in diagnostic tools and guides meant that tools were often not \"subtle\" enough (Rogers et al., 2016, p. 827) when trying to diagnose someone with an atypical presentation. Standard assessments need to be supplemented with a personal approach to decide what works for the child Decision making : Evidence is presented in relation to how should decisions be made? Lockwood Estrin et al. (2020) Strict diagnostic criteria also led to delayed diagnosis for females, with one parent saying their daughter was declined diagnosis because 'she's two points above the cutoff score'. Howes et al. (2021) Tools and professionals judgments and ind ividual differences were acknowledged frequently in professionals felt that mediation between the outcome of the diagnostic tools and their own professional judgment was necessary. This process was discussed by two professionals in Karim et al. (2014, p. 1 18) as necessary, due to the \"subjective impressions\" that were being \"objectied\" by the diagnostic tools. When faced with long referral times, some professionals chose to diagnose themselves, rather than refer to a specialist (Penner et al., 2017). They explained that getting support for people with autism as quickly as possible was a key priority. Additionally, the professionals perceived parental readiness to receive an ASD diagnosis as closely related to their understanding of ASD. In cas es of diagnostic uncertainty, professionals would put the needs of the child and family rst, such as giving a \"false positive diagnosis\" (Rogers et al., 2016, p. 827), due to diagnosis being a gateway for some services. Within the postdiagnosis topic, th e difculties with support services were acknowledged, along with the satisfaction of both the professionals and families. Diagnosis was described as an entrance ticket to services and it was suggested that professionals may feel coerced to make an ASD dia gnosis due to the link between diagnosis and service support. Guan et al. (2022) PCPs reported their impression as to whether the child had ASD and stated the specific DSM IV diagnostic subtype. Full agreement between the trained PCP and the expert teams was 92% for the presence/absence of ASD and 87% for specific subtypes. There were no significant differences in respect to parents' perception of shared decision making or family -centered care between the traditional model and the trained PCP model. Outcomes : Evidence is presented in relation to what should be the outcomes? Legg & Tickle (2019) Having a diagnosis gave access to support and helped with adjusting future expectations. Parents need to be taken seriously from the first point of se eking help. The relationship with the diagnosing professional makes a real difference to parents and it is important fathers are included in this where they wish to be. Parents also wish to maintain contact with services as they adjust to the diagnosis. It is likely that such relationships could contain parents and help them to manage their emotional reactions, which is likely to benefit both their well -being and that of their child. Howes et al. (2021) Too little parental knowledge was a barrier to givin g a diagnosis because it would mean additional time was needed to explain the diagnosis, while too much knowledge of the challenges a child with autism might face could indicate that the family would not accept a diagnosis if it was given. Professionals f elt that mediation between the outcome of the diagnostic tools and their own professional judgment was necessary. This process was discussed by two professionals in Karim et al. (2014, p. 118) as necessary, due to the \"subjective impressions\" that were bei ng \"objectied\" by the diagnostic tools. The family response was a crucial experience for professionals, with Jacobs et al. (2018) identifying a dual effect where parents who had actively pursued an ASD diagnosis were relieved when they received the diagnosis, but not giving a diagnosis for these parents was seen as bad news. Additionally, some professionals acknowledged that parents viewed the practical use of the diagnostic label, such as an explanation for why their child might behave in a certain way, to be more important than it being an explanation of their child's condition. The professionals in the Finke et al. (2010) study stated that a discussion around the worries of the causes of ASD, such as vaccines, was crucial to informing the family o f a diagnosis. Professionals in Rogers et al. (2016) recognized the need to communicate both the positive and negatives of the ASD diagnosis with both the person with autism and their family. Within the postdiagnosis topic, the difculties with support s ervices were acknowledged, along with the satisfaction of both the professionals and families. Diagnosis was described as an entrance ticket to services, and it was suggested that professionals may feel coerced to make an ASD diagnosis due to the link betw een diagnosis and service support. Guan et al. (2022) A small number of patients were included in studies that reported accuracy (n 5 14 - 38). Diagnostic agreement between the trained providers and the expert teams ranged between 74% and 100%. Notably, ea ch of these studies reported absolute agreement, without adjustment for chance agreement; the rates of ASD diagnosis by the expert teams ranged from 41% to 78%. Info sharing: Evidence is presented in relation to how should information be shared? Legg & Tickle (2019) Feedback session was anxiety provoking and had significant emotional impact. Structured and focussed approach was valued. Diagnostic process was hard to understand, and parents did not understand roles of professionals. Parents were unaware of potential support available following diagnosis. Delivery of diagnosis was criticised for being too brief with a lack of sensitivity and a focus on negative aspects. Lack of adequate information and support at the time and following diagnosis was highlighted. Some expressed disappointment in the way diagnosis was communicated. Parents had mixed views, with some seeing assessments as comprehensive and others expressing disappointment that clinicians did not spend more time or show them recordings of assessments: It did seem really short [session where clinician interacted with son] it didn't ... I mean it was only about fifteen minutes ... and I don't see how you can make a judgement just within half an hour of watching a child, because surely it would take a bit long er. (Griffith et al., 2013, p. 64). Those parents who received it valued information and support from professional services after diagnosis: The child psychologist gave us, you know, she was very good, she gave us, a massive great book actually on, you k now, various exercises that might help developmental wise. (Evans, 2010, p. 68). Good communication from professionals towards both parents and children promoted good relationships between parents and professionals. Such relationships are likely to have been containing for parents who have concerns about their children and promote positive engagement in the assessment process. Parents are likely to be more satisfied when assessments include more time building relationships between the professional a nd the child and when information is provided to the parents, including through observation of assessments. Boshoff et al. (2019) Parents reported being presented with a variety of unsatisfactory explanations as alternatives to autism (Altiere & von Klug e, 2009). Through the process of reaching a diagnosis for their child, parents experienced confusion as a result of professionals often providing various alternative suggestions to a diagnosis of autism (Altiere & von Kluge, 2009). They also described receiving information through a standard brochure rather than individual support. These parents reported that had the health professionals used a warmer and more personal interaction style in their communications, it would have made hearing the f ormal diagnosis much easier (Jegatheesan et al., 2010). Parents from different cultural backgrounds reported communi - cation (Luong et al., 2009) and interaction difficulties (Jegatheesan et al., 2010), perceived to significantly impact on the relationship between parents and providers, leaving parents with a preference to consult with doctors from a similar cultural and linguistic background. \"She said, from there, there is really nothing more that you can do ... Goodbye and good luck', 'What she gave was so rt of nothing ... no hope.\" \"That is how he is, he is going to go down, and you are going to be stuck with this, let's say, vegetable'\" Howes et al. (2021) Within informing of a diagnosis, the families response, and positive and negative aspects of ASD seemed to be important aspects to several of the articles. Difculties with services were identied to be a factor of the postdiagnosis experience for many of the articles. Communicating the diagnosis to the person and their family was described as ti meconsuming and was a barrier to the decision to diagnose, as it meant a \"whole separate visit\" (Penner et al., 2017, p. 601) was needed in addition to the necessary visits during the assessment. Crane et al. (2018) identied that a balance was needed bet ween raising awareness and sensitivity being used to inform parents of a possibility that their child may be displaying autistic traits. For example, one professional in Crane et al. (2018) identied that they sometimes had parents be told their child migh t have autism because they had \"put their hands over their ears when they heard a loud noise\" (Crane et al., 2018, p. 3766) and that in reality there are many reasons for this behavior not just autism. too little parental knowledge was a barrier to giving a diagnosis because it would mean additional time was needed to explain the diagnosis, while too much knowledge of the challenges a child with autism might face could indicate that the family would not accept a diagnosis if it was given. A lack of facts on ASD meant that some professionals felt they could not convey clear messages to parents about the diagnosis. Some professionals felt that communicating the diagnosis to the person and their family was a signicant emotional burden. Multidisciplin ary teams also allowed staff access to other professional opinions and expertise, when faced with uncertain cases. Multidisciplinary teams were thought to support parents' experience of the diagnostic process, as they allowed parents \"time to talk\" and ga ve clarity about the diagnostic process. Parents having some knowledge of ASD was thought to facilitate communication between the professional and the family. When informing the family of an ASD diagnosis, one study found that terminology is crucial, an d some professionals suggested that they used the term \"Asperger's\" as they perceived the information available about Asperger's Syndrome to be less frightening than \"autism\" (Karim et al., 2014, p. 120). A professional in the Finke et al. (2010) study dis cussed that he would attempt to facilitate parents in their internet searching by telling them what they might see on the internet. Professionals depended on parents to disclose a diagnosis to the child, but would tell an adolescent of their diagnosis. The family response was a crucial experience for professionals, with Jacobs et al. (2018) identifying a dual effect where parents who had actively pursued an ASD diagnosis were relieved when they received the diagnosis, but not giving a diagnosis for these parents was seen as bad news. Additionally, some professionals acknowledged that parents viewed the practical use of the diagnostic label, such as an explanation for why their child might behave in a certain way, to be more important than it being an expla nation of their child's condition. The most important implication of informing a diagnosis for the professionals from the Jacobs et al. (2018) study was the function of lifting the blame on parents for their child's behavior. The professionals in the Fin ke et al. (2010) study stated that a discussion around the worries of the causes of ASD, such as vaccines, was crucial to informing the family of a diagnosis. Additionally, the professionals perceived parental readiness to receive an ASD diagnosis as closely related to their understanding of ASD. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, professionals would put the needs of the child and family rst, such as giving a \"false positive diagnosis\" (Rogers et al., 2016, p. 827), due to diagnosis being a gateway for some services. Professionals in Rogers et al. (2016) recognized the need to communicate both the positive and negatives of the ASD diagnosis with both the person with autism and their family. Professionals stated they were o ften unable to offer support, even though they wanted to, and that they were put under \"pressure\" not to offer postdiagnostic support due to the demands that were already on them. Brown et al. (2021) Some fathers described healthcare professionals not discussing the diagnosis and prognosis with them, with a need to provide information in language they could understand (Manor -Binyamini, 2019). Many fathers described feeling ignored by professionals in services, highlighting the view tha t there were more supports provided for mothers than fathers (Potter, 2017). Update of the National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism in Australia Appendix 5.1 Online survey 2 Information Statement for the Research Project: Update of the National Guideline for Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism in Australia: Community Consultation Online Survey (GU ref no: 2022/780) Part 1: Participation Information What is this project about? Autism CRC is leading the update of the National Guideline for Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Australia. The Guideline, developed in 2018, will be undergoing a review and update based on recent research and consultation with members of the autistic and autism communities. The result will be a set of Recommendations and Good Practice Points to guide the practice of practitioners involved in assessment and/or diagnosis of autism in Australia. Why are you being invited to participate? We warmly invite all members of the autistic and autism communities who have an interest in assessment and diagnosis to share your views about the Guideline. Who can participate in the research? We would like to hear from the following people: People on the autism spectrum (this includes children, young people, and people who communicate mainly in ways other than speech and/or writing). Parents, caregivers, and family members of individuals on the autism spectrum. Practitioners involved in assessment and/or diagnosis of autism across the lifespan. Other members of the autism community (e.g., informal support people, service providers, researchers). Where a person is under the age of 18 years, or is unable to provide informed consent, a parent or guardian will need to provide consent and support that person in accessing and/or completing the survey. What will you be asked to do? You will be asked to answer questions about assessment and diagnosis of autism. The questions are designed to help us work out what works well, what does not work well, and what practitioners can do to make it better. You will be asked to write your answers, but there will also be opportunities to upload artwork if preferred. You can choose to give responses for some or all of these. We anticipate it will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending on how many questions you answer. You can return to the survey up to one week after you begin, provided the survey is still open. After one week, if the survey is still open, you would need to commence a new survey if you want to answer more questions. Do I have to participate? You can choose whether or not you participate. If you choose to complete the survey, we will take this as permission to use the information provided in updating the Guideline. If you decide not to participate, this decision will not disadvantage you or impact your relationship with Griffith University or any other institutions affiliated with this research. What happens if I change my mind? If you begin the survey and decide that you would like to withdraw consent, there is a button at the end of the survey you can select to indicate that you no longer want the information you provided to be used in the project. If you change your mind after submitting the survey, your individual responses will still be analysed but rest assured you will not be identified due to the anonymous nature of data collection. What are the benefits of participating? We hope that it will be a positive experience for you, in helping to inform the Guideline. While you will not receive any direct benefits from participating in this research, the benefits of the research more broadly include an increase in knowledge and understanding regarding the most important factors relevant to assessment and diagnosis of autism. Are there any potential risks? We do not believe there are any direct risks associated with participation in this research. However, we understand that for some people thinking and talking about their experiences, can lead to a mixture of emotions, includingsadness.

This email address is monitored each working day by A/Prof David Trembath and members of the project team. How can I receive information about the research results? Regular updates regarding the progress of the Guideline including a summary of the outcomes of this survey, will be provided on the Autism CRC website. Participants will be able to access a copy of the updated Guideline, once published. If you would like to discuss this further with the research team, you can do so via email (ADGupdate@griffith.edu.au). How can I trust this research is safe for me? This research is being conducted by skilled research staff and supported by a Guideline Development Group that includes people with a range of knowledge and experience, including autistic adults and family members of people on the autism spectrum. The team has carefully selected the questions, considered how they are presented in the survey, and has made available different options for you and other people to share your thoughts. Only anonymous, summarised, and combined survey data will be used and reported. Part 2: Ethical Information we must provide you. What will be done with the data? We will use the information you and others provide to help develop a set of draft recommendations for assessment and diagnosis of autism across the lifespan, and then share these with the community for feedback. We may also publish the findings in research journals and in professional (e.g., conferences) and community forums (e.g., seminars, via social media). When we share the data, we will: Present a summary of de-identified information about who participated (e.g., the variety of practitioners, broad geographical areas represented) in the Guideline and related documents. Present the themes that emerge from responses and use direct quotes from participants to help explain what the themes are about, in the Guideline and related documents. Any quotes will be presented de-identified, not using your real name. It is possible that if you read the findings or see them presented at a workshop or seminar that you might recognise your own quotes, but we will never attach real names to these quotes. We will make a copy of the de-identified information (i.e., themes and quotes) available in a public repository for people to review and possibly use in other research. No personally identifying information will be included. How will privacy be protected? The conduct of this research involves the collection, access, storage and/or use of your identified personal information.

Section 1 This section invites you to share views and experiences of assessment and diagnosis (i.e., what is/was good, not good, and what you would change). This section provides an opportunity to share your own experience and views and/or to help another person (e.g., your child or another family member) share their views. Section 2 This section invites you to share your views on specific aspects of the assessment and diagnosis process (i.e., regarding principles that should be followed, referral, assessment of functioning, medical evaluation, diagnostic assessment, quality and safeguarding). This section focuses on what practitioners can do to help improve the process of assessment and diagnosis for individuals and their families. Section 3 Invites you to share your thoughts about the existing Guideline and the update. This section focuses on what you would like to see changed or added to the Guideline, as well as your views on barries and enablers to the implementation of Recommendations in the Guideline.02/28/2023 11:21am projectredcap.org Page 15 SECTION 1: Sharing views and experiences of assessment and diagnosis We would like to start by inviting you to share views and/or experiences regarding assessment and/or diagnosis of autism. If you are a person on the autism spectrum, a family member, or someone else who has a personal experience of going through the process, we invite you to share your personal experience. If you are a practitioner or a member of an organisation that provides services, we invite you to share your observations based on professional experience. Some people may have both personal and professional experience, please share the information you feel is most relevant. If you are assisting someone else to complete the survey (e.g., you are asking your child for their views about assessment and diagnosis) you can also do that here. There is also an opportunity to upload an artwork as a way of sharing experiences and views. When helping someone else to share their views (i.e., your child/family member), we ask you to please: Ensure that they are aware that they know that sharing their experience and views is their choice (i.e., it is voluntary) and that what they share will be provided to us, the research team. If they agree, please ask the following questions in a way that they will understand and be meaningful to them. If you are recording their response, please write down exactly what they say wherever possible. Would you like to share your views and experience? Yes No You can respond to the questions below by recording your responses in the feedback boxes or by producing a piece of art (e.g., a drawing, painting or other artwork) about your views and experiences of the assessment and/or diagnostic process and uploading it below.

No A note from the research team Thank you very much for answering the questions. The information that you and others provide will directly inform the update of the Guideline. The next step for the research team will be to analyse all of the information provided. The Guideline Development Group will then formulate updated Recommendations. If you have not already done so, please register with Autism CRC to receive updates about the guideline. You can do so here https://www.autismcrc.com.au/access/national-guideline/2022-update. Before we finish, we want to take a moment to acknowledge the time it takes to complete surveys like this. While we are not able to send a personal response to each person who completes it, please know that we genuinely value the information you have provided and will be reading every word. We also acknowledge that if you are an autistic person, a parent, or other family member of a child on the autism spectrum, you will have shared in the survey insights from your own life, your experience, and your expertise. It is likely that you will have been asked to do this many times before, and we warmly thank you for being willing to do so again here, to help make the guideline the best it can be. We simply could not do this piece of important work, without your insights. Thank you. We look forward to sharing updates, and the Guideline in due course, via Autism CRC's website.

This is a Guideline for practitioners. This means we want to focus our discussion today on what practitioners can do to help ensure assessment and/or diagnosis is timely, accurate, and supportive. There are many related issues, that are very important, but that are beyond the scope of the Guideline. These include: The cost of assessments, and how they should be funded. The need for more practitioners, including in regional and remote areas. The different roles of State and Federal Government departments and agencies (e.g., health, education, National Disability Insurance Agency) We warmly encourage everyone to focus on the role of practitioners , to make the best use of the time available today.
