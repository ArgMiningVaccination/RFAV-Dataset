These treatments can help prevent hospitalization, reduce risk of severe disease, and save lives. - Most patients who test positive for COVID-19 are eligible for treatment. After you receive a positive test result, talk to a health care provider immediately to see if COVID-19 treatment may be right for you - even if your symptoms are mild. - People who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are especially encouraged to seek treatment. This includes people who are older (65+) and/or have [certain medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html). - Act fast - treatment must be started within days of initially feeling sick. - If you are a patient seeking COVID-19 treatment, please consult a health care provider. If you need to find a health care provider, call 1-877-PA-HEALTH (1-877-724-3258).
