I made special \"immunity\" honey with raw honey, lemon slices, fresh ginger and lots of garlic. Put it in your tea or your oatmeal! I love a clove sliced very thin and placed between two apple slices! Works like a charm. Chop it small enough to swallow it and take it like a tablet with water. A small clove can just be crushed a little, then swallow it down. Your breath is not affected, but the garlic still does its thing. I found the best way to take the garlic is finely chopped in a spoon of apple sauce. You can't taste it at all this way and I never get garlic breath! I put the garlic inside a date. I was once on tour as a sound engineer and was so sick I couldn't walk. I ate a couple cloves of garlic and within minutes was good to go. I crush up 3 cloves and mix with avocado (zinc). It helps mask the taste but gets the garlic right into your system... with the added benefits of avocado! I cut a clove in half and put one half in each cheek. I suck on em for a few minutes then crush the halves between my molars and let the juices drip to the back of my throat. I used to eat a clove or three at the first sign of a cold. Chopped or mashed into a paste (a little salt helps). Let it sit for a few minutes then spread on bread. My method involves cutting up two garlic cloves (finely chopped) leave it 15-20 minutes to let the allicin release, this is a compound found in garlic that is released once it has been chopped or crushed. I then put the chopped garlic into a small glass with vitamin C powder and fill with a little water. The garlic rises to the top of the glass, then drink or down pretending its a shot! Cut the garlic. Let it soak in water for 10 mins and then add hot water, lemon and honey. Good tea. I can attest to the cloves with honey/olive oil working well. I also take it with some pieces of ginger and ground cinnamon as well. The anti-inflammatory properties have a wonderful effect. I make gluten-free toast, buttered and minced fresh garlic on top. The butter helps soften the bite of the garlic. I mix a clove with kale, shallots and dried cranberries (along with a homemade dressing of white vinegar, olive oil and a dash of orange juice). I eat it every time I get a cold or sinus infection and I feel better afterward! Stuffed a clove in large olives. Love them, two per day keeps the doctor away. Double up while traveling. I prefer to chew a clove slowly - keeping it in my cheek and gently chomping until it's all gone. Yes, it's pretty hot but no more unpleasant than a sore throat or nasty chest bug.
