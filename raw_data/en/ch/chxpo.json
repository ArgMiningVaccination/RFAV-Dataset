Using special mindbody techniques we treat the entire mind, body, and soul.", "sitename": "Body and Mind PT", "date": "2016-01-01", "cleaned_text": "WE BELIEVE IN HEALING NATURALLY Our trauma informed practice invokes physical and emotional modalities which connect body and mind to empower our clients' path to vitality. Taking a more holistic view, we facilitate healing for more than an area of pain or a localized injury; we treat the entire mind, body, and soul. Our goal is to help our clients heal without the use of medication, injections, or surgery. I am Sarah Vose. I was driven to study Physical Therapy after a devastating car accident in high school, when I was told I would never walk again without a cane. Not able to accept it, I pushed on and overcame my injury with the help of physical therapy. I returned to skiing and rollerblading with my friends. But years later, I became very ill and nobody could help me. It wasn't until I met a practitioner who provided craniosacral therapy that I realized the shock wave from the impact of the accident had affected more than the fractured bone in my leg. The emotional trauma had affected my entire body in a way I didn't even know was possible. Through craniosacral therapy, I was able to stop the progression of symptoms and finally began to heal. My journey toward healing inspired me to begin Body and Mind Physical Therapy. I want to help you overcome physical trauma and its emotional impact so your body can return to a homeostatic state. I am a healer at heart, a mother of two young children, a wife, and a believer that your body, mind, and soul are connected - and can be healed - as one. Dr. Sarah Vose PT, DPT, MS, CIDN, Cert-MSUC Trauma Sensitive Certified Practitioner Doctor of Physical Therapy Master of Science in Physical Therapy Bachelor of Science in Rehabilitation Science NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY Holistic Physical Therapy Praise from our Patients \"Sarah has helped me (and my wife) work through a variety of over training injuries from training for marathons and triathlons. She has excellent knowledge of both PT and the training regimes I follow and is able to work with me to improve regeneration and limit injuries. I highly recommend Sarah to any \"age groupers\" out there that are looking to treat or prevent injuries.\" BRENDAN W. \"I have been treated at several PT clinics throughout my life and none have been the same as being treated by Sarah. Sarah worked closely with the doctors and gave me the confidence to do the things I did not want to do. Many times, talking and working with Sarah got me through the hardest of situations. It is not a stretch to say that Sarah literally and figuratively saved my life!\" JEFF D. \"I have spent numerous physical therapy sessions with Sarah. She has made such a difference in my life. I am now able to move freely and without pain. I definitely would not be in the \"get up and go\" stage of my life without her expertise, knowledge, and commitment to me as a patient. Anyone who is referred to Sarah can expect, and will receive, such special care. I hold her in deep respect.\" MILLIE H. "}
