Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient.Cyclosporine should be administered with adrenal corticosteroids but not with other immunosuppressive agents. Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development lymphoma may result from immunosuppression.Cyclosporine capsules and cyclosporine solution have decreased bioavailability in comparison to cyclosporine MODIFIED capsules and cyclosporine MODIFIED solution.Cyclosporine and cyclosporine MODIFIED are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision.The absorption of cyclosporine during chronic administration of cyclosporine capsules and oral solution was found to be erratic. It is recommended that patients taking the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution over a period of time be monitored at repeated intervals for cyclosporine blood concentrations and subsequent dose adjustments be made in order to avoid toxicity due to high concentrations and possible organ rejection due to low absorption of cyclosporine. This is of special importance in liver transplants. Numerous assays are being developed to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Comparisons of concentrations in published literature to patient concentrations using current assays must be done with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed .Oral route(Capsule, Liquid Filled;Solution) Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressive therapy for the indicated disease should prescribe cycloSPORINE, modified. Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma may result from immunosuppression. Hypertension and nephrotoxicity can occur at recommended dosages, and the risk increases with increasing dose and duration of cycloSPORINE therapy. Monitor blood levels and renal function to avoid toxicity. CycloSPORINE, modified (Neoral(R) or Gengraf(R)) and cycloSPORINE (Sandimmune(R)) are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision. Psoriasis patients previously treated with PUVA and to a lesser extent, methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, UV-B, coal tar, or radiation therapy, are at an increased risk of developing skin malignancies when taking cycloSPORINE . Classifications: Inhibitor Uses of This Medicine: Cyclosporine is used together with other medicines to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ (eg, kidney, liver, or heart). It belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents. When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Cyclosporine works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ. Cyclosporine is also used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed treatment with methotrexate. This medicine is also used to treat adults with severe plaque psoriasis after other treatments (eg, PUVA, retinoids, methotrexate) failed. Cyclosporine is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as kidney problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. Before Using This Medicine: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered: Allergies\u2014 Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Children\u2014 Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine have not been performed in children receiving organ transplants. However, no pediatric-specific problems have been documented to date. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine in children with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Older adults\u2014 Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cyclosporine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have high blood pressure or age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving cyclosporine.

Precautions While Using This Medicine: It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. You will also need to have your blood pressure measured before starting this medicine and while you are using it. If you notice any change to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor. Do not take Neoral\u00ae if you are receiving treatment for psoriasis, such as PUVA or UVB therapy, methotrexate (Rheumatrex\u00ae), coal tar, or radiation therapy. Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms: blood in the urine, change in the frequency of urination or amount of urine, difficulty breathing, drowsiness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, or swelling of the feet or lower legs, or weakness. These may be symptoms of a serious kidney problem. Do not use supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without first checking with your doctor. Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem. Using this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer or cancer of the lymph system (lymphoma). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk. This medicine may increase your risk of developing infections. Avoid being near people who are sick while you are using this medicine. Wash your hands often. Tell your doctor if you have any kind of infection before you start using this medicine. Tell your doctor if you have ever had an infection that would not go away or an infection that kept coming back. This medicine may increase your risk of developing rare and serious virus infections, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN). The BK virus may affect how your kidneys work and cause a transplanted kidney to fail. Check with your doctor right away if you are having more than one of these symptoms: bloody urine, a decreased frequency or amount of urine, increased thirst, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea, swelling of the face, fingers, or lower legs, trouble breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting, or weight gain. While you are being treated with cyclosporine, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Cyclosporine may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor. In some patients (usually younger patients), tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may appear soon after treatment with cyclosporine is started. Brushing and flossing your teeth, carefully and regularly, and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums. This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and can increase your risk of having skin cancer.
