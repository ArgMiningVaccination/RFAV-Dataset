Read on to learn about its key ingredients and how they transform your skin. [Crystal Clear](https://bybi.com/collections/skincare/products/crystal-clear) is a foaming, non-stripping gel cleanser, specifically formulated for skin that feels normal, congested, unbalanced, oily or prone to the odd breakout. It contains a blend of prebiotics and potent natural ingredients, such as white willow bark and sustainably sourced rock quartz crystal, to balance the skin's microbiome, help regulate sebum production and decongest pores. The result = clear, calm and healthy skin. There's no debate that cleansing is an integral (if not, THE most important) part of one's skincare routine. However, it's easy to overdo it. If your skin feels dry, irritated or stripped of its natural oils, you might just be removing all the good stuff your skin needs to stay protected, healthy and balanced. What makes Crystal Clear unique? It's a blend of potent, intelligent and natural ingredients that optimise skin health. [Crystal Clear](https://bybi.com/collections/skincare/products/crystal-clear) uses the power of prebiotics to balance your skin's microbiome and keeps all the good bacteria your skin needs to remain healthy and clear in check. What is the microbiome? Essentially the microbiome is the skin's first line of defence. It is composed of the microbiota - this is the array of bacteria, fungus and viruses that live on the skin's surface in a delicate balance of neutral, beneficial and harmful microorganisms. The composition of the microbiome is different depending on the environment. The type of microorganisms present are also affected by skin pH, hydration and UV exposure. What happens if it's compromised? The microbiome exists in a delicate balance and if this is compromised, the skin has lost one of its first lines of defence and therefore is more susceptible to infection. The result could be an increase in skin dryness, irritation, redness or flakey skin. What is the difference between a prebiotic and a probiotic? A prebiotic is a nondigestible food ingredient that promotes the growth of the microflora, almost like a fertilser. A probiotic is a living microorganism that may have beneficial properties if applied topically or orally ingested. How can prebiotics be beneficial for the skin? Prebiotics mainly work by helping to restore and rebalance the microbiome after it has been removed or compromised. It may have been damaged through cleansing, a skin problem or external environmental factors. It helps the barrier to restore a lot quicker by providing a \"food\" source for the microorganisms. Studies have shown that topically applied prebiotics can improve skin health by increasing skin hydration and reducing the amount of toxic compounds produced by skin bacteria. Inulin: the prebiotic in Crystal Clear Inulin; a polyfructose derived from chicory root that works as a prebiotic. It helps to rebalance the skin's microflora after cleansing. During the cleansing process, we often remove the skin's first line of defence, the microbiome, weakening our skin barrier which can lead to heightened sensitivity and dryness, as well as leaving our skin vulnerable to external aggressors known to contribute to blemishes and breakouts. Inulin supports the growth of beneficial microbiota, but harmful microbiota cannot metabolise it. Therefore the natural microflora is strengthened and recovers more quickly after cleansing. In addition to inulin? Rock quartz crystal alongside salicylates, derived from white willow bark, aids the regulation of sebum production and helps to unclog and decongest pores. White willow bark is known for its anti-redness and soothing properties, it contains salicylates (a natural source of salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid). Salicylic acid is oil soluble and so is able to penetrate into the pores, and clean out sebum or excess dirt but is gentle enough to do it without causing irritation. Crystal Clear contains over 0.5% salicylic acid - strong enough to pack a punch, but gentle enough for everyday use. Willow bark also has antimicrobial properties helping to keep your skin clean without stripping it. What gives Crystal Clear its natural fragrance? Antimicrobial rosemary water and cypress oil, a concoction that works together to keep skin clear and fresh, whilst also ensuring Crystal Clear smells uplifting and delicious. Got more questions?
