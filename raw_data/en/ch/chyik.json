It can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, restricting their ability to perform daily activities and causing discomfort. At our [East Greenwich RI chiropractic clinic](/), we want to explore the causes, symptoms, and various treatment options for shoulder pain. By understanding the underlying factors contributing to shoulder pain and learning about effective treatment approaches, individuals can make informed decisions to manage and alleviate their shoulder pain effectively. How We Treat Shoulder Pain in East Greenwich RI COMPREHENSIVE CONSULTATION & EXAM Getting to the root cause of any condition always starts with a comprehensive consultation and exam. By understanding the injury's mechanism and the specific features of the condition you're experiencing, we can more easily find and treat the actual cause of the problem. We want to hear about these details and how the injury has affected your overall health and life. Once we know your side of the story and have asked questions about your condition, we perform the necessary orthopedic, neurological, functional, and chiropractic tests to fully understand the condition's presentation. In almost all shoulder injuries, we will take X-rays to see the quality of the spine, structural damage, and any wear and tear, such as arthritis in the shoulder joint. This process allows us to select the best treatment protocols for you to resolve your shoulder pain effectively. DIGITAL X-RAYS In cases of shoulder pain, if warranted by the exam, we will take digital X-rays of the shoulder to more clearly see the shoulder joint. We will assess shoulder alignment and arthritis to determine if these contribute to your shoulder pain. SPECIFIC CHIROPRACTIC CARE Once we have evaluated the shoulder, mobilizing the shoulder will help maintain proper alignment, break up scar tissue, and even reduce swelling and inflammation to restore proper shoulder function. By restoring proper function, we can use a customized exercise program to restore strength and flexibility to the shoulder joint. CUSTOMIZED CAUSES FOR SHOULDER PAIN An exercise plan tailored to your specific condition and needs will help strengthen and stabilize healthy spinal structure and address muscle weakness and imbalance.

Common Causes for Shoulder Pain ROTATOR CUFF INJURY Shoulder pain can arise from various factors, including injuries, overuse, and underlying medical conditions. One of the most common causes is rotator cuff injuries. The rotator cuff consists of a group of muscles and tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. Overuse, repetitive motions, or sudden trauma can lead to inflammation or tears in the rotator cuff, resulting in shoulder pain. SHOULDER IMPINGEMENT Another cause of shoulder pain is shoulder impingement syndrome. This occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff become irritated and inflamed as they pass through the narrow space between the top of the shoulder blade and the upper arm bone. This condition is often associated with repetitive overhead activities or poor posture. ARTHRITIS Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can also contribute to shoulder pain. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that occurs with age, causing the cartilage in the shoulder joint to wear down. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition, leads to chronic joint inflammation, including the shoulder. BURSITIS Additionally, shoulder pain can result from bursitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the small fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion the bones, tendons, and muscles near the joint. Tendonitis, the inflammation of tendons in the shoulder, is another potential cause of pain. Frequently Asked Questions Yes! Chiropractic can restore function to the shoulder and decrease pain. When you function well, you feel well! Chiropractors are trained to diagnose shoulder conditions and are always a great first option before major surgery. Chronic repetitive stress on the shoulder at work or home, as well as arthritis, can cause a shoulder problem to persist. Shoulder pain can be a sign of many things; however, rotator or labrum cuff tears, arthritis, bursitis, and frozen shoulder all cause shoulder pain. The best option is to have this problem properly assessed by a healthcare professional. Often, sleeping on the shoulder on your side can make symptoms worse. We recommend sleeping on your back. We never recommend trying to adjust your shoulders on your own. The anatomy is very complicated, and this can lead to further injury. Arthritis can cause shoulder pain without injury as it can get inflamed with gradual use over time.
