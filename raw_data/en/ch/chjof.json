Some kids aren't \"just like this\" as you may have heard from your pediatrician. It's not normal, and there's a real reason for it. Something is irritating your child's gut -whether it's not enough specific nutrients or hidden food sensitivities (mainly gluten, additives, glyphosate, refined sugars) that's affecting their brain chemistry and this is how it's revealing itself - angry behavior, emotional meltdowns, tantrums, etc. They don't know how to communicate that something 'is off\" or \"doesn't feel right' because they're so young, so this is how they express it. Most diagnosed ASD, ODD, SPD, ADD, ADHD have root causes of this - and when we identify the triggers, replenish nutrients we see a totally different kid - one that feels safe in their body, can communicate their needs, and doesn't feel like its them against the world. Struggling with your child's behavior? Set up a consult to talk about it so we can get to the root of it. "}
