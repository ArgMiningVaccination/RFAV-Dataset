Published on [Parents PACK](/publications/parents-pack) Published on It's a common concern among parents of newborns and infants \u2014 are my kids getting too many vaccines? Are the vaccines overwhelming their immune system? Indeed, the recommended childhood vaccine schedule includes 26 inoculations against 14 vaccine-preventable diseases during a child's first two years of life. The well visits during which children receive these vaccines can include up to five shots. Yet both the cumulative effects of the childhood vaccine schedule and the volume of shots given during a single visit shouldn't be the basis for lingering doubts. Anytime these concerns have been studied, the data have been reassuring. Immunological components of vaccines are the viral or bacterial proteins or bacterial polysaccharides (complex sugars) contained in a vaccine that induce an immune response. In the 1980s, children received vaccines to protect them from seven diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Immunological components contained in these vaccines numbered about 3,000. Currently, the recommended immunization schedule protects children from 14 diseases, and the total number of immunological components is between 150 and 160, depending on which versions of the pertussis and rotavirus vaccines children are given. So in approximately 30 years, the protection children receive against vaccine-preventable diseases has doubled \u2014 from seven diseases to 14 \u2014 while the immunological challenge has decreased almost 95 percent. Another important consideration is that infants do not live in a sterile environment. Babies face immunological challenges ever-present in the environment around them; food, water, air, toys, surfaces and other people are all non-sterile and, therefore, are potential sources of germs that could cause their bodies to generate immune responses. While their immune systems need time to mature, the truth of the matter is the immunologic challenges presented by vaccines are minimal when compared with the number of viruses and bacteria infants successfully manage every day. Shortly after birth, newborns are exposed to trillions of bacteria \u2014 carrying them on their skins and mucosal surfaces (nose, throat, intestines). In order to avoid infection, babies' immune systems constantly make antibodies \u2014 the product of an immunological challenge. This concern, that infants' immune systems are immature, has merit within context. That is, studies have shown that infants' immune systems are not as good at making T cell responses as those of older infants and children. Likewise, B cell responses, responsible for generating antibodies against the complex sugars on the surface of bacteria, take time to mature. However, it does not mean that infants are completely incapable of protecting themselves. Indeed, if this were the case, our species would cease to exist. However, humans have evolved to endure in a few ways: Contributed by: Charlotte A.
