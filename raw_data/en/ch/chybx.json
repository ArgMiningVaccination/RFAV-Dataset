HeaderBackground & Processes The Alameda County SB 823 Subcommittee was convened in early 2021, in accordance with legislation. The Subcommittee accepted the significant amount of work and responsibility to create the plan presented here. The Subcommittee met regularly and publicly as an entire body, and developed workgroups with specific areas of focus. The workgroups made the Subcommittee more efficient by allowing multiple topics to be explored simultaneously. These workgroups convened weekly during the summer and drafted the substa nce of the plan presented here. A downside of th e workgroup process, which community members brought to the Subcommittee 's attention, was that it did not provide public access for interested community members to observe or provide feedbac k. This is an issu e that should be addressed and balanced in any future plan development process. Both the Subcommittee and workgroups were supported by subject matter experts, community member input , and background research. As part of this process, at the request of the Subcommittee, Impact Justice also conducted focus groups and interviews with current ly and formerly incarcerated youth, both locally at the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC) and virtually with those in state custody at the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) . The input of these young people was invaluable, and we sincerely thank them for their willingness to share their experiences and recommendations with us. Subcommittee Composition & Membership Our Subcommittee was approved by the Board of Supervisors, whose members are included in the following table: Agency Name & Title Agency Name & Title Chief Probation Officer (Chair) Marcus Dawal, Interim Chief Probation Officer Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Commission Vamsey Palagummi, Chair District Attorney's Office Matthew Golde, Assistant District Attorney Delinquency Prevention Network Emily Young , Co-Chair or Lynn Gardner , (Designee) Co-Chair Public Defender's Office Alphonso Mance, Deputy Public Defender Free Our Kids Coalition Hayden Renato Department of Social Services Michelle Love, Assistant Agency Director Community Member , District 1 Representative Caryn Quezada Department of Mental Health Juan Taizan, Forensic, Diversion, & Re - Entry Services Director Community Member , District 2 Representative Davida Scott Office of Education Monica Vaughan, Chief of Schools Community Member , Erin Palacios Commented [EP1]: This table differs from the BoS list Impact Justice: 4 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderDistrict 3 Representative Court Representative Honorable Judge Ursula Jones Dickson Community Member , District 4 Representative Trevor Arceneaux Community Member , District 5 Representative Kelly Thompson Purpose & Intentions Moving Forward This SB 823 Realignment Plan, if approved by the Board of Supervisors, shall be submitted to the Office of Youth and Community Restoration (OYCR) no later than January 1, 2022, and will remain in effect through April 30, 2022. The SB 823 Subcommittee will convene to review, revise, and update this document prior to the next required submission to the OYCR, which is on or before May 1, 2022. The SB 823 Subcommittee will do so annually in order to update and develop the SB 823 Realignment Plan for submission to the OYCR on or before May 1 of each year. However, the SB 823 Subcommittee w ill undertake a complete review redevelopment of the SB 823 Plan every third year, beginning with the plan due on or before May 1, 2025. It is the intent of this Subcommittee to remain regularly engaged in the SB 823 planning and to receive regular reports on implementation, convening monthly through April 2022 and at least quarterly thereafter. It is intended that the structure and composition of the Subcommittee remain the same subject to changes in law, regulation, or state guidance . Bylaws and procedures related to organization, process, operation , and membership for member selection and approval will be developed , which is in keeping with best practices for such legislative bodies . Clear procedures regarding membership turnover , including setting term limits, will also be articulated. These bylaws will be developed, adopted, and adhered to in accordance with any rules and bylaws set by the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council. The following Cha rter and Values statements were developed by the Subcommittee to clearly articulate and guide its work. Charter The Alameda County SB 823 Subcommittee is charged with preparing a comprehensive plan to serve youth realigned under SB 823 the realignment tar get population: \"youth who were eligible for commitment to the Division of Juvenile Justice prior to its closure,\" and youth who are \"adjudicated to be a ward of the juvenile court based on an offense described in subdivision (b) or Section 707 or on offense described in Section 290.008 of the Pen al Code .\" This plan shall be comprehensive, Meeting the requirements for youg people commi tted to Secure Youth Treatment Facility (SYTF) means addressing not only detention and housing, but treatment, services, reentry preparation, and reentry as well. For the realignment population not committed to the SYTF , this requires addressing detention alternat ives, housing, and placement options; family engagement, preservation , and maintenance; an array of commumity -based treatments Commented [EP2]: This should be a complete review each year, but a redevelopment or somehow more complete process every third year. Impact Justice: 5 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Headerand services; and individualized assessments and case plan ning; and an effective teaming model to deliver coordinated treatment and ser vices. Ultimately, this will prepare young people for success outside of the system. We are charged to identify and \"use evidence -based and promising practices and programs that improve the outcomes of youth and public safety, reduce the transfer of youth into t he adult criminal justice system, ensure that dispositions are in the least restrictive appropriate environment, reduce and then eliminate racial and ethnic disparities, and reduce the use of confinement in the juvenile justice system by utilizing communit y-based responses and interventions. \" (Sen. Bill No.823 (2019 -2020 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1)(S.B. 823) Values The Alameda County SB 823 Subcommittee is committed to the success of system -involved youth through the implementation of innovative strategies that pro mote healing and address their needs, the needs of victims and families, improve public safety, and promote overall community wellbeing. The Subcommittee recognizes that system -involved youth have overwhelmingly experienced trauma and neglect on both indi vidual and systemic levels, which has often resulted in their system involvement. Thus, the Subcommittee considers that providing youth with healing - centered and trauma -informed services that address these harms is vital in preventing harms from recurring. To this end, we are committed to complying with the mandates of SB 823, ensuring that impacted youth have access to education, programming, treatment, and services that are both developmentally and therapeutically appropriate. We are determined to go abov e and beyond these requirements whenever possible, with the ultimate goal of best supporting youth success outside of the system. We also recognize that family (defined as broadly as possible) relationships and reunification are often key components of suc cessful treatment and reentry, and will seek every opportunity to promote and strengthen familial connections. We a cknowledg e that victims of crime and communities have been harmed, and approach those harms directly. We address the needs of victims , in compliance with the California State Constitution and Mar sy's Law, and provide a meaningful opportunity for accountability . The Subcommittee is strongly committed to the values and principles of restorative justice , which centers the needs of the person harmed while providing support and structure to the young person as they seek to make things right. The work of the Subcommittee is guided by a public health approach and is informed by evidence -based practices that improve outcomes for system -involved youth, reduce recidivism, and increase public safety. The Subcommittee recognizes that the juvenile justice system disproportionately impacts communities, families, and youth of color. To this end, we are committed to reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities and to promoting racial /ethnic equity through culturally affirming practices and programming. Defining the Target Population1 Overview 1 Based on data provided by Alameda County Probation Department. Commented [EP3]: This is an attempt to list some of the core additional components required to serve the population. Impact Justice: 6 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderAs of March 2021, there were 21 youth from Alameda County committed to the Ca lifornia Division of Juvenile Justice and a total of 55 youth detained in the Juvenile Justice Center (including 44 youth pending resolution of 707(b) offenses). This number represents 80% of the current population. The section that follows provides an ov erview of the 21 youth currently committed to DJJ, with the earliest registered in 2014. This population most nearly resembles the population of youth likely to be committed to the SYTF. The section also contains an overview of the (#) of youth with a sust ained 707(b) offense who received a disposition other than a commitment to DJJ. Since the passage of Proposition 57, in 2016, there have been three youth transfers from Alameda County to the adult system. Together, these three groups makeup the target realignment population. Demographics DJJ Commitments: Youth's ages at commitment ranged from 14 to 25 years old, with a mean age of 18.9. Male youth comprised most of DJJ's population (20, or 95%, of all youth) , compared to one female youth (5%). Y outh of color were disproportionately made up the entire population of youth committed to DJJ, and were mostly Black (57%), Hispanic (38%), and Asian (5%). All Other Dispositions: Primary Offenses DJJ Commitments: All of the youth committed (100%) to DJJ had WIC -707(b) offenses. The most common offenses were murder (33%) and robbery (24%). Youth committed for assault with a firearm or a deadly weapon and voluntary manslaughter each accounted for 14% of commitments. Youth committed for attempted murder, lewd act with a minor, and rape each made up 5% of the remaining commitments. All Other Dispositions: Prior Juvenile Justice System Contact DJJ Commitments: Prior to DJJ commitment, youth had an average of 5 referrals to Probation. Almost half (48%) had up to 3 referrals while just under one -fourth (24%) had 7 or more referrals. The average age at first referral was 14 years old, with about 43% aged 13 or younger and 19% aged 17 or older. The average span of time between a youth's first referral and DJJ commitment was 4.4 years. Significantly, no youth went from first referral to DJJ commitment in under one year, and only 2 youth (9.5%) went from first referral to DJJ commitment in under 2 years. The offenses for these two youth were murder and lewd act with a minor. Before the DJJ commitment, youth were booked into custody an average of 6.2 times, with 24% of them having 10 or more bookings prior to commitment. On average, before their DJJ commitment , youth had 4 true2 findings. Approximately 1 in 3 (33%) youth had 5 or more true findings before the DJJ commitment. All Other Dispositions: 2 This refers to a formal finding , made by the Court, that the youth was involved in a delinquent act . Commented [EP4]: Insert FN - The target population includes youth with sustained offenses listed in both WIC 707(b) and PC 290.008. However, for the sake of readability 707(b) offense will be used to refer to the combination of offenses unless otherwise indicated. Formatted: underline Commented [EP5]: Do we have the data for prior contact with other systems. We should because it would have been pulled for the detention reports so probation would have it. Prior system/ agency contact of any kind represents an opportunity to avoid this outcome. Impact Justice: 7 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderProjected Number of Youth to be Served in the SYTF Based on the past five -year average (2015 -2020), Alameda County Probation Department (ACPD) has projected the number of youth expected to be served. Although Alameda County only committed an average of 6 youth per year over the last five years ., an analysi s of 2020 disposition data showed there were 70 youth who were eligible for commitment with 707(b) offenses sustained . Based on the past 5 -year average in Alameda County (excluding 2019 as an outlier), the ACPD projects the SYTF DJJ will serve 67 youth p er year. The past three -year average length of stay for Alameda County youth in DJJ is 2.8 years , plus an estimated year - long average pre -disposition court process is also used to calculate the projected number of additional youth to be served each by year. It is important to note that the length of the court process varies by individual youth due to a number of factors, and the number of youth that may be booked in on 707(b) charges in the future can be affected by variables no t factored in this projection . Such variables may include the dispositional track and broader sociodemographic, political, and economic factors in Alameda County (e.g., an increase in the crime rate ). One factor that we expect will have an immediate imp act on average length of stay is the proportion of youth adjudicated for murder and other serious crimes. The average dispositions in these cases are much longer than the \"average .\" The average length of stay for 1st degree murder , for example, was 60.9 months in 2020 (approximately 5 years) and 47 months (approximately 4 years) in 2019 .3 In the future, this data will be tracked very closely to ensure that youth are being retained in the juvenile justice system and that the county is not seeing an incr ease in the number of transfer petitions filed or in the number of you th not being transferred into the adult system. Similarly, data will be tracked to ensure that net -widening \u2014which is to say an increase in commitments to the secure track as compared with commitments to DJJ \u2014 doesn't occur. Given that Alameda County has utilized less severe options for many 707(b) cases in the past, it is intended that these less severe options conti nue to be utilized wherever possible. Projected Number of Youth Adjudicated of 707(b) Offenses to be Otherwised Served In addition to the relative ly small number of youth ACPD anticipates serving within the SY TF, the plan outlined will also directly ser ve youth adjudicated of 707(b) offenses . Based on the past five-year average (2015 -2020) of youth meeting these c riteria , Alameda County has projected the number of youth to be se rved. An analysis of 2020 disposition data showed there were 70 youth who we re eligible f or commitment with 707(b) offenses sustained. DATA REQUIRED - We still need dem ographic s for the missing portion of the target population (707(b)/ PC 290.008 adjudications) \"numbers of youth served, disaggregated by factors including their ages, offense and offense histories, gender, race or ethnicity, and other characteristics, and by the pro grams, placements, or facilities to which they are referred \" required in plan pursuant to WIC 1995 (c)(1) 3 Court decisions determine what the length of stay will be within the parameters set in Welfare and Institutions Code section 875 et seq . Commented [EP6]: Suggest ed cut for two reasons 1) Moved it to the subsection below on projected number of youth with 707b adjudications who will be otherwise served. 2) It doesn't add anything to the projection here without additional data or context. It seems to be trying to indicate a likely increase in commitments based on this data, but it can't support that point unless it is also shown that there were fewer 707(b) adjudications during the relevant prior years (or perhaps a lower average). Commented [EP7]: Regardless of whether this is an anomalous year, and I cannot tell whether it is based on the data provided, it does not follow that it should be excluded from the analysis. It is still part of the county story over that time period. To exclude it a much better case would need to be laid out and explained. Otherwise it appears to be excluded simply because it lowers the projection. Also, the initial average is 5.6, which is rounded up to 6. And excluding the 2019 data takes this up to 7. With numbers this size that is a big jump, and ev en if this made sense, it should be clearly explained and supported with comparable data. Commented [EP8]: Suggested cut for two reasons: 1) There is no information as to how someone arrived at this estimate or whether it is an estimate of time after sustained offense or also includes pre -adjudication. 2) This is a period of time when, by definition, youth are not being served in the SYTF because they have not been committed there. While it may very well be appropriate to provide realignment services during this time, the court process time should not be used to increase the estimated number of youth to be served in the SYTF. These youth would not have been within the ... Commented [EP9]: This doesn't seem right. This sounds like it will create an artificially high average number and thus hide increases in the committed population for some period of time. ... Commented [EP10]: Again, court process time is not part of this equation. Youth in the hall on 707(b) charges, even serious ones, are not part of this ... Formatted: Highlight Commented [EP11]: This doesn't quite make sense. Is it saying that the proportion of youth adjudicat ed for these crimes ultimately has a significant impact on the average length of stay and population size? Or is it ... Formatted: HeaderRetaining the Target Population ACPD strongly believes that youth are best served close to home \u2014 enabling smoother community reintegration as well as more opportunities for family engagement, access to high quality services, programming in the local facility and community. ACPD recognizes the harms caused by any system contact, but also recognizes that youth transferred to the adult criminal court face some of the most harmful outcomes (e.g., increased recidivism rates, increased likelihood of victimization during incarceration, increased rates of suicide, poorer mental health outcomes, etc.). Specifically, transferring youth to adult courts tends to increase their recidivism rates, while processing youth in juvenile courts is related to reduced recidivism rates. Additionally, sentencing youth to adult prisons ten ds to aggravate mental health issues which, in turn, is associated with prison misconduct (particularly for younger inmates). While the decision to transfer youth lies with the Court, ACPD is committed to doing all in its power to ensure that youth remain out of adult criminal courts . Thus, ACPD will prevent an increase in transferred youth by: A. Ensuring secure -track placement options are available for consideration by the court. This not only refers to the Secure Placement Youth Treatment Facility (SYPTF), but also the array of programs and services that will be utilized to address the needs of the youth committed to the SB 823 program , including investing in successful community -based treatment and step -down options .4 B. Establishing sufficient high-quality programs that are culturally responsive, trauma - informed, evidence -based, age appropriate, centered on youth and family engagement, and based on positive youth development. This will ensure that programming approach youth with specificity and in a way that they are able to relate to and engage with. Culturally affirming staff will also support youth. C. Guaranteeing that specialized treatment and programming options meet high -need youth that garner confidence of juvenile court judges. D. Certifying that formal recommendations from Probation to the Court, for adult transfers, are approved at the Chief Probation Officer level. This ensures several layers of review and discussion before a recommendation for transfer proceeds. A detailed, updated report from the Multi -Disciplinary Team (MDT) and the youth's counsel will be considered and submitted as part of the overall recommendation. E. Tracking data of youth transfers to adult criminal court and reporting to justice partners to monitor and review at lea st bi-annually and at all SB 823 Subcommittee meetings. This will ensure a level of oversight and input, contributing toward the goals of transparency and fairness. F. Ensuring that youth have in juvenile hall pending trial or dispo sition on 707(b) charges have access to the services and programs available within the secure track. This will provide youth with an opportunity to make and show progress prior to the court having to enter judgment on a petition to transfer a child to the adult c riminal justice sys tem. 4 The SB 823 pro gram is intended to be a high -quality program that relies on data -driven decision making that incorporates feedback from youth as well. Commented [EP12]: This is just a change to match the language in WIC 875. It seems like this is intended to match and should be changed throughout. Formatted: Line spacing: Multiple 1.08 li Commented [EP13]: QUESTION: Would it be possible for youth to be in the SYTF prior to disposition? To spend their time in the SYTF rather than in the hall while awaiting proceedings on a 707(b) petition? Or even to be there during the day to participate in programming and benefit from the different relationships and dynamics within the unit and with the staff? I don't know if this is a desirable option, but wanted to know if it was even an option before getting into the questions. Impact Justice: 9 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: HeaderE.G. Prior to a judicial termination on a petition to transfer a youth to the adult system, a MDT ( right term?) will convene to consider what, if any, services are needed to serve the youth or that may assist in avoiding a transfer of the youth to the a dult system. The team will consider any services recommended in (which assessments and reports) or otherwise being recommended as required to the court. The team will also determine whether those services are available within the SYTF, and if not, wh ether they can be made available. If the services cannot be made available, the team will report the reasons for this conclusion. Both the juvenile justice system and adult criminal system aim to protect the safety of the public, but unlike the adult court system, the overarching purpose of the juvenile justice system is to provide children with care, treatment and guidance consi stent with their best interest. does not recognize punishment as a legitimate purpose . Rather Indeed , the United States Supreme Court recognized that the juvenile justice system's its stated goal5 is to help young people avoid future delinq uency and mature into law - abiding adults. but the adult system is arguably more punitive and focuses on retribution, while the juvenile system is designed to be rehabilitative. Building upon years of research and evidence -based progress in juvenile justice , SB 823 aimed to push things a step further As stated i n the language of SB 823, the goal of the legislation is stating that \"[i]t is the intent of the Legislature and the ad ministration for counties to use evidence -based and promising practices and programs that improve the outcomes of youth and public safety, reduce the transfer of youth into the adult criminal justice system, ensure that dispositions are in the least restrictive appropriate environment, re duce and then eliminate racial and ethnic disparities, and reduce the use of confinement in the juvenile justice system by utilizing community -based responses and interventions ;\" and ACPD the goal of the legislation is not to increase the number of transf ers to adult criminal court, and ACPD clearly states its commitment to prioritize juvenile justice system retention. upholding the law's intent. Data Collection and Reporting The Probation Department will commit to publishing timely data related to SB 823 implementation. The data collection and reporting are critical to ensure (1) there are no net - widening impacts in commitments to the local SYTF compared to commitments to DJJ prior to the passage of SB 823 and DJJ intake closure; (2) the Plan sufficie ntly protects against any increase in adult court prosecutions of youth in Alameda County; (3) there is an ongoing racial and ethnic disparity analysis to monitory the impact of the most restrictive and punitive decisions on youth of color compared to whit e youth; and (4) \"step -downs,\" or less restrictive programming for eligible youth to serve the remainder of their baseline term or modified baseline term, as permissible under WIC 875(f), is being utilized to the greatest extent possible. To accomplish thi s, the probation department will publish data disaggregated by race/ethnicity and gender on a quarterly basis that includes, but is not limited to: 5 See Supr eme Court Case - Montgomery v. Louisiana , outlning the purpose and intent of juvenile justice system -0.08\" Formatted: Header the of youth eligible for a SYTF under WIC 875(a), including youth ages fourteen (14) years or older whose most recent juvenile court adjudication is a 707(b) offense, including the most serious offense included in the adjudication; the number of youth committed by Alameda County courts to a SYTF, including the most serious offense for which youth are co mmitted; the time youth spend in a SYTF, calculated by the date of release from the SYTF, either as the result of discharge as described in WIC 875(e) or transfer to a less restrictive program as described in WIC 875(f); the number of youth who are trans ferred to a less restrictive program as described in WIC 875(f)(1), including the type of program the youth are transferred or \"stepped down\" to; the number of youth for whom a motion for transfer to adult criminal court was filed, including the most serio us offense considered in the transfer motion; and the number of youth transferred to adult criminal court, including the most serious offense for which the youth was transferred. Promoting Healthy Adolescent Development Youth are more susceptible to engaging in risky behaviors due to the development of the brain's prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for complex reasoning and functioning, and will not fully mature until their mid -twenties.6 Youth are more likely to be impulsive, fa il to evaluate the impacts of their decisions, and assess long -term consequences. 7 With that said, youth also have significant neuroplasticit y - the brain's ability to rewri te, rewire, relearn, and strengthen important connections - and through practice, repetition, and praise, youth are best positioned to create and reinforce new neural pathways to lea rn new skills, habits, and ways of thinking. Transfers to adult court can potentially entrench youth in a life of criminal behavior that they otherwise would have matured away from. Youth afforded the opportunity to remain in the juvenile system will, on the other hand, have access to age -appropriate education and rehabilitative services that are designed for them , and designed to .harness their neu roplasticity. One approach that takes this perspective into account is known as positive youth justice, which is built upon the idea that youth can be developed within a caring community of adults who work to help them learn and practice key skills. The goal of this approach is to recognize that many of the youth's behaviors and challenges are developmentally typical (rather than pathological and/or abnormal) responses to unaddressed needs. ACPD recognizes that many of the youth from the target populatio n may not have had the support and experiences necessary to build the core skills to manage emotion and make effective decisions. ACPD also recognizes that negative or harmful decisions are often a direct response to the many traumas youth have experienced , which act as coping or survival strategies When programming and services prioritize skill development for all youth, their mental, physical, psychological, and emotional wellness benefit. 6 Cohen, A. O., & Casey, B. J. (2014). Rewiring juvenile justice: the intersection of developmental neuroscience and legal policy. Trends in Cognitive Sciences , 18(2), 63 -65. 7 Giedd, J. N. (2008). The tee n brain: insights from neuroimaging. Journal of spacing: Multiple 1.08 li, Bulleted + Level: 1 shouldn't leave it with just keeping youth in the JJ system. In part because the target population that we are dealing with isn't just youth in the SYTF and transferred, it is b roader as described. This should also include how ensuring use of the least restrictive environment and establishing the most connected relationships is a major part of promoting health AD. Impact Justice: 11 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderTherapeutic Milieu ACPD recognizes the need for a new approach to in -custody and in -community programming , designed to better serve the long -term needs of young people and the public. Based partially on its existing TAY programs and the programming available at Camp Sweeney, ACPD will develop a new program to serve youth committed to the secure placement treatment facility. The County's new program will focus on supporting youth in their development of core competencies (described below ). The program will be designed to both meet and flexibly respond to youth's individual needs. The goal of this program is not to \"save \" young people, but rather to provide an enriching, nurturing environment that supports their inherent potential to succeed as individuals. Both the program and the environment will be designed to ensure that all youth feel safe, cared for, and valued. Thus, ACPD shall construct a developmentally appropriate and restorative \"milieu,\" or social environment. This approach will enable all service providers to contribute to a comprehensive program designed to address the core needs of youth. The coming s ections shall provide the framework for this milieu. In addition, ACPD will develop new programs and options to serve youth adjudicated of 707(b) offens es who are not committed to the SYTF. These programs and options will likewise focus on development of t he core competencies and will emphasize the same fundamental values and components outlined for the milieu. Focus on Relationships Decades of research on therapeutic modalities8 related to both mental health and delinquency have produced a set of best practices . The quality of the relationship between the helper and the youth is one component of success , and reflects a more general indicator of long -term wellbeing: fostering quality social connections . The attributes identified as most important across the literature include the ability to empathize, demonstrate commitment and belief in the young person, display warmth and authenticity, and \"recognize and acknowledge the 'real ity' of the 'lived experiences' of young people .\"9 ACPD shall commit to develop a comprehensive team of staff \u2014through training and instructive supervision \u2014who will collaborate with contracted providers and volunteers to offer an array of services and supp orts for youth. A secondary component for long -term success is that these trusted relationships have the capacity to transcend the walls of the facility and follow the youth in meaningful ways into their communities of origin or chosen living environments. In focus groups with youth previously served by the DJJ system, Impact Justice facilitators noted that youth identified mentors \"that you really connect with one -on-one\" as instrumental in helping them successfully transition back into their communities. They also stressed that they needed mentors to have regular contact with them on an individual basis , especially in the first few weeks after their transition. Achieving this goal entails b uilding the social environment in such a way to includ e, from the beginning, mentors who can advocate for and support the youth throughout the process. Research related 8 Therapeutic modalities refers to the \"wide array of treatments and interventions that provide a variety of therapeutic benefits\" (Bellew, Michlovitz, and Nolan Jr. 2016, 3).

Commented [EP15]: I think we discussed this before, but can we add something about how this critical period is also a time of great hope. The plasticity in this developmental period makes it possible to ameliorate the effects of past trauma -- and conversely it should be pointed out that harm done to a young person in this critical period can compound and ingrain the negative things. For instance, I really like this quote: \"People certainly do not enter adolescence with a 'blank slate.' Rather, adolescent development is pa rtly a consequence of earlier life experiences. However, these early life experiences are not determinative, and the adaptive plasticity of adolescence marks it as a window of opportunity for change through which mechanisms of resilience, recovery, and dev elopment are possible.\" It comes from -- National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: https://doi.org/10.17226/25388 Commented [EP16]: QUESTION: what is meant by \"helper?\" Is it a counsel or therapist, staff member, caretaker, all of the above, or something else? This section goes on to describe the importance of a significant, quality relationship so I wanted to make sure I understood wh at this referred to. Impact Justice: 12 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: Headerto services that were most effective in reducing recidivism lists mentoring as one of the most effective interventions in recidivism reductio n.10 Additional evidence for a relationship -based approach to the provision of service and supports comes from the literature on implementation of Positive Youth Justice11. One of the central benefits of juvenile justice realignment is that youth will rema in close to their homes and communities. Using the most expansive definition of family, ACPD will engage and support youth in establishing the most connected relationships possible. It will further support youth's relationsh ips through deep partnerships wi th contracted, community -based providers and volunteers at all phases of a youth's contact with the system. For youth with 707(b) adjudications who are not committed to the SYTF ACPD will contract with and engage community providers and volunteers to serve youth in other settings or in the community, ensure access to the mentorship program described above, and provide robust family engagement and support . At every phase, and in every setting, these services will be delivered with goal of maintaining the youth in the least restrictive appropriate environment as intended by SB 823. Credible Messengers Incorporating Credible Messengers into a secure treatment facility requires much more than adding a program that provides time, space, and opportunity to meet with youth residing there. While that is an important component, credible messengers in secure facilities will be given a broad array of responsibilities supported by the facility leadership. These responsibilities require the ability of Credib le Messengers to have access to youth throughout their waking hours (and a presence at critical late -night hours, when many youth struggle the most). In order to leverage their knowledge and perspective within the facility milieu, Credible Messengers will be incorporated into staff meetings, trainings, and other processes that inform the way the facility is run. Incorporation of Credible Messengers and their collaboration with clinical, restorative, and other treatment -oriented personnel requires probation and institutional staff to relinquish some portion of their control in defining and facilitating overall youth engagement. The purpose of incorporating credible messengers from the community is to minimize institutionalization and maximize positive ties i n the community. In essence, if youth cannot be in the community, then the effort should be to bring the community to them. In order to successfully prepare youth for safe and successful community reintegration, , they have to develop trusting, positives t ies within the community. The institution will support that process by \"making room\" for Credible Messengers to contribute to and develop such a culture and milieu. How will credible messengers be utilized to serve 707(b) youth who are not committed to the SYTF? Restorative Justice Practices The milieu must also account for inequities , social injustices , and violations of social contract s that are specific to the youth's experiences. Common models for intervention focus on \"changing\" a young person's way of thinking to reflect a more pro -social perspective. However, the lives of many youth who find themselves involved with the justice system have been 10 Howell, J. C., & Lipsey, M. W. (2012). Research -Based Guidelines for Juvenile Justice Programs.

Retraining and re -evaluating one's thinking will occur in the context of a safe restorative environment. Restorative justice (RJ)/transformative justice princ iples and practices must guide the SB 823 milieu community structure and all related policies, practices, programs , and procedures. At the core of such a program is a kind of relation al, physical , and emotional safety, as well as transparency and empowerme nt. Different from the inequitable circumstances and social injustices that have existed within the youth's community of origin, ACPD will ensure that the social environment within this community is firmly steeped in restorative/transformative justice principles and practices. Restoration will not only be practice for youth , in address ing harm they may have caused but also a n opportunity to offer social environment services to help the youth identify and begin to find ways to heal harms that they have endur ed. This form of healing makes room for the youth to understand and accept responsibility for their actions while learning healthy ways to respond to their own experiences. The milieu's core values and practices will stand on the pillars of restorative ju stice: accountability, competency development, and community safety. It will also incorporate common RJ core values: equity, respect , honesty , humility , accountability , empowerment, and hope. ACPD will ensure that this approach is woven through any level or stage system designed to encourage progress, youth code of conduct, incident response, disciplinary practices, staff training, and supervision. All programs, settings, and service s for 707(b) adjudicated youth who are not committed to the SYTF will also be based on the core con cepts and values of restorative justice. This includes family engagement and maintenance efforts, recommending appropriate conditions of probation, incident responses, supervision and reporting requirements, staff training, and individual case planning and assessment . Culturally Responsive Programming Equally as important to healthy adolescent development is ACPD's commitment to design a high-quality, cultura lly responsive program. The term cultural responsiveness generally refers to an approach that considers and responds to individuals' cultural frame of reference, including demographic, sociopolitical, and other contextual characteristics. When applied to y outh programming, a culturally responsive approach takes into account the cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of youth in the design and implementation of the program. Research suggests that an effective implementation of a culturally r esponsive program makes youth, particularly those from ethnic and racial minorities, feel safe and valued and better prepared for their futures .12 To improve youth's successful participation in program activities for both the SYFT and services or settings for 707(b) adjudicated youth completing alternative dispositions , ACPD will take on a culturally responsive approach across three two main program components: structure , and staffing , and program design . 12 Simpkins, S.

Impact Justice: 14 Formatted: Header, Indent: -0.08\" Formatted: HeaderAs stated earlier, Alameda will adhere to the Risk, Need, Responsivity (RNR) principle which , together, make up one of the eight principles of effective interventions.13 To ensure adherence to the Responsivity Principle, ACPD will adopt programs, services , and interventions that are relevant to youth of color, given the disproportionate rate at which they are represented in the target population. As previously mentioned, h aving youth participate in activities that are meaningful to their everyday lives and interests is one way to foster efficacy and is particularly important for fostering engagement of ethnic and racial minority youth .14 ACPD will implement programs that youth can connect with, understand, and find value in. For instance, youth will participate in activities that promote their socio -political consciousness, such as designing and participating in social justice projects that can have an impact in their communities. Relatedly, ACPD will ensure youth are offered programs that provide the history of their respective cultures, races , and/or e thnicities , and employ relevant indigenous/ancestral practices and frameworks that support youth development. . Youth will also be offered religious and/or spiritual services to assist with providing a holistic array of services that they can choose from as part of their growth and development. Most evidence -based models have been created by individuals immersed in Western, Eurocentric culture, many of whom developed these models by \"studying others ,\" (i.e., not as a result of actual lived experiences ).15 This means that many evidence -based programs have not been implemented with racial or ethnic minorities, and will not necessarily be the most relevant options for the target population. To that end, ACPD sha ll consider programming rooted in local best practices and youth development, evidence -informed practices, and emerging practices, such as EBP+ and community -based organizations.16 Paragraph or couple of sentences applying this same flexibility and approach to services for 707(b) adjudicated youth i n alternative dispositional tracks. Facility staff are also an integral component of a culturally responsive approach since they play an essential role in the implementation of programs. ACPD will thus provide and ensure the appropriate training of all facility staff, including on how to engage youth in the design and implementation of program activities. Staff will be prepared and willing to actively seek youth's input regarding their interests, goals , and community conce rns. Introducing youth with the opportunity to co -construct program activities is fundamental to developing culturally responsive programming17. Staff will help youth thrive by ensur ing that materials are written in a language that is accessible for all li teracy levels and remain attentive for when interpretation or translation services are needed ,.18 as well as for when graphic or oral deliveray of program materials will better enable youth to access and engage content. Mentioned previously, s ince youth's realities and needs are likely to change over time, staff will remain flexible and prepared to adapt programs in order to remain responsive to the youth.

How will culturally responsive programming be used to better support youth residing with their families, and to better provide services to family members? The last question may also relate to youth in the SYTF. Culturally Responsive Mental Health Services ACPD shall commit to ex panding its traditional interpretation of mental health and program services . Based on historical Youth Level of Service (YLS) assessment information, youth committed to the SB 823 program will require programming to target judgment and decision - making, emotion al regulation/ management , and social engagement . ACPD will ensure that these services are provided via an interwoven mech anism that clearly shows how building these skills helps the youth move from surviving to thriving. n Most All of the youth currently at DJJ are Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color ( BIPOC ). Thus, ACPD will adopt theoretically relevant , evidence -informed , or promising interventions developed by BIPOC individuals for BIPOC individuals and/or will commit to delivering or contracting for the delivery of Culturally - Adapted Treatments (CATs).19 Restorative Justice will also serve as one of the frames for this program and, as such, youth shall be provided with curriculum related to restorative justice practices. One model that has been developed for youth in the justice system is the \"RJ Ready\" curriculum developed by Rashida George at the Instit ute for Restorative Future. More importantly ,. RJ shall guide ACPD's rewards and sanctions policies, allowing for the community (youth, mil ieu team, and family members) to instill meaningful and authentic ways to repair any harms committed by youth or staf f during the Program. This will allow for a move away from stock rewards and sanctions and toward highly individualized approaches more likely to help youth internalize the core competency being developed within the process. Interventions that focus on ra cial socialization and ethnic pride may reduce the reliance on criminogenic knowledge structures . 20 Thus, ACPD will ensure a rich array of programs that provide youth opportunities to explore their history and culture to enhance BIPOC racial/ethnic pride as a way of building resilience and combatting criminogenic knowledge structures ( CKS). The primary interventions sel ected for this unit will have a manual or written protocol, facilitators 19 CAT's are \"systematic modificati ons of evidence -based treatment or intervention protocols that consider language, culture and context to increase compatibility with the client's cultural patterns, meanings and values\" (Bernal, Chafey, and Rodriguez Bernal, Guillermo & Chafey, Mar\u00ed a & Domenech Rodr\u00edguez, Melanie.

Gender Responsive Approach Although girls constitute the largest growing segment of the juvenile justice population, there are very few programs that have been designed to meet their the specific needs of girls and gender expansive youth .21 Similarly, lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and/or gender non -conforming and transgender quee r, trans, and gender expansive youth (LGBQ/GNCT) youth are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system . And yet, few systems have protocols in place to collect sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE ) data to better understand the pathways and experiences of LGBQ/GNCT youth in the system .22 As a result, girls and sexual minority gender expansive youth in the system are unlikely to receiv e appropriate, evidence -based services suitable for their rehabilitative needs. This is particularly concerning given that the inclusion of gender -specific risk and protective factors in the design and implementation of programs is crucial for accomplishin g positive outcomes for all youth .23 In fact, r esearch has shown that gender -neutral programs are significantly less effective than gender -specific programming for girls. Although there is no exhaustive list of gender responsive program elements, recent reviews, research, and government -led study groups examining effective gender -responsive programming suggest that the most promising elements in programming for girls include the following: Relational (e.g. attention to healthy romantic and non -romantic re lationships) Restorative (e.g. scaffold skills for navigating the justice system with attention to trauma histories) Socio -culturally anchored (e.g. attention to the intersectional identities of girls) Individualized (e.g. tailored to meet a variety of needs) Multi -level (e.g. girls' individual, peer, family, community, and multiple systems of involvement are targeted.) Community -based (e.g. provided flexibly in youth's natural communities) Strengths -based (e.g. orientation on positive development, re sisting deficit -orientation and promoting skills and assets in the child.) In a national survey conducted with parole and probation staff, the overwhelming majority (97%) agreed that girls have unique needs and most of them (94%) thought there should be ge nder- responsive programming24 Although there is no exhaustive list of gender -responsive programs, there are some For this reason, ACPD will work to implement the key elements of gender responsive programming described that ACPD will consider in the development of SB 823 programs for girls and gender expansive youth .

Since adolescence is a profound time of change and growth, programs should be designed to support social contexts that promote healthy development . PSpecifically, p rograms will 30.31. Additionally, programs will stress the role of relationships between staff and girls. Programs and services should also be restorative in nature, helping them navigate the system with attention to their trauma and victimization histories. At the same time, there will be program activ ities designed to encourage leadership and developing other key strengths. Above all, programs will be individualized and tailored to meet the specific situation of each girl, including having the structures in place to address parenting and pregnant youth and to serve youth and their children in the least restrictive appripriate environment to the greatest extent possible . Given that it is anticipated that young women will rarely be referred to the SB 823 program, ACPD will engage in discussions with othe r Bay Area counties to co -develop a program for young women. Prior to housing Alameda County girls in any out -of-county facility, Alameda County shall ensure that the facility provides a therapeutic model that is in line with the County's own program, a nd that the facility adheres to the same minimums standards of care, treatment, and honoring of children's rights as the County's own program. With that said, ACPD will work closely with the Young Women's Freedom Cente r to create a plan to better support gender - responsive and culturally affirming programming to our young women, transgender and intersex youth, and LGBTQ youth. Transgender and Intersex youth ACPD has developed a policy to guide the care and services of transgender and intersex youth. The policy appropriately states that \"if a youth requires clinically necessary treatment that is not available at the Juvenile Facilities, as determined by a medical or behavioral health provider, the ACPD must provide transportation f or the youth to receive treatment.\"32 An alternative mechanism that may be more appr opriate for youth in the SB 823 program may be to contract with a provider who has the requisite training and practice to provide onsite services. 25 California Penal Code \u00a7 422.56(c) 26 E.g., 28 CFR \u00a7 115.42; Bostock v.

These needs do not exist in a vacuum and are often driven by other social determinants of health and wellbeing su ch as inadequate educational systems, lack of safe affordable housing, poor social supports, inadequate family income and employment opportunities, and barriers to accessing health care. These identified inadequacies do not happen accidentally but are a re sult of the forces of structural and institutional racism over generations in BlPOC communities. Therefore, ACPD will be holistic in their approach to achieving broad mental, physical , and spiritual wellness and healing and take the opportunity to address these needs in a restorative and sustainable manner that places the youth in the position to flourish, not just survive. ACPD will create a comprehensive healing community on the SB 823 unit led , in partnership, by Probation staff and credible messengers. andThis will be supported by the consistent , integrated partnership of a licensed mental health provider that has requisite training and experience work ing with youth and young adults, educational and /or vocational specialists, and trained juvenile specifi c Credible Messenger mentors all working collaboratively to identify and meet youth needs via culturally responsive, developmentally appropriate , and innovative services and opportunities. ACPD will also engage an expert consultant (or group of consultant s) to develop, implement , and monitor the fidelity of this program and the essential training elements. Paragraph describing how same attention to and development of comprehensive community healing will be brought to services for the remaining target population. Mental Health Needs in Context An analysis of the Youth Level of Service Case Management Inventory (YLS -CMI 2) domains in the current DJJ population (see Table 1) suggest that DJJ youth committed to the SB 823 program are likely to demonstrate challenges in problem solving, judgement, decision making, and behavior and emotion management (especially related to anger and aggression). These specific needs may be defined as \"criminogenic\" in the juvenile justice vernacular or as originating from an underlying mental health concern, but neither label changes the recommendations related to appropriate services and supports. Services and supports must be rooted in a clear conceptualization of the potential drivers of symptomatology. Understanding the d rivers provides insight regarding the methods of intervention. This only covers DJJ committed youth and therefore only forecasts youth in SYTF commitments. It also needs to provide an overview/ assessment of the MH needs of the remainder of the target popu lation. A review of different/ additional assessments will be important - including the CANS or other case planning and service delivery assessment. For many youth in the justice system , the drivers lie in their experiences at home and within the community and society at large. Longitudinal research shows that youth who witnessed and experienced high levels of community violence ( i.e., potential trauma exposure) were most likely 33 Borschmann , R., Janca, E., Carter, A., Willoughby, M., Hughes, N., Snow, K., ... & Kinner, S. A. (2020). The health of adolescents in detention: a global scoping review. The Lancet Public Health , Headerto develop hostility and paranoid ideation.34 And African -American youth were consistently more likely to experience high levels of violence over the period studied.35 A second study determined that youth who were exposed to chronic violence over extended time frames developed traits that predicted higher levels of self -reported off ending as young adults.36 Finally, \"interpersonal racial discrimination\" \u2014particularly when experienced by youth who live in under - resourced communities with high rates of violence \u2014can develop criminogenic knowledge structures or adaptive cognitions designe d for survival.37 The criminogenic knowledge structures include a desire for immediate gratification, disregard for \"conventional\" norms, and lack of trust in relationships. ACPD will see the youth through neither pathological nor moral lenses , but rather as youth in need of support to overcome strategies developed to deal with the structural challenges experienced in their everyday lives . Assessments of Needs and Case Planning ACPD and its partners will commit to comprehensively identifying the \"criminogenic \" and mental health needs that must be addressed to support the youth to become thriving community members. Traditionally, ACPD, Alameda County Office of Education (ACOE), and ACBH conduct their assessments independently and develop th eir own Individual Rehabilitation Plan, Mental Health Treatment Plan, and Educational/Vocational Plans based upon their assessments. However, lack of integration, understanding, and coordination of case planning can lead to disjointed services that may fa il in supporting youth to reach the defined goals. In order for the program to appropriately meet the needs of youth in a comprehensive cohesive fashion, ACPD shall ensure that assessment, from its inception, is a multidisciplinary process. ACPD and other service providers will develop a unified assessment and case planning process in which the Individual Rehabilitation Plan completed is informed by both formal and informal assessments and take into account the CANS . It is understood that each Department/ service provider will also develop their individual plans to detail and document their specific services, but these plans will reflect a shared vision and the role each will play in assisting the youth along the journey to successful return to their commun ity of choice. Summary of Assessments Probation Assessment At pre -commitment , the Alameda County Probation Department routinely completes a YLS -CMI 2 to assist the Court in making determinations about care and placement. The YLS/CMI is a validated assessment tool developed to estimate the level of risk for recidivism but its most effective use is to identify needs across a broad array of life that can be targeted by services and addressed in the Individual Rehabilitation Plan. One static and seven dynamic risk/need domains are assessed by the YLS. The domains that relate to youth need s include Family 34 Thomas A.

Appropriately matched interventions that meet the youth's level of need reduces the like lihood of recidivism.38 This is not the same as thriving but is the minimum standard of care for any juvenile services agency. Current Data Nineteen of 21 youth currently served by DJJ (90%) took part in the YLS risk and needs assessment at pre -commitment. Table 1. shows the areas rated highest overall for those who completed the assessment.

Peer Relations, Personality Behavior, and Attitudes and Orientation domains align most closely with externalizing disorders , such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder , and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2014all of which can be driven by traumatic stress responses. The provided data su ggests that youth who will be assigned to the SB 823 program will benefit from opportunities to engage in programming that increase s social decision -making, emotion management , and impulse control. As previously noted, however, many of these \"needs\" are dr iven by the same social determinants that contribute to the marginalization of BIPOC youth and BIPOC communities. So, while providers may want a youth to focus on the decisions that they make, that cannot be done effectively without acknowledging their valid anger regarding their circumstances and providing \"viable alternatives .\" In addition to the primary risk and needs assessed, the YLS will also determine Other Needs and Special Considerations. This factor helps to recognize the family environment and needs, including quality of relationships in the home and the presence of depression, anxiety, trauma, 38 Baglivio, M. T., Wolff, K.

ACPD provides this as sessment pre -adjudication and thus is not completed by the SB 823 probation officer. Therefore, the SB 823 deputy probation officer will review the YLS and collateral documentation for all newly placed youth to ensure that the information entered is compre hensive and consistent with the current understanding of youth need. If the tool was administered greater than 6 months ago or appears to lack the necessary information to appropriately contribute to the development of an Individual Rehabilitation Plan ( IRP), the tool will be readministered by the SB 823 deputy probation officer. Given that the normal youth sample for the YLS -CMI ranges between 12 and 18, ACPD will explore the use of this tool for youth above age 18 when re -assessing youth. Mental Health Assessment ACBH proposes to provide a biopsychosocial assessment and to use that information to determine need for services and develop an appropriate mental health treatment plan. The primary areas that ACBH proposes to include as a part of their biopsychosocial assessment shall include: Demographic information Identification of mental status Identification of specific mental health symptoms and behaviors Identification of functional impairments Description of mental health history Description of history of trauma or exposure to trauma Description of clinical risk factors Psychosocial history (including family history and cultural considerations) Education/vocational history and goals Developmental history from pre -birth to 17 years of age Medical history Medication history Prior mental health history/treatment Substance use/exposure screening and assessment Diagnosis As a part of this assessment, ACBH will use standardized screening and assessment tools designed specifically to meas ure the presence of depression, anxiety, substance use, and trauma -related symptoms (including race -related trauma).

Conceptualization of Needs and Approach to Care In July 2021, Impact Justice had the opportunity to conduct a series of focus groups with youth who were released from DJJ.

To bolster and potentially clarify information gained from the probation and behavioral health assessments, Impact Justice: 22 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: Headerqualitative assessment of culturally specific needs will be completed by a person with \"lived experience\" who has the training and experience to assess youth needs. Thus, ACPD will contract with a community -based organization (CBO) to provide Credible Messenger services that include the provision of qualitative assessment of youth needs utilizing culturally relevant assessment modalities. ACPD has indicated that it will hire a recreational therapist to provide services. As a part of this service , ACPD will ensure that the therapist participate s in the assessment process, par ticularly in terms of determining appropriate leisure and recreation services . The therapist will also ensure these services incorporate a wide variety of activities that include culturally specific activities as well as exposure to activities that can hel p youth enhance their emotion and behavior regulation skills. Leisure/Recreation is noted as one of the high need areas for youth in the program according to the data of previously administered YLS assessments for youth currently in DJJ. The youth focus g roup also yielded other valuable reflections that may suggest improvement for the program. One of the major notes is that youth felt demoralized going before the Parole Board and being denied release. That in and of itself increased frustration and anger. Though it is not possible to know the reason for each youth's denial, a critical component of a comprehensive case planning process will be transparent and will begin with ensuring a clear and comprehensive assessment to identify needs and develop agreed u pon commonly understood goals that relate to preparation for release. ACPD will work with credible messengers, the Court, Public Defender, District Attorney and others to discuss and develop practices for progress review hearings that aim to avoid the demo ralization , frustration, and anger youth reported experiencing at parole hearings. Specialized Treatment Individual Services In addition to collaborative milieu -based interventions previously recommended, it will be important for ACBH to provide individual services to some youth who present mental health needs that are not addressed by the more general program. This will be determined based upon the initial mental health assessment as well as referrals related to newly identified needs. The level of service need will be driven by the youth's functional capacity or desire for greater wellness. Sex Offender Services Youth committed on charges related to sexual offenses will receive a comprehensive assessment provided by a clinician who has the requ isite skills to assess the needs of sexual offenders. These youth will participate in all other programming and receive sex offender programming individually or in a small group (if there are enough youth) with a licensed and trained therapist whose scope of practice includes youth who have committed sexual offenses. Importantly, the body of evidence consistently demonstrates that youth adjudicated for sexual offenses are psychologically and behaviorally distinct from adults convicted for similar charges. Namely, justice -involved youth demonstrating problematic sexual behaviors ( PSB) are, on average, remarkably similar to the general population of justice -involved youth (i.e., without Impact Justice: 23 Formatted: Header, Indent: Formatted: HeaderPSB) in terms of rehabilitative needs .39 Thus, they may be appropriately a nd effectively treated using non -PSB-specific methods.40 Nonetheless, there remains a limited proportion of this population who may benefit from PSB -specific treatment methods. For this group, the County will explore expanding its local capacity. In exploring an expansion of local capacity, the County intends to consider partnering with at least one community -based provider to coordinate and synchronize therapeutic methods for the purpose of ensuring consistency and continuity of service across the continuum of care (i.e., from the secure treatment facilities to less restrictive placements and through reentry). Indeed, research finds that community -based care is more effective than facility -based care in reducing recidivism among youth with PSB.41 While this may not be possible in some cases, the County embraces these findings in principle and will appropriately weigh these facts as it determines its programmatic strategies. Youth with Significant Mental Health Needs Youth with significant mental health needs may require both psychiatric and psychological treatment in order to be able to be included in the milieu. At a minimum , it will be necessary to ensure that there is a clinician with the requisite training in assessment, diagnosis , and treatme nt of individuals with significant mental health needs. This person will also have been trained or show significant supervision experience working with adolescents and young adults. Most ACBH clinicians are trained to assess, diagnose, develop treatment pl ans, and provide individual therapy for clients who meet this level of acuity. A Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who has experience serving such clients has already been hired as the mental health professional assigned to the unit. This individual w ill provid e joint services in the milieu , serving as the MH specialist for all youth and monitor ing for destabilization. In cases when youth need to be placed on an involuntary hold, they will be transferred to the crisis stabilization units at Willow Rock (< 18 years old) or John George (18 years+). Youth would return to the unit once stabilized. If youth are not stable enough to be on the unit because of their mental health, then ACBH will work with Probation, the Court partners, and Willow Rock or John George to identify other solutions to meet the youth's level of care (e.g., a hospital setting ). The vast majority of the youth who have been committed to DJJ over the last several years would not be categorized as youth with significant mental health needs who would require hospitalization. The main diagnoses provided by Guidance Clinic clinicians for youth committed to DJJ have been PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Most youth who have significan t mental 39 Chaffin, M. (2008).

Impact Justice: 24 -0.08\" Formatted: Headerhealth needs that severely impact their daily functioning have been identified while in detention and have been diverted to short -term residential therapeutic programs, the Regional Center, or to a locked treatment facility . Over the last 5 yea rs, less than 5 youth (< 18 years) have been conserved and transferred to a locked treatment facility. Since significant mental health needs doesn't necessarily mean significant risk, there should be language describing how these services will also be prov ided in alternative settings or in the community. Just to make it very clear that no youth will have to be committed to receive a service - but will be able to receive the service if committed. Family Interventions Given that the program is built on a res torative frame \u2014and mentioned previously \u2014it is likely that youth committed to the SB 823 program may have interest in healing relationships with their family of origin or partner. ACBH, in collaboration with ACPD, will contract family and couples therapy an d parenting services as requested by the young people in the program. The youth's primary therapist will not serve this dual role but will participate in assisting the youth in preparing for family sessions. Also for the remaining target population. Family Engagement Research in the field of family engagement has demonstrated the important role that family members play in supporting individuals while they are incarcerated. Specifically, having strong family ties during confinement is related to fewer violent incidents, as well as lower levels of stress and anxiety.42 Additionally, detained individuals who can stay connected with their family members are more likely to be successful after their release and less likely to be re - incarcerated.43 In addition to the engage st rategies described in this section, ACPD will also provide robust and diligent family finding services to help connect youth to fam ilial resources. This will help youth in the SYTF locate and develop connections, and will assist the remaining target popula tion to locate and develop both relationships and placement resources. Family engagement is about relationship building. As youth are learning skills around social engagement, boundaries, and emotion management , such relationships offer them the space to put those skills into use. Programming that focuses on RJ, identifying and restoring harm, and developing boundaries can be voluntarily practiced during family engagement opportunities. Consistent with this research, ACPD recognizes the importance of strong bonds with family and/or community support person(s) for youth's success. ACPD has already been providing resources and support for families, especially with regards to maintaining reg ular contact, and will continue to do so. As outlined in the Youth in Custody Practice (YICPM), ACPD will prioritize family engagement and family -focused strategies. ACPD will also use the broadest definition of family, biological and extended, as well as other important individuals involved in the youth's life such as romantic partners, friends, neighbors, mentors, coaches, and clergy. Following evidence -based practices, ACPD will consider the use of a Relational Inquiry Tool (RIT), which 42 Shanahan, R., & Agudelo, S. V. (201 2). The family and recidivism.

Commented [EP24]: QUES TION: -0.08\" Formatted: Headerallows individual s who are detained to work with staff in identifying their family resources. The use of a RIT has been shown to be particularly beneficial for building rapport and establishing trust between detained individuals and facility staff.44 Once the youth's famil y has been clearly defined and identified, ACPD will provide access through both formal and informal means and will work to remove all physical and economic barriers to ensure that these relationships are preserved. Youth and their families shall be offered formal and informal opportunities to provide input and plan family activities that occur on a regular basis. These activities may include opportunities for sharing family meals, recreational activities, and participation in community events. ACPD will also provide opportunities to practice engaged parenting for youth who have children. Some potential program options that could be explored include the Just Beginning \" Baby Elmo \" pProgram for those with younger children and the Parenting Inside Outsid e Program.45 Given the importance of family engagement, fostering family -oriented environments in confined facilities is crucial for youth's overall success during incarceration and after release. One program that has been successful at accomplishing this is known as Restoring Promise.46 Restoring Promise creates prison housing units designed for young adults and focuses on eliminating barriers to family connections. All Restoring Units hold family orientations where families can visit and see the facility and spaces where youth live. In some cases, families are also allowed to bring personal items, such as sheets and comforter sets and even stay to make the beds of their family members who are confined.47 This process is overseen by staff who are trained to facilitate visits and answer any questions families might have. Since ACPD already plans to train facility staff on the importance of family engagement and presenting a strength - based approach, consideration will be given to training for the facilitation of family visits using a similar approach. Relatedly, ACPD will ensure that any spaces identified for family engagement events, to the degree possible, mirror a home -based setting environment to provide a sense of normalcy that is grounded in dignity for y outh and their families.

Family Therapy Family therapy may not be appropriate for all youth and will not be the only mechanism to achieve increased family engagement. In a more comprehensive framework, family engagement and development of supportive relationships should be prioritized for youth. Most families won't want therapy ; instead, they will often seek opportunities to build effective 44 Shanahan, R., & Agudelo, S. V. (2012). The family and recidivism.

For this reason, it is critical that family engagement opportunities be co -created by the clinician unit staff, credible messengers, restorativ e justice facilitators , or other team members who can help in healing.48 Many of the youth in this program will emerge as adults who have choices about where and with whom they live and call family. Some families have been harmed by the youth and vice vers a, and thus a restorative justice model toward healing familial bonds is appropriate and necessary. One example that may be considered for reference as an adjunctive service for interested families is Anchored in Strength, which is a family support group b uilt around empowering families of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. Anchored in Strength provides an emotionally safe venue for families to draw on the strength of each other as they share their individual experiences while navigating their f amily members' involvement in the justice system.49 Core Programming: Building Core Competencies Identifying & Defining Core Competencies Program development Developing the therapeutic milieu requires a coordinated effort among all partners and shall include the development of a full daily and weekly program schedule that embraces the core concepts of the program. ACPD will partner with an expert consultant(s) to assist in developing, implementing , and ensuring the core program 's fidelity over the course of the first two years of implementation , at a minimum. This will include the design of a training program for staff and coaching and mentoring sessions for the milieu team. Guided by the latest positive youth development research \u2014as well as discussions with community partners (local CBO's, community members, system leaders, and social justice leaders ), and formerly and currently incarcerated youth and their families \u2014we have identified 20 core competencies necessary to support \"thriving.\" A s discussed further below, these competencies are success indicators, allowing the program to adequately measure youth progress, determine which types of programming should be offered, create staff training and accountability frameworks, and guide the desi gn of the environment. Additionally, thriving will be the key outcome that the youth's individual success plan and programming ultimately seek to achieve . This will be informed by the various mental health, risk/needs, and social emotional assessments; col lateral information from the youth's success team ( i.e., the individual youth and their family, Credible Messenger, clinician, JIO, educational partner, and relevant CBO partners ). Put in another way, every aspect of the Program should intentionally align to build these core competencies. Due to the broad nature of the core competencies, successful implementation of the Program will require a close partnership between local community -based organizations, the milieu staff (combination of Credible Messengers , clinician, and Probation staff), and youth development experts. This program aims to develop the following core competencies, in partnership with youth, staff, community partners, and their families (in no particular order) : 48 Ibid. 49 Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services.

When given multiple opportunities to explore themselves, youth are more likely to experience self -confidence, resiliency, and make positive choices. Similar to a typical college experience, self -exploration is best facilitated through exposure to multiple and new experiences, including the arts, music, books, articles, etc. The Program shall provide multiple opportunities for youth to engage in various activities, based on their interests, but also through exposure to new experiences, = that will push them out of their comfort zone, in a safe and structured setting. Examples include Ted Talks and engaging in new experiences (e.g., cooking , coding, etc. ). Develop and Understand Self within Community : Developing an understanding of self within the community requires defining community both as their immediate surroundings and relationships with peers, staff, and other trusted adults . Youth will also learn of the larger, broader communities they belong to based on geography, affinity, culture, and relationship s. Both of these framings of community are critical for youth to develop a sense of empathy for others and eventually move towards positive social action or change. Therefore, youth will understand how they fit in with in their immediate environment, and how their actions affect others . They will also be able to make sense of, and begin to transform, their social world. Youth shall explore their own and others' experiences with oppression and privilege to understand and change the underlying causes of social and historical processes that perpetuate problems that they face daily. Develop Sense of Agency : Youth perceive and have the ability to employ their assets and aspirations to make or influence their own decisions about their lives and set their own goals, as well as to act upon those decisions in order to achieve desired outcomes. A key ingredient to forming agency is first building self -efficacy, or the youth's belief that they are capable of changing their own conditions. Similar to above, agency is built through exposure to new Impact Justice: 28 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: Headeractivities, ideas, and social connections and pushing youth to move away from their comfort zones, while celebrating successes along the way. Agency also includes control over one's thoughts and emotions. As such, mindfulness techniques and practices shall be incorporated throughout critical programming aspects, along with fac ilitated programming. For example, morning circles will begin with mindfulness techniques, and ACPD will partner with experts to explicitly teach youth and staff about the most effective practices . See Yourself into the Future : One powerful protective factor against engaging in harmful behavior is feeling optimistic about the future. If young people feel helpless or hopeless when thinking about their lives, they are more likely to engage in short -term thinking and decision making. It should b e noted that rather than pathologizing youth who feel pessimistic about their futures, we should recognize that this is a common outcome of exposure to violence and serious harm and trauma. Helping youth develop a sense of optimism, an expansive view of their potential and options for the future, and self -efficacy should be reinforced through as many programs and policies as possible. Social Connectedness : Building skills for understanding and appreciati ng oneself, one's own culture, language, history, and contributions as well as appreciation for others, are essential components of positive youth development. These skills include self -discipline and decision - making; the ability to work and communicate with others; develop financial literacy; technological access and skills; parenting skills; empathy for others ; and the ability to solve problems without domination, retribution , or violence. Support Others : It is critical to give youth the opportunity to support others within their immediate envir onment, larger community, and families. ACPD is committed to partnering with the JJDPC to develop a program in which youth are paid for their work and contributions to maintaining the Facility. They will be given opportunities to financially contribute to their families or loved ones. This will help foster their sense of pride, empathy, and dignity. Being able to meaningfully contribute financially will also help mitigate any feelings of guilt for being locked up, particularly towards their families and lov ed ones. In partnership with ACPD, the JJDPC will immediately create a youth income plan, outlining the process in which youth can earn income during and after their incarceration . While the details of the plan ar e still in progress , youth shall be given t he opportunity to earn no less than $500 per mont h (this amount is aligned with cutting -edge research, stating that merely $500 per month can support agency and a reduction of stress and anxiety). Health -Wellbeing and Agency : Good health as well as knowledge, attitude , and behaviors ensure future health . This includ es access to trauma -informed physical, emotional, and mental health services and healing ; substance use services ; and nutrition, sports , and recreation services. Youth will also be given t he information and freedom to make healthy choices (health agency) regarding nutrition, participation in mindfulness, yoga, etc. Connection to Physical and Natural Environment : Skills for understanding and appreciating environmental health, justice , and su stainability also includes built environment, environmental racism , and access to housing and resources oriented toward personal wellbeing . This will require examination of the policies, laws , and regulations that impact one's healthy development as well a s access to and knowledge about green jobs, urban farming , and environmentally sustainable agricultural, housing , and urban development. Impact Justice: 29 Formatted: Header, Indent: -0.08\" Formatted: HeaderCognitive and Creative Competencies : Knowledge and ability to appreciate and participate in areas of healing -centered, creative expression will be fostered.

Social Justice & Civic Engagement : Youth will be offered opportunities to u nderstand and develop skills related to personal values, moral and ethical decision -making , and participation in efforts contributing to the greater good . This includes the right to speak out, organize to serve and change one's school, community and society (e.g., leadership pipelines, advisory groups, County commissions and board memberships ). Youth shall also be given opportunities to register to vote in local, state , and national elections. Youth shall be provided with election information if needed. Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee of the JJDPC The purpose of ACJJDP's Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee is to provide ACPD with critical information and perspectives from the Community to help inform current and pot ential program ming. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will work closely with community - based organizations, systems -impacted youth (current and former) and their fam ilies, and relevant justice stakeholder groups (i.e. AC Youth Council) , to gather critical information , expertise , and diverse perspectives, and make recommendations to support the Programming goals outlined in this document ; thereby further expanding ACPD's reach into the Community. In consultation with t he Chief of Probation and Presiding Judge of the Juvenile Court , the JJDPC shall immediately develop a programmatic advisory subcommittee to review programming and advise ACPD regarding a) requests for proposals to provide services to the target population or in connection with the Realignment Plan; b) proposals to provide services; c) proposed extensions, increases, or other substantive or durational amendments to contracts for services; and d) programming utilized (or proposed for use) by ACPD staff. The JJDPC Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee shall be made up of the JJDPC members and to the extent possible from this membership include a minimum of three community members as defined by Welfare and Institutions Code Section 1995(b), and at least one of those members must be a youth member who is 24 years of age or younger. The JJDPC Chair and the Chief of Probation shall develop a process for the Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee to receive, review, and advise the ACPD with respect to the items listed a nd any additional programmatic service items for which ACPD seeks advice or comment. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will review proposals and options for the items listed in the preceding paragraph and will advise ACPD and provide community perspe ctive on the applicants or proposed options. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will use the Core Competencies to make their assessments and recommendations. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will gather information from the community and directly impacted young people and families in order to develop its recommendations and work closely with other r elevant stakeholder and community -based groups and organizations .

Courses will also be offered covering; including civic engagement & responsibility education. All youth who are old enough will be given t he opportunity to pre -register/register to vote, with voting actively supported and encouraged by ACPD. Prior to each election, ACPD will ensure that youth are provided information on ballot issues by a non -partisan group such as the League of Women Voters . Programs will also be offered that are designed to teach about money management and investing with the opportunity to begin an investment portfolio while in facility, based upon funds earned in the program. Many systems have some form of a \"point or tok en\" economy for good behavior or achieving unit goals. This program will move beyond \"tokens for Takis,\" which reinforces compliance and short -term goals, instead focusing on helping youth invest and plan for the future. This also supports the youth in lea ving the program with the necessary financial resources to transition to community, acquire safe affordable housing, and meet their basic needs while seeking employment. Programs will also be offered on housing and home ownership. SB 823 Youth will also be provided financial awareness courses with the goal of teaching them budgeting and savings skills, as well as how to manage their credit ; build or rebuild credit scores ; and planning for taxes, benefits, and retirement. Currently Available Programming Within the framework of positive youth justice , Alameda County Probation is determined to provide services to encourage the continued growth and enrichment of youth committed to our program. In alignment with appropriate practices, the followin g services will be offered currently offering the following programs and services : Write to Read Program : The Alameda County Library is currently working to build out a robust complement of literacy services at both JJC and Camp Sweeney, which will include a combination of one -on-one literacy tutoring and small group instruction, with referrals from ACOE and facility staff. Library : The Alameda County Library operates full -service libraries at both JJC and Camp Sweeney. Youth at JJC visit the library once pe r week during free hours. Full -size collections are maintained with a vast array of reading materials at all reading levels. o The Alameda County Library also provides an array of programming for youth at both facilities that includes visits from popular aut hors throughout the year, book groups, creative writing classes, and STEAM programming during the summer and throughout the year. o The Alameda County Library at the Juvenile Justice Center provides a collection of books and reading materials that are cultu rally relevant, age appropriate, and in keeping with current trends. We refresh our collection throughout the year to ensure that the collection is consistently reflective of the cultures, languages, and experiences of the young people we serve. o The author s and programming that the Library offers throughout the year are culturally responsive and relevant to the lives of the young people who visit the library at JJC.

Reading and Homework Hour : Volunteers from the community come in and help youth work on their reading skills with the goal of improving the young people's academic abilities and forging meaningful relationships between the youth at Juvenile Hall and responsible adults. Mind Body Awareness Program : Mindfulness -based techniques are taught through meditation and yoga to the detained youth. The Beat Within : Creative writing workshops are conducted resulting in a magazine that features the work of the participating youth. Recreational Activities : ACPD intends to hire a recreational therapist to develop programming for individual and group activities. They will lead and instruct physical, social, and culturally relevant programs to encourage progress toward therapeutic goals. Within the framework of the milieu, Alameda County Probation is determined to provide services to encourage the continued growth and enrichment of youth committed to the SYTF. Currently available programming w ill be reviewed to determine whether and which core competencies each support. Each will be assessed to ensure that they fit within the new programming framework prior to being continued, or prior to receiving any new contract, contract extension, or other contract amendment that extends its substance or duration. All new program development shall be centered around development of the core competencies, and be submitted to the programmatic advisory subcommittee of the JJDPC described herein. In addition to reviewing all programming within the context of the core competencies ACPD will also ensure development of a program array that provides for and supports all of the core competencies described. ACPD will specifically provide the following programming whic h supports the core competencies but which is often overlooked or missing: LIST: ACPD recognizes the importance of providing a wide array of engaging and high -quality programming to ensure that youth are able to make progress toward their goals and are also provided with multiple opportunities to fill their time with prosocial activiti es. Given the relatively low anticipated population (<10) in the first year, ACPD will continue existing contracts for programs and services. For the immediate future, ACPD intends to replicate the TAY programs and Camp Sweeney contractors in the SB 823 p rogram and will continue to seek opportunities to partner with community -based organizations to fill any gaps in programming, as well as to provide additional opportunities for programming to meet any individual needs. Partnerships with Community -Based Organizations Community -based partnerships are essential and key to the success of this program model. ACPD plans to leverage existing and new contracts with a variety of community -based service providers to facilitate in -custody programs and services, as well as to provide services in the community during \"inside/outside\" and reentry phases. Alameda County Probation intends to partner with community -based organizations (CBOs) to provide a vast array of re -entry services including but not limited to case ma nagement, housing, mental health, systems navigation, substance use, education/vocation/college, employment, mentoring, and on -going cognitive behavioral treatment, as necessary.

Impact Justice: 32 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderAlameda County will incorporate structured decision -making based on a foundat ion rooted in Evidence -Based Practices (EBP), but also open to locally developed and other promising practices. While implementing EPBs for program development will be prioritized, it is important to point out that there is no standardized approach for wor king with all youth. Moreover, ACPD will identify locally developed programs that have offer indicators of success as part of its commitment to support the growth and work of its community partners. This is in line with ACPD's plan to implement a community capacity fund (CCF) grant program in order to build capacity amongst youth -serving organizations. Implementing locally promising or relevant programming that attends to the specific needs of the target population opens the opportunity for the creation of new EPBs that are more relevant for youth in the juvenile justice system. ACPD will also pursue the identification of other innovative programs within the community. For example, ACPD will partner with a Credible Messenger or a community provider to have a n emotional or therapeutically trained animal , such as a dog who will be available regularly according to a set schedule. Developing trust with animals helps build empathy, responsibility, and can be incredibly rewarding. Sharing responsibility for the ani mal ( e.g., feeding, walking, grooming, etc.) can help to build a larger sense of community , responsibility , and belonging. ACPD will also partner with CBOs to plan and \"host\" \u2014whether at the facility or in the community, as appropriate \u2014community events on a regular, hopefully monthly, basis. This event planning can also involve the youth themselves, not only on the \"theme\" or focus of the event, but also planning the logistics. Some examples of these events might include BBQs/cookouts; Town Halls for Civic Engagement; Resource Fairs; Cook Offs and other light - hearted \"competitions\"; Art Exhibits, including youth works and community artists; Musical events; etc. Input from the youth themselves, as well as from the Youth Council, will be taken into considerati on when planning the content and scheduling for these events. Income Developmentally Appropriate Scheduling It is widely accepted that delayed start times in education and other programming is preferable for adolescents. It is universally accepted that adolescents experience a biologically driven sleep delay.50 During this phase of development , adolescents exper ience a sleep -wake phase delay unrelated to social factors or circumstances. This change in sleep pattern does not correspond to a decreased need for sleep though, and early scheduling requirements thus contribute to sleep deprivation in adolescents. In a 2014 report, American Academy of Pediatrics referred to adolescent sleep deprivation as an epidemic and recommended a delay in school start times.51 Sleep deprivation is associated with a number of increased risks and poorer outcomes including increased dr ug use and risk -taking behaviors, depressive symptoms and higher prevalence of mood disorders, and a decrease in academic performance.52 In fact, given the essential relationship between sleep and human development, it has been postulated that sleep 50 Hagenaue r, M.

Those challenges are largely absent in this prog ramming environment, and thus sleep needs can be accommodated more readily. ACPD, in recognition of the importance of sleep and the delay in sleep onset and wakefulness, will develop programming and daily schedules to meet the sleep hygiene needs of youth. This will be routinely reassessed and include increased flexibility on weekends. ACPD will also consider and implement options to accommodate the needs of young people in its facility setup and provisioning \u2014 for example, ensuring young people are able to have lights for reading or other nightly activities, are offered sufficient darkness and quiet for sleeping, and meeting other such needs as they arise. The established daily schedule, or a sampling of weekly schedules, and any accommodations or modificati ons made to meet these needs will be reported to the subcommittee prior to the approval of the Annual Realignment Plan. Sample Core Programming Schedule This schedule is not intended to be proscriptive, but rather provide an illustration of the intent to provide a wide variety of tailored programming. Key features of this sample schedule include relatively later shower/personal hygiene time, plenty of personal time, varied weekend schedules, daily outside time, and significant time for family engagement. 53 Hagenauer, M.

That's just a notch above survival. If ACPD acknowledges that racism entrenched in the laws, policies, and practices of our society have contributed to these youth attending substandard schools and living in severely under -resourced, often v iolent communities, then and it will commit to contributing to repair these injustices by providing youth with equitable \u2014not just equal \u2014resources, knowledge, and experiences. Focus on High School Diplomas & Higher Education The ACOE and ACPD will continue existing agreements to include the development of educational curriculum as part of the treatment program to assist the youth in work toward earning a high school diploma and higher education degree completion . Credit recovery courses, in addition to regul ar course enrollment, will be offered to propel the youth to their proper grade level more quickly than in public school. Where appropriate and desired by the youth, ACOE will utilize dual enrollment in community college as a credit recovery strategy. This will allow youth to both recoup high school credits while also being exposed to a college learning environment which can both smooth a transition to higher education and also help avoid the feelings of frustration and embarrassment associated with being b ehind in school. Youth absent a high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) certification will be in school for a large portion of the day. The education program will comply with the State Education Code and County Board of Education policies and provide for annual evaluations of the education program offerings through existing evaluative processes, such as WASC and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). Students will be Attendees are provided quality educational programming that includes instructional strategies designed to respond to the different learning styles , present levels of academic performance, and different ages and levels of maturity . and abilities of students. Courses which are offered include, but are not limited to, instruction in English /Language Arts, Social Sciences, Physical Education, Science, Health, Mathematics, Fine Arts/Foreign Language, and Electives (including career educatio n). ACOE will consult with community partners and educators in order to ensure that students at all readi ng and math levels, including English Language Learners, have access to culturally relevant and age appropriate educational materials. Older youth who have already completed their GED or high school diploma will spend much of their day in workforce develop ment, continuing and higher education, and other programming areas. Every student should have an Individualized Learning, and Transition Plan (ILTP). Assessments for IEPs should be conducted as need ed. Students with existing IEP and 504 plans will have their plans implemented and an IEP meeting scheduled as soon as possible, and in accordance with state and federal timing guidelines. Students with in -progress evaluations will have their evaluations completed as soon as possible, a nd in accordance with state and federal timeline guidelines. ACOE will work with sending school districts to expedite the completion of in - progress evaluations while minimizing the burden of duplicative assessments on the student and family. Students will have the opportunity to provide feedback regarding education and other services they are receiving while in the SB 823 program. A clear and meaningful protocol for response to feedback will be developed.

Formatted: Font: (Default) HeaderThe initial cohort of students in the SB 823 program will likely be older than the average youth at JJC. It is important for older and TAY youth to feel empowered and have agency over their education and vocation paths (i.e., not infantilized or patronized). However, research also demonstrates that integrat ion and programming with other youth \u2014similar to them in age and social -emotional development \u2014is beneficial. Thus, learning environments will be integrated whenever possible, knowing that some individualization will likely be needed. The youth's input and p references will also be discussed during the MDT Meetings and included in the ILTP. If there are enough older students, regardless of SB 823 status, the ACPD will consider the creation of a cohort of older students with separate classes. This determination should be made by age or educational needs, not SB 823 status. While we're anticipating older youth in the first few years of the SB 823 program, it is important to create a program that is flexible and responsive to a range of ages and developmental and learning needs. After a few years, it is likely that the SB 823 program will include students with a wide range of ages. Older youth who have already completed their GED or high school diploma will spend much of their day in workforce development, continu ing and higher education, and other programming areas. The ACPD is strongly committed to making college available to high school graduates. The ACPD will bring in college -level courses that would be available to students who are not yet in a position to go out of the secure setting into the community, if feasible. Given the wide array of online courses available, the ACPD will provide internet access consistent with Title 15 and the Welfare & Institutions Code , necessary technology and equipment, and the opportunity to take advantage of online higher education options as soon in the SB 823 program as possible. We emphasize that many students may need foundational courses that may not be credit - bearing but are nonetheless essential to their success in coll ege. Thus, the ACPD will focus on these courses for those still in the secure setting. This will enable students to complete necessary foundational courses without incurring significant debt, which will greatly benefit their success. Eligible high school s tudents will also be given the opportunity to participate in dual enrollment in community colleges and vocational training. Dual enrollment is especially beneficial to youth, as those courses are free. ACPD will consider expansively college courses that ma y also promote wellness and self -care (e.g., yoga, meditative practices, etc). ACPD is also considering programs such as San Mateo's Project Change program, since such a program could be adapted and/or improved for local use. For both youth still in the s ecure setting and those in an inside/outside setting, ACPD will develop partnerships with community colleges . These institutions will offer transition support, enrollment services, academic advising, financial aid, etc. ACPD will also pursue partnerships with existi ng campus -based groups55 that are supporting formerly incarcerated students and will prioritiz e relationships with groups that ar e able to bring in programming and supports into the facility. Post-high school education be formally managed by an educational third party. Ideally, these services would be prov ided by Laney College's program serving youth with juvenile justice system experience Restoring Our Communities ( ROC ) at Laney Community College . This organization would be supported by ACOE and Probation. Exploration and planning for this partnership is already underway. ROC currently provides postsecondary services to students at the Alameda County Juvenile Hall through an established MOU with the Alameda County Office of Education. The intent is to expand this contract to include Alameda County Probation, and to expand the scope of services to serve all youth interested in and eligible for college programing, including DJJ Realignment youth. This expanded MOU between Laney College, Alameda County Pro bation, and Alameda County Office of Education creates the opportunity for 55 Examples of such groups include: Underground Scholars, ROC, Proj ect Rebound, RISE (Chabot Community College) Commented [EP31]: QUESTION: Does this refe r to students having access to educational resources available on computers/ internet under AB 2448 and SB 11 pt Commented [EP32]: Is there a discussion somewhere about how youth engaged in higher ed in the SYTF will access college -based disability services?

The MOU process will allow for the key stakeholders: Laney College, ACOE, and Alameda Probation, to create the additional logistics needed to expand their already existing college program model. The goal of the program par tnership with ROC is to provide postsecondary pathways that a) prepare youth for a variety of career and technical pathways; b) allow students to build and maintain positive connections to the community; and c) serve as a framework for community re - integra tion. Alameda's program model is considered a best practice and provides services that meet several key recommendations for model programs, including: It provides postsecondary programming for juvenile justice students with a multidisciplinary, multi stakeholder team for as required for success. Every stakeholder has an essential role to play. The key stakeholders include: Identified local community college (Laney College); Probation; County Office of Education; additional can include public defender's office, a community based organization, social services The community college is the lead organization and includes a liais on/program lead to organize the college services and serve as a conduit between the juvenile hall, multi stakeholders, the students, and the college. The college course offerings include UC/CSU transferable courses and potentially Career and Technical edu cation courses for credit. Dual Enrollment programing can be included in the college course offerings to enable students without a diploma the opportunity to receive both high school and college courses concurrently. Students can receive wrap around suppor t services to ensure success: tutoring, support with enrollment, access to and guidance for financial aid, academic advising through college counselors. Transition plans are developed for re -entry support to the college campus upon release; as an alternati ve placement; as an option for early release; or as an option for furlough to come to campus to engage in college preparation or take college courses. Recognizing that higher educational opportunities will be extremely limited for those still in the secure setting, ACPD will provide the supports and resources needed for students to \"step - down\" and move into an inside/outside setting as quickly as possible. We recognize that this decision is ultimately made by the Court . However, the MDT and assigned D PO will keep this goal in mind and will provide the Court with detailed updates that would be sufficient for the Court to make informed and timely decisions in the best interest of the youth. Vocational Training Vocational Program training will be expande d through community partnerships with local colleges \u2014ideally , coordinated by ROC. The mission of these vocational programs will be to create meaningful, living wage career pathways and provide opportunities for in -person apprenticeships and employment outs ide of Juvenile Hall. Direct linkage to job and apprenticeship opportunities will better prepare youth for success upon their release as these opportunities will allow SB 823 youth to gain valuable work experience, build references, Font: (Default) Paragraph, Outline numbered + Level: 1 + Numbering Style: Bullet + Aligned Formatted: Headerdevelop professional ne tworks, and open a savings account. ACPD will explore collaborative opportunities with local unions56 who will be able to provide training and apprenticeships for which youth will be eligible. For those youth who are interested in vocational training outsi de of union trades, efforts will be made to connect them with a vocational mentor working in their desired field. ACPD will pay initial union dues for those youth who successfully complete union - trade related programs. ACPD will also purchase the first set of tools and supplies for graduates. These supports both remove potential economic barriers to accessing the careers of their choice, and also helps to set youth up for success in their chosen field. ACPD also recognizes the importance of youth exploring different fields of work and developing a passion for a career of their choice . Therefore , ACPD will actively engage SB 823 youth and provide youth with career aptitude and assessment tests in order to explore their skills and interests. Based on these ass essments and discussions will be provided access to a direct linkage to training in that field in the community. Access to facilities that enable hands -on learning (e.g. , auto repair shops, commercial kitchens, computer labs, etc.) will also be provided. A focus on employment for our youth must elicit and develop their strengths and skills, be meaningful, and assist in the selection of a field that can promote sustainability. Work that is offered will be structured and closely monitored, and will not interf ere with other important adolescent development activities. Currently at Camp Wilmont Sweeney , workforce development programs create employment and educational pathways for sustainable careers. On-campus programs , such as Multi -Core Craft Curriculum (MC3) and Google Technology Certification courses , will allow youth to develop the skills and obtain the certifications needed to obtain employment. Other vocational training programs will be explored and pursued as well \u2014 including, but not limited to , coding and technology -related certifications, real estate licensing, etc. These programs will be available for SB 823 youth at JJC and will work to create a direct connection between training & actual jobs. Throughout the entire process, ACPD will continue to offer innovative programs with demonstrated success, such as Raising Leaders workshops for SB 823 youth, which are already in progress, and will explore the expansion of the program as well. ACPD also recognizes that when SB 823 youth obtain jobs, they may face barriers getting to and from work (once they are back in their communities). ACPD will therefore explore opportunities for SB 823 youth to obtain their driver's license or CA ID while they are in custody. Other Academic Supports and Normative Academi c Experiences An important aspect of any educational program is the opportunity to engage in developmentally appropriate activities that develop a sense of community, leadership and social skills, artistic expression, cultural identity, and self. ACOE a nd probation will work with community partners, students, and families to regularly assess the availability, quality, and accessibility of these activities. Hence, ACOE and Probation will work with community partners, students, and families to identify ac ademic supports and extracurricular activities that are responsive to students' interests and will support continued academic and community engagement. Examples of such 56 Such as: SEIU 1021, UA Local 342, Plumbers & Pipefitters Carpenters Local Union 713, and LiUNA Laborers Local 304 Commented [EP34]: A way to link this section to other portions of the plan might be 1) to involve the recreational therapist in developing this plan and helping to provide/ coo rdinate access 2) tie extracurricular activities to promotion of adolescent development.

ACOE and Probation will also work with community partners, students, and families to ensure that families and supportive adults have opportunities to engage with and support their students in their educational progress. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to, graduation ceremonies, open houses, college nights, and performance opportunities for extracurriculars. In planning for the above extracurriculars and com munity events, ACOE and Probation will consider both in -person and virtual opportunities for youth and family engagement, depending on the availability, quality, and accessibility of programming and how that interacts with youth and family circumstances, f or instance, providing virtual opportunities for family members to attend events if there are family members who live in another state or country and cannot participate otherwise, or allowing a youth in a creative writing program to submit an entry to a poetry slam that is being held online. Reentry Planning, Coordination, & Services Background Determining how to support youth returning from a period of confinement requires understanding the harm confinement inflicts upon a young person during a crucial period of their development.57 The disconnection from one's family, friends, and community impairs the potential for successful reentry.58 For young people, these challenges are complicated by the already trying transition from adolescence to adult hood.59 Reentry interventions that center adolescent development are effective in reducing recidivism and ensuring long -term success, particularly when they involve the family in treatment and target higher -risk youth.60 To ensure better reentry outcomes a s they transition from confinement to their communities, the county's reentry support system will tap into the strengths, assets, and aspirations of justice - involved youth and their support systems, and combine targeted programs and services to address the immediate needs of youth returning to their communities. Some of these needs include, but are not limited to : housing ; employment ; education ; substance abuse ; physical and 57 De Nike, M., Shelden, R., Macallair, D., & Menart, R. (2019).

Programming To improve the odds of success for youth reentering their communities, the County, related agencies, and community will begin to plan for what a youth needs to be successful in their reentry process when they first enter the juvenile justice system. Coordination and collaboration between agencies and across services and supports are necessary at multiple phases of a youth's confinement.61 The reentry services and supports youth need to succeed will be tailored, high quality, a nd provided in the least restrictive environment possible.62 Youth in confinement show significantly lower levels of psychosocial maturity (responsibility, perspective, and short - term decline in temperance). As a result, confined youth have lower levels of educational and employment attainment in young adulthood compared to all other youth.63 As these are critical components to successful reentry, ACPD will ensure programming allows youth to build psychosocial maturity skills through activities that mirror typical adolescent responsibilities, behaviors, and tasks. Incorporating a reentry perspective in all aspects of facility programming and operations can help minimize the harmful effects of removal and increase the likelihood of sustainable and successful reintegration of youth back into the community.64 Probation will keep the following concepts in mind to help guide their practices. First, in the immediate term, the Juvenile Hall (JJC) is a vital part of the reentry process.65 Thus, ACPD will purposefull y and clearly articulate the goals of preparing youth to become contributing members of their community upon their return. Consistent with that mission, every aspect of confinement programs should be designed and evaluated through the lens of how well they meet that goal. This will require, where needed, changing the focus of institution programs and policies from simply managing youth inside the facility to promoting skills that lead to successful reentry. Phased Approach ACPD will employ a phased approach to programming in order to respond to the changing needs of youth throughout the duration of their time in custody. Once ordered into the SB 823 program by the Court, Phase 1 (Orientation) begins. This phase is not intend ed to last more than 30 days and primarily consists of convening the MDT, orientation to the Secure Treatment Facility, and administering any additional assessments that may be needed to ensure proper programming is available and assigned. According to Wel fare and Institutions Code 875(d), within 30 days of making an order to commit a youth to a secure placement treatment facility 61 Clark, H.

The IRP must be submitted to the court by the probation department and any other agencies or individuals the court deems necessary for the development of the plan. The MDT and Success Team will be primarily responsible for the development of the IRP. Prior to submission to the Court, the IRP will undergo a quality control mechanism to ensure it is compliant with WIC 875(d) and is reflective of additional parameters set forth by this Plan . Note that reentry planning should also begin immediately. Once Phase 1 Orientation is complete, the youth will move into Phase 2 \u2014where the bulk of programming, education, training, and skill and relationship building will take place. Phase 2 will also include a reward/sanction system that rewards good behavior , disincentivizes poor behavior , and allows for increases in freedom and privileges over time. As noted above, this reward/sanction system should be less focused on short -term rewards and behavior management and should instead be oriented toward long -term goals. During this Phase, close attention will be paid to ensure that the \"least restrictive environment\" is used to engage youth and provide services. Phase 2 will include regular contact with the community, both \"inside\" (through Credible Messengers and other community -based staff who will provide programming within the facility ) and also through utilizing a step -down approach that will incorporate an inside/outside component. This will allow for community integration and \"normalizing\" the process of undoing institutionalization , early on . As noted above, ACPD recognizes that progression of an inside/outside program will depend on youth success within the program and the Court 's decisions . However, ACPD will clearly articulate the goal of \"step -down\" and will pr ovide the Court with the information it needs to make informed, timely decisions. Phase 3 involves Community Reintegration, and ideally will begin between 6 and 9 months before anticipated release. One of the current challenges facing reentry is that the exact date of reentry is often unknown until the Court sets the final baseline term of confinement or step -down date within the secure track. These decisions will generally take place at progress review hearings. In order to ensure youth have the smoothest transition and greatest access to reentry support, planning will begin no later than 9 months prior to the initial baseline date set for release, and adjusted to be earlier as soon as it becomes apparent that release will be earlier. To help address some of these challenged, ACPD will ensure that Community Reintegration planning, services, and programming begins well before any anticipated release. Discussed in further detail below, this phase will include access to education, vocational training, and employment outside of the facility. The Re entry Service Coordinator \u2014ideally from a CBO \u2014will be assigned during this time, as well as a community -based Credible Messenger who will continue to mentor the youth throughout their reentry journey, including post release. These individuals will also begin attending the MDT meetings. Ideally , these supports will continue throughout the duration of their community supervision. Reentry Case Management ACPD will also ensure that transitions for youth into and out of reentry programs are as seamless as possibl e. Efforts to redirect youth are more likely to succeed when youth are offered consistent expectations, services, and support as they move into, through, and out of confinement facilities.66 In an effort to minimize the possible confusion youth and their f amilies 66 McCarthy, P., Schiraldi, V.

Successful case managers are culturally sensitive and come from similar backgrounds and experiences as reentering youth. These attributes help to foster a closer relationship between the reentering individual and their support system ,68 and achieves positive youth development outcomes in the long term.69 ACPD shall contract with a third -party non -profit that will provide a reentry case manager, who will be primarily responsible for coordinating the reentry plan for the youth. San Francisco's Juvenile Collaborative Reentry Unit (JCRU) can serve as an example for seamless transition. The Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (CJCJ) participates in the JCRU, which comprises the Probation Department, court, Public Defender's Office, and CJCJ. Reentry planning begins upon disposition, incorporating the young person and family members in every decision along the way, and blending together service plans from all participating agencies. When the youth reenters the community, there is a coordinated and comprehensive plan in place. CJCJ delivers most of these supports directly, but also brokers access to outside programs that correspond to the youth's needs, strengths, and interests.70 ACPD and the Public Defender's office already have a n existing collaboration with many of these practices in place, however further coordination with the Court and the Case Manager would be a significant benefit to the youth. Addressing Basic Needs Upon Release Many youth with justice involvement have few, if any, financial resources and may not have family members that they can rely on for food and shelter. These young people cannot afford to volunteer, take unpaid internships, or engage in some of the job -search behavior s that are available to more privileged young people. Involving youth with justice involvement in paid work, service, or other employment related activity as soon as possible is key to success. Examples of successful approaches include wage -subsidized inte rnships, stipends for community service, and transitional jobs, which are time -limited subsidized work experiences that help establish a work history and develop skills to access unsubsidized employment.71 In partnership with the County, ACPD will expand t he use of subsidized employment programs and paid internships to help bridge the unemployment gap that many youth face upon release. ACPD will prioritize under -resourced areas of the County \u2014particularly , South County. Ideally , all youth would have access t o these opportunities well before their release. ACPD will utilize the existing innovative Transition Center and expand services to ensure that youth \u2014and the families they are returning to, where applicable \u2014are connected to resources they are eligible for . These resources are not limited to housing, (including , Section 8 ) and other forms of public assistance (including SNAP, Medi -Cal, etc. ).

Thus, ACPD will offer assistance in preparing vital documents (e.g., Social Security Card, original birth certificate , CA ID &/or Driver's License) , SSI (needs to start while in custody), and voter registration (if changing address, etc. ). It should be noted that some of these resources can be accessed prior to release, while some ( e.g., public assistance ) must be access ed after release. The Transition Center and its services will remain available to youth (and their families where appropriate) post -release. Through the Transition Center, ACPD will develop an MOU with the Department of Social Services to ensure that youth and their families are maximizing their social service benefits. ACPD re -entry staff will be connected to the Alameda County Probation Department's Transition Center \u2014 a collaboration of partners, who stand in alignment with our mission to support and restore communities. Alameda County Probation recognizes that engaging in the justice system can be emotionally difficult for those involved. As such, we place emphasis on a family -focused and trauma -informed process. The Transition Center empowers youth, fa milies, and their caregivers by removing barriers to success and connecting them to supportive resources and healthy alternatives in the community. The Transition Center, with the Probation Department as the lead agency, works in partnership with Alameda C ounty Office of Education, the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities, Oakland Unified School District, Oakland Unite, Alameda County Behavioral Health, and Alameda County Public Health. The Transition Center is equipped with two confidential conferenc e rooms furnished with computers, telephones, and current community resources and events. Alameda County Probation has committed to addressing all the stabilizing needs of a family and is prepared to provide concrete services such as transportation , food vouchers , relocation supports, clothing, school supplies, and household items. ACPD also recognizes that the stigma of a criminal record may follow the youth during and after re -entry, and may present a significant barrier to successful reentry. Thus, ACP D commits to training re -entry staff in the procedures required to seal records according to Welfare and Institution Code 781. Re -entry staff will relay such information to the youth and their families during and throughout Phase 3 while the youth prepare to transition back to the community. Continuity of Care The Reentry Case Manager will coordinate with various agencies, departments, and community -based organizations to ensure that smooth continuity is ensured without interruption in physical and mental h ealth , as well education , services . The Reentry Case Manager will ensure that warm handoffs and transportation occur \u2014not just passive referrals to services. Any medications currently prescribed will be filled prior to release. The amount of medication provided will be determined by the prescribing physician, who will be informed of the transition to release. Ideally 30 days or more of medication will be provided. In the case that this is not indicated by the prescribing physician due to safety or health considerations, transportation to and from necessary appointments and the appropriate pharmacy will be provided . Education For youth still pursuing their high school diploma, ACOE and ACPD will coordinate to ensure youth are enrol led in a school or program that will meet their goal of a HS diploma. The Reentry Case Manager will ensure that this coordination is taking place, as well as involving parents and ensuring that a warm handoff is provided. The Reentry Case Manager will leve rage resources needed to foster a successful transition, including transportation support, school supplies , uniforms, etc. ACOE will ensure that all needed transcripts and other student records are provided and given to the school or program, including an y prior transcripts from other districts.

ACOE will collaborate with K -12 schools to develop 30 - Day Change of Placement IEPs when enrolling students. For youth who are pursuing higher education, ACPD will coordina te with the community -based Community College services provider (ROC) in much the same way. ACOE and ACPD will ensure that all transcripts and other student records are given to the student or Educational Rights Holder. Transcripts and other student record s will also be released to schools enrolling students in K -12 programs. The Reentry Case Manager will assist in this coordination and make sure that a warm handoff is provided. For students with IEPs who are graduating High School, ACOE will complete an E xit IEP outlining accommodations needed to continue vital educational and learning supports in higher education. An exit IEP will outline the supports and/or accommodations that a student will need to succeed in Higher Education. Community -based Community College services provider (ROC) will support with any additional referrals, including with Student Disability Services needed on campus. For youth attending college outside of Alameda County, the Reentry Case Manager will support the youth in enrolling, as well research ing, identify ing, and connect ing students with services at the appropriate institutions. Family Programs need to find ways to engage these support systems as part of an overall case plan in which everyone is working together toward the same goals. To help achieve these goals , Probation will develop individualized plans and programs and refrain from one -size-fits-all approach to policies, programs, and practices within the JJC. Youth will be regularly consulted regarding who they want included in their \"family\" group to ensure that positive, trusted adult relationships are encouraged and supported. Family members under the age of 18, especially children of the youth themselves, will be allowed to visit as well. As previously mentioned, ACPD wil l use the broadest definition of family, to includ e biological and extended family, as well as other important individuals involved in the youth's life such as romantic partners, friends, neighbors, mentors, coaches, and clergy. Additional Considerations f or Reentering TAY The multiple challenges faced by transitional -aged youth can present barriers to meeting normative developmental milestones of this age (e.g., vocational and educational success, development of stable relationships, and maturation into productive adults ). Transitional -aged youth (TAY) also have the highest level of mental health problems compared to non -transitional - aged youth in the juvenile justice syste m, and serious mental illnesses often emerge during these years as well.72 However, perhaps even more importantly, reentering TAY will most likely be experiencing overlapping and compounding stressors related not only to this often -difficult developmental stage, but also of reentry (after having spent much of their adolescence in custody ). While we know this to be true from existing research, this was also clearly reflected in the focus group with young men who were previously held at DJJ. They discussed th e shock, anxiety, and stress of release , even though it was something they were eager for . The County will, thus, provide adequate supports for reentering youth , ensur ing that planning includes provisions for mental health transitions from juvenile -to-adult systems of care. ACPD will 72 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. (2012). Comparing and evaluating youth substance use estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and other surveys.

Impact Justice: 45 -0.08\" Formatted: Headercoordinate with Credible Messengers to provide the necessary programming TAY youth need to address these unique barriers. Options for Step -Down In addition to a continuum -of-care process, transitional or step -down programming in a secure setting will also plays a critical role in the reentry process.73 The decision as to when to transfer youth to a less restrictive facility will depend less on benchmarks or milestones achieved by a given young person, and will instead be depend ent on where an individual is more likely to receive the services most tailored to their needs.74 In fact and as previously mentioned , youth are most likely to succeed when they receive high -quality, tailored services in the least restrictive environments possible.75 We recognize that the decision to allow a step -down relies on the Court, which must also consider public safety. ACPD will strive to ensure step -down programs are individualized and involve a number of options that are geographical ly spaced throughout the County. While in a transitional or step -down program, youth will be immersed in a therapeutic community that prepares them for their reentry. Treatment exercises in the step -down program should mimic as much as possible the challe nges that youth will face in the outside world. The program exercises become a dress rehearsal for reentering youth so that they can role -play new skills before reintegrating into their community. Potential facilities that may serve as appropriate step - down options are discussed in more detail below. Data & Evaluation Plans Programmatic administrative data will be collected for each program offered to the SB 823 realigned youth. Each program must c apture basic demographic and participation data, as well as outcome measures tied explicitly to the Core Competencies supported by the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data are acceptable. The intention is not to create undue burdens on program s taff, but to document progress and the impact of the program \u2014which is essential to program development and improvement. This data will be reviewed regularly by program and ACPD staff to ensure programs are meeting their intended goals. Importantly, ACPD's program evaluations processes will be transparent and accessible to the general public. Program evaluations will be regularly submitted to the JJDPC Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee to help inform their recommendations. ACPD will implement a data -driven accountability framework as part of its program evaluation process. This framework will support Alameda in its efforts to move toward data -driven strategies that use evidence to evaluate program outcomes, impacts, and/or cost effectiveness. ACPD will also use performance data by working with contractors to monitor progress in its contracted activities. Ultimately, these strategies will produce better outcomes for youth while also supporting cost efficiency efforts. 73 Fretz, R. (2005).

Impact Justice: 46 Formatted: HeaderAt the same time, ACPD recognizes that the re are limitations in using existing evaluation frameworks . Particularly, these frameworks are mostly quantitative and do not always take an equity lens into account . In response to this, ACPD will include the use of qualitative data that incorporat es youth voice s as part of its program evaluation process. When youth are not progressing in a program as expected, system leaders may conclude that youth are either not compliant, or not progressing in treatment . However, it is also possible that youth have not received individualized services. ACPD will thus facilitat e focus groups, administer feedback surveys, and/or set up suggestion boxes. This process will help inform the development of future programs as well as whether any modifications need to be made as programs are being implemented. To define youth success in the program, ACPD will move beyond outcomes that are traditionally analyzed in correctional settings ( e.g., recidivism ) and will instead examine other indicators of youth success . Some proposed ou tcomes to evaluate include youth mental and physical well- being , self -efficacy, optimism for the future, critical consciousness, and socio -emotional development. ACPD will seek to conduct thorough process and outcome evaluations of the SB 823 program on a regular basis. These types of larger evaluations typically take several years to complete and often occur every 3 -5 years. Such evaluations will be timed to be able to inform large -scale decision making . Evaluation results will also be made transparent and available to the public through reports to the JJCC. Facilities: Immediate, Intermediate, & Long -Term Plans Overview & Background Research indicates that youth's perceptions of an institutional environment have important implications fo r their future success. Specifically, positive perceptions within and across dimensions of the juvenile setting reduce the likelihood of future antisocial activity, rearrest, or a return to a facility.76 The facility environment and public safety are inher ently connected. In line with this research, ACPD is committed to providing as homelike an environment as possible, designed to allow developmentally appropriate normative behavior and daily life. Mentioned above, ACPD recognizes the key role that family, friends, and community play in positive youth development and will seek to allow outside community and family involvement to the greatest extent possible. Thus, both the physical facility \u2014as well as the policies implemented within \u2014will promote positive dev elopment and dignity, physical , and psychological safety. ACPD recognizes that the current facility (discussed in more detail below) places some limitations on these goals , but remains committed to pursuing them as future secure and step -down placement fac ilities are explored and developed. The SB 823 program will serve older adolescents and young adults (based on anticipated average age) . These youth may be living in SB 823 program for several years and shall require 76 Schubert, C. A., Mulvey, E. P., Loughran, T. A., & Losoya, S. H. (2012). Perceptions of institutiona l experience and community outcomes for serious adolescent offenders.

The staff and providers leave each day and return , but the youth do not have such privileges . ACPD will explore all environmental options to ensure that youth have access to: Rooms for sleeping and relaxing that provide some level of privacy and autonomy. Leisure recreation both indoor and outdoor that is not solely adjacent to their sleeping environment Kitchen space for youth meal preparation and family -style eating . (College campuses have purposely designed t hese elements into their student living environments. ) Appropriately designed space for family engagement. This needs to include child appropriate spaces with related developmentally appropriate activities. Eradication of Inhumane and Re-Traumatizing Practices Restoration cannot exist alongside harm or fear of harm. This milieu shall serve as a nurturing social environment and thus cannot include the tools of degradation and control that create physically and psychologically unsafe environments and have proven to contribute to increased mental health symptomatology and trauma. ACPD shall commit to eliminate these practices in this milieu. Camp Sweeney ACPD has already eliminated the use of pepper spray and has included that in the policy. ACPD shall utilize the same policy to eliminate the use of pepper spray on the SB 823 program. Isolation and room confinement is non -existent at Camp Sweeney , and all available alternatives to these practices shall be explored for the SB 823 program. Several programs throughout the country may serve as models for the elimination of such practices.77 Clothing, and personal items of comfort will not be used as rewards or sanctions. All youth will have access to \"civilian\" clothe s, and ACPD will coordinate with the JJDPC and youth council to develop a plan to work toward allowing youth to wear their own clothes. There may be a dress code related to security and community standards, but there will not be a set uniform. Youth who en ter the program without sufficient clothing will be provided an initial wardrobe that they work to select with staff. While budget limits may provide a necessary constraint, the intent is to allow youth as much personal expression and freedom as possible. Minimum clothing requirements set by the BSCC will be reviewed by the JJDPC and youth council during the first year of implementation to ensure that ACPD policies meet or exceed these regulations. The intent is to promote both agency and personal dignity a mong youth. Given that SB 823 realigned youth will most likely be incarcerated for longer periods of time than other youth at the JJC, personal items are especially important in order to promote a homelike environment. Allowable personal items \u2014both in the individual rooms and within the unit\u2014will be examined with the goal of expanding the policy as broadly as possible. Culturally relevant p ersonal items such as toiletries and hygiene products will be provided to all youth, regardless of Phase or level of p rivilege. These items will not be restricted by sanction in any way. In addition to toiletries, youth will also be allowed a photo album in which to keep photos beyond those immediately displayed. A small bookcase or other storage option will be provided in each individual room to store books and other personal items. Art supplies and writing supplies will be made available. A cabinet, closet, or locker that youth can lock will be provided 77 Resources related to this may be found at: https://www.stopsolitaryforkids.org/. Impact Justice: 48 -0.08\" Formatted: Headerfor each youth somewhere in the unit. Staff may have keys or access codes, but youth will utilize locks to promote a sense of independence and agency. Food is not only a matter of proper nutrition, quantity, and quality but represents an important connection to human self -worth and dignity. Food is central to cultural exp ressions and offers a sense of familiarity, comfort, and home. Meal planning and preparation provide important opportunit ies to connect with other tradition s and people. Families will be allowed to bring \"outside\" food to all family engagement activities a nd times (whether brought from a restaurant or vendor or prepared at home). Finally, sleep is particularly important (and is easily disrupted) for adolescents and young adults , as noted earlier. The ability to feel safe and relaxed while sleeping is essen tial for healing and rest both physically and emotionally . While some lighting is necessary for safety of both youth and staff, proper darkness is needed for proper sleep. Thus, sleeping masks will be provided for all youth. Similarly , access to lighting f or evening reading and other activities will be provided. Compliance with Federal and State Laws that Protect People with Disabilities Alameda County Probation will maintain full compliance with the various federal and state laws that protect people with disabilities (e.g., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and 2008, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), etc. ) to ensure protection for youth with disabilities . Our compliance will achieve the following: Ensure youth with disabilities receive and are able to use the same services and types of care, as all other youth within the facility. Ensure youth with disabilities are not harassed and/or d iscriminated against. Ensure youth with disabilities are provided with accommodations needed for equal access to programs and services. Ensure supporting aids and services are available for youth with disabilities. Ensure all structural barriers are remove d. As part of the standard admittance process and in accordance with Title 15 regulations, youth will be screened by the appropriate staff ( i.e., medical, mental health, dental, educational , etc. ) to determine if they have a physical, mental, or intellect ual disability. Alameda County staff have and will continue to receive training to assist youth with disabilities and will make available a mechanism for referrals and evaluations. Immediate Plan for Facilities In the immediate future, ACPD intends to uti lize Unit 3 at its existing Juvenile Justice Center (JJC), while exploring other options for long -term commitments. ACPD recognizes that it is not in the youth 's best interest to remain in this type of secure setting for a long period of time and acknowled ges that the JJC was not built with long -term commitments in mind. However, it is also true that the process to design and build any new facility or campus will likely take many years. Thus, ACPD will consider and outlin e all other existing possible option s that could serve as a temporary Secure Placement Treatment Facility while longer -term solutions are being developed. Impact Justice: 49 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: Formatted: HeaderIn the meantime, ACPD is committed to transforming the space where youth will be housed to ensure the most therapeutic environment possi ble is immediately available. ACPD will make basic improvements to the unit, including but not limited to installing new furniture, upgrading the paint, and ensuring quality food services. The space will also be filled with images and signs that have posit ive affirmations and messages, culturally relevant images, artwork, historical figures, etc. There is already wi -fi installed, which allows the youth to have access to wireless tablets with both educational and age -appropriate entertainment content. All ro oms have chalkboards and chalk to allow for personalization and self -expression within the youth's personal spaces. The ACPD will also review policies to ensure they are truly supporting as homelike an environment as possible and are responsive to the need s of youth who will be in custody for several years. ACPD will prioritize reviewing policies that directly impact the youth 's daily lives, such as being able to wear their own clothes, allowing families to bring in food during visits, and reviewing and expanding the personal items that are allowed. ACPD will ensure there is a space within the unit intended for private, personal \"cool -down\" or self-regulation time. These spaces are often furnished with dimmable lighting, bean bag chairs and other soft furniture , writing and drawing supplies, aromatherapy, squeezable stress balls, etc. Spaces such as these have shown success in school environments and have shown promise in juvenile correctional settings (e.g., Sacramento County 's successful de-escalation room ).78 As part of this process, ACPD has also hired Dr. Monique Khumalo as a consultant to help flesh out the immediate plans to further soften Unit 3 and offer additional input and recommendations for renovations that might be made in a sh ort period of time. Dr. Khumalo brings experience in providing technical assistance as it relates to the impact of trauma to child -serving systems, including juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and behavioral health. DIn order to meet the immediate day-to-day needs of young people d uring this process, ACPD will adapt the current juvenile hall facility to create the most homelike environment possible in the facility. ACPD shall make alterations and adjustments to allow for, create, and implement the following: ACPD shall explore making alterations and adjustments to allow for/create the following : o Kitchen Access , or micro kitchen access o New, more homelike furniture o Mini basketball hoop o Convert one of the cells into a recording studio/mobile/DJ equipment o o Mood lighting throughout (e.g., ceiling panels that mimic the starry night ) o Gym enhancement o Carpeting and rugs in the interim o Outdoor space (increased space) space to eat, hangout, and exercise outside , as well as regular acce ss to a garden space o Remov al of all possible caging, bars, locks, and barriers that are not required for licensing or mandated by reg ulation s o Open as much of the space as possible to create less confinement and more free flow o Multiple sitting areas for do wn time multiple TVs for group viewing 78 Udesky, L.

Relevant updates and progress will be reported to the Subcommittee as often as it convenes. Intermediate Plan for Facilities As part of the effort to explore existing potential alternatives to the JJC, ACPD will review the possibility of using Camp Sweeney as a Secure Treatment Facility while long -term planning is taking place. Similarly, ACPD will explore and outline the possibility of using Camp Sweeney as a possible \"step -down\" facility. Guiding this process is ACPD's belief that youth should only be housed in a secure facility for the shortest time needed. ACPD will also begin a concurrent process of planning for the long term needs of the Department, includ ing, but not limited to, the needs of the SB 823 realigned youth. The ACPD prioritizes beginning this work immediately . They are clear in their belief that the current facility is not satisfactory, and they have no intention to \"coast\" and use the JJC inde finitely. As a part of this process, the ACPD will explore how to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of a Secure Placement Treatment Facility while holding to the principles, values, and research underlying the ideal of a homelike, therapeutic envi ronment. In exploring the feasibility of using the Camp, t he following issues will be addressed throughout this process : o Examine the feasibility of adding a secure perimeter . o Determining whether SB 823 secure living/programming spaces need to be at all separated from the existing camp population . o Determine whether existing Camp facilities can be utilized or repurposed or whether it is needed to build additional separate facilities . o Costs/ projected costs of necessary changes . o Explore whether the Camp co uld be used as a step -down facility. Formatted: -0.08\" Formatted: HeaderUpdates on information gathered, findings, and analyses will be reported to the SB 823 Subcommittee. It is expected that ACPD will complete a full assessment of the possibility of using Camp Sweeney as a Secure Treatmen t Facility and as a potential option for a step -down facility during the first year of implementation of this plan. ACPD will also continue to explore other existing facilities and options that may be possible for secure track use, including any regional or out -of-county facilities that may be considered. Updates on these efforts will also be provided to the SB 823 Subcommittee as often as it convenes. Long -Term Planning for Facilities Alameda County is committed to reimagining the possibilities for children in the county and to developing a new approach to responding to young people (even those who have committed the most serious offenses ). This includes the commitment to move away from the current juvenile hall and ultimately close or repurpose that facility, and to instead establish a complete continuum of services and housing options to meet the needs of young people. A full array of juvenile justice housing models to accommodate secu rity, treatment, developmental , and emotional needs. This Subcommittee has determined that even our most secure environments should be small, homelike, and designed to allow for normative development, emotional healing, and connectedness. The prison -like facilities that so many believed we required have been proven unnecessary and harmful. The scores of youth offenders that were predicted to fill them did not emerge. Instead, our community, like most around the country, has witnessed unprecedented declines in juvenile crime and perhaps the generation with the lowest rates of criminal activity ever recorded. This does not guarantee that crime rates will decrease forever as that is highly dependent on a host of societal factors. However, the fact that the pop ulation is vastly smaller than predicted does offer a moment of great opportu nity, and this Subcommittee has determined to capitalize on that opportunity to build a better approach for youth in Alameda County. There is no way to fully develop and implemen t this new approach in the time provided \u2014nor should a plan to develop a new model that takes the County well into the future be created without a community -based planning process. For that reason, the Subcommittee believes that Alameda County must take imm ediate steps to begin a planning and reimagination process. This must, as soon as possible, lead to the design, creation, and implementation of the services and facilities required to serve the Realigned population. There is no way to meet the many lofty goals of juvenile justice realignment without also addressing other aspects of the system and our overall response to children. None of our services and responses can work or be developed in a vacuum. While the development of such a process is beyond the s cope of this Subcommittee, it is the Subcommittee's recommendation that the County immediately begin a redevelopment process. To do this Alameda County must partner with directly -impacted youth and youth advocates to design and deliver a fiscally efficient and equitable plan that transitions the County away from a law enforcement respon se to children and that (1) builds the capacity of community based organizations to serve young people outside the current justice system; (2) results in a significant reduction in the number of young people who are in contact with the justice system; (3) explores a rehabilitative, health -focused, and care -first model of youth justice that is Commented [EP36]: Additional language from this section pasted from the last workgroup draft. Formatted: Font: -0.08\" Formatted: Headermeaningfully different in operations and outcomes from the current system; and (4) prevents the prosecution and incarceration of children in the adult system The Subc ommittee recommends that the County review the working group proposal presented by Free Our Kids (FOK) and undertake that or a similar process for planning. This Subcommittee is committed to working with that process to develop subsequent Realignment Plans and to develop the resources identified as needed to serve the population. There is no way to meet the many lofty goals of juvenile justice realignment without also addressing other aspects of the system and our overall response to children. None of our services and responses can work or be developed in a vacuum. Iit is therefore our the Subcommittee's intent to remain involved as the SB 823 realigned youth are particularly vulnerable to harsh system responses and the impacts of long -term confinement. The County should include a broad range of stakeholders, including significant and meaningful participation of system -impacted youth and their families. The planning process should be transparent and equitable, and the resulting plan should be fiscally efficient and grounded in equity. Other Options for Step -Down, Transitional, & Post -Release Facilities One significant task remaining for the SB 823 Subcommittee is the consideration of other facility options for step -down, transitional, and post -release facilities. The current housing crisis in the Bay Area makes the consideration and development of these options simultaneously both more challenging and more urgent. In accordance with the research and intentions included in this Plan, a focus on homelike environments will be maintained. For example, we know that converted hotels and single -room -occupancies do not work well for TAY , since the se spaces do not typically have shared common spaces to socialize, etc. One option for consideration is the development of Credible Messenger Healing Homes. This concept grows out of the larger idea of credible messengers filling the role of the primary level of engagement with young justice involved youth. That role includes forming trusting relationships, providing crisis intervention and stabilization support, advancing healing through restorative practices, supporting the development of individualized life plans, and co -navigation of progress towards achieving short -term, intermediate , and long -term goals. G iven this core role and set of responsibilities, Credible Messengers can have transformative impacts in various settings, including the community, secure facilities , and transitional housing settings. Conceptually, Healing Homes are small home -like reside nces with 4-8 bed s that are staffed by a team of caregivers . One or two credible messengers actually live in the home and serve as on-site leaders. Other staff involved in the home may include social workers, clinicians, educational specialists, and other relevant providers. The home should serve as a safe space where youth can engage in various processes, including healing circles, restorative justice activities, and entrepreneurial projects while they prepare to be reconnected to their homes, schools, and full community in a safe way. Healing homes can be a viable option at various points in the continuum of the justice process. They can serve as viable alternatives to secure detention on the front end of the system for pre - adjudicated youth, as well as \" step down\" options for youth transitioning out of facilities. All step - down, transitional, and post -release housing options should be community -rooted assets that are resourced to connect youth and families in a healthy way, and do not involve private, for - profit entities with limited investment back in the communities they serve. Formatted: -0.08\" Formatted: HeaderSpecial consideration in programmatic development and solutions should be paid for girls and gender expansive young people. Agencies and community partners already existing in Alameda County and the bay area that practice a credible messenger model and that have been extremely successful in working with girls and gender expansive youth that are more deeply system involved and should be advisors and core partners in building out t he Gender responsive model. Programmatic components should include; ensuring staff have lived experience, that enjoy working with young people, are trained in gender responsive best practices, and are committed to supporting the agency and self -determination amongst girls and gender expansive youth. The step -down strateg ies for girls need to be relational, grounded in best practices, and be built on a continuum of support and care. The Community Based Gender Responsive Credible Messengers will Build relationships with young people at the very first point of system conta ct (and on the preventative side in the community). During any incarceration, while on probation, while serving a commitment, or any other way the young person is in contact with the system, the community program partners should have complete access to yo ung people during their system involvement as a partner and support for the young person. Decisions by system players (judge, probation, etc.) along the continuum should not sever or interfere with the relationship or contact between the Community partner and young person at any point as gender responsive best practices are relational. The community partner will work most closely with a young person to develop self-determined goals, to navigate the step down process, and to create individualized plans bas ed on best practices, the self -determination of the young person and goals. They will also partner with the young person and the system players to develop strategies for community based solutions including developing a network of Credible messenger styl e homes that are built to address the specific needs of girls, transgender, and gender expansive young people both locally and regionally as a part of a network of services for girls and gender expansive youth. Additional programmatic components of gende r responsive best practices include ensuring young women have access to economic support. Because economic challenges are an additional driver of incarceration, girls and gender expansive youth should receive economic and material support that will allow t hem to survive day -to-day. The will also be grounded in best practices including research that has shown: that gender -neutral programs are significantly less effective than gender -responsive programs for girls 5 Recent reviews, research, and government -led study groups examining effective gender -responsive programming suggest that the most promising elements in programming for girls include the following: Relational (e.g. attention to healthy romantic and non -romantic relationships) Restorative (e.g. sca ffold skills for navigating the justice system with attention to trauma histories) Socio -culturally anchored (e.g. attention to the intersectional identities of girls) Individualized (e.g. tailored to meet a variety of needs) Multi -level (e.g. girls' in dividual, peer, family, community, and multiple systems of involvement are targeted.) Community -based (e.g. provided flexibly in youth's natural communities) Strengths -based (e.g. orientation on positive development, resisting deficit - orientation and pro moting skills and assets in the child.) Community -based organizations contracted to oversee the models detailed below should adhere to the tenants above and offer a variety of programming options that collectively encompass the following approaches. Santa Clara is home to a variety of strong community -based organizations, many of which already incorporate some or all of these programmatic elements.

As discussed above, ACPD will move to eliminate the harshest behavioral controls: pepper (OC) spray, prone restraint, and room confinement. Restraints and room confinement will only be used in the case of extreme, immediate safety risk to youth or staff, and the use of prone restraints will be eliminated. Physical restraints have likewise been shown to cause harm and lack utility , indicating that \"high risk safety procedures that can result in severe injury or death ,\"80 and that \"can be counter - productive to treatment, disrupt essential adult -child relationships, and impede children's social and emotional learning, especially among vulnerable children with severe trauma histories.\"81 In particular, there has been significant evidence regarding the dangers of prone restraint and reports highlighting the high likelihood of restraints being misuse d or incorrectly applied .

In light of the dangers of physical intervention, many have arrived at the conclusion that room confinement or seclusion present a safer or more appropriate options -- this is simply not the case. The research and empirical evidence of room confinement and isolation practices in juvenile facilities has shown that it has a harmful impact on youth's brain development, emotiona l health and growth, frustrates other programming efforts, hinders effective youth -staff relationships, and contributes to a less safe environment. Isolation of adolescents can also contribute to depression, anxiety, psychosis, and other psychological as w ell as developmental harm. Research has demonstrated that \"overly harsh correctional policies and ones that are not age - specific or developmentally appropriate may hinder the reintegration of adolescent and teenage offenders\".82 Hindering protective fact ors for desistance, including utilizing institutional confinement instead of less restrictive measures, may backfire, leading to slower progress or even a reversal in progress.83 While Title 15 sets the minimum standards for compliance, Alameda County is committed to exceeding all minimum standards in the treatment and care of its youth. To that end, ACPD will develop and implement a plan to end the use of room confinement , OC Spray, and physical restraints . As long as room confinement , pepper spray, and physical restraint s are used, reviews of each instance will be conducted to determine appropriate use and compliance with policy. Incident data will be provided to the appropriate body, which would also include community representation. To ensure th at ACPD never uses, and continues to never use OC spray , restraints , and room confinement in the secure track and broader SB823 programming , ACPD shall develop a sustainability plan by March 31, 2022. In addition to detailing ACPD's plan to ensure that OC spray is never used in Unit 3, the plan shall include the following considerations: Crisis Response Teams - ACPD shall consider adding mobile crisis response teams - consisting of an IS -II Supervisor and licensed clinician - to help intervene during crisis or potential conflict. Additional Training : All staff shall be trained in de -escalation techniques/youth dev elopment best practices, including: Non-Violent Self -Defense, such as Crisis Prevention Institution (CPI) training Advanced Motivational Interviewing (by MINT certified trainers) Adolescent brain development Trauma -informed care and response Vicarious trauma (so staff can recognize when they are traumatized/triggered) Restorative Justice 82 (Altschuler & Brash, 2004 ) 83 (Baglivio et al., Impact Right, Right: -0.08\" Formatted: Header Prioritize Employee Wellness : Offering therapy and mental health support to members of the milleu team and any staff that interact with the youth, including JIO's and Shift Supervisors. Ensuring the mental health and well -being of staff will mitigate the potential for vicarious traum a and/or abusive tactics and behavioral interventions. Positive Behavior Model Consistent with the Eight EPBs of Effective Interventions, ACPD currently utilizes a point -based positive reinforcement behavior model to encourage and incentivize positive beh avior and achievement of daily and weekly goals. This model relies heavily on incentives and utilizes sanctions only as a last resort and for the duration of time necessary to correct or change behavior. In line with best practices, incentives and sanction s will not be based around basic items or items of basic comfort. Moreover, rewards and incentives will be individually determined and go beyond the usual items. MDTs could help inform appropriate incentives based on the individual youth's plan. ACPD inten ds to continue utilizing this model, while remaining open to exploring other models that are intended for use in long -term stays, and that are developmentally appropriate for older youth. If and when a model is identified , which will support the target population, staff will be extensively trained in the application of the model, emphasizing the importance of incentives in encouraging positive behavior. Refresher training in the model will be conducted regularly, in accordance with model recommendations. Discipline and Management shall not be tied to or alter any of the following: Participation in programming Change to the food and meal policy Change to the clothing policy Participation in extracurricular activities related to school Family visitation and communication Time and/ or supplies related to the basics of daily living such as toiletries and hygiene products, clean clothing and access to laundry, Program Refusal Lack of progress from initial assessment to reassessment may indicate the need to revise treatment/case plans and adjust how the program is working with the youth.84 If a youth refuses to participate in programming or other structured parts of the day, punishments , or sanctions will be avoided. A trusted adult from among the therapeutic milieu will instead \"check in\" with the youth to see what might be hindering their participation. If an issue persists, it will be discussed among the MDT with the goal of identifying the internal, int rinsic motivations of the youth that might be leveraged to encourage a positive change in behavior. Formal sanctions in these situations will be avoided and only used as a last resort. The operati ng assumption should be that youth behavior is often the res ult of their environments; thus, a sincere discussion of what changes could be made to their environments to encourage a 84 Baglivio, M.

Criminal justice and behavior, 44(3), Impact 57 Formatted: Headermore positive reaction or behavior is warranted . In the case that this refusal may cause harm to peers, a restorative process, outlined below, will be relied upon. Conflict Resolution ACPD is committed to using non -punitive approaches to address conflict resolutions. A restorative justice framework will be used in cases of interpersonal conflict between youth. Restorative responses should include all members of the unit & members of the therapeutic milieu. Credible Messengers will be relied upon for conflict resolution. Such an incorporation of credible messenger insight, experience , and expertise can have a direct impact on conflict reso lution, mediation, restorative practices , and graduated approaches to disciplinary issues. For example, one jurisdiction incorporated credible messenger contributions to their policy formation process and was able to successfully incorporate restorative ap proaches, while preventing/eliminating isolation, use of mechanical restraints, use of pepper spray , and other practices found to be harmful and ineffective in promoting safe spaces. Oversite & Appeals Process of All Disciplinary /Sanction Decisions SB 823 created a new local commitment option and a new category of county facilities for justice involved youth : the secure placement treatment facility (S PTF). Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code 875, the Board of State and Community Corrections is charged with developing \"standards for the establishment, design, security, programming and education, and staffing\" of a secure youth treatment facility by July 1, 2023. Until those standards are finalized, SPTF must \"comply with applicable minimum standards for juvenile facilities in Title 15 and Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.\" In part because this is a new category of facilities, the State has yet to establish a youth bill of rights for young people committed to a S PTF. A bill of rights exists for foster youth, including those placed in STRTPs, and for youth committed to DJJ. Until the State establishes a specific youth bill of rights applicable to S PTFs, Alameda County will consider the adoption of the following Youth Bil l of Rights for children committed to county juvenile facilities: A. To live in a safe, healthy, and clean environment conducive to treatment and rehabilitation , and where they are treated with dignity and respect. B. To be free from physical, sexual, emotional, or other abuse s and corporal punishment. C. To receive adequate and healthy food and water, sufficient personal hygiene items, and clothing that is adequate and clean. Clothing and grooming /hygiene products shall respect the child's culture, ethnicity, and g ender identity and expression. D. To receive adequate and appropriate medical, dental, vision, and mental health services. E. To refuse the administration of psychotropic and other medications consistent with applicable law or unless immediately necessary for th e preservation of life or the prevention of serious bodily harm. F. To not be searched for the purpose of harassment or humiliation or as a form of discipline or punishment. G. To maintain frequent and continuing contact with parents, guardians, siblings, childr en, and extended family members, through visits, telephone calls, and mail. H. To make and receive confidential telephone calls, send and receive confidential mail, and have confidential visits with attorneys and their authorized representatives, Impact Justice: 58 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: Headerombudsperson s, and other advocates, holders of public office, state and federal court personnel, and legal service organizations.

The rights listed are broad expressions of the rights of the rights of youth in S PTFs a nd are not exhaustive of all rights set forth in the United States Constitution and the California Constitution, federal and California statutes, and case law. Grievance and review process Youth are entitled to appeal all disciplinary (sanction) decisions. With any appeal, the original penalty may remain unchanged, there may be a decrease in the severity of the sanction, or the sanction may be completely removed. Youth will have the right to file a grievance if there are concerns related to the c onditions of their confinement and may file a grievance if it is believed that they have received unfair treatment related, but not limited to the following: Health care services (medical or mental health) Commented [EP37]: What happens with their grievance?

The presentation and discussion of incident data may occur in closed session if the identity of the youth may be revealed, even inadvertently. Staff With regards to staff -to-youth ratios, ACPD will adhere to national PREA standards. Under PREA standards, in secure juvenile facilities, the Department of Justice (DOJ) defined minimum staffing as \"1:8 during resident waking hour s and 1:16 during resident sleeping hours. Agencies may depart from these minimum ratios during limited and discrete exigent circumstances, which are fully documented for audit purposes.\" Key Probation and Camp Staff Roles & Responsibilities : Agency/ facility leadership: set vision & tone for infusing credible messengers into the culture and framework of the facility. Ensure appropriate staffing levels, space and resources are available Safety, security and operations staff: support credible messenger work by facilitating access, Movement and coverage of relevant facility spaces. Behavioral Health Staff: spearhead the facilitation of the development of an overall youth engagement (programmatic and treatm ent) framework for youth in the facility; assist with incorporating Credible Messengers into the framework ; and co -facilitate various interactions with youth. Restorative justice staff: co -facilitate development of youth engagement framework and various in teractions with youth. Milieu Providers The therapeutic milieu/community relies on structure and predictability to include dedicated staff with clear roles and responsibilities for each community team member. It is proposed that a 10 - bed SB 823 programming unit be supported by a core group of ACPD staff, ACBH clinicians , and professional Credible Messengers. Though the current position descriptions of the Probation staff do not naturally fit a clean unit management structure the ACPD shall explor e mechanisms to create a more typical unit management structure with clear lines of supervision and roles and responsibilities to support the milieu. This requires a manager with the capacity Impact Justice: 60 Formatted: Header, Indent: Left: -0.08\" Formatted: Headerand role responsibility to manage all functions on the unit and provide direction to all staff on the unit. At the moment , the only position with this level of supervision is the Facility Superintendent for both Camp Sweeney and the SB 823 unit. The Unit Supervisor supervises the Deputy Probation Officer only , and the Institutional Supervisor only supervises the Juvenile Institutional Officers. On its face , this split line of supervision has the capacity to create misdirection in services and programs. If this cannot be resolved , the Unit Supervisor assigned to the unit and the Institutional Supervisors must be engaged in regular discussions regarding how to jointly manage the community and all staff supporting the community to ensure cohesive practice in the milieu. This will require regular/weekly meetings between thes e two \"supervisory positions\" to determine the best strategy week to week. This is definitely possible but requires a concerted effort to avoid a divided community approach. The unit team shall consist of the following members in addition to the ACPD staff : 1-2 Dedicated Licensed Mental Health Clinicians (1 -2 FTE's) with expertise in working with BIPOC youth in the justice system and who have the capacity to engage with a team of individuals to support a milieu approach to core services. Clinicians(s) shoul d possess the requisite education, training, and experience to provide culturally congruent individual mental health services to youth who need this level of care and participate in the designed milieu programming for the unit which should include a core p rogram focused on the development of interpersonal skills, social problem solving , and emotion management. The clinician should co - lead groups/circles with the DPO and credible messengers and/or JIO. The clinician(s) shall also provide adjunctive services such as suicide and self -injury assessments, and assistance in developing and impl ementing trauma -focused safety plans and Behavior Management Plans when necessary. The clinicians, like other team members, shall work a schedule congruent with supporting the milieu which will require mid -day to evening schedules and a rotating weekend. I t is expected that only one clinician will be needed at least until the unit reaches 50% capacity. At that point a second clinician may be introduced, and the schedules modified to ensure appropriate coverage. The ACBH clinician shall also assess and ident ify youth who may during their stay require a more intensive level of care. In those instances , ACBH shall provide placement and service recommendation to ACPD. ACBH shall also collaborate with ACBH to ensure specialized services such as substance use, sex offender services, and individual therapy for transgender and intersex youth as necessary. 1-2 Credible Messengers (1-2 FTE equivalents) -will be contracted and trained , and will serve as mentors . They will act as advocates and provide program services an d case planning. The Credible Messengers will assist youth in developing skills necessary to thrive in community and will complete an independent assessment of youth needs to be considered during the comprehensive case planning process. The same or alterna tive Credible Messengers may be contracted to run culturally relevant (individualized or group ) programs in collaboration with other unit team members. The Credible Messenger team will collaborate with the other milieu providers in planning, administering, and facilitating its youth engagement functions , and will participate in relevant staff meetings to support the overall goals of youth healing, restoration, development , and preparation for reintegration into the community. Specifically, Credible Messenge rs will: Form trusting relationships and lines of communication with youth . Provide individual transformative mentoring sessions . Facilitate restorative -focused group activities (independently and in conjunction with designated staff) . Accompany Youth as t hey matriculate through their Impact -0.08\" Formatted: Header Credible Messenger program implementation . Document interactions with youth in designated data base . Participate in relevant staff meetings . JIO will provide engaged supervision. Engaged supervision means that they shall participate in activities with youth, provide advice and consultation, and assist with homework assignments or other tasks to support the youth. They will also assist with developing and practicing skills and motiv ating youth to succeed. Once trained, JIOs shall be integrated into more of the core programmatic services as co -facilitators. JIOs will also be responsible for providing input to the weekly meetings to determine youth progress via a formalized feedback pr ocess with the Institutional supervisor. Training of Milieu Providers An effective milieu program will require that all staff and service providers collaborating to provide services engage in joint training on the key elements of the milieu. ACPD shall assemble a comprehensive interdisciplinary training for ACPD, ACBH and contracted providers to include the credible messengers. ACPD and all partner organizations and departments recognize that a trauma -informed approach also applies to working with staff the mselves. This work may expose them to secondary and vicarious trauma, and staff may also find themselves triggered in different circumstances. Ensuring staff are trained in recognizing and responding to their own trauma(s) will help them better respond to triggers and traumas among the youth they are serving. This training shall at a minimum include: Positive youth justice Restorative justice practices Think trauma: a training for staff in juvenile justice and residential settings85 Credible Messenger th eory and practice Effective strategi es for youth and family engagement Group facilitation Conflict resolution Behavior management principles Effective case planning and case management The level system Specific interventions that will be jointly provided Secondary and vicarious trauma Mindfulness and self -regulation Credible Messengers will go through their own training.
