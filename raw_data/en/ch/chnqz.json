Organization (P AHO), through the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute (CFNI) and the Cari bbean Program Coordination, has been actively promoting good nutrition prac tices in the Caribbean Region. This commitment to encou rage a heal thy approa ch to eatin g has brought the recognition that, while a preventive approach to health care is key to maintain ing health, proper management of diseases is an importan t aspect of the health care continuum. Chronic non-communicable nutrition-rela ted diseases are the main causes of disability, illness and death in the Caribbe an. Their m anagement needs to be given priority, even as the fight against commu nicable diseases continues. With the increasing cost of hospitalization, treating complications, loss of productive capacity and the im pact on qu ality of life, more em phasis needs to be placed on th e pivotal role of nutrition in th e effective manageme nt of these diseases at the primary care level. The nutritional management of obesity, diab etes and hypertension has been selected as a first step for which nutritional gu idelines ought to be established for management in the primary care system, since success in the ma nagement of these diseases may well prevent the onset of other debilitatin g chronic diseases. Nutritional management is a cost-effectiv e approach to health care. Sensitive consideration must, therefore, b e given to the role of nutrition in reducin g costs, especially those associated with certain me dications, morbidity, length of hospita l stay and mortality. This can be achieved through adequate, practical and effective nutrition in tervention based on scientific fa cts. Throughout the Caribbean region there is limited availability of dietitians and nutritionist s to provide the lev el of prof essional care need ed. The prot ocol is designed to assist other members of the heal th care team to provide a standard level of basic nutritional ca re. Notwithstanding, this should not detract from the need to increase the number of nutrition professionals in the region. viiProtocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean The inform ation provided in this document represents guidel ines for standa rdizin g nutritional care at the basic lev el. The correct use of the information con tained in the docum ent will require setting goals for in dividual c lients, dete rmining pr iorities and undertaking on-going monitoring to revi ew and t ailor these objectives to their health status. While the protocol addresses the nutritional management of obesity, diabetes and hypertensi on at the primary car e level, it provides basic principles and techniques that can b e applied t o other kinds of chronic d iseases. Training in its u se is an essential step in its implementation and it has been d esigned wit h both trainer and trainee in mind. The protocol provides guidel ines which ma y be used by health care profes sionals such as n urses, nutr ition assistants, and dietet ic assistants who are involved in offering nutritional care to clients at th e primary care level. When implementing aspects of t he protocol , it is advis able that whenever possible the involvement of the nutritionist/dietitian/doctor be s ought as members of the management team. It is important to note that the document does not address dietary modifications relevant to persons who have complications of diab etes and hypertensi on. Such persons should be r eferred for specialist nutritional care. viiiProtocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Acknowledgements The Caribbean Food & Nutrition Institute (CFNI), a nd the PAHO/WHO Office of Caribbean Program Coordination (CPC) ac knowledges and appreciates the contri- butions of many persons who he lped to make this Protocol a reality: Ms. Violet Griffith, Nutritionist, Ministry of Health, Jamaica, who developed the draft of the Protocol The technical persons who assisted in init ially outlining the conten t and form at of the Protocol and namely: \u0083 Ms. Dianne Broome, Community Nutrition Officer, National Nutrition Centre, Ministry of Health, Barbados. \u0083 Ms. S heila Forde, \u0083 Ms. Theresa Regis, Assistant Nut ritioni st, Ministry of Health, St. Vincent & the Grenadines. \u0083 Ms. Jeanine Smit, Lecturer in Nutrit ion, Medical School, University of Suriname.

Caribbean Food and Nutr ition I nstitute Jam aica PAHO/WHO Office of Caribbean Program Coord ination Barbados 2004 xProtocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Introduction Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) ha ve gradually displaced communicable diseases as the main causes of mortality in the Caribbean. Nutrition-related chronic Diseases NCDs suc h as obesity, d iabetes and hypertensi on are major contributors to disability, illness and death in the sub-region. Of concern is the fact that while th e prevalence and mortality rates of these dise ases are highest in th e elderly, t hey are not restricted to any one age group. Hype rtension and diabetes rank as the two leading ch ronic disor ders among Caribbean populations and are also major risk factors for other dis eases such as cere brovascular disease (stroke) and coronary heart disease. Interventions to control risk fa ctors for these disorders and their complications include the adoption of healthy lifestyles , especially regular physical activity, avoidance of smoking and alc ohol along with healthy food choices. An inter sectoral approach to facilitating the be haviour ch ange need ed is a key strategy in NCD prevention and cont rol. Interventions in various settings such as workplaces, schools, cli nics and hospitals, are crucial for success. The crit ical role of n utrition in the prev ention of d isease, health promotion and chronic dis ease management is undisputed. Nutrition intervention is a low cost and effective way to prom ote health everybod y eats and with guid ance and attention to what they eat, people can improve thei r nutrition an d health status. Maintaining optimal nutritional status at any age is important and can contribute to prev enting some chronic diseases, less frequent episod es of illness, shorter and less expensive hospital sta ys, fewer co mplications and a hig her surviva l rate. The burden of these diseases (obesity, di abetes and hypertension) on health is astronomical. The costs in loss of produc tive time, lost opportu nities, decreased quality of life and money spent on health care are sig nificant. Much of the burden, however, can be prevented. The cost of treating one patient in hospital per admission could well cover the cost of treat ing several individuals in the primary care setting if effective preventive m anagement strategi es were employed. at prev enting, as the targeted nutrition -related ch ronic disea ses at the primary care level. 1Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean There is much eviden ce to suggest that e ffective management is very important for persons alr eady diagnosed with t hese NCDs: The International Ob esity Task Force (IOTF) has stat ed that weight loss in over- weight and obese individuals im proves ph ysical, metabolic and endocrinological complications. The 1999 WHO/ISH1 Guidelines have confirmed positive and continuous relationship between blood pressure leve ls and the ris k of major coronary heart disease events, including death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. The Diabetes Control and Com plications Trial (DCCT) has stat ed conclusively that the risk of development and progre ssion of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy is reduced 50-75% nsive r egimens compared with conve ntional treatment regimens in pa tients with type 1 diabetes. The United Kingdo m Prospective Diabet es Study (UKPDS) has also demon- strated conclusively that improved blood gl ucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes r educes the risk of d evelo ping retinopathy and nephropathy and possibly re duces neuropathy. Th e UKPDS al so showed that aggressive control of blood pressure signif icantly red uced strok es, diabet es-related deaths, heart failure, mic ro-vascular complications and visual loss. This Nutrition Management Protocol is intend ed to serve as a resource docu ment for nutrition a nd dietet ic personnel and othe r health professionals involved in the management of client s with the selected ch ronic d iseases - obes ity, diab etes and hypertensi on - in the primary health care setting. It is not intended to be a comprehensive technical and clinical care document and individ ual clients, who will differ in t heir personal, medical, social, ethnic and cultural c haracteristics, may require ref erral for more specialized care. The Protocol recognizes that there is limite d availability of specialized nutrition and dietet ic pro fessionals in the Carib bean setti ng. However, it is not a replacem ent for the specialized prof essional services of nutritionists and diet itians. The P rotocol should provide a framework for Nutritional Care which will guide standard care using a set of core Nutritional Care parame ters. It should serve as a practical 1 Wor ld Health Organizat ion/I nternational Society of Hyp ertensio n 2Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean management tool, with time ly referral of the clien t to the appropriate health professional for care beyond the knowledg e, training and skills of particular members of the multi-disciplinary health ca re team.

Objectives To provide guidelines to health professi onals at the primary care level for the nutritional management of obesity, diabetes and hypertension. To facilit ate documentation of the nutritional management process, main- streaming it into the medical records. To provide a framework in whic h to set tre atment goals for nutri tional manage- ment of selected chronic diseases in the pri mary care setting. To define the nutrition referral process for the selected NCDs. 4Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Overview of the Nutrition Management Process While the indicators f or success and the ou tcome will be diff eren t, the princ iples of nutritional management of persons with ch ronic diseas es are the same as those for management of any business o r establishm ent. The process of nutrition manage- ment includes: Assessment involves the gathering of informat ion and analysis of data. This provides in formation (historical data) on the person before nut rition inter vention begins. Planning involves the interpretation of findings from the assessment and translating these to achievement targets. This process outlines the strate gies and activities to be used to achieve these ta rgets and how success will be eva luated. Planning includes information for the education process. Implementation is the actual process through whic h the plan is put into a ction. Coordination involves communication as well as documentation. All aspects of Nutritional Care should be communicated to other health care team members to facilitate reinforcement of the nutritio n strategies by other team members. Achieving desired health out comes is depen dent on int egrating Nutritional Care with other aspects of medical management. Evaluation - is the process of exam ining the implementation to determ ine if the process is achieving the set targets and yi elding the desired resu lts by comparing actual results with set goals. This also invol ves observ ation of the client's behaviour to determine if he/she is ready to accept a greater lev el of self- care. Evaluation may reveal unexpected findings, both positive and negative, which can be used to improve the care plan. 5Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Managing NCDs demands effectiv e allocation and use of resources. The health team offering Nutritional Care must focus its ma nagement skills to facilitate successful outcomes. Resources such as time, inform ation, mon ey and materials must all be carefully managed to ensure effective and effi cient use for the benefit of the patients. 6Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean SECTION I The Nutritional Care Process 7Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Blank 8Protocol for the Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Diabetes and Hypertension in the Caribbean 9 The Nutritional Care Process Proper Nutritional Care is integral to the successful management of obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Compliance with the nutrition and meal planning principles, however, remains one of the most challe nging aspects of care. The conceptual framework in Figure I identifies the st eps necessary for successful management. Assessment An important first step in initiating Nutr itional Care is evaluating the nutrition status of the individual. Nutrition assess ment must be complet ed for every person with obesity, diabetes or hypertension who presents for initial care. Nutritional assessment is an important tool for identifying existing or potential problems and identify clients needing a more comprehensive screening. Assessment generates the information ne eded for a comprehensive approach to nutrition intervention. Some parameters will need to be assessed each time the individual presents for care. These include weight, blood pressure, dietary intake and blood glucose (only for diabetes). In de fining the level of nutrition intervention for the targeted diseases, a total review of historical data is important. This will set the framework for all the problems/illnesses t h a t m u s t b e t a r g e t e d a s p a r t o f t h e nutrition intervention process. Indicators of Nutritional Risk These indicators include: 1. Dietary intake quality and/or quantity 2. Decreased absorption of nutrients 3. Decreased utilization of nutrients 4. Increased nutrient losses 5. Increased nutritional requirements Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 10FIGURE I A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE TEAM APPROACH ASSESS NUTR ITION STATUS DEVEL OP NU TRITIO NAL CARE PLAN Education Meal P lan Exercise Pro gramme NUTRITIO N GOAL N OT REALIZED REFER FOR M ORE SPECIALIZE D CARE AS AP PROPRIATE REVISE CARE PLAN NUTRITIO N GOAL REALIZED Schedule follo w-up appoi ntments less frequently e.g. semi-annually IMPLEMENT NUTRITIO NAL CARE PLAN EVALUATE EF FECTS OF NUTRITIO N INTERVENTION Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Page for Figure 1 10 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean The Assessment Process The assessment process is the systematic process of collecting obj ective infor mation about the client, his/her environment and the sup port system.

Assessment of client support network - home/community 6. Interpretation of data 7. Use of the data to provide appropriate care Review of Historical Data Historical data will provide an insight into any releva nt past illn esses or circum- stances tha t may directly or indirectly im pact on the client's nutrition needs and health stat us. Important historical data to be reviewed include: Health history - explore health factors and/or family history that ma y influence the client's nutrition status. Drug history - review medicat ions (prescription and over the counter, nutrient supplements, and illegal drugs that may affect nutrition status). 11 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Socio-economic history - Check for environmental, per sonal and all religious, s ocial and economic factors th at can influence food av ailability, f ood needs, food intake and nutrient needs and dietary intervention. Diet history - identify possible nutrient imbalances and eating patterns. Sources of historical data include medical records, family members and/or signi - ficant others and the client. Data Collection This is an i mportant phase of the assessm ent and involves various parameters which will be det ailed b elow. (Appendix I provide s a form which can be used to gu ide d ata collection for the asse ssment p hase.) A. Anthropometric Data This is a measurement of bod y size, weig ht and proportions. These measures are non-invasive and are used to evaluate n utrition status, to monitor the effects of nutrition intervention and to provide inform ation about the body's stores of fat and muscle. Anthrometric measurements include: Height and weight Circumferences - waist, hip, arm Information from the measurements is th en used to calculate indicators of nutritional status. (i) Height Height is t he most frequently misreported valu e. It is useful to ascertain height by standard measurements in the clinic using a stadiometer or other reliable met hod to the nearest centimetre or half inch. Height measurement should be recorded as a basic initial scr een for all clients presenting for care. 12 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Height measurements are useful for calculating: Appropriate weight for height Body mass index (BMI) Basal energ y expenditure (BEE) (ii) Weight Weight is a sensitive indicator of nutritional status. The Body Mass Index (BMI), a standard which relates height and weight ma thematically, is ofte n used to determine health risk (BMI = weight in kg/height in metres2) (see Appendix X and XI). (iii) Waist-hip Ratio Waist-to-hip ratio is a way of measuring wher e body fat is stored. It is an indirect indicator of intra-abdominal fat. A high waist-to-hip ratio indicates an increased risk of obesity-related health problems. Waist-to-hip ratio is calculated by dividi ng the measured waist circumference by the measured hip circumference. W = waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) H Indicators of risk Women: WHR Greater WHR Greater than 1.0* (iv) Waist circumferen ce Waist circumference is an indica tor of intra-abdominal fatness and is a good indicator of abdomin al fat. A high wais t circumference is a ssociated with an increased risk for type 2 diab etes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Indicators of risk Men: Waist Circumference Greate r than or equal to 102cm* Women: Waist Circumference Gr eater than or equal to 88cm Obesi ty: preven ting and managi ng the global epidemic.

Dietary Data Obtaining an accurat e diet hist ory is an important component of the assessment process and is part of the overall nutritio n history. The diet history provides valuable in formation about the client's past and curren t food behaviours. Details of which are presented in Appendix II. Nutritional Care Plan GOALS OF NUTRITION THERAPY To maintain near-nor mal blood-glucose le vels by balancing food intake with insulin or oral medicat ion and physical activity levels. To provide adequate calories to attain and maintain reasonable weights for adults, nor mal rates of growth and deve lopment in children and adolescents, increased metabolic needs during preg nancy and lactation or recovery from catabolic illnesses. 14 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean To control blood pressure To achieve optimal blood lipid levels. To prevent , delay or treat acut e insuli n-related as hypogly- caemia, short-term illness and exercise-relat ed problems. To prevent, delay or treat long-term complicatio ns of obesity, diabetes or hypertensi on. These include, bu t are not limited to, renal diseas e, neuropathy and cardio vascular disease. To improve health thr ough optimal nutrition. Develop the Care Plan The nutrition recom mendation s that are in tegrated into the overall management plan for the client are based on: Nutrition assessment Desired treatment outcomes Modification of lifestyles including eating be haviours An essential component of the Nutritiona l Care proc ess is the measurement and documentation of outcomes. An evaluation of the medical, clin ical, bioch emical, educational and mation on the effectiv eness of nutrition therapy in t he overall management plan. The client's long and short-term nutritiona l needs should be clearly ident ified in a plan of action based on finding s from the assessmen t. The Nutritional Care Plan should outline: Objectives for meeting nutrition and educational needs Content of the counselling sessions Time fram e for achieving the objectives The individual's nutr ient requirements, th eir sources and the strategies for meeting them should be consid ered. The plan shoul d be discussed with the client and his/her 15 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean family. The final plan should be achieved in discussion with the other members of the healthcare team. Seek the assistance of Nutrition/D ietetic personnel in developing the plan. Coun selling session s should then be planned to provide instructions and recommendations for the client. The counselling process may require several sessions to address the care pl an, the diet and to evaluate the client's understanding as well as responses to the plan. IMPLEMENTING THE NUTRITIONAL CARE PLAN Meal pla nning Meal planning is the use of foods, food gr oups and nutrients to facilitate variations for indiv idual/group preferences, cultural habits, health status and socio-economic factors to achieve specific objectives. It is an interactive process between the clien t and the health care provider. Meal planning is a focal point in the management of obesity, diabetes and hypertensi on. The meal planning process requires inp ut from the client, in cluding financial, r eligious an d cultural considerations. Purpose of meal planning To control weight, blood pressure and/or blood glucose To ensure that the right type s and amounts of food are eaten To control the specific nutrients that are appropriate to the targeted disease To improve overall quality of life. The principles which gover n meal planning include: Nutritional adequacy Pro viding adequate amounts of all the essential nutrients, energy and fibre to maintain health while ensuring any required nutrient modification specific to the disease. Caloric control Managing the amount of energy consumed without over- or under-eating. Nutrient density Choosing foods that g ive a g ood variety of nutrients for a small num ber of calories. 16 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Variety and Balance Selecting food s from each of the food grou ps in proportion to each other thus pre venting nutritional ris ks. Individuality Using the information from the asse ssment to meet individual needs. Flexibility Allowi ng clients to choose foods within a practical and creative setting. Meal plans that are rigid do not encourage co mpliance. Developing a Meal Plan The meal plan should be tailored to the needs of the i ndividual while targeting the disease. There are many meal planning op tions, but, generally, the exchange syste m is used in t he Caribbe an. A f ood exchange is a measure or portion of one type of food that may be eat en inst ead of anot her type of food and provides sim ilar nutrien ts and calories (see Appendix III) . The meal plan should be evaluated perio dically and altered if necessary to achieve the goals of improved disease con trol and general good health. Determin ing calorie needs of the individual Note: It is advisable to a sk the nutrition/dietetics personnel on the health tea m to undertak e thi s task (see Appendix IV). 1. Assess current food in take and eating pattern using a 24-hour recall. Categorize usual food intake into exchange amount s based on portions and foods consumed at each m eal and snack. Using the exchange amou nts for each food item, translate into calories. 2. Determine caloric pr escription based on ag e, gender, height, weigh t, and a ctivity level (see A ppendix V). 3. Subtract calories if weight loss is desi red. Generally, 500 or 1000 kcal per day can be subtracted from current intake to produce a 0.5-1.0 kg (1-2 lb) per week weight reduction. 17 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 4. Calculate the grams of carbohydrate, protein, and fat from the exchanges and determine percentages of total calories contributed by each macro-nutrient grams of carbohydrate x 4 x 100 total calories grams of protein x 4 x 100 total calories grams of fat x 9 x 100 total c alories 5. Adjust exchange as needed to reach goal percentages for each macronutrient . 6. Distribute the foods from exchanges among meals and snacks b ased on usual eating pattern, activity, medication re gimen , and target ed diet mo dificat ion. Implementing the Nutritional Care Plan involves providing bo th the appropriate meal plan and educat ion. This process in cludes follo w-up appoi ntments to ensure timely incremental understandin g, motivation and compliance. Utilize data from assessment pr ocess to pr ovide nutrients/calories to meet client needs, guid e food choices and preparation techniques Involve client and family in setting goals Ensure that care plan fits into the overall management plan for the client Develop strategies to a chieve goal s Counsel cli ent and significant others Refer to other members of the he alth team where appr opriate Evaluate Nutritional Care Evaluation is usually a state ment of th e efficien cy and effectiveness of the intervention and should be done at regular intervals, the frequency depending on the client's sta tus. All the strategies that we re implemented must be evaluated. Th e client's nut rition status and needs may ch ange as his/her situation changes. The 18 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean client's participation in developing the plan and his/her compliance will influence whether or not goals will be met. It is possible that more flexibility will be required and different strategies and techniques may be needed to achieve desired results. The plan may also need to b e revised be cause the client has ac hieved short-term goals and is ready to move on t o the next level or because hi s/her socio-economic situation has changed. It is usually done through follow-up appointments and includes the following actions: Re-assess c lient's progress Revise care plan or deve lop new plans as needed Implement interventio ns Monitor progress Expected Outcom es of Nut ritional Care Improved nutrition status Improved food and nutrient intak e Improved knowledge Positive behaviour change Improved laboratory values, weight, blood pressure Risk factor reduction Prevention or delay of complications Ability to identify and access available community resources Reduced hospital admissions Improved self management Improved quality of life To achieve the expected outc omes ou tlined above: Involve the client, fa mily members (inclu ding siblings) and caregivers in all management discussi ons. 19 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Individualize the approach to Nutritional Care. Provide cul turally appropriate inf ormation and educational materials. Involve the client in the development of re alistic plans, which include a variet y of foods which are liked, available and fit his/h er schedule and self-care regimen. Facilitate follow-up vi sits and mo dificat ion of goals whe n necessary. Schedule on-going education, review s, support and dialogue to improve acceptance and compliance. Give general information about the targeted chronic disease - risk factors, prognosis, treatment and its side effects. Suggest workable strategies for positive behaviour change and t he adoption of healthy life styles. Documentation of Care There are s pecific fa ctors that should be included in the documen tation and captures information from the assessment process. Documentation is an essential component of the Nutritional Care process. All interventions of Nutrition al Care in cluding initial nutr itional asse ssment the client's medical r ecords. The medical record is a permanent legal docu ment that records the client's history, assessment and diagnosis (see A ppendix VI for details). Documen tation of care shou ld be continuous a nd serves to: Establish a record of t he Nutritional Care process. Maintain a strong professional communica tion network to inform all members of the health care team of the client 's status, plans and actions taken. Provide a f ramework/indicat ion for interven tion, re-assessment or follow-up care by other members of the care team. Facilitat e continuity of care, thus contributing to accuracy and better quality management. 20 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Provide a reference p oint for evaluating the impact of medical nutrition therapy on medical and clinical outcomes and client 's quality of l ife by linking assessm ent with goals, intervention and strategies. Provide data for es tablishing cost-benefit and cost-effectiven ess of medical nutrition therapy. Provide inf ormation on referral for other services. Nutrition information which should be documented incl udes: Evaluation of current diet Nutrient assessment d ata Planned medical nutrition therapy Counsellin g and education Acceptance and tolerance level Appetite Planned follow-up Referrals Response t o therapy Any data relevant to client's health/nutritional status Continuing Care Continuing care is an essential component of management and allows for evaluation and reassessment. F ollow-up facilitates achieving behaviour change. Effective Nutritional Care requires more than one visit. The visits provide opportunities to sustain progress and control of the conditions, to review problems, observe the effect of treatment and re-design the management plan and intervention strategies if necessary. Follow-up visits can help to pr ovide the motivation to succeed as well as to establish good relations with the cl ient and reinforce e ducation m essages. 21 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Frequency of Visits Clients starting nutrition thera py may init ially need weekly visits until there is reasonable progress. As goals are met and there is improvement in management, visits may be less frequent. If goals are not being met, the management plan needs to be revised and goals re-assessed (see Figure I) Frequency of visits may be influenced by any of the following - degree of obesity; severity of hypertensi on; type of diabetes ; changes in treatment regimen; level of compliance. Appendix VIII provides details of determin ants of visits. The following chart outlines the type of care which should be undertaken at specific visits.

Clients therefore need to be provided with relevant knowledge and skills . Training the client in self-management is an important strategy in achieving the leve ls of Nutrit ional Care that will re sult in improved health. Self-management training should be tailored not only to the client's specific health condition, but also to his/her life ci rcumstances and st ate of readiness. Referrals An important aspect of the nutr itional ma nagement of clients in the Primary Care System is recogniz ing the need for timely re ferral for specialist care. It takes an active heal th team to provide care for a client with chronic diseases (Appe ndix IX sets out responsibilities of health care team members in the Nutritional Care of clients).

The overall aim should focus on achi eving good health. The same eating and exercise ha bits that support a healthy lifestyle often achieve appropriate body weight. During weight loss, approximately 20 kcals/kg (10 kcals/lb) of current weight is needed to s pare lean body tissue while losing fat. A weight loss of 0.5-1kg (1 - 2 lbs) per week is usually recommend ed. In ord er to achieve desirabl e, practical weight loss which can b e maintained, a reduct ion of 500 k cals/day from present caloric intake i s recommended. At the end of one week, this should achieve a redu ction of 3500 kcals, which translates to 0.5 kg (1 lb) of fat. It usually takes about three months to see the real effe cts of this intervention. The causes of obesity are multifac torial. Me tabolic, gen etic, environmental, cultural, sociological, psychological and b ehavioural factors offer some explanation, but the complete aetiology remains unknown. So me key fa ctors contributing to obesity include dietary intake, sedentary lifestyle and changes in diet, part icularly increased intake of fat and simple sugars. Consumpt ion of ref ined, processed, and \"fast \" foods has been increasing, while the use of indi genous foods such as ground provisions, peas, beans, vegetables and fruits has not ke pt pace. Ob esity results when more food energy is consumed than expended over a period of time. Achieving weight loss in the obes e individua l is not usually easy. Additionall y, only a small percentage of t hose who lose weight are able t o maintain the weight loss. There are no consistent criter ia that will categor ize the type of people who will successfull y lose weight. 27 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean The objectives of nutritional management of obesity are to: 1. Achieve and maintain healthy body weight. 2. Provide op timum Nutritional Care through a nutritionally balanced decre ased calorie diet which will achi eve hea lthy weight loss of 0.5-1kg (1-2 lb) per week. 3. Prevent or control complication s such as high blood pressure, diabetes, h eart disease and elevated uric acid lev els. 4. Avoid or correct unhealthy eating behaviour.

Determine the level of obesity and the spec ific interven tion needs of the client, e.g. elevat ed blood l ipids. See classifica tion for o verweight and obesit y, Appendix X and XI). 2. Set realistic goals. Assist the client to set his/her own short, medium- and long- term goals. A r ealistic goal is lo ss of 5- 10% of init ial body weig ht at a r ate of 0.5-1 kg (1 -2 lb) per week. There is no magic foo d that will achieve a nd maintain weight loss. 3. Distribute calories over approximately six meals for t he day, inc luding sna cks, to prevent over-eat ing. Where this is not possible, work within the clien t's schedule of activities. 4. Provide adequate fluids to aid excretion - at least 8 glasses of wate r per day. 5. If there is fluid retention, decreas e sodium intake. 6. Increase the fibre c ontent of the diet to enc ourage lon ger chewing, create m ore bulk and increase satiety. Include fibre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables and legumes. 7. Decrease t he intake of high caloric foods such as fats (9 Kcal/g) and alcohol (7 Kcal/g). Recommend low-calorie alternativ es to high-calorie food s in the diet. 8. Avoid severe dietary restrictions , sinc e very low calorie diets ma y le ad to reduced Re sting Energy Expenditure (REE) and affect the rate of weight loss. Caloric inta ke less than 1200 kcalories will require stric t clinical supervision. 9. Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor progress and monitor weight using the same scale. 10. Encourage regular physical activit y accor ding to doctor's recommen dations an d client's preference as part of weight loss pla n. 11. Ensure that nutritiona l counselling is highly individualiz ed. 12. Closely monitor obese persons who quit sm oking. There is a tendency to gain weight due to inc reased calor ic intake from craving for sweets. It may be 30 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean necessary t o decrease intake by 100-2 00 kcalories per day just to maintain weight. 13. Encourage the client to participate in a support gr oup and facilitate family involvement. 14. Encourage client to record fluid intake da ily to be able to verify r eduction of calories through fluid. Guid elines for Promoting Self Mana gemen t 1. Develop a weight loss programme with the input of the client. This therapy may take time, as weight loss is a slow proce ss. 2. Provide guidance to client on how to maintain a proper diet. Provide tips on how to choose foods t hat are low er in calories, portion control, eat ing out an d methods of food preparation. 3. Encourage changes in eating b ehavi our and general lifestyle behaviour to facilitate w eight loss. These include: \u0083 Keeping fo od diar ies including food choices, situations that encourage unhealthy eating. This is useful in identifying triggers and sources of excess calories \u0083 Monitoring and recording body weight on a monthly ba sis \u0083 Participat ing in mode rate physical activi ty for most days of the week for at least 1 hour each day \u0083 Avoiding situations that may contribute to over-eating and discuss triggers with care provider \u0083 Modifying the time meals are eaten \u0083 Reducing portion sizes \u0083 Eating slowly \u0083 Using smaller plates and eating utensils \u0083 Choosing d ifferent foods and methods of pre paration \u0083 Substituting low calorie alternat ives for high calorie foods \u0083 Chewing fo od well 31 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 4. Encourage aerobic exercises to increase ener gy output. 5. Discourage fad d ieting which can lead to a weight loss/weight gain pattern t hat may demotivate the client and ma ke weight l oss more difficult. 6. Promote food label reading so that person s will be a ble to make appropriate food choices, avoiding foods which are excessively high in calories. 7. Suggest non-caloric sweeteners to provide a useful alternative to sugar. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Regular physical activity is an essent ial component of any weight management programme and c omplements dietary meas ures. While exerc ise does not nec essarily reduce body weight, body fat is reduced an d basal metabolic rate is increased during and after exercise. Per sons are more likely to exercise if the activity is enjoyable. The type, duration and frequency should be ta ilored to individual ability and health status, but may include swimming, brisk walk ing, jogging and playing games, such as soccer and cricket. Joining with friends and family to exer cise should also be encouraged. 32 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean SECTION III Nutritional Management of Diabetes Mellitus 33 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Blank 34 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resul ting from defects in insulin se cretion and/or uptake. It develops when insulin is absent, not secreted in adequa te amounts or there is diminished tissue response, (that is, so that insulin is not used properl y by the target tissues). There may also be a combin ation of these factors. As a result, the body cannot properly metabolize the macro-nutrients (carbohydrat es, fats and proteins) in the normal way to effectively convert glucose into energy. High levels of glucose accumulate in the blood and spill into the urine. This can result in several complications in volving long-term damage, dysfunction and failure of various organs including the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and blood vessels. Several symptoms can indicat e the presen ce of hyperglycaemia (elevated blood glucose). T hese include frequent urination, increased thirst, we ight loss, so metimes increased hunger, blurred vision, itching and suscepti bility to certain infections. In children, there may be growth impairment. Some persons experience no symptoms and are diagnosed at health screening sessi ons or when they seek medical care for other problems. Some acute life-threate ning consequences ar e associated with diabetes a nd include hyperglycaemia (hig h blood sugar) with ketoacid osis or the non-ketotic hyperosmolar syndro me, both of which can lead to coma. TYPES OF DIABETES Diabetes mellitus can be group ed into thr ee main c ategories : Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Type 1 Type 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune destruction of beta cells of the pancreas. The rate of beta-cell destruction varies an d is quite ra pid in some persons (mainly infants and children) and slower in adults . Type 1 diabetes is more com mon in younger persons but can occur at any age. There is little or no insulin secretion, therefore individuals with this type of di abetes must rely on e xternal sources of insulin for survival. Clients with type 1 di abetes are us ually prone to accumul ation of ketone bodies (ketoacidosis) and have an increased risk of developing very fine blood 35 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean vessel (mic rovascular) and large blood vess el (macrovascular) complication s. Some clients, particularly children, ma y present wi th ketoacidosis at diagnosis. Beta-c ell destruction is dete rmined g enetically and is also rel ated to some environmental factors, which are not clearly defined. Clients with type 1 diabet es are rarel y obese, however, the presence of obesity is not inco mpatible with the disease. Some forms of type 1 diabetes have no known cause. Type 2 Type 2 diabetes refer s to a condition charac terized by insulin resistance and relative rather than absolute insulin deficiency. Mo st persons with this type of diabetes do not need insulin treatment to survive b ut some may require short-term insulin therapy to stabilize th e disease es pecially in periods of stress, pr egnancy and surgery. For many persons wi th Type 2 diabetes, es pecially those who are obese, diet and exercise to achieve weight loss are the main lines of therapy. Medication s should only be i ntroduced when these measures do not achieve desired results. Approximately 90-95% of all persons with diabetes have type 2 and it is more common among adults. Recently, a number of child ren are b eing diagnos ed with type 2 diabetes. These ch ildren are usually obese. Hyperglycaemia develops gradually and may not be diagnosed for several years. The specific aetiologies are not known but ther e is no autoimmune destruction of beta cells. Persons with type 2 diabet es are no t usually pro ne to ketoacidosis but are at increased r isk for macrovascular and micr ovascular complications. Obesity, age, lack of physical activit y and genetic pre-di sposition, increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. It occurs more frequen tly in women with previous history of gestational diabet es. Weight lo ss and/or pharmacological tr eatment of hypergly- caemia ma y improve insulin resistance. Gestational Diabetes This is defined as a degree of gl ucose into lerance which begins or is first re cognised in pregnancy. Women who are markedly obese, have a personal history of gestational diabetes or glycosuria or a strong family history of diab etes are es pecially susceptible. 36 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Diagnosi s of Diabetes Mellitus The criteria for diag nosing diabetes have been revised for standardizat ion. The new cr iteria suggested by T he World Health Org anization (WHO) Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classifi cation of Diabetes Mellitus (2000) outlines three ways to diagnose the disorder. Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus 1. Symptoms of diab etes plus random (casual) plasma glucose concentration > 200m g/dl (11.1m mol/L).

Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours or 3. 2-hr PG > 200mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by WHO, using a glucose load containin g the equivalent of 75g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. Each test must be confirmed, on a subseq uent day, by any one of the thr ee methods. Nutritional Management for Diabetes Nutrition t herapy is an integral component of successful diabetes managem ent and has remain ed one of t he most challenging aspects of care du e to the complexity of nutrition issues. Input from the client in developing intervention is extremely important in ensurin g that the plan is a ppropriate t o the indiv idual's lifestyle and cultural practices. A ll nutrients play an important role in diab etes management, moderation in intake is usually the key. Figure III provides the critical pat h for the nutritional management of Diabetes. 37 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean The major goals of therapy are to achieve metabolic control and to prevent or delay the macro-vascular and micro-v ascular com plication s of diabet es.

Maintain desirable blood lipids Nutrition therapy for persons with type1diabetes should include an individualized meal plan based on usual food intake interrelated with exercise and insulin regimens. For pers ons on conventional insulin therapy, care must be taken to ensure con sistency in the timing and amoun t of food eaten and th e time and action of the insulin used. Individuals should be educated to monitor their blood-glucose levels and adjust insu lin where n ecessary. The aim of nutrition t herapy in type 2 diab etes is to ac hieve gluco se, lipid an d blood sugar control. Many persons with type 2 di abetes are o verweight, therefore a weight loss diet usually improves short- term blood glucose control. For long-term control, several strategies in additi on to weight lo ss can be implemented to achieve and maintain n ear-normal control. Dietary recommendations should be based on a nutritionally adequate diet determined by individual assessment with a reduction in fat, especially saturated fat, and an increase in physical activity. Recommendations for Physical Activity Benefits of physical activity are greatest in the early progression of the d isease. Nevertheless, regular physical activity is encouraged f or all persons with d iabetes. Overall persons living with di abetes should be asked to: Undergo detailed medical evaluation befor e embarkin g on an exercise regim e. Engage in aerobic physical activity daily. Pay careful attention to hydration status duri ng and after exercise. 39 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean FIGURE III: CRITICAL PATH FOR THE NUTR ITIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS ASSESS NUTR IENT ITIONAL STATUS VAL IDATE DIET ORDER (NUTRITIO NIST/DIETIT IAN) 40 PREPARE CARE PLAN IN COLLAB ORAT ION WI TH CLIENT ADVISE CLIE NT & SIGNIFICA NT OTHERS MONITOR NUTRITION CARE PROCES S AND SCHEDULE F OLLO W- UP A PPOINTMENTS INDI CATED TREATMENT GOALS ARE MET RE-EVALUATE/REFER TO PHYSIC IAN FO R SPECIALIZE D CARE DISC USS WIT H PHYS ICIA N APPRO PRIATE RE-ASSESS YES NO habits adopt ed \u0083 Client involved in regular physical activity \u0083 5-10% weight loss achieved, if necess ary Low activity l evel \u0083 Less tha n 5-10% weight loss, where indicated NO SET GOAL WE IGHT Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the ons for Ty Diabet es 1.

If there is no progress with bl ood glucose control after three monthly visits, hypoglycaemic medica tions may be indicated . B. Diabetes in Pregnancy Clients wh o have diabetes and become pregnant will require some re-assessment and modif ication in their management. The aim is for the diet t o achieve appropriate weight gain or control measur es and match age needs, thus contributin g to a healthy outcome. Usually a total weig ht gain of about 11.8 kg (26 pounds) is recommended. Approximately 0.9-1.8 kg (1-2 lbs) should be gained during the first trimester and not more than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) every fortnight thereafter. It is im portant 42 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean to monitor blood glucose levels, urine ke tones, appetite and weight and make adjustments to the me al plan thro ughout th e pregnancy to achieve desired res ults. C. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabet es is a type of diabet es that can oc cur in pregnant women who have not been known to have diabetes befo re. Gestational diabet es usually subsides during the early post-partum period, ho wever, it may recur in subsequent pregnancies. Women who have had gestat ional dia betes are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes late r in life. Factors relating to diab etes in pregnan cy will also apply to gestation al diabetes. Guid elines for Self-M anagement The management of d iabetes rest s heavily wi th the individual and his/her ability to cope with the challenges of living with di abetes. One important management tool is education. Clients who understand what to do and why it should be done ar e more likely to be motivated to participate in achieving and maint aining g ood health outcomes. The following are useful guidel ines to assist th e client with self management. 1. Ensure that the client understands what is diabetes, types, signs an d symptom s, the causes and management of: a) hypoglycae mia b) hyperglyca emia c) ketoacidosis 2. Discuss the role of diet , medication and physi cal activity in controlling diabetes 3. Emphasize the role of blood glucos e monitoring and use of the results 4. Explain conditions under which exercise is not appropriate 5. Train clients to detect and manage complications 6. Discuss ho w/where to access informat ion and resource persons in the community 43 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 7. Teach nutrition label reading - recognizi ng ingredients that mean sugar or carbohydrate 8. Explain managing the diet in special circumstances e.g. travel, parties, eating out, illness. 9. Demonstrate the use of Foods and food grou ps and thei r use in formulating meal plans 10. Explain the importance of self care in achieving optimal results 44 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean SECTION IV Nutritional Management of Hypertension 45 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Blank 46 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Hypertension Hypertension is a major health problem a ffecting a l arge percentage of the adult population in most Caribbean c ountries. T he risk of cardiovasc ular complications and organ damage in persons wi th high blood pressure is increased when other risk factors such as smoki ng, obesity, elevated cholesterol and diabet es are also present. Untreated hypertension can r esult in a number of problems such as stroke, congestive heart failure, renal disease and myocardial infarction. ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis must be established by a doctor, medex or nurse-practitioner. 1. If the init ial systolic reading is betw een 120 and 139 and/or diastolic reading between 80-89 mm Hg, and there is no evidence of end organ damage (see Appendix XII Table 3), repeated BP measurements over six months are necessary. Here the diagnosis is pre-hypertension. 2. If initial d iastolic re adings are between 90-100 m m Hg, an d there is no evidence of end or gan damage, repeated BP measurem ents over t hree months are necessary. The diagnosis of high blood pressure in this group is established by a persistent systolic value 140 mm Hg or dias tolic value 90 mm Hg (Stage 1 ). 3. If initial B P readings are 160/1 00 mm Hg (Stag e 2) and there is no evidence of end-org an damage, BP measurements should be repeated on at least one other occasion within one month. A diagno sis of hypertension is made if BP is consistently 140/90mm Hg. 4. If initial re adings are 180/110 mm Hg (Stage 3) and there is no evidenc e of end-organ damage, t he patient should be re-examin ed within one week. In some cases therapy should be started, if the risk level assessment so warrants (see Appendix XII, Ta ble 3). 5. Labile hypertensives' will show fluctuati on of BP from normal to Stage 1 or higher hypertensive ranges and such pati ents should be monitored regularly. Persistence of diastolic readings above 90 mm Hg will usua lly indicate established hypertensi on. 47 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 6. Diagnosis can be est ablished on the basi s of a single diastolic pressure >100 mm Hg, if there is evidence of target organ damage. The patient should be classified as hyp ertensive with spec ific target o rgan disea se, risk level assessed (see Appendix XII, Table 3) and treatment begun. 7. Isolated systolic hypertension is diagno sed when there is an average of fou r readings 140 mm Hg on two occasions with a diastolic BP <90 mm Hg (JNC 7 criteria). Isolated systolic should be carefully re-evaluat ed at intervals. 8. \"White-coat hypertension\" may occur in pati ents whose BP is raised only in the clinic but not at other times. A White-coat effect may further raise BP in a patient with hypertension. 9. Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM) over 24 hours is warranted for evaluation of White-coat Hypertension or White-coat effect or for evaluation of patients with resista nt hypertension, i.e. hypert ension uncontrolled by triple therapy. TREATMENT Managing hypertensi on efficiently is impo rtant in achieving max imum redu ction in the total health risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. All risk fac tors and co-morbid condition s must be identified and treat ed. These include smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, d iabetes and other clinical conditions. A compreh ensive nutrition assessment and r eview of historical and laboratory data will provide a good indication of need for nutrition intervention. Laboratory data should include determ ination of haemoglo bin, serum sodium, po tassium, creatinine, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile. Urine examinatio n should include microscopy and analysis for blood and protein. Unless hypertension is at an urgent level, life-style mo difications should initially be employed and form the cornerstone of treatmen t at all stages of hi gh blood pressure. These include weight loss in the overweig ht or obese, regular physical activity, reduction in dietary sodium and reduced consumption of caffeine and alcohol. If these modifications do not achieve treatm ent goals o r if there are signs o f target organ damage, medication should be added to the treatment regim en. Hypertension is both a cause an d a conseq uence of renal disease. In hypertensive patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have micro-album inuria or clinical albuminuria, treatment must be effected to delay prog ression from albuminuria t o overt nephropathy. Such individuals shou ld be referred to medical and nutrition specialists. 48 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean FIGURE I V: CRITI CAL PA TH FOR ITIONAL MANAGE HYPERT ENSION DIET ORDER (NUTRITIO NIST/DIETIT IAN) SET GOAL WE IGHT 49 PREPARE CARE PLAN IN COLLABORATI ON W ITH CLIENT ADVISE CLIE NT & SIGNIFICA NT OTHERS MONITOR NUTRITION CARE PROCES S AND SCHED ULE FOLL OW- UP A PPOINTMENTS INDI CATED TREATMENT GOALS ARE MET RE-EVALUATE/REFER TO PHYSIC IAN FO R SPECIALIZE D CARE DISC USS WIT H PHYS ICIA N APPRO PRIATE RE-ASSESS YES Hg BP< 130/80 ting behaviour/l \u0083 Client involved in regular physical activity loss achie co BP >140/90 m m Hg BP> 130/80 mm pe rsons with renal disease/ we ight Low activity l evel \u0083 Signs of complication NO Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Objecti ves 1. Control blo od pressure at a safe level to prevent damage to target organs e.g. heart, kid neys, brain, thereby reducing the likelihood of congestive heart failure, ren al failure and stroke 2. Achieve weight loss in the overweight or obese client. 3. Reduce excessive intake of sodium, alcohol and caffein e. 4. Increase in take of potassium and calcium. 5. Educate th e client on the role of nutr ition in the pr evention and control of hypertensi on. 6. Recommend a nutritionally adequate diet, balancing food intake with physi cal activity to achieve optimum results. 7. Address risk factors pr esent e.g. cigarette smoking. Steps in the Nutritional Management of Persons With Hypertension 1. Set treatment goals with input fro m clients 2. Prepare Nutritional Care plan 3. Provide needed car e 4. Evaluate care 5. Take neces sary corrective action 6. Reassess n utrition status 7. Provide necessary follow-up care 8. Document in medical records 50 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension menda tions Trea tment 1. Conduct thorough review of c linical history and physical examination to identify factors which may impa ct on blood pressure levels. 2. Determine severity of hypertensi on and sp ecific int ervention nee ds of patients e.g. reduced sodium intake, weight loss, increased potassium intake, need to lower blood lipids. 3. Determine caloric/nutrient needs to facilitate weight loss if ne cessary (see section on Obesity). 4. Monitor blood pressure levels, weight management programme and laboratory values. 5. Provide a nutritionally balanced diet with a variety of foods from all the food groups to meet the indivi dual diet prescription. 6. Monitor sodium intake. For all clients on diuretics, a diet containing 2g of sodium per day is usually sufficient. A normal diet of 2-4 g sodium daily is usually a practical guide, but must be monit ored closel y and modified to meet the needs of the individual client. 7. Limit con sumption of caffeine and al coholic beverages. Decaffeinat ed beverages may be sub stituted for caffeinated ones. 8. Modify behaviour to include healthy lifestyle practices. 9. Include a regular physical activity programme agreed on with the doctor. Guid elines for Self-M anagement 1. Discuss h ypertension, its causes, risk factors and compl ications. 2. Explain the role of good nutrition in the context of hype rtension control. 3. Teach persons to read food labels. This will help to a void excessive intake of sodium in the diet. 51 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 4. Encourage clients to u se alternatives such as herbs and spices to fl avour food s instead of salt. Suggest that they taste food before adding salt and to avoid adding salt after the food has been cooked. 5. Explain the role of food intake and phys ical activity in achieving weight loss and in lowering blood pressure. 6. Discuss sources of caffeine, e.g. coff ee, cola beverages, tea and chocolate. 7. Explain that it takes time to see the resu lts o f nutrition intervention so patients will be mor e patient in expecting results. 8. Discuss the possible ef fects of sodium on blood pressur e. 9.

The diet history provides valuable information about the client's past and/or cur rent food behaviours. Diet What the person usually eats or drinks. The health worker must be skilled at collecting data, as o ften clients will omit important informatio n and may reveal what they eat but not what they drink. Beverages can be significant sour ces of calories and nutrients. History Recording, analyzing, correlating and explaining past events. How many meals the individual eats Food group s represented Quantity eaten Meal preparation met hods Snacks eaten Social and family history Taking a d iet history involves interviewing the client. The interview serves two important purposes: It helps to build a relationship between th e client and the health worker so that he/she can express his/her feelin gs honestly without judgment. It generates the infor mation needed to develop a realistic meal plan. Components of the di et history are: Collecting data Recording data Analyzing data Integrating the information to de velop client profile 57 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Preparing f or the interview: Obtain client profile by reviewing medical records. Schedule the interview. Find a location that is conducive to confidentiality, concentration, car e and comfort. If the client thinks tha t confide ntiality is compromised, he/she will be less likely t o tell the tr uth. Avoid distractions. Both the interviewer and the client need to be comfortable. Ideally, the interviewer should be seated at a level similar to the client so that eye contact can be established. The interviewer must demonstrate a caring personality and should avoid reacting to informatio n given by the client. Both ve rbal and no n-verbal c ommunication can influence the client's reaction. INTERVIEWING S KILLS Several int erviewing s kills have been de veloped and t ested by ex perts in communi- cation and counselling: Verbal skills These include listening and sharing . Listening reassures th e client that he/she is being heard. Listening response s include exp loratory clarificat ion and empathy. Exploratory responses are passive and are reg arded as in formation sharing, while empathy and clarificat ion se ek to inform the client that he/she is heard and understood. Sharing responses all ow the counsellor to share his/her thoughts and feel ings with the cli ents. Non-verbal skills Silent eye contact Gentle touch 58 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Silence on the part of the caregiver can a llow the client time to gather his/ her thoughts. Be careful about in vading the client's space. The gentle touch conveys empathy. Roadblocks to com municati on Ordering rather than discussing Moralizing Lecturing Judging or ridiculing Initiating the interview Introduce yourself Inform the client about the purpo se and benefits of the interview. Start the interview - use open-ended qu estio ns which allows the client to express hi m/her self without pr ejudice Closing the Intervi ew Nearing the end of the interview, inform th e client of the available time left for the session and ask him/her for any additio nal information. At this time, pointed / probing qu estions may be asked to obt ain missing inf ormation. Make plans for follow-up. METHODS OF OBTAINING A DIET HISTORY 1. 24 hour recall Provides information on food intake of the previous 24 hours. Advantages \u0083 A quick and easy met hod \u0083 Writing an d reading skills are not required by the client \u0083 Does not influence the usual eating pattern of the client 59 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean Limita tions \u0083 Client may not tell the truth \u0083 Requires the client to recall foods (memory dependent) \u0083 May not re present usual intake \u0083 Requires a skilled interviewer 2.

Advantages \u0083 Easily stan dardized \u0083 Beneficial when used with the 24 hour recall \u0083 Provides a picture of food consumption ov er a period of time with an overall picture of key nutrients \u0083 Does not influence the usual diet Limita tions \u0083 Reading an d writing skills are required unle ss the client is interviewed \u0083 Does not provide specific inform ation on quantities consumed or on meal pattern \u0083 Food list may not be representative of all the foods in the client's diet \u0083 Knowledge of portion sizes may be required 60 Protocol for t he Nutritional Management of Obesit y, Di abetes and Hypertension in the Cari bbean 4. Food Record/Diaries Provide 3 to 7 day records of actual food intake. Advantages \u0083 Eliminates errors of recall \u0083 A record of the type a nd amount of food eat en and the time of consumption Limita tions \u0083 Reading an d writing skills are required \u0083 Requires the client to be knowledgeable about portion sizes \u0083 Food intak e may be influenced and therefore changes during the period of recording \u0083 Requires a recording period of at leas t 3 days ( one weekend day should be included) 5.

Within each food list, one exchange in the serving size descri bed (measure) is appr oximately equal to another in calories, carbohydrate, protein or fat. The exchange list should be used in consultation with a nutrition professi onal who would individualise the treatment plan a fter reviewing the nutrition and health history and calculate the appropriate amoun t of calories and carbohydrate required. The list in this appendix is divide d into: 1. The Carbohydrate Group which includes the staples foods, vegetables and fruits. Foods from this list can be interch anged in t he meal plan since each group contains roughly equal amounts of calories and carbohydrate. 2. The Meat and Meat Substitute Group which includes sources of protein from legumes and nuts as well as foods from animals. 3. The Fat Group which includes familiar fat source s and is divided into list of unsaturated and saturated fats.

Th e Harr is B enedict Equation for Basal Energy Expenditure (B EE) which is often used to estim ate the minimum amount of energy needed by the bo dy at rest (basal energy), uses age, height and weight. For men: BEE (kcals/day) = 66.5 + (13.8 x W) + (5.0 x H) - (6.8 x A) For women: BEE (kcals/day) = 655.1 + (9.6 x W) + (1.8 x H) - (4.7 x A) W = weight in kilograms H = height in centimeters A = age in years Another method for estimating energy n eeds is ca lculation o f Resting Energy Expenditur e (REE). For men: REE (kcals/day) = 1.0 x W x 24 For women: REE (kcals/day) = 0.95 x W x 24 BEE and REE are multiplied by an activi ty factor to estimate total energy expenditur e.

Th e combined efforts, k nowledge, attitudes and skills of the team can help to ensu re safe and effectiv e Nutritional Care , particularly in the Caribbean where the ava ilability of nutritionist s and diet itians is limited.
