Jill is diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder and drug dependency, now in full remission. Jill has received multiple mental health services for 30+ years. Jill was born in Texas into a \"military family\" who moved \"a lot\" when she was a young child. When she was in the 3rdgrade her family returned to Minnesota. She attended high school in Minnetonka and college at Winona State University. Her mental health symptoms emerged after starting college. At the same time her consumption of alcohol increased. She remembers feeling \"paranoid and delusional\". She left Winona State that 1styear. For the next several years Jill lived on the east coast, joined the Navy, and held various short -term jobs. She attempted to live independently in her own apartment. Her alcohol abuse continued, as did her mental health symptoms. Her auditory hallucinations began in the Navy and she had a suicide attempt. 59Questions? Email DHS.HCBSImprovement@state.mn.usDuring this time, she did see a psychiatrist, but did not receive treatment or get connected to supportive services. She left the Navy, returned home to Minnesota for 5 years moved to California and stayed there for 3 years. Most of that time she was homeless, often living on Venice Beach. By this time she had stopped using alcohol and had started street drugs. She had an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization once in California and lived in a homeless shelter, but still did not receive treatment for either her mental health symptoms or her chemical dependency. 60Questions? Email DHS.HCBSImprovement@state.mn.usAt some point she returned to Minnesota, still struggling with her illness and addiction issues. She again attempted to live on her own, but often would reconnect with her \"using friends\" and fail. Her mother sought and found assistance for her. Over the next 4 years she would frequently have inpatient hospitalizations, be discharged to her apartment, relapse and again be admitted. She had a second suicide attempt and was hospitalized at Wilmar State Hospital, during that time she was legally committed. She was assigned a Behavioral Health Case Manager. She received evaluation and treatment for both her mental health and chemical dependency concerns. She \"self - admitted\" to HCMC and received ECT therapy and aftercare treatment at Bill Kelly IRTS. After one of her multiple hospitalizations she was discharged to CIP's Passageway which at the time was a Rule 36 facility. She was also evaluated for waivered services and was given a CADI waiver. In 2007, a female AFC also operated by CIP had an opening and Jill was accepted. Jill currently resides at this same AFC. or her chemical dependency. 61Questions?
