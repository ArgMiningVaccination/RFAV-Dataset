I really enjoyed recording this episode, and I think you will enjoy it as well. Today I am chatting with Ari Calhoun all about natural solutions to autism. We talk about autism prevalence and how rates of autism have risen over time. We also talk about the things that have been theorized to contribute to that rise. Dr. Calhoun shares so much knowledge about what causes autism including the first signs and symptoms of autism and what steps you should take if you are concerned. Dr. Calhoun also shares the main root cause that biomedical or functional medicine doctors address when treating autism. We talk about gut health, toxicity, immune system regulation, mitochondria health, and nutrient imbalances. We also talk about how parents can take a proactive approach and what they should focus on. If you are listening to this episode and you or someone you know are navigating through any of the health issues we discuss, I would be more than happy to support you in the journey!
