Medicaid and CHIP play a key role in ensuring that low - income children get health care coverage, access to a comprehensive set of benefits, and other medically necessary services. CMS's 2014 core set of health care quality measures for children in Medicaid and CHIP (referred to as the Child Core Set) includes 23 measures that address the following domains of care: Primary Care Access and Preventive Care Perinatal Care Care of Acute and Chronic Conditions Behavioral Health Care Dental and Oral Health Services Over the past five years, CMS and states have continued to break new ground with reporting on CMS's Child Core Set. This Chart Pack summarizes state reporting on the quality of health care furnished to children covered by Medicaid and CHIP during FFY 2014, which generally covers care delivered in calendar year 2013. This Chart Pack includes detailed analysis of state performance on 19 measures. For a measure to be publicly reported, data must be provided to CMS by at least 25 states and meet internal standards for quality . The information presented in this Chart Pack is abstracted from the 2015 Annual Secretary's Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, which is available online at https:// About the 2014 Child Core Set 23 measures that address key aspects of health care access and quality for children and pregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP Detailed analysis of state performance on 19 publicly reported measures 5OVERVIEW OF STATE REPORTING OF THE 2014 CHILD CORE SET 6Number of Child Core Set Measures Reported by States, FFY 2014 Sources: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports and Form CMS -416 reports.

Preventive services include immunizations, screenings, and counseling to support healthy living. Access to regular primary care and services that help prevent infectious and chronic disease and other health conditions helps people to live longer, healthier lives and improve the health of the population. This section includes findings for the nine Child Core Set measures used to assess primary care access and preventive care in Medicaid and CHIP that were reported by at least 25 states for FFY 2014. These measures are among the most frequently reported measures in the Child Core Set . Child and Adolescent Access to Primary Care Practitioners Well-Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life Well-Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Years of Life Adolescent Well -Care Visits Childhood Immunization Status Immunization Status for Adolescents Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine for Female Adolescents Body Mass Index for Children and Adolescents Chlamydia Screening in Women For more information about the Primary Care access and Preventive Care measures, see the domain -specific report at http Care Access and Preventive Care 1396to percent among the four age categories for this measure Access to primary care practitioners (PCPs) is essential for all children. Whether children have a comprehensive well -care visit or see a PCP when they are sick, all primary care visits offer the opportunity for routine care. A basic measure of access to PCPs is whether children ages 1 to 6 had a visit in the past year and children ages 7 to 19 had a visit in the past two years. Child and Adolescent Access to Primary Care Practitioners Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015 Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children and adolescents ages 12 months to 19 years who had a visit with a PCP. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population.

The Childhood Immunization Status measure includes 10 rates for individual vaccines ( DTaP ; IPV ; PCV; HepA ; RV; and influenza) and 9 combination rates . The most common combination rate reported by states is \"Combination 3,\" which includes all of the vaccines except HepA , RV, and flu and requires at least two HiBvaccines by age 2. Childhood Immunization Status A median of 67 percent of children were up to date on recommended immunizations (Combination 3) by their second birthday (35 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children who turned 2 years old during the measurement year and had specific vaccines and combinations of vaccines by their second birthday. This measure is reported as 10 separate immunization rates and 9 combination rates. In the Secretary's Report, state performance is assessed on the basis of the Combination 3 rate. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population.Percentage of Children Up to Date on Recommended Immunizations (Combination 3) by their Second Birthday, FFY 2014 (n = 35 states) 25Childhood Immunization Status (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015. Notes: This exhibit excludes three states (TX, WY, and WI) that used Child Core Set specifications to calculate the measure but did not provide data for Combination 3 and one state (SC) that did not use Child Core Set specifications to calculate the measure.

Overweight and obesity are most commonly assessed based on the child's body mass index (BMI), which is calculated based on a child's height and weight, adjusting for age and gender. This measure indicates the frequency with which the BMI percentile is recorded in the medical record. Body Mass Index (BMI) Assessment for Children and Adolescents A median of 43 percent of children and adolescents with an outpatient visit had a BMI percentile documented in their medical record (33 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of children ages 3 to 17 who had an outpatient visit with a primary care practitioner (PCP) or obstetrical/gynecological (OB/ GYN ) practitioner and whose weight is classified based on body mass index (BMI) percentile for age and gender. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population.Percentage of Children Whose Weight is Classified Based on BMI Percentile, FFY 2014 (n = 33 states) 31Body Mass Index (BMI) Assessment for Children and Adolescents (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015.

Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection and easy to cure when it is detected. However, most people have no symptoms and are not aware they are infected. Left untreated, Chlamydia can affect a woman's ability to have children. The Child Core Set reports Chlamydia screening rates for women ages 16 to 20. Chlamydia Screening in Women A median of 48 percent of sexually active women ages 16 to 20 were tested for Chlamydia (37 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015. Notes: This measure identifies the percentage of women ages 16 to 20 who were identified as sexually active and had at least one Chlamydia test during the measurement year. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure-eligible population.Percentage of Sexually Active Women Ages 16 to 20 Receiving At Least One Test for Chlamydia, FFY 2014 (n = 37 states) 33Chlamydia Screening in Women (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015.

As the largest payer for maternity care in the United States, Medicaid has an important role to play in improving perinatal health outcomes. Despite improvements in access to coverage and care, the rate of births reported as preterm or low birth weight among women enrolled in Medicaid is higher than the rate for those who are privately insured. This section includes findings for the Child Core Set measures used to assess perinatal care in Medicaid that were reported by at least 25 states for FFY 2014. Timeliness of Prenatal Care Frequency of Ongoing Prenatal Care Live Births Weighing Less than 2,500 Grams Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections in Neonatal Intensive Care Units For more information about the Perinatal Care measures, see the domain- of prenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy facilitates a comprehensive assessment of a woman's health history, pregnancy risk, and health knowledge. Early screening and referrals for specialized care can prevent pregnancy complications resulting from pre- existing health conditions or promote access to recommended care. The measure indicates how often Medicaid/CHIP enrollees receive timely prenatal care.

Premature infants in NICUs are particularly susceptible to infection because of their immature immune systems. This measure reports the rate of CLABSIs in NICUs . The CLABSI measure is obtained from data reported by hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network. The Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) compares the number of infections reported in a facility or state to the baseline U.S. experience, adjusting for several risk factors. Among the 41 states with CLABSI rates for 2013, the SIRs ranged from 0.175 to 0.954. An SIR less than 1 means that fewer infections occurred relative to what would have been predicted given the baseline data. An SIR greater than 1 means that more infections occurred relative to what would have been predicted given the baseline data. An SIR equal to 1 means that the number of infections is no different than the baseline period.Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections in Neonatal Intensive Care Units 31 states had a significant decrease in infections since the baseline period (41 states) 42Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (continued) Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013 National and State Healthcare-Associated Infections Standardized Infection Ratio Report, Table 3d, available at http:// www.cdc.gov/hai/excel/hai-progress -report/ HAI-Progress-Tables.xlsx .Geographic Variation in State Performance on Central Line- Associated Blood Stream Infections ( CLABSIs ) in Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ), 2013 (n = 41 states) 43Children covered by Medicaid and CHIP have higher rates of physical, developmental, and intellectual health problems than privately insured children. Ensuring that children covered by Medicaid and CHIP receive the necessary monitoring and management for acute and chronic conditions may reduce the need for more costly care later and improve their chances of leading healthy, productive lives . The extent to which children receive safe, timely, and effective care for acute and chronic conditions is a key indicator of the quality of care provided in Medicaid and CHIP. This section includes findings for the Child Core Set measures used to assess the care of acute and chronic conditions in Medicaid that were reported by at least 25 states for FFY 2014. Ambulatory Care: Emergency Department Visits Medication Management for People with Asthma For more information about the Acute and Chronic Conditions measures, see the domain -specific report at of Acute and Chronic Conditions 44Unnecessary visits to a hospital emergency department (ED) may indicate lack of access to more appropriate sources of medical care, such as primary care providers or specialists. Excessive visits to the ED can result in overcrowding and increased ED wait time. Understanding trends in ED visits among children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP can help states identify strategies to improve access to and utilization of appropriate sources of care. Performance on this measure is being publicly reported for the first time. Ambulatory Care: Emergency Department Visits Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015. Notes: This measure identifies the rate of ED visits per 1,000 enrollee months among children up to age 19.

Children with persistent asthma who regularly take their prescribed controller medications experience fewer asthma episodes, resulting in less frequent trips to the emergency department and decreased costs associated with care. This measure is an indicator of consistent use of asthma controller medications among children with moderate to severe asthma. Performance on this measure is being publicly reported for the first time.Medication Management for People with Asthma A median of 31 percent of children ages 5 to 20 remained on asthma controller medication for at least 75 percent of their treatment period (25 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports as of May 8, 2015.

For the purpose of the Secretary's Report, the term \"behavioral health care\" refers to treatment of mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and other behavioral conditions, such as attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Improvement of benefit design and service delivery for behavioral health care in Medicaid and CHIP is a high priority for CMS, in collaboration with other federal agencies, states, providers, and consumers. This section includes findings for the Child Core Set measures used to assess behavioral health care in Medicaid that were reported by at least 25 states for FFY 2014. Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness Follow -Up Within 7 Days of Discharge Follow -Up Within 30 Days of Discharge Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Medication Initiation Phase Continuation and Maintenance Phase For more information about the Behavioral Health Care measures, see the domain - specific report at http:// www.medicaid.gov/medicaid -chip-program -information/by Care 49After discharge from inpatient treatment for mental illness, follow -up outpatient mental health treatment is necessary to manage medications, continue therapy, facilitate transitions to home and school, and generally prevent readmissions due to the lack of continuous care. Recommended post -discharge treatment includes a visit with an outpatient mental health provider within 30 days of discharge and ideally, within 7 days of discharge.

Children's oral health is important to their overall health, both in childhood and later in adulthood. Improving children's access to oral health care in Medicaid and CHIP continues to be a focus of federal and state efforts. This section includes findings for the Child Core Set measures used to assess dental and oral health services in Medicaid that were reported by at least 25 states for FFY 2014. Preventive Dental Services Dental Treatment Services For more information about the Dental and Oral Health measures, see the domain- specific report at Oral Health Services 56Tooth decay, or dental caries, is one of the most common chronic diseases of children. The disease is almost entirely preventable through a combination of good oral health habits at home, a healthy diet, and early and regular use of preventive dental services. This measure assess the percentage of children ages 1 to 20 that received preventive dental services.Preventive Dental Services A median of 48 percent of children ages 1 to 20 had a preventive dental service (51 states) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Form CMS -416 reports as of September 29, 2015.

The Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections ( CLABSI ) and the CAHPS Health Plan Survey measures were excluded from this table because the measures use a summary statistic different from those in this table. a Combination 3 includes four doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis ( DTaP ); three doses of polio one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); two doses of H influenza type B ( HiB); three doses of hepatitis B ( HepB ), one dose of chicken pox four doses of pneumococcal conjugate ( PCV). b Combination 1 includes one dose of meningococcal vaccine and one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or one tetanus, diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) vaccine.Measure Measure DescriptionNumber of States Reporting Using Core Set Specifications Mean Median25th Percentile75th Percentile Care of Acute and Chronic Conditions (continued) Medication Management for People with Asthma: 12- 18 YearsPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication and Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period25 29.7 28.2 23.3 37.9 Medication Management for People with Asthma: 19- 20 YearsPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication and Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period16 33.7 33.2 25.2 41.2 Medication Management for People with Asthma: 5- 20 YearsPercentage Dispensed Appropriate Medication and Remained on Medication for at Least 75 Percent of Treatment Period25 32.7 31.2 24.5 38.9 Behavioral Health Care Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness: 6- 20 YearsPercentage of Discharges with a Follow -Up Visit within 7 Days34 44.8 43.9 32.0 62.9 Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness: 6- 20 YearsPercentage of Discharges with a Follow -Up Visit within 30 Days34 64.2 65.2 51.9 78.3 Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication: 6- 12 YearsPercentage with 1 Follow -Up Visit during the Initiation Phase34 44.2 44.1 35.3 53.3 Follow -Up Care for Children Prescribed ADHD Medication: 6- 12 YearsPercentage with at least 2 Follow -Up Visits during the Continuation and Maintenance Phase31 53.9 56.5 45.3 63.1 Dental and Oral Health ServicesPreventive Dental Services: 1- 20 Years Percentage with At Least One Preventive Dental Service 51 45.6 47.6 42.5 50.6 Dental Treatment Services: 1- 20 Years Percentage with At Least One Dental Treatment Service 51 23.5 22.3 20.2 25.2 72Changes in Performance Rates on Frequently Reported Child Core Set Measures, FFY 2012- 2014 MeasureNumber of States Reporting Using Core Set SpecificationsFFY 2012 FFY 2013 FFY 2014 Mean Visits: 12- 21 Years40 43.9 44.3 56.9 Body Assessment: 3 21.9 0.9 51.9 33.9 33.8 3.3 52.8 42.4 42.6 5.8 67.1 73Changes in Performance Rates on Frequently Reported Child Core Set Measures, FFY 2012- 2014 (continued) Source: Mathematica analysis of FFY 2014 Child CARTS reports. Notes: The term \"states\" includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This table includes measures that were reported by 20 or more states using Child Core Set specifications for all three years (FFY 2012- 2014). Means are calculated as the unweighted average of all state rates. When a state reported separate rates for its Medicaid and CHIP populations, the mean and median rates were calculated using the rate for the larger measure- eligible population. Data from previous years may be updated based on new information received after publication of the Annual Secretary's Report.MeasureNumber of States Reporting Using Core Set SpecificationsFFY 2012 FFY 2013 FFY 2014 Mean 52.0 73.7 Health Care Follow -Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness: 6- 20 Years22 48.8 48.4 40.1 60.6 47.6 43.2 33.7 63.5 44.8 42.4 32.0 63.2 Follow -Up After Hospitalization Mental 12 Years26 63.0 Dental and Oral Health Services Preventive Dental Services: 1- 20 Years51 44.1 45.5 38.4 50.5 45.4 47.0 40.8 51.4 45.6 47.6 42.5 50.6 Dental Treatment Services: 1- 20 Years51 23.7 22.8 19.6 26.0 24.1 22.7 19.6 26.9 23.5 22.3 20.2 25.2 74The 2015 Annual Report on the Quality of Care for Children in Medicaid and CHIP is available at resources related to the include: Technical Specifications and Resource Manuals for the Child Core Set, Technical assistance resources for states, and Other background information on the Child Core Set.
