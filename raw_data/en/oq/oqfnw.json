It is becoming a worldwide trend.. India is a little bit behind, but it is going to catch up and get there,\" Pinky Daga, CEO of Thrive Art & Soul, and curator of Quantum Energy Conclave, told . Thriive Art & Soul, a holistic wellness portal is hosting the three-day Quantum Energy Conclave 2 at a nearby venue from January 26, aiming to pioneer the bridging of Science with Alternative as well as Allopathic medicine in India. The conclave is considered India's only conference where the greatest global minds in Energy Medicine share the latest developments in Quantum Energy Medicine. One among non-invasive forms of alternative medicine, Quantum Energy Medicine is a healing technique to correct energy imbalance in the human body by activating the natural healing resources present within and thereby addressing any physical, mental or behavioural problems. Therapists also use cutting-edge Quantum Energy devices and high precision Quantum Energy diagnostic tools like [Radionics](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/radionics) , Scenar Cosmodic, SE-5, QLaser, TimeWaver and HRV. Noting that energy is always there in one's body, whether an individual is in perfect health or not, Dr [Nipa Das](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/nipa-das) , an expert in Kinesiology, Energy Medicine said it is the frequency that differs. \"It is a wave.. If an individual is in perfect health it will be smooth, but if you are not, it will not be smooth,\" she said, adding that therapies of Quantum Energy Medicine can be used to make it smooth along with practices like meditation and everyday exercises to maintain the waves. Experts opine that Quantum Energy Medicine,in tandem with conventional methods, will be the future of medicine and that is why it is also known as \"complimentary\" healing therapy. Dr Nipa Das opined that conventional medicine, like allopathy, can be complementary to Quantum Energy Medicine and added that \"it is because we have the whole gamete, and allopathy is just little, a part of it.\" Terming Energy Medicine as a \"holistic\" treatment from diagnosis to healing of ailments, she said we are not treating symptoms, we are treating holistically the whole body. \"Whole body is one, it is not separate. So when we treat your body, where ever energy is suppose to go it will go and heal you,\" Das added Noting that alternative or energy healing sector is largely unorganised and lacks funding for research and collaborations, practitioners and exponents stressed the need for efforts in this regard that would in turn help in further popularising the benefits of this form of medicine. Daga said Thriive is looking at working with the Ministry of Ayush for verification and certification of therapists and healers. Suggesting that there is a need for Medical Doctors and energy medicine therapists to know each other's traits and exchange ideas in order to work complimentarily with each other for the holistic treatment of patients, Das said the field of energy medicine lacks money for research. However, she hoped money would come in looking at the potential the therapy has in addressing the health needs of large population. "}
