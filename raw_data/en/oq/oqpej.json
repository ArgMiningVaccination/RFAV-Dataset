Lastes news & blog. Info & FAQ. This section provides useful information and answers to frequently asked questions about a particular topic or service. - Our Therapy SessionDuring an acupuncture treatment session, the acupuncturist will ask the patient about their medical history and current health concerns. We will then conduct a physical examination and determine the appropriate acupuncture points to treat the patient's specific issues. The acupuncturist will sterilize the skin at these points and insert thin needles into the skin, which are typically left in place for 20-30 minutes. The acupuncturist may also use techniques such as heat therapy during the treatment. After the needles are removed, the patient may be given recommendations for at-home care. Acupuncture treatment sessions typically last 60-90 minutes. - How does acupuncture work?The mechanism of action for acupuncture remains largely unknown. It is possible that this is due to multiple mechanisms at play. It has been clearly demonstrated time and again that stimulating certain points on the body via insertion of an acupuncture needle has a physiological effect. Sometimes this effect is the release of neurotransmitters, which may cause the patient to report feeling happy, calm, balanced, or peaceful. Other times the effect is immediate and dramatic pain relief. Other effects include support of the body systems including the lymphatic, endocrine, respiratory, major organ, digestive, and reproductive systems. - Who can have acupuncture treatment?There is no limitation in terms of age, sex or condition regarding acupuncture treatment. - Is Acupuncture Safe?In the hands of a licensed practitioner acupuncture is a very safe, pain-free, effective, treatment for many acute and chronic conditions that has been used for thousands of years. - Do acupuncture needles hurt?This is the most commonly asked question. Acupuncture needles are quite different from the needles that are used to draw blood or give injections (hypodermic needles). While a hypodermic needle is hollow, an acupuncture needle is solid with a fine point for easy insertion. An acupuncture needle is also significantly thinner \u2014 about the diameter of a human hair. Roughly 30 acupuncture needles can fit inside the barrel of a hypodermic needle. You may feel a small prick, pressure, tingling, or no sensation at all. Some points may be more sensitive than others due to having a stronger energetic action - Can I exercise, go to a totalbalance class, get a massage, go to physical therapy, etc. before or after acupuncture?
