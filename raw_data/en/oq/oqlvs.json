It's time to treat them the same as adults in our border policy.\" With this change, everyone 12 and older needs to have their own Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form that reflects their own vaccination status. Adults can complete the form on behalf of children. People who were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before arriving do not have to isolate, but testing is recommended. People who are not fully vaccinated must isolate for at least seven days and get two negative test results in Nova Scotia to stop isolating after seven days. They must be lab-based tests, not rapid tests. Children who are 11 and under will continue to isolate with the least vaccinated adult they are traveling with. They can be included on the Nova Scotia Safe Check-in form for that adult. International travelers continue to follow federal requirements under the Quarantine Act.
