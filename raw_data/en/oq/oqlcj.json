Ayurveda emphasizes re- establishing balance in the body through diet, lifestyle, exercise, and body cleansing, and on the health of the mind, body, and spirit. According to Ayurveda, everything is composed of five elements: air, water, fire, earth, and space. These elements combine to form the three doshas i.e. Vata kapha pitta The vata dosha is a combination of space and air. It controls movement and is responsible for basic body processes such as breathing, cell division and circulation. Vata body areas are the large intestine, pelvis, bones, skin, ears, and thighs. People with vata as their main dosha are believed to be quick-thinking, thin, and fast, and are susceptible to anxiety, dry skin, and constipation. The kapha dosha represents the elements of water and earth. Kapha is believed to be responsible for strength, immunity, and growth. Kapha body areas are the chest, lungs, and spinal fluid.

After being crushed and dissolved in alcohol and/or water, the selected substance undergoes a long process of dilution and succession (a process that involves vigorous shaking of the solution). The solution is then stored. Since they're so diluted, homeopathic remedies don't usually cause adverse effects. In some cases, however, patients may briefly feel worse after first beginning their homeopathic treatment. 1. A surgical problem which has progressed far beyond its initial stages might not respond to homoeopathy. 2. Some sudden life threatening situations like heart attacks, paralytic strokes, diabetic comas etc. might have to be initially treated with allopathy, till the patient is out of danger. 3. It is relatively slow acting as compared to the steroids. 4. The success rate is not 100%.

Biofeedback is a group of therapeutic procedures that use electronic or electromechanical instruments to measure the process and information to person about their neuromuscular and autonomic nervous system. The information or feed back is given in physical, physiological activity or visual feedback signals. People are trained to exercise some control over the way their bodies work and involves measuring a subject's bodily processes such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature using electronic sensors. Biofeedback helps a person to be more aware of what his body is doing, and to bring reactions under control. During relaxation the feeling may be uncovered that client cannot cope with them.

Biologically based therapies in complementary and alternative medicine use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. There are mainly following types of biological based therapy: Herbal Medicine Orthomolecular Medicine Herbal medicine is a system, which uses various remedies derived from plants and their extracts to treat disorders and maintain good health. Either a whole single herb or a mixture of different herbs can be used. Though herbal medicine exhibits a slower and deeper action they assist the body to eliminate and detoxify,thus taking care of the problem that's causing the symptoms. Herbal medicines are available as extracts, infusions, pills, and powders. Orthomolecular medicine involves the use of proper nutrition or nutritional supplements to maintain and restore health. Orthomolecular medicine uses combinations of minerals, vitamins and amino acids normally found in the body to treat specific conditions. Chiropractic is based on the theory that disease conditions result from misalignments of body structures, especially the spine. Due to this misalignment pressure is placed on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column resulting in decreased function of the nerve and the organs that they serve. The treatment for achieving this balance is spinal manipulation to restore correct alignment and full working order. Researches have shown chiropractic to be effective in treating low back pain. Osteopathy is a system of diagnosis and treatment by manipulation that mainly focuses on musculo- skeletal problems. It differs from chiropractic in its underlying theory that it is impairment of blood supply and not nerve supply that leads to problems. Doctors of osteopathy use manipulation plus traditional medicine to cure problems. It is the manipulation of body tissues to promote wellness and reduce pain and stress.

It is commonly performed on the particular areas of foot that are believed to correspond to different organs or systems of the body. This helps to eliminate the blockage of energy responsible for pain or disease in the corresponding body part. Biofield therapies are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body. The existence of such fields has not yet been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Reiki is a technique, which uses the channeling and flow of energy through the body to improve health and promote healing. It is very much different from conventional healing therapies.

Nurses have the potential for becoming essential participants in this type of health care philosophy. Nurses should be knowledgeable of CAM therapies to make appropriate recommendation. Nurses should also provide advice to client regarding when to seek conventional therapies or CAM therapies. Nurses need to be aware of their state nurse practice act with regard to CAM therapies and practice only with in the scope of these laws. Nurses have knowledge regarding current researches being done in this area to provide accurate information not only to patient but to other health care professionals. Perry and potter.
