I am looking forward to hearing from you. Ottavia Hello and welcome to Soul Integration Healing. I am Ottavia, a Level 3 trained Internal Family Systems practitioner and I am here to help you to experience life to the full. If you experience overwhelm, helplessness, crippling grief, illness, a loss of control and of the sense of who you are, you may want to know if this is all there is to you and perhaps are longing to find answers to the way you have been feeling. I hope that I will be able to help you if you are currently affected by: * chronic or acute anxiety and severe stress; * a struggle with unresolved grief; * long Covid symptoms; * difficult sleeping patterns; * chronic aches and pains (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, IBS, migraines); * a sense of feeling stuck; * a lack of direction and meaning in life; * developmental trauma and/or shock trauma; * PTSD and CPTSD. It is everybody's right to live the life they truly want to live, to feel whole and connected and to know their place in the world. I believe healing to be a very personal experience, a dynamic process which often will uncover aspects of ourselves we were not aware of and which invariably will allow us to deepen our connection to ourselves and others. In this sense healing does not necessarily correspond to curing in the widely accepted sense of the term, neither can it be expected to happen at once; in fact it is always a journey: you know where you stand when you begin, but it is not possible to know where you will be heading after the first step. Healing requires a strong commitment to yourself and courage to explore the source of the pain which you have been avoiding out of fear. I also believe that there isn't a 'one size fits all' healing therapy. This is because we are all inherently different and our personal stories need to be told using a diverse selection of words and symbols. Similar experiences take on a completely different meaning when lived by different people. Therefore my aim is to create a safe space where I can attend to your needs, listen to your story and gently support you as you turn inwards to explore that which wants to be witnessed, heard, healed and integrated. * chronic or acute anxiety and severe stress; * a struggle with unresolved grief; * long Covid symptoms; * difficult sleeping patterns; * chronic aches and pains (chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, IBS, migraines); * a sense of feeling stuck; * a lack of direction and meaning in life; * developmental trauma and/or shock trauma; * PTSD and CPTSD.

There were some very dark and scary feelings which I needed to work out. Ottavia made me feel incredibly safe without protecting me from these feelings which I had been avoiding... Don't expect to turn up and passively 'get healed'. Instead, Ottavia invites you to bravely explore healing while she never leaves your side. (Alex) | | I will only ask you to go as far as you feel ready to at any given time and I will never push you to go any faster than what feels right or to go anywhere you do not feel comfortable going. In this contained and gently held space your emotions, sensations, thoughts and experiences will be allowed to unfold naturally...and you will find congruence and a new sense of vitality and peace within. Energy and Somatic Healing I am here to offer you a compassionate and safe space where you can discuss your needs and be met with understanding and non judgement. We will then decide together on a personalised healing approach using a combination of Internal Family Systems, energy, somatic and spiritual healing techniques. If you have experienced trauma in your life I will also include elements of Somatic Experiencing\u00ae, a powerful approach to physical and psychological symptoms of stress, shock and trauma, working with the body's natural self-regulation. Knowledge of trauma patterns offers a window through which much of your current experience can be reframed, affording you a sense of agency and control over your life once again. | | | | Energy Healing Choose Reiki, a hands-on Japanese healing technique based on the channelling of energy, or Soul Integration Healing to restore physical, emotional and psychological well-being. I can't tell you how different it was to share with you yesterday and to feel properly heard, for the first time. I have never talked like that with anyone so it's a great start. I feel a little lighter and I feel hope.
