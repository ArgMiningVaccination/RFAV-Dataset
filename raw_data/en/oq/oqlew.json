ISSN 0890-1686 All Rights Reserved People v. Profs: How a Conflict between Traditional and Homeopathic Medicine Nearly Destroyed the University of Michigan By Robert Olender \"What are you doing with my patient . G_d d__n you, Dr. Maclean.\" Maclean parried Franklin's rushing assault and wrestled him to the floor. Were it not for a watchful attendant, Franklin would have knocked the \"d____d face\" off Maclean, or so he claimed. These were not ordinary pugilists. Edward Franklin was the dean of homeopathic faculty and Donald Maclean was a professor of surgery, and this day in 1878 was just another in the decades-long battle between homeopaths and allopaths at the University of Michigan.1 The simmering dispute over medical education had been going on well before the founding of the university's medical school in 1850, and in the years following the Civil War that dispute would nearly destroy the medical school and cripple the university. In some measure, the difficulties were the result of the State of Michigan's efforts to both promote publicly owned university education and shield its university from public educational objectives. This clash between academic freedom and popular expectations nearly shattered the University of Michigan. Nonetheless, it illuminates the intersection between public higher education and popular will. That glimpse reveals that money will almost inevitably overcome academic resistance and will compel even constitutionally independent universities to succumb to sustained public demands. The University of Michigan harks back to 1817, when the Michigan Territorial Legislature passed \"An Act to establish the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania.\" As elsewhere in the west, the population of the territory, and later the state, offered a sparse financial base upon which to build a university. Accordingly, little happened for twenty years. The new state's 1837 constitution called for a public university, and the 1 \"The Franklin-Maclean Fracas,\" Detroit Free Press, 17 December 1878, 6. 78 The Michigan Historical Review legislature soon passed enabling legislation.2 But, almost immediately, the Panic of 1837, crippling debt (associated with its internal improvement efforts), and significant competing state goals caused many to question the priority of large university spending. Legislators coveted the funds earmarked for the school\u2014the University Fund\u2014to help alleviate state debt and support other government functions.3 The governor's appointed regents had little higher-education experience and, like several of the state legislators, many believed monies dedicated to the university would better be allocated elsewhere. This environment strained any sustained focus on creating a major state university. In response to these challenges, a Select Committee on the Condition of the University in 1840 declared the university \"a trust too sacred to be made the foot-ball of party.\" Consequently, it recommended university governance \"be cut loose from all connection with politics.\"4 The committee's wisdom was exposed by Governor John Barry's less-than-enthusiastic opening of the Ann Arbor campus to students in 1841 exposed the committee's wisdom: \"Well, 2 The university's birth has been tied to several dates. In 1887, James Burrill Angell, president from 1871-1909, offered that the school's founding could go back 100 years to the 1787 Northwest Ordinance. He suggested this at The Semi-Centennial Celebration of the Organization of the University of Michigan\u2014in honor of the institution's 50th birthday. That celebration would support an 1837 founding date, aligning with Michigan's admission into the Union, the state's first constitution, and the enabling legislation to begin construction in Ann Arbor. The university opened to students in 1841. Today, the University of Michigan marks its beginning with the 1817 Catholepistemiad statute, in some measure to claim rights as an early state university.
