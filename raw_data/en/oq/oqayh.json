All drugs, preparations and appliances su pplied by chemists must, where a standard or formula is specified in the British Pharmacopoeia, the British Pharmaceutical Codex, the British National Formulary, or the Drug Tariff, conform to the standard of formula so specified, and in any other case mus t be of a grade or quality not lower than the grade or quality ordinarily used for medical purposes. All appliances supplied by chemists must, where a specification is included in the Drug Tariff, conform to that specification or be of a grade or quality not inferior thereto, and in any case must conform to the ordinarily recognised standards of good quality. Scheduled Drug (see also Part XI) 2. The Health and Personal Social Services (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs Etc) Regu lations (Northern Ireland) 2004 make provision as to the drugs, medicines or other substance that may be ordered for patients in the provision of medical services under a general medical services contract within the meaning of Article 57 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. Schedule 1 to the Regulations lists the drugs and substances that are not to be prescribed under a general medical services contract. Schedule 2 lists the drugs, medicines and other substances that may be ordered under a general medical services contract only in certain circumstances and sets out those circumstances. Chemist contractors are under no obligation to supply a scheduled drug that may be ordered erroneously on a prescription form by a doc tor or dentist, or on a stock order form by a dentist, and can have no claim against the BSO in respect thereof. List Prices 3. References to the list prices shall be construed as references to net cost prices in the price lists of such manufacturing or wholesale firms as may be selected by the Department after consultation with the Local Pharmaceutical Committee. Containers (see also Part V) 4. Paragraph 16 of the Terms of Service [Schedule 2 to the Health and Personal Social Services (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997] requires the chemist to supply all drugs in suitable containers, which include a 5ml spoon where appropriate. Questions 5. Any questions arising as to the price or dispensing fee to be allowed in a particula r case shall be determined by the Department after consultation with the Pharmaceutical Contractor's Committee. Prices Of Drugs And Preparations Included In Part I And Chemical Reagents Included In Part II Tariff Prices 6. The tariff prices are generally net cost prices calculated from the agreed wholesale price lists. General Notes September 2021 5 Payment for Water 7. Payment for water will be made only (a) where purified water has been prescribed, or (b) where its use is implied, e.g., where the Business Services Organisation (her einafter called \"the BSO\") after consultation with the Department is satisfied that the water ordinarily available is unsuitable for dispensing purposes and purified water is used. Revision of Prices 8. The prices of drugs and preparations included in Pa rt I and Chemical Reagents included in Part II will be revised monthly in accordance with current list prices. Pricing of Other Drugs and Preparations 9. Drugs and preparations not included in Parts I II and IX and not being scheduled drugs will normally be priced on the basis of the most cost -effective price rate derived from list prices for the pack sizes generally available to chemist contractors. Where a chemist contractor's throughput of drugs and preparations does not justify supply from the pack s ize from which the most cost -effective price rate is derived, the chemist contractor may endorse the prescription with the pack size from which the supply is made. Payment will be based on the list price for the pack size so endorsed but in any doubtful c ase the BSO will, before pricing, satisfy itself that the pack sizes used were reasonable in relation to the contractor's throughput of drugs and preparations. If the BSO is not satisfied that the pack sizes used were reasonable - or if the prescriptions are incompletely or incorrectly coded by the chemist contractor, the standard price convention set out above will be applied. Oncost Allowances for Chemist Contractors 10. Oncost allowances payable on gross or net ingredient cost are detailed below. In special circumstances an additional oncost is payable for trusses and elastic hosiery. i. HS prescriptions for oxygen and oxygen therapy equipment The oncost allowance payable for these items is 10%. ii. Stock orders The oncost allowance payable for it ems ordered by doctors on a stock order form is 17\u00bd% of the net ingredient cost of these items calculated in accordance with paragraph 9. iii. HS prescriptions for trusses and elastic hosiery An additional oncost allowance of 15% based on the gross ingre dient cost is payable when the measuring and fitting of trusses or elastic hosiery has been carried out by a chemist and the prescription has been endorsed \"measured and fitted\" or has been coded as such according to the Prescription Code issued by the BSO . Appliances 11. Part III contains the list of appliances that may be ordered by medical practitioners on the Medical List. 12. Appliances not included in Part III may not be ordered and suppliers of appliances are under no obligation to supply any such appliance and can have no claim against the BSO in that respect thereof. 13. Part III gives the specifications and tariff prices of such appliances. All appliances must conform to the specifications and sizes shown in Part III. General Notes September 2021 6 Prices of Appliances 14. Prescriptions for elastic hosiery and trusses supplied by chemist contractors will be reckoned along with those for drugs and will consequently qualify for the appropriate oncost allowance as set out in paragraph 10. Where measuring and fitting have been carried out, an appropriate fitting oncost (15%) will be paid by the BSO, where claimed. The prices of other appliances given in Part III will be the prices so stated (subject to alteration monthly, in accordance with variations in list prices). Where a p rice is not shown in the tariff for an appliance the price will be the list price, or in the case of appliances not included in a price list, the invoiced wholesale net cost price. Provided that if in any case the Department approves a special price diffe rent from that ascertained as aforesaid, such price shall apply in lieu thereof. Payment to Appliance Contractors 15. Suppliers of appliances only will receive the cost of the appliance as detailed in paragraph 14 above, 25% oncost allowance and a 15% me asuring and fitting fee where appropriate and where claimed. No dispensing fee is payable in respect of the supply of an appliance. Dispensing Fees For Chemist Contractors 16. In accordance with the terms of Regulation 9(2) of the Pharmaceutical Service s Regulations (NI) 1997 (Standards of, and payments for drugs and appliances), and, in relation to dispensing or other fees payable in respect of the supply of drugs and appliances and of the provision of supplemental services and of additional professiona l services or any other fee, allowance or other remuneration in respect of the provision of pharmaceutical services by chemists, the determining authority is the Regional Board. 17. In addition to the payment of ingredient costs, the oncost allowances (se e para 10), and the payment for coding prescriptions (see para 18), dispensing fees will be paid at the rate shown in the table below. These dispensing fees are not payable on stock orders or on prescriptions for oxygen or oxygen equipment. Fee per Presc ription (1).

(7) Minor Ailments Scheme Consultation Fee Consultation fees for the Minor Ailments Scheme are paid under a tiered structure. The payment due within the structure is based on the number o f cumulative consultation fees from 1 April 2020. Payment Due Lower Limit Upper Limit \u00a38.50 1 500 \u00a37.50 501 1000 \u00a36.50 1001 2000 2950 \u00a30.00 2951 For all prescriptions dispensed extemporaneously, ingredient costs will be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Tariff and the relevant dispensing fee at paragraph 2 above will be paid. Where a chemist contractor for some reason cannot dispense the prescription extemporaneously or elects to have it made up as a \"special\", the ch emist contractor must provide to the BSO the reasons why a \"special\" was necessary. In any doubtful cases the BSO, before pricing, may refer matters to the Pharmaceutical Committee of the BSO to ascertain if the additional costs involved through use of a \"special\" were necessarily incurred and were reasonable. Only in circumstances where the Pharmaceutical Committee is satisfied that the use of \"special\" was necessary, will the invoiced \"special\" price be reimbursed and the dispensing fee at paragraph 1 ab ove be paid. In other cases, payment of ingredient costs and dispensing fees will be made on the basis that the prescription had been dispensed extemporaneously. General Notes September 2021 8 Chemist contractors are required to endorse CD prescriptions for drugs included in Schedul e 2 and 3 to the Misuse of Drugs (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1986 (as amended) with the letters \"CD\" unless a Code has been assigned in The Prescription Code issued by the BSO. These prescriptions should be coded as far as possible and included in the a ppropriate section of the prescription bundle when submitting the forms to the BSO. Provided these requirements are met the additional fee at paragraph 4 above will be paid. Serious Shortage Protocol Reimbursement for any product supplied under a Serious Shortage Protocol (SSP) will be as if the product had been dispensed against a prescription. The prescription should be endorsed with the annotation \"Supply in line with SSP [Insert number]\" to indicate that a supply was made in line with an SSP and also any other usual endorsements as appropriate for the product. Details on necessary endorsements will also be detailed on the BSO website (www.hscbusiness.hscni.net/services/3063.htm ). Contractors should submit their prescriptions that have an SSP endors ement at the top of their amended bundle, with the second submission clearly separated from other prescriptions in the amended bundle. The number of prescriptions submitted with a SSP endorsement should be noted at the bottom of the second submission (HS3 0). Payment For Coding Prescriptions 18. For the purpose of payment prescriptions should be coded and, where necessary, endorsed as indicated in the Prescription Code issued by the BSO. An allowance at the rate of 4.43p per prescription (including stock orders and prescriptions for oxygen gas) is payable to chemists for the work of coding prescriptions and payment will be made by the BSO in respect of prescriptions furnished by a chemist to the BSO each month. If however it is found that the standard of a ccuracy of coding for the month for which the allowance has been paid was not at least 95% and that within the 12 months prior to the month for which the allowance was paid the chemist had on two or more occasions been notified that his standard of accurac y of coding had fallen below 95% recovery of the allowance for that month will be effected by deduction from subsequent payments due by the BSO to the chemist. Urgent Prescriptions 19. Urgent fees may be paid on prescriptions (including stock orders and those for oxygen and oxygen equipment) for which the chemist is required to re -open his pharmacy outside both contracted hours of service and agreed rota opening hours. a. prescriptions endorsed \"Urgent\" by prescriber.

The conditions for payment are: i. the Board was immediately informed, in accordance with regulation 10(A)(1)(a), or informed within 14 days of the prescription being presented to the chemist, in accordance with regulation 10A(1)(b) as appropriate; ii. a claim is made by returning to the BSO a duly completed claim form, prov ided by the BSO, within 24 days of the form having been presented; General Notes September 2021 16 Reward Scheme - Fraudulent Prescription Forms cont iii. the form presented as a prescription form was not a genuine order for the person named on the form; an order would not be a genuin e order if, for example, it had been stolen or counterfeited and not signed by an authorised prescriber; or had been altered otherwise than by the authorised prescriber by whom it was issued. iv. the BSO consider that the information on the claim form has contributed to the detection and prevention of a fraud, or the recovery for the Health Service of sums lost through a fraud, other than the cost of the drugs or listed appliances ordered on the fraudulent prescription form which is the subject of the clai m; to satisfy this condition, the BSO must consider that at least one of the following criteria is fulfilled: the fraud would not have been detected or stopped without the information provided on the claim the fraud would not have been detected until a la ter date, or would not have been stopped until a later date, without the information provided on the claim the information provided on the claim was cited as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings; this is regardless of the outcome of those proceedings, provided that condition (v) below is met v. the BSO considers that the fraud, about which the claim provided information, has been stopped subsequent to the claim being received. The BSO will estimate savings resulting from the information provided, by the addition of (a) and (b) as follows: (a) losses prevented will be calculated by reference to an estimate of whichever is the greater of: losses in the 12 months up to the stopping of the fraud, or losses in the financial year previous to the stopping o f the fraud, or an annual rate of loss over an average of up to 5 previous financial years before the stopping of the fraud, if the data are available. (b) if previous losses to the Health Service are recovered, whether or not by civil proceedings, the to tal sum recovered. The level of savings will be agreed with the Policy and Accounting Unit of the Health and Social Services Executive.

Blood glucose testing strips (BGTS) are primarily intended for insulin -dependent diabetics who will nor mally have received consultant advice on their condition. One pack (50 strips) would normally be sufficient for 2 months. All strips should be kept in their original container and should not be cut or slit. Because of the differences in colour change in colorimetric types, strips are not interchangeable. Due regard should be given to the manufacturer's instructions and to the recommendation on storage and period of use after first opening . 2. Misleading results, which could be hazardous if acted upon, might arise if users are inadequately trained. It is therefore essential that patients should receive appropriate training before attempting to use BGTS for monitoring their blood glucose. This instruction should be given by health care professionals who are trained in the use of the product. It should be noted that there are small variations in technique between different makes. Some technical factors are given in paragraph 5 below. 3. General practitioners should be aware that defects in colour visio n may occur in diabetes and certain BGT strips should not be prescribed for such patients for visual use. (see outline of colour changes described in each entry on the foregoing pages). 4. Reagent Strips are subject to the following limitations: Fluorid e Specimen: The strips are not to be used with blood specimens preserved with fluoride. Serum and Plasma: The strips are not designed for use with serum or plasma. Haematocrit: Extremes in haematocrit levels can affect test results: Due regard sho uld be given to the manufacturer's product specifications. 5. Disposal of Lancets. Patients should be reminded of the need to exercise caution when disposing of used lancets. These should be placed in a tin or other strong container before disposal. (The needle clipping device listed in Part III is not generally suitable for use with lancets) . As with single -use syringes, the arrangements outlined above are not suitable for patients where there is a risk of infection being transmitted. General Practi tioners are similarly advised that blood lancets should only be prescribed for patients who are carriers of infectious diseases where suitable arrangements have been made for the disposal of the used articles as contaminated waste. Medical Officers for en vironmental health can advise on these arrangements. Part III List of Appliances September 2021 117 Part III List of Appliances Notes 1.

Domiciliary Oxygen Oxygen should be prescribed for patients in the home only after careful evaluation and nev er on a placebo basis. Oxygen may be supplied in cylinders or where the quantity required justifies it, from a concentrator but in general the appropriate method of supply will depend on the type of therapy, intermittent or long term, to be prescribed. 2. Intermittent Therapy 2.1 The majority of patients will have oxygen prescribed for intermittent use in a variety of respiratory conditions. This type of therapy is used in patients with hypoxemia of short duration, for example, asthma, when the conditio n is likely to recur over months or years. It may be prescribed for patients with advanced irreversible respiratory disorders to increase mobility and capacity for exercise and ease discomfort, for example in chronic obstructive bronchitis, emphysema, wid espread fibrosis and primary or thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Such patients will usually be supplied with oxygen in cylinders. 2.2 Arrangements for the prescription and supply of cylinder oxygen to those patients who require intermittent therapy are set out at paragraph A.1 to this part of the Drug Tariff. GPs are asked to co -operate in an effort to make this part of the oxygen service more cost effective. If more than one or 2 are regularly required for a particular period, prescribing in mult iples of 3 cylinders would produce savings by reducing the number of journeys. It is accepted that it will not always be possible to prescribe in this way, for example, because of the infrequency of use of oxygen or because of storage problems at the pati ent's home but whenever possible cylinders should be prescribed in multiples of 3. 3. Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) 3.1 Long -term oxygen therapy is the provision of oxygen for 15 hours or more a day for a prolonged period and is of benefit to many pati ents with chronic hypoxemia. For these patients oxygen should, where possible, be provided by a concentrator. 3.2 Since it is important to recognise that long term oxygen therapy is of benefit to a limited number of patients and that the needs of the maj ority of patients will continue to be met by intermittent therapy from cylinders, clinical guidelines for prescribing long term therapy have been drawn up for the benefit of general practitioners. These guidelines are set out in full below. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 392 4. Guideline s For Prescribing Long -Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) 4.1 On present information, patients who are likely to benefit from long -term oxygen therapy will by definition have chronic hypoxemia, but may for the purposes of these regulations be divided into three g roups: - 1. Those for whom there is an absolute indication, for which there is scientific evidence of the value of long -term oxygen therapy. 2. Those in whom there are good grounds for assuming the value of oxygen therapy, but for which there is no firm sci entific evidence at present. 3. Patients in whom oxygen would have a useful palliative effect. 4.2 GPs who identify patients who might belong to any of these groups will wish to have consultant advice on the need for LTOT. 5 Indicators For The Use Of LTOT 5.1 Absolute indication. Patients for whom there is clear evidence of the value of LTOT will be those with chronic obstructive airways disease, hypoxemia and oedema. Such patients will have ankle oedema or a history of an acute exacerbation when ankle oedema was observed. It will be necessary for such patients to be seen and assessed by a respiratory physician with access to respiratory function services. Suitable patients would have a forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) of less than 1.5L, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 2L, and arterial oxygen tension less than 7.3kPa (55 mm/mercury) and some elevation of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) greater than 6.0kPa or 45mm/mercury. These tests are the minimum requirement and they should be mad e in a stable phase of the condition when all reversible factors have been adequately treated e.g. infection, reversible airways disease, cardiac disease etc. In order to establish stability, the spirometric measurements and the arterial blood gases shoul d be repeated at an interval of not less than 3 weeks. There should be variation of no more than \u00b1 20% in the spirometric measurements and a variation of no more than \u00b1 5mm/mercury or 0.6kPa in the arterial oxygen tension. If such variations are exceeded then a further 3 weeks interval should elapse before the tests are repeated again. 5.2 Other patients with chronic obstructive airways disease. The second group will include all patients with chronic obstructive airways disease having the same spiromet ric characteristics and the same levels of arterial oxygen tension as those described in para 1.3.1, but in whom hypercapnia is not present and oedema has not been witnessed. Many such patients were studied in American trials of long -term domiciliary oxyg en therapy and benefit was clearly shown but such patients were excluded from the British studies. However, many of these patients, including refractory asthmatics and sufferers from cystic fibrosis could be expected to benefit from long -term oxygen thera py. On present evidence long -term domiciliary oxygen therapy should not be denied but the same criteria of stability should be applied to ensure that they are established cases of chronic hypoxemia. We hope that further studies on this group of patients can be urgently carried out. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 393 5.3 Palliative use of oxygen. This group should include patients with other respiratory conditions associated with severe arterial hypoxemia, but without hypercapnia, for which oxygen therapy may have a useful, palliative e ffect, without necessarily affecting survival. Examples would be severe hypoxemia associated with the terminal stages of fibrosing alveolitis, industrial lung fibrosis, terminal stages of emphysema, and lung infiltrations such as in sarcoidosis, lymphangi tis carcinomatosa and certain collagen disorders. 5.4 Other conditions. There are other conditions in which palliation of chronic respiratory failure might be considered, for example in severe kyphoscoliosis, gross obesity and the end stage of irreversi ble peripheral neuropathies and muscle disorders. However, these conditions are associated with such serious disturbances of ventilatory drive that the abolition of hypoxemia by providing additional inspired oxygen may be dangerous. There is also prelimi nary evidence that long -term oxygen therapy may help some children with pulmonary hypertension. For all these patients the initial assessment would have to be even more detailed than that already described for patients with chronic obstructive airways dis ease. 6. Post Assessment 6.1 If LTOT is to be prescribed and used effectively it must be remembered that the treatment involves a minimum of 15 hours oxygen per day and whenever possible this should be provided by means of a concentrator. The patient mu st be fully acquainted with the installation, the working of the concentrator and the need to keep to the arduous therapeutic regimen. The initial flow rate of oxygen through standard nasal prongs will be 2L/min, but may need to be modified between 1.5 an d 2.5 litres per minute when the arterial blood gases have been checked with the patient breathing oxygen. The aim is to elevate PAO 2, to 60 mmHg (8kPa) or more without excessive hypercapnia. 6.2 Full co -operation by the patient is essential and expert s upport will be necessary to enable the 15 hours daily treatment period to be achieved. Regular monitoring in the home by appropriately trained nurses or lung function technicians and follow -up in respiratory outpatients by thoracic physicians will be nece ssary to ensure that the treatment is achieving optimum results. 7. Patients For Whom Long -Term Oxygen Therapy Is Not Useful 7.1 It is important to stress the circumstances under which LTOT is not indicated. Patients with respiratory conditions that mer ely produce breathlessness without hypoxemia should not be treated. Long -term therapy is not intended for acute conditions such as lobar pneumonia and other chest infections. Patients with lesser degrees of chronic obstructive airways disease (i.e. not c onforming to the criteria in para 1.3.1) or reversible obstructive airways disease including those having acute exacerbations are not candidates for this form of oxygen delivery since their hypoxemia is likely to be only of short duration. 8. Smoking And Long -Term Oxygen Therapy 8.1 Patients who continue to smoke are unlikely to gain much benefit from LTOT and every effort must be made to persuade them to discontinue smoking. There is also the additional hazard of fire. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 394 9. Summary 9.1 It is anticipated that the provision of oxygen concentrators for such patients described above who have proven chronic hypoxemia will be an additional service. It is not intended that oxygen concentrator installations will compete with intermittent oxygen therapy at prese nt provided for patients by cylinder supplies. Patients who would benefit from LTOT from concentrators will need to be carefully selected and carefully monitored and will be relatively few in numbers compared with those having intermittent short burst the rapy. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 395 A. Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service Provided By Chemists To Health Service Patients 1. General Arrangements for the Service a. The Board's list of contractors who provide oxygen therapy services includes only those chemists who are authorised to hold a number of lightweight single unit oxygen sets (Specifications 01 A and B) and stands and i. regularly stock oxygen equipment, as specified in the Drug Tariff, and oxygen gas on the premises; ii. are prepared, when it would not be reasonable t o expect that a patient's representative could safely do so or when he is unable to do so, to deliver the oxygen set and cylinders to the patient's home, to collect empty cylinders when they are being replaced, and to collect the set and cylinders when informed that treatment has been discontinued; and iii. are prepared to erect and explain the operation of the oxygen set and cylinders at a patient's home, particularly when the patient is having oxygen therapy for the first time. b. At any time a chemist willing to provide this service may apply to the Board for inclusion on the list. c. A copy of the Board's list of oxygen contractors, with details of the services being provided, is supplied to every chemist and doctor. d. If a prescription for an oxyg en set or cylinders is presented to a chemist whose name is not included in the list, he should normally provide the patient or his representative with the name, address and telephone number of at least 2 chemists who provide oxygen therapy services at the time the need arises and who are nearest to the patient's home. e. Except where, in emergency, a set has been loaned by a distant contractor, oxygen gas should normally be supplied to a patient only by the chemist who has loaned the set. When, exception ally, cylinder replacements are provided by a chemist other than the one who supplied the set, he should at the time when cylinders are supplied satisfy himself that the patient continues to operate the equipment satisfactorily. f. Delivery and collection of sets and/or cylinders is to be undertaken by a patient's representative where he is willing and where the chemist can fully satisfy himself that the representative is able to transport a set and/or a cylinder, carry it and secure it in position in the house and fit the mask after the instructions provided in the set have been explained to him. In other circumstances delivery, erection and collection of sets and/or cylinders and the explanation of the operation of oxygen equipment at the patient's home, particularly at the commencement of treatment, is to be undertaken by the contractor. g. The recovery of empty cylinders from patients, and their prompt return to the suppliers for refilling, is essential if adequate supplies of oxygen for the use of pat ients are to be maintained. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 396 h. As part of the explanatory information under (f), the chemist must provide appropriate advice on procedures to be followed to ensure safe use of oxygen equipment in the home. In particular any safety instructions issued by the manufacturers of the equipment must be brought to the attention of the patient or his representative. In addition chemists will wish to advise the patient or his representative that the Fire Prevention Officer from the local Fire Brigade is prepared to visit the patient's home to provide practical advice which will help ensure safe use of the oxygen therapy equipment. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 397 2. Oxygen Equipment, which may be supplied on loan by chemists to patients a. Oxygen Sets The following sets * (see Specification 01 A and 01B) are approved for use within the oxygen therapy service, and any one may be loaned against a prescription for a set: i. BOC Set (BOC 330228) iii. Oxylitre Set (MR 210) Spec ification 01A iv. Air Apparatus and Valve set (D24) Specification v. Ohmeda Domic Set 01A vii. Puritan Bennett Set (778435) Specification 01A * Spare O -rings may be supplied by the manufacturer with the set, but these should be removed by the contractor before the set is supplied to the patient. On no account should chemists attempt to modify any oxygen set to produce a higher flow rate than that for which it has been designed. To do so could create a hazardous situation for the patient. b. Oxygen Administration Equipment The following masks are approved for use within the oxygen therapy service: - i. Constant performance masks: - See descriptions a. Ventimask MK IV, 28% and illustrations b. Intersurgical 010 Mask 28% ii. Variable performance masks See descriptions a. Intersurgical 005 Mask and illustrations Constant performance masks provide a nearly constant concentration of 28% oxygen in a ir over a wide range of oxygen supply, and irrespective of breathing pattern. When a constant performance mask is supplied to a patient, the recommended flow rate is 2 litres per minute (the Medium setting on the control head). Variable performance masks provide a variable concentration of oxygen in air. The concentration varies with the rate of flow of oxygen supplied and the breathing pattern of the patient. Two Ventimask MK IV, 28% constant performance masks will be supplied by the manufacturer with each oxygen set. (On account of bulk, these masks require to be packed separately from the remainder of the set). Where a prescriber considers that the Ventimask MK IV 28% mask is not appropriate for the treatment of a patient, he must state on the presc ription which alternative approved mask is to be supplied. Every mask is supplied for the use of one patient only. All masks, therefore, are \"disposable\" but each is sufficiently robust to withstand usage even over a long period of treatment. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 398 c. Connect ion plastic tubing (see Specification 01A and 01B). A new length of connection plastic tubing (approx. 150 cm) is to be supplied for each new patient. During extended loan periods, replacement lengths of tubing may also need to be supplied. d. Oxygen Oxygen should only be prescribed in 1360 litre cylinders. The lightweight aluminium cylinder supplied by BOC is free -standing and obviates the need for a cylinder stand to be supplied to the patient. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 399 3. Procedure to be followed in loaning equipment, con firming continued use, and termination of BSO's liability. a. The chemist shall on making the loan include a note with the set, saying \"This equipment is the property of the chemist, and must be returned immediately to the chemist in good condition when i t is no longer required. Any loss of or damage to the equipment is the responsibility of the patient\". b. The chemist shall endorse the prescription with i. name of set supplied; ii. the date of commencement of loan; and iii. size and number of cyl inders supplied. c. i. Where the return shows that the set has been on loan for at least 3 months and has not been returned to the chemist, the Board shall ascertain from the doctor whether the equipment is still required; 2 similar enquiries shall be made if necessary during the first year of the loan. ii. In cases where the equipment has been on loan to a patient for 18 months or more the Board should make special enquiries as to the circumstances of the loan. iii. Where the Board is satisfied, after making enquiries that the equipment is no longer required by the patient it shall notify the chemist to arrange recovery. d. Where the patient fails to return the equipment the onus of collecting it rests on the chemist. 4. Method of claiming compensati on for financial loss in respect of Oxygen Equipment Where the chemist suffers financial loss as a result of the act or default of a person causing the loss of, or damage to, oxygen equipment loaned, and the chemist forthwith informs the Board of such fin ancial loss and of the action taken by him, short of actual litigation, to recover the equipment and compensation for its loss or damage from the person concerned, the Board shall investigate the matter and if in their opinion the financial loss was not oc casioned by the act or default of the chemist or by his failure to take the appropriate action to recover the equipment and compensation, the Board shall make a payment to him based on the value of the equipment at the date of loss, or equivalent to the co st of repairing the said damage, as the case may be: Provided that where the contractor is dissatisfied with the decision of the Board he may refer the matter to the Department who shall give such direction to the BSO as it thinks fit. In this paragraph, the expression \"person\" means the person supplied, the patient concerned, members of his household, or the authorities of an institution to which the equipment is delivered, as the case may be. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 400 B. Additional Specifications And Descriptions Lightweight S ingle Unit Sets Specification 01A (see also diagram) The SET comprises: - i. a. a valve which reduces the gas cylinder pressure from 13,650 k.P.a. to a pressure of 70 to 415 k.P.a; b. a miniature cylinder contents (pressure) gauge calibrated with \u00bc, \u00bd a nd full markings; c. a cap consisting of a 2 flow selector which can be turned from the ratchet position marked \"OFF\" to ratchet positions marked \"MED\" and \"HIGH\", these being designed to correspond to flow rates of 2 litres and 4 litres respectively per minute; d. an outlet, being the male portion of a bayonet type connection; e. a standard bull -nose cylinder adaptor designed for finger tightening and preferably incorporating an O -ring washer; f. a safety device, such as a sintered filter, to preve nt the spontaneous combustion of particulate material in the control head or in the neck of the cylinder. ii.

Equipment Which May Be Prescribed Oxygen concentrator - Accessories - face mask, nasal cannula, humidifier Emergency back -up supply (comprising regulator, tubing, administration mask and cylinder of oxygen BP) 2. Claims For Payment The contractor shall despatch prescription forms together wi th the appropriate claim forms to the Board not later than the seventh day of the month following that in which the supply was made. 3. Concentrator Supplier Following a competitive tender exercise carried out by the BSO the supplier of oxygen concentra tor services from 1 January 2013 will be: BOC Ltd Prince Regent Road 4. Oxygen Concentrator Service An oxygen concentrator is an electrically powered machine, which separates a hig h proportion of nitrogen and some other components from ambient air and thus delivers oxygen -enriched gases to patients. Oxygen concentrator services will comprise the supply, installation, maintenance, and removal when no longer required, of a concentrat or and associated equipment in a patient's home on the prescription of a general practitioner. The service also includes the provision of full instructions to the patient. 5. Concentrators are generally reliable and the risk of breakdown is low, but in t he event of a breakdown suppliers will be responsible for responding to an emergency call -out within 10 hours. However, where a doctor considers a patient to be at risk in the event of a concentrator failure, he may prescribe an emergency back -up supply o f cylinder oxygen BP that the patient could use until the concentrator is repaired. When it is considered to be necessary, such back -up equipment should normally be prescribed along with the concentrator but the general practitioner should review the need for back -up oxygen regularly and the supply should be withdrawn if no longer required. The emergency back -up supply will form part of the services to be provided by the concentrator supplier. The supplier will also be responsible for the payment of pati ents' electricity costs associated with concentrator usage. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 407 6. It is accepted that some doctors and most patients will have little knowledge of concentrators and how they are installed. It will, however, be important for a general practitioner to be abl e to reassure his patient about the advantages of a concentrator before the supplier's initial visit to install the equipment. To assist in this the supplier will be required to provide the Board with copies of a leaflet giving general information on the e quipment and services to be provided. The Board should arrange for all general practitioners on the medical list to have a copy of this leaflet in advance of the commencement of the new service. On installation the supplier will provide the patient with a comprehensive booklet. 7. Liaison Each Board already has an Authorised Officer who is the duly authorised representative for all purposes connected with the contract and will be the point of contact for all enquiries about the concentrator service. T he Authorised Officer will liaise with the contractor providing concentrator services and with general practitioners. 8. Prescribing Arrangements For Oxygen Concentrators Concentrators will normally be prescribed when a patient requires long term oxyge n therapy (i.e. 15 hours or more a day over a prolonged period). However it will still be cost effective to prescribe a concentrator for patients who require or are using the equivalent of 21 cylinders or more per month (i.e. 8 hours per day). In no circ umstances should a concentrator be prescribed for patients requiring less than 8 hours oxygen per day. When a general practitioner decides that a patient should receive long term oxygen therapy he should take the following action to obtain a concentrator for his patient. a. Using form HS21, prescribe a concentrator and any other related equipment (e.g. humidifier) specifying on the form the amount of oxygen required (i.e. hours per day) and the flow rate. If a back -up oxygen set and cylinder are require d (see paragraph (g) below) these should be ordered at the same time. b. The GP should give the prescription form to the patient along with an explanation of what a concentrator is and advise the patient that the supplier will be in touch shortly to arra nge installation. The patient should also be instructed to give the prescription form to the supplier when he visits the patient's home. c. The GP should then advise the concentrator supplier by telephone that he has prescribed a concentrator for the pa tient and ask the supplier to arrange for its installation. The supplier will acknowledge receipt of the order by sending written confirmation to the GP, the patient and the Board. d. If at any time during the patient's treatment the GP wishes to order additional equipment e.g.. emergency back -up set and cylinder if not previously ordered, he should follow the procedure at (a) to (c) above. e. If for any reason the GP wishes to alter the regimen he should inform the patient, complete the card which has been given to the patient by the concentrator supplier (entering the date, recommended flow rate, hours of use and his initials) and tell the patient to show it to the supplier when he next visits his home to service the machine. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 408 f. If the patient in tends to move to a new address the GP should issue a new prescription for an oxygen concentrator to be provided at the new address or liaise with the patient's new GP if the patient is also changing doctor, so that he/she may issue a prescription. g. It is essential that the GP notifies the Board immediately the concentrator is no longer required by a particular patient. h. In the event of a breakdown of a concentrator, the supplier must respond to an emergency call -out by the patient within 10 hours. The Department is advised that patients who are suitable for long term oxygen therapy are generally not clinically at risk if their oxygen supply is interrupted for a few hours but for those patients considered to be at risk GPs may wish to prescribe emerg ency back -up cylinder oxygen in case of such a breakdown. It is expected that prescribing of emergency back -up oxygen will be limited to only a small number of patients. 9. Under -Use Of A Concentrator Once a patient has had a concentrator installed in his home it will be important to monitor the volume of oxygen consumption. If the patient's oxygen consumption falls below the level prescribed it may not be cost -effective for him to continue to have a concentrator. Under the terms of the contract, the supplier is required to submit to the Board a statement accompanying claims for reimbursement of patients' electricity costs, setting out in respect of each patient a comparison between the patient's average daily usage of the concentrator over the period of the claim and the daily usage as prescribed by the general practitioner. In those cases where it appears that there may have been a significant under -use of the concentrator the Board should bring the matter to the attention of it's Medical Adviser for General Practice/GP Adviser so that he/she may discuss the matter with the prescriber. In those cases where the average daily usage has fallen below the specified level at which a concentrator should be prescribed (see para 8) prescribers should be aske d specifically to confirm that the patient has been counselled and that usage of the concentrator will increase. Where no such confirmation is obtained Boards should arrange for the concentrator to be withdrawn and for the doctor to prescribe cylinder oxy gen for the patient. Similar action should be taken if, after receiving a prescriber's confirmation of a continuing need for a concentrator at the first enquiry, a further statement from the supplier indicates that usage is still below the specified level . 10. Transfer Of Existing Patients From Cylinders To Concentrators Some patients who had had cylinder oxygen prescribed for their treatment may reach a point where their oxygen requirements are such that supply would be more economical by concentrator. The Board will identify such patients using the specified level at paragraph 8 and will contact the patient's general practitioner to consider whether the prescription of a concentrator would be a more appropriate form of providing oxygen therapy. If so , the GP should follow the procedure at paragraph 8 (a -h). In such cases a close liaison between the doctor, the concentrator supplier and the patient's existing cylinder supplier will be necessary to ensure that the patient receives sufficient cylinder o xygen to meet his needs until but only until the concentrator is installed. The Board should ensure that oxygen cylinder contractors are aware of concentrator installations and that they withdraw their equipment and any cylinders (empty or full) from the patient's home as soon as possible after the concentrator has been installed. Part IV Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service September 2021 409 11. Withdrawal Of A Concentrator And/Or Associated Equipment Where a GP advises the Board that a concentrator and/or emergency supply of cylinder oxygen is no longer require d for a particular patient the Board should immediately arrange with the supplier for removal of the equipment from the patient's home. At the same time the Board should note their records with the details and date of removal notification.
