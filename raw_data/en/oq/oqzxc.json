The new kit has been redesigned for the detection of active SARS-CoV-2 by identifying the presence of any one of eight gene targets from the virus. It helps in providing accurate results even for current and future Covid-19 viral mutations by surveying multiple genes. The TaqPath Covid-19 RNase P 2.0 kit, which has a turnaround time of approximately three hours, uses a newly designed assay for evaluating nasopharyngeal and nasal swab samples to detect active cases of Covid-19.
