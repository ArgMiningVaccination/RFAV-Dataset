This information will be published annually as an addendum of the Tennessee Higher Education Fact book. Four community colleges (Jackson State, Nashville State, Pellissippi State, and Walters State) do not collect student activity fees, and have therefore been omitted from this report. Thr ee community colleges (Columbia State, Dyersburg State, and Southwest) collect a student government fee, which serves the same purpose as a student fee. These institutions are included in this report. For each institution, the undergraduate and graduate headcount is provided, along with the amount of student fee revenue attributed to each student level. The Carryover from the Prior Year is the amount of unused student fees. The student fee revenue and carryover sum to the Total Available Resources. Student Activity Fee Expenditure is the sum of every item listed under the Actual column of the Programmatic Use of Funds Expended. The Proposed column lists how each institution, prior to fiscal year 2013-14, planned on spending student fees. Unexpended Funds at Year End represent carryover for the 2014-15 academic year. ii Table of Contents Community Colleges Chattanooga State Community College..........................................1 Cleveland State Community College.............................................. 2 Columbia State Community College.............................................. 3 Dyersburg State Community College............................................. 4 Motlow State Community College.................................................. 5 Northeast State Community College.............................................. 6 Roane State Community College................................................... 7 Southwest Tennessee Community College..................................... 8 Volunteer State Community College.............................................. 9 TBR Universities Austin Peay State University......................................................... 10 East Tennessee State University.................................................... 11 Middle Tennessee State University................................................ 13 Tennessee State University........................................................... 14 Tennessee Technological University............................................... 15 University of Memphis.................................................................. 16 University of Tennessee System University of Tennessee, Chattanooga........................................... 17 University of Tennessee, Knoxville................................................. 19 University of Tennessee, Martin.................................................... 20 University of Tennessee Space Institute..........................................21 University of Tennessee Health Science Center................................22 Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology Athens........................................................................................ 23 Chattanooga................................................................................ 24 iii Covington.................................................................................... 25 Crossville.................................................................................... 26 Crump.........................................................................................27 Dickson.......................................................................................28 Elizabethton................................................................................ 29 Knoxville..................................................................................... 35 Livingston................................................................................... 36 39 Morristown.................................................................................. 40 Murfreesboro...............................................................................
