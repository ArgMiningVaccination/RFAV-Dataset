We've curated a list of resources that address the most common questions we receive. \u2014 Allogeneic transplant patient, 2011 Honoring Dr. Mary Flowers, Fred Hutch and SCCA merger, Covid-19 survey Covid-19 patient survey, Honoring Carina Moravec, ARNP, Dr. Paul Carpenter, Using MyChart to link and share your medical record Clinical LTFU Leadership, Peer-to-Peer, Return to Work Survey Information regarding COVID-19, late infections for transplant patients and sexual function. Announcements regarding the Caresi app for former patients, survey analysis results and information about future research surveys. Starting Summer 2018, a new secondary questionnaire focusing on cognition will be conducted. Also, for the first time study participants who completed the fatigue module from last year will receive personal results based on their responses. This issue shares responses from 779 survey reponses from survivors on what both enhances their lives and disrupts their quality of life. For over 20 years, patients have been submitting LTFU questionnaires. Many patients have offered comments at the end of their questionnaire. Taken together, the comments show a patchwork of experiences. We selected comments that we thought were interesting and informative. Please note that while we've removed identifying information, we didn't edit the quotes for content. Below are a number of useful PDFs and documents that can answer questions about long-term follow-up care, dietary guidelines, nutritional needs, and more.

You may also have increased nutrient needs due to medications or loss of muscle mass. Calories, protein, fluid, vitamins, and minerals are necessary for you to regain your immunity, maintain or achieve your weight goal, strengthen your muscles, and feel better! Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels can change after transplant due to medications including Cyclosporine and prednisone. If your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated after transplant, have them remeasured two to three months after immunosuppressive drugs (Cyclosporine, prednisone, FK-506) are discontinued. Take a multiple vitamin/mineral supplement for one year following your transplant to ensure you get the vitamins and minerals you need while your body and immune system are recovering. A generic brand is fine. If you are considering taking any supplement (including antioxidants and herbal preparations) in addition to the vitamin/mineral supplement that has been recommended, discuss its' safety with your Fred Hutch dietitian. When selecting a supplement, it should: Recommended Supplements For Adults Mature Balance, One-a-Day 55 Plus Your protein needs were higher than normal early after transplant to allow repair of cell damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation. Protein continues to be an important part of your diet to promote recovery of your immune system.
