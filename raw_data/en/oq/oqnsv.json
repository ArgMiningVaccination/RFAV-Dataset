Overview The purpose of this document is to describe the guidelines Mass General Brigham Health Plan uses to determine medical necessity for chiropractic services as a treatment for neuromuscular and/or musculoskeletal conditions . Coverage Guidelines Mass General Brigham Health Plan covers chiropractic services for medically necessary examination, evaluation, and diagnosis of the presence or absence of neuromuscular and/or musculoskeletal conditions. Mass General Brigham Health Plan covers medically necessary chiro practic services for the treatment of neuromuscular and/or musculoskeletal illnesses, injuries, conditions, or disorders including: 1. The administration of chiropractic adjustments or manipulations, either by hand or by instrumentation, to the body for the p urpose of maintaining, restoring, or improving biomechanical and/or neurological integrity or functioning in the human body; and 2. The administration, dispensing, or prescribing of supportive procedures and therapies. Coverage Criteria Medical necessity for chiropractic services is determined through InterQual\u00ae criteria, which Mass General Brigham Health Plan has customized. To access the criteria, log in to Mass General Brigham Health Plan's provider website at MassGeneralBrighamHealthPlan.org and click the InterQual\u00ae Criteria Lookup link under the Resources Menu. Exclusions 1. Chiropractic services are not covered for member 0 to 24 months of age. Medicare Variation Mass General Brigham Health Plan uses guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for coverage determinations for its Medicare Advantage plan members. National Coverage Determinations (NCDs), Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), Local Coverage Articles (LCAs) and documentation included in the Medicare manuals are the basis for coverage determinations. When there is no guidance from CMS for the requested service, Mass General Brigham Health Plan's medical policies are used for coverage determinations . Mass General Brigham Health Plan 2 At the time of Mass General Brigham Health Plan's most recent p olicy review, Medicare includes coverage guidelines for the following: LCD: Outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy Services (L33631). LCD: Billing and Coding: Outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy Services (A56566). Definitions Chiropractic Services : Services rendered by a licensed chiropractor that consist of manual technique where the hands are used to manipulate, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, or otherwise influence the synovial joints and paraspinal tissues in the spinal column . The goal is to store joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile, or restricted in their movement, as a result of a tissue injury. Chiropractic Manipulative Treatment : The correction of misalignments, su bluxations, or segmental joint dysfunction of the bony articulations of the vertebral column, the pelvis, and adjacent areas. Maintenance Therapy : A treatment plan that seeks to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong and enhance the quality of life, or maintain or prevent deterioration of a chronic condition. When further clinical improvement cannot reasonably be expected from continuous ongoing care, and the chiropractic treatment becomes supportive rather than corrective in nature, the treatment is then considered maintenance therapy. Supportive Procedures and Therapies: Modes of care which may be administered dispensed or prescribed in addition to the primary Chiropractic procedure (i.e., Chiropractic adjustments or techniques/manipulative technique s). Such supportive procedures and therapies include but are not limited to the use of braces, casting, supports, traction, thermal modalities, ultrasound, electrical modalities, hydrotherapy, myotherapy, dietary and nutritional advice and/or supplementati on, and rehabilitative exercise therapy. The purpose of supportive procedures and therapies is to aid the chiropractor in assisting a patient to achieve a timely and favorable clinical outcome. A chiropractor shall not be required to apply supportive proce dures and therapies in the practice of chiropractic. Categories of Spinal Joint Problems: 1. Acute: A patient's condition is considered to be acute when the patient is being treated for a new injury, identified by x -ray or physical exam. The result of chiropractic treatment is expected to be an improvement in, or arrest of progression of the patient's condition. This result should be obtained within a reasonable and generally predictable period of time. Some patients with acute conditions may require several w eeks of treatment, (e.g., up to three months), while others require a much shorter duration of treatment. Initially, services may be more frequent, but Mass General Brigham Health Plan would expect to see a decrease in frequency as a result of the improvem ent in the patient's condition. 2. Chronic: A patient's condition is considered chronic when it is not expected to significantly improve or be resolved with further treatment (as is the case with an acute condition), but where continued therapy can be expected to result in some functional improvement. 3. Exacerbation: A temporary marked deterioration of the patient's condition due to an acute flare -up of the condition being treated. This must be documented in the patient's medical record, including the date of occurrence, nature of the onset, or other patient factors that will support the medical necessity of treatments for this condition. 4. Recurrence: A return of symptoms of a previously treated condition that has been quiescent for 30 or more days. This may requi re the re- institution of therapy.
