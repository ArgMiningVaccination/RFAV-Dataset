Justice Stevens said: For 30 days our flags have flown at half-mast as a gesture of respec t for our friend and colleague, William Hubbs Rehn\u00ad quist, the former Chief Justice of the United States, who died on September 3, 2005, at his home in Arlington, Virginia. Born in Milwaukee in 1924, Bill Rehnquist was the son of William Benjami n and Margery Peck Rehnquist. He at\u00ad tended publ ic element ary and high schools in Shorewood, Wisconsi n, a suburb of Milwaukee . During the Second World War he served in the Army Air Force as a weather observer in the United States and North Africa. He was honorably discharged in April of 1946. He was graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford Univer\u00ad sity with a B.A. and M.A. in 1948 and also received an M.A. from Harvard University in 1950. He earned his law degree from Stanford University in 1952, where he was rst in his class. After leaving Stanford, the Chief Justice was a law clerk to Supreme Cour t Justice Rober t H. Jackson from February 1952 through June 1953. He prac ticed law in Phoenix, Ari\u00ad zona, from 1953 to 1969 when President Nixon appoi nted him Assist ant Attorney Genera l, JUSTICE REHNQUIST was nomi nated as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Cour t of the United States by President Nixon on October 21, 1971, and swor n in on January 7, 1972. Some 14 years later Presi\u00ad dent Reagan nomi nated him Chief Justice of the United States and he was swor n in on September 26, 1986. Chief Justice Rehnquist was the longest serv ing Chief Justice since Chief Justice Melville Fuller, who died in ofce in 1910. While on the bench, Chief Justice Rehnquist authored 458 opinions for the Cour t, 376 dissenti ng opinions, and over 100 separate writings either concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part or explai ning his rulings as a circuit justice . These opinions were lucid expositi ons of the law, often revealing his excepti onal fami liarity with the history of our country . Moreover many of them, as well as the books that he au\u00ad thored, prov ided evidence of his profound love for our coun\u00ad try and our independent judicia l system. He was truly the rst among equa ls, having led us by examples of excel lence rather than by at. Although his opinions have shaped every impor tant area of the Cour t's jurisprudence , with his background as a prac ticing lawyer he realized that it was often the opinions issued with little fanfare that would have the greatest impac t on the day-to-day prac tice of law. mes opinions by quoti ng from Thomas Gray' s Elegy Written in a Country Church yard: \"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the deser t air.\" The members of this Cour t will greatly miss Chief Justice Rehnquist' s warmth and collegiality. I speak for all of us in expressi ng our sympathy to his son, Jim, his daugh\u00ad ters, Janet and Nancy , his grandch ildren, and to all those whose lives were touched by this remarkable man. At an appropr iate time, the traditi onal memor ial observance of the Cour t and the Bar of the Cour t will be held in this Cour troom. We now turn to the future . Tomorrow our flags will no longer fly at half-mast. Today we welcome our new Chief Justice, John G.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AT OCTOBER TERM, 2004 GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al. v. RAICH et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the ninth circuit No. 03-1454. Argued November 29, 2004 \u2014Decided June 6, 2005 California's Compassi onate Use Act author izes limited marijuana use for medici nal purposes. Respondents Raich and Monson are California residents who both use doctor-recommended marijuana for serious medica l conditi ons. After federa l Drug Enforcement Administrati on agents seized and destroyed all six of Monson' s cannabis plants, respond\u00ad ents brought this action seek ing injunc tive and declaratory relief pro\u00ad hibiting the enforcement of the federa l Control led Subst ances Act (CSA) to the extent it prevents them from possessi ng, obtaining, or manufac\u00ad turing cannabis for their persona l medica l use. Respondents claim that enforci ng the CSA against them would violate the Commerce Clause and other constituti onal prov isions. The District Cour on for a preliminary injunc tion, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, nding that they had demonstrated a strong likelihood of suc\u00ad cess on the claim that the CSA is an unconstituti onal exercise of Con\u00ad gress' Commerce Clause author ity as appl ied to the intrast ate, noncom\u00ad mercia l cultivati on and possessi on of cannabis for persona l medica l purposes as recommended by a patient' s physician pursuant to valid California state law. The cour t relied heav ily on United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, to hold that this separate class of purely local activities was beyond the reach of federa l power . 1 545US1 Syllabus Held: Congress' Commerce Clause author ity includes the power to pro\u00ad hibit the local cultivati on and use iance with Cali\u00ad fornia purposes of idati ng prov iding meani ngful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversi on into illegal channels, and streng th\u00ad ening law enforcement tools against inter national and interst ate drug trafck ing, Congress enac ted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven\u00ad tion and Control Act of 1970, Title II of which is the CSA. To effec tuate the statutory goals, Congress devised a closed regulatory system mak\u00ad ing it unlawfu subst ance except as author ized by the CSA. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 844(a). All control led subst ances are classi ed into ve schedu les, \u00a7 812, based on their accepted medica l uses, their potentia l for abuse , and their psycholog ical l 811, 812. Marijuana I , \u00a7 812(c), based on high potentia l for abuse , no accepted medica l use, and no accepted safety for use in medica lly superv ised treatment, Pp. 10-15. (b) Congress' power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic \"class of activities\" that have a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce is rmly established. See, e. g., Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 151. If Congress decides that the \" 'total inci\u00ad dence' \" of a prac tice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class. See, e. g., id., at 154-155. Of particular relevance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-128, where , in rejecting the appel lee farmer's contenti on that Congress' admitted power to regu\u00ad late the produc tion of wheat for commerce did not author ize federa l regulation of wheat produc tion intended whol ly for the appel lee's own consumpti on, the Cour t established that Congress can regulate purely intrast ate activity that is not itself \"commercia l,\" i. e., not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interst ate market in that commodity . The similarities between this case and Wickard are striking. In both cases, the regulation is squarely within Congress' commerce power be\u00ad cause produc tion of the commodity meant for home consumpti on, be it wheat or marijuana, has a subst antia l effec t on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity . In assessi ng the scope of Con\u00ad gress' Commerce Clause author ity, the Cour t need not deter mine whether respondents' activities, taken in the aggregate , subst antia lly affec t interst ate commerce in fact, but only whether a \"rati onal basis\" exists for so concludi ng. E. g., S., PAGES PGT: OPIN (2005) 21 S. C. \u00a7 801(5), and concer ns about diversi on into illicit channels, the Cour t has no difcu lty concludi ng that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrast ate manufac ture and possessi on of marijuana hole in the CSA. Pp. 15-22. (c) Respondents' heavy reliance on Lopez and Morrison over looks the larger context of moder n-era Commerce Clause jurisprudence pre\u00ad served by those cases, while also readi ng those cases far too broadly . The statutory challenges at issue there were markedly different from the challenge here . Respondents ask the Cour t to excise indiv idua l ap\u00ad plicati ons of a concededly valid comprehensive statutory scheme . In contrast, in both Lopez and Morrison, the parties asser ted that a partic\u00ad ular statute or prov ision fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety . This disti nction is pivot al for the Cour t has often reiterated that \"[w]here the class of activities is regulated and that class is within the reach of federa l power , the cour ts have triv\u00ad ial, indiv idua l instances' of the class. \" Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. More\u00ad over , the Cour t emphasi zed that the laws at issue in Lopez and Mor\u00ad rison had noth ing to do with \"commerce\" or any sort of economic enter prise. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 610. In contrast, the CSA regulates quintessentia lly economic activities: the produc tion, distr ibuti on, and consumpti on of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative , interst ate market. Proh ibiting the intrast ate possessi on or manufac ture of an article of commerce is a rational means of regulating commerce in that produc t. The Ninth Cir\u00ad cuit cast doubt on 's constituti onality by isolati ng a disti nct class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federa l power: the intrast ate, noncommercia l cultivati on, possessi on, and use of marijuana for persona l medica l purposes on the advice of a physician and in accord\u00ad ance with state law. However, Congress clear ly acted rationally in de\u00ad termining that this subdiv ided class of activities is an essentia l part of the larger regulatory scheme . The case comes down to the claim that a locally cultivated produc t that is used domestica lly rather than sold on the open market is not subjec t to federa l regulation. Given the CSA 's ndings and the undisputed mag nitude of the commercia l market for marijuana, Wickard and its progeny foreclose that claim. Pp. 23-33. 352 F. 3d 1222, vacated and remanded.

California is one of at least nine States that author ize the use of marijuana for medici nal purposes.1 The questi on pre\u00ad sented in this case is whether the power vested in Congress by Article I, \u00a7 8, of the Constituti on \"[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry ing into Execu\u00ad tion\" its author ity to \"reg ulate Commerce with n Na\u00ad tions, and among severa l States\" includes the power to proh ibit the local cultivati on and use of marijuana in compl i\u00ad ance with California law. I California has been a pioneer in the regulation of mari\u00ad juana. In 1913, California was one of the rst States to pro\u00ad hibit the sale and possessi on of marijuana,2 and at the end of the century , California became the rst State to author ize limited use of the drug for medici nal purposes. In 1996, California voters passed Propositi on 215, now codied as the Compassi onate Use Act of 1996.3 The propositi on 329-121 to 329-128 (2004 Cum. Supp .); Me. Rev. Stat.

Both women have been using marijuana as a medicati on for severa l years pursuant to their doctors' rec\u00ad ommendati on, and both rely heav ily on cannabis to func tion on a daily basis.

Respondent Raich, by contrast, is unable to cultivate her own, and thus relies on two careg ivers, litigati ng as \"John Does, \" to prov ide her with locally grown marijuana at no charge . These careg ivers also process the cannabis into hash ish or keif, and Raich herself processes some of the mar ijuana into oils, balms, and foods for consumpti on.

The case is made difcu lt by respondents' strong arguments that they will suffer irrep\u00ad arable harm because , despite a congressi onal nding to the contrary , marijuana does have valid therapeutic purposes. The questi on before us, howe ver, is not whether it is wise to enforce the statute in these circumst ances; rather , it is whether Congress' power to regulate interst ate markets for medici nal subst ances encompasses the portions of those mar\u00ad kets that are suppl ied with drugs produced and consumed locally. Well-settled law controls our answer . The CSA is a valid exercise of federa l power , even as appl ied to the trou\u00ad bling facts of this case. We accordi ngly vacate the judg\u00ad ment of Opinion of the Cour t II Shor tly after taking ofce in 1969, President Nixon de\u00ad clared a national \"war on drugs.\" 9 As the rst campaig n of that war, Congress set out to enac t legislati on that would consol idate various drug laws on the books into a comprehen\u00ad sive statute , prov ide meani ngful regulation over legitimate sources of drugs to prevent diversi on into illegal channels, and streng then law enforcement tools against the trafc in illicit drugs.10 That effor t culminated in the passage of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preventi on and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236. This was not, howe ver, Congress' rst attempt to regulate the national market in drugs. Rather , as early as 1906 Con\u00ad gress enac or shipment of any adulterated or misbranded drug travel ing in interst ate commerce .11 Aside from these label ing restr ic\u00ad tions, most domestic drug regulations prior to 1970 genera lly came in the guise of revenue laws, with the Depar tment of the Treasury serv ing as the Federa l Gover nment' s primary enforcer .12 For example , the primary drug control law, be\u00ad fore being repea led by the passage of the CSA, was the Har\u00ad rison Narcotics Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785 (repea led 1970).

Rather imposed produci ng, selling, or dealing in marijuana, and required the payment of an\u00ad nual taxes in additi on to transfer taxes whene ver the drug changed hands.15 Moreover , doctors wishing to prescr ibe marijuana for medica l purposes were required to with burdensome admi nistrative requireme would t them to prose\u00ad cution under state law.17 Thus, while the Marihuana Tax Act did not declare the drug illegal per se, the onerous admi nistrative requirements, the proh ibitively expensive taxes, on prac tically cur\u00ad tailed the marijuana trade . in 1970, after declarati on of the national \"war on drugs,\" federa l drug policy under went a signicant trans\u00ad on.

Second, at the end of his term, President Johnson fundamen\u00ad tally reorgani zed the federa l drug control agencies. The Bureau of Narcotics, then housed in the Depar tment of the Treasury , merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, then housed in the Depar tment of Health, Educati on, and Welfare (HEW), to create the Bureau of Narcotics and Dan\u00ad gerous Drugs, currently housed in the Depar tment of Jus\u00ad tice.18 Finally, prompted by a perceived need to consol idate the grow ing number of piecemea l drug laws and to en\u00ad hance federa l drug enforcement powers, Congress enac ted the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preventi on and Control Act.19 Title II of that Act, the CSA, repea led most of the earlier antidr ug laws in favor of a comprehensive regime to combat the inter national and interst ate trafc in illicit drugs. The main objec tives of the CSA were to conquer drug abuse and to control the legitimate and illegitimate trafc in control led subst ances.20 Congress was particularly concer ned with the 18 Musto & Korsmeyer 32-35; 26 Almanac 533. In 1973, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs became the DEA. See Reorg .

Title I relates to the preventi on and treatment of narcotic addic ts through HEW (now the Depar tment of Health and Human Serv ices). 84 Stat. 1238.

In assessi ng the validity of congressi onal regulation, none of our Commerce Clause cases can be viewed in isolati on. As char ted in considerable detail in United States v.

The DEA Administrator did not endorse the ALJ' s ndings, 54 Fed. Reg. 53767 (1989), and since that time has routi nely denied petiti ons to reschedu le the drug, most recently in 2001. 66 Fed. Reg. 20038 (2001). The Cour t of Appea ls for the District of Columbia Circuit has reviewed the petiti on to reschedu le marijuana on ve separate occasi ons over the course of 30 years, ultimately upholdi ng the Administrator 's nal order . See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeu tics v. DEA, Opinion of the Cour t evolved over time.24 The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the centra l problem giving rise to the Constituti on itself : the absence of any federa l commerce power under the Articles of Confederati on.25 For the rst century of our history , the primary use of the Clause was to preclude the kind of discr iminatory state legislati on that had once been permissible .26 Then, in response to rapid indus\u00ad trial development and an increasi ngly interdependent na\u00ad tional economy , Congress \"ushered in a new era of federa l regulation under the commerce power ,\" beginning with the enac tment of the Interst ate Commerce Act in 1887, 24 Stat. 379, and the Sher man Antitr ust Act in 1890, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.

Jones & Laugh lin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 37 (1937). Only the third category is implicated in the case at hand. Our case law rmly establishes Congress' power to regu\u00ad late purely local activities that are part of an economic \"class of activities\" that have a subst on ate com\u00ad merce e. Perez, 402 U. S., at 151; Wickard v. Fil\u00ad burn, 317 U. S. 111, 128-129 (1942). As we stated in Wick\u00ad ard, \"even if appel lee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce , it may still, whate ver its nature , be reached by Congress if it exer ts a subst antia l economic effec t on interst ate commerce .\" Id., at 125. We have never required Congress to legislate with scienti c exac titude . When Congress decides inci\u00ad dence' \" of a prac tice poses a threat to a national market, it may regulate the entire class. See Perez, 402 U. S., at 154- 155 (\" '[W]hen it is necessary in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so' \" (quoti ng Westfa ll v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 (1927))). In this vein, we have reiterated that when \" 'a genera l regulatory statute bears a subst antia l relati on to commerce , the de minimis charac ter of indiv idua l instances arising under that statute is of no consequence .' \" E. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558 (quoti ng Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196, n. 27 (1968); emphasis deleted). Our decisi on in Wickard, 317 U. S. 111, is of particular rele\u00ad vance . In Wickard, we upheld the appl icati on of regulations promu lgated under the Agricultura l Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, which were desig ned to control the volume of wheat mov ing in interst ate and foreig n commerce in order to avoid surpluses and consequent abnor mally low prices. The regulations established an allotment of 11.1 acres for Fil\u00ad burn's 1941 wheat crop, but he sowed 23 acres, intendi ng to use the excess by consumi ng PAGES RAICH Opinion of the Cour t argued that even though we had sustained Congress' power to regulate the produc tion of goods for commerce , that power did not author ize \"federa l regulation [of] produc tion not in\u00ad tended in any part for commerce but whol ly for consumpti on on the farm.\" Wickard, 317 U. S., at 118. Justice Jackson' s opinion for a unani mous Cour t rejected this submissi on. He wrote: \"The effec t of the statute before us is to restr ict the amount which may be produced for market and the ex\u00ad tent as well to which one may forest all resor t to the market by produci ng to meet his own needs. That ap\u00ad pellee's own contr ibuti on to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federa l regulation where , as here , his contr ibu\u00ad tion, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.\" Id., at 127-128. Wickard thus establishes that Congress can regulate purely intrast ate activity that is not itself \"commercia l,\" in that it is not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regu\u00ad late that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interst ate market in that commodity . The similarities between this case and Wickard are strik\u00ad ing. Like the farmer in Wickard, respondents are cultivat\u00ad ing, for home consumpti on, a fung ible commodity for which there is an established, albeit illegal, interst ate market.28 Just as the Agricultura l Adjustment Act was desig ned \"to 28 Even respondents acknowledge the existence of an illicit market in marijuana; indeed, Raich has persona lly participated in that market, and Monson expresses a willingness to do so in the future . App. 59, 74, 87. See also Department of Revenue of Mont . v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U.

See nn. 20-21, In Wickard, we had no difcu lty concludi ng that Congress had a rational basis for believing that, when viewed in the aggregate , leaving home\u00ad consumed wheat outside the regulatory scheme would have a subst antia l influence on price and market conditi ons. Here too, Congress had a rational basis for concludi ng that leaving home-consumed marijuana outside federa l control would similarly affec t price and market conditi ons. More concretely , one concer n prompti ng inclusi on of wheat grown for home consumpti on in the 1938 Act was that rising market prices could draw such wheat into the interst ate market, resu lting in lower market prices. Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128. The para llel concer n mak ing it appropr iate to include marijuana grown for home consumpti on in the CSA is the likelihood that the high demand in the interst ate mar\u00ad ket will draw such marijuana into that market. While the diversi on of homegrown wheat tended to frustrate the fed\u00ad eral interest in stabilizing prices by regulating the volume of commercia l transac tions in the interst ate market, the di\u00ad versi of homegrown marijuana tends to frustrate eral interest in eliminating commercia l transac tions in the interst ate market in their entirety . In both cases, the regu\u00ad lation is squarely within Congress' commerce power because produc tion of the commodity meant for home consumpti on, be it wheat or marijuana, has a subst antia l effec t on supply and demand in the national market for that commodity .29 29 To be sure , the wheat market is a lawfu l market that Congress sought to protec t and stabilize, whereas the marijuana market is an unlawfu l mar\u00ad ket that Congress sought to eradicate . This difference , howe ver, is of no constituti onal impor t. It has long been settled that Congress' power to regulate commerce includes the power to proh ibit commerce in a particu\u00ad545US1 20 GONZALES v. RAICH Opinion of the Cour t Nonetheless, respondents suggest that Wickard differs from this case in three respec ts: (1) the Agricultura l Adjust\u00ad ment Act, unlike the CSA, exempted small farming opera\u00ad tions; (2) Wickard l economic commercia l farm\u2014whereas respondents do not sell marijuana; and (3) the Wickard record made it clear that the aggregate produc tion of wheat for use on farms had a signicant impac t on market prices. Those differences, though factually accurate , do not diminish the precedentia l force of this Cour t's reasoni ng. The fact that Filburn's own impac t on the market was \"trivial by itself \" was not a sufcient reason for remov ing him from the scope of federa l regulation. 317 U. S., at 127. That the Secret ary of Agriculture elected to exempt even smaller farms from regulation does not speak to his power to regulate all those whose aggregated produc tion was sig\u00ad nicant, nor did that fact play any role in the Cour t's analy\u00ad sis. Moreover , even though Filburn was indeed a commer\u00ad cial farmer, the activity he was engaged in\u2014the cultivati on of wheat for home consumpti on\u2014was not treated by the Cour t as part of his commercia l farming operati on.30 And while it is true that the record in the Wickard case itself established the causa l connec tion between the produc tion for local use and the national market, we have before us ndings by Congress to the same effec t.

Moreover , even in the narrow prism of re\u00ad spondents' creati on, they read those cases far too broadly . Those two cases, of course , are Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, and Morrison, 529 U. S. 598.

Here, respondents ask us to excise indiv idua l appl icati ons of a concededly valid statutory scheme .

The Act did not regulate any eco\u00ad nomic activity and did not cont ain any requirement that the possessi on of a gun have any connec tion to past interst ate activity or a predic table impac t on future commercia l activ\u00ad ity. Distinguishing our earlier cases holdi ng that compre\u00ad hensive regulatory statutes may be validly appl ied to local conduc t that does not, when viewed in isolati on, have a sig\u00ad nicant impac t on interst ate commerce , the Cour t \"Sec tion 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has noth ing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of eco\u00ad nomic enter prise, howe ver broadly one might dene those terms. Section 922(q) is not an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intra\u00ad state activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore , be sustained under our cases upholdi ng regulations of ac\u00ad tivities that arise out of are connec ted with a commer\u00ad cial transac at 561. The statutory scheme that the Gover nment is defendi ng in this litigati on is at the opposite end of the regulatory spec\u00ad trum. As explai ned above , the CSA, enac ted in 1970 as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preventi on and Control Act, 84 Stat. 1242 -1284, was a leng thy and detailed statute creati ng a comprehensive framework for regulating the pro\u00ad duction, distr ibuti on, and trolled subst ances. \" Most of those subst ances\u2014those in Schedu les II through V\u2014\" have a usefu l and legitimate medica l purpose and are necessary to maintain the health and genera l welfare of the Amer ican people .\" 21 U.

The regulatory scheme is desig ned to foster the benecia l use of those medicati ons, to prevent their misuse , and to proh ibit entirely the possessi on or use of subst ances listed in Schedu le I, except as a part of a strictly control led research projec t. While the statute prov ided for the periodic updati ng of the ve schedu les, Congress itself made the initia l classi cati ons. It identi ed 42 and 17 hallu\u00ad cinogenic subst ances as Schedu le I drugs. 84 Stat. 1248. Marijuana was listed as the 10th item in the 3d subcategory .

The CSA is a statute that regulates the produc tion, distr ibuti on, and consumpti on of commodities for which there is an established, and lucrative , interst ate market. Proh ibiting the intrast ate possessi on or manufac\u00ad ture of an article of commerce is a rational (and commonly utilized) means of regulating commerce in that produc t.36 Such proh ibitions include speci c decisi ons requir ing that a drug be withdrawn from the market as a resu lt of the failure to comply with regulatory requirements as well as decisi ons excludi ng Schedu le I drugs entirely from the market. Be\u00ad cause the CSA is a statute that direc tly regulates economic, commercia l activity, our opinion in Morrison casts no doubt on its constituti onality. The Cour t of Appea ls was able to conclude other wise only by isolati ng a \"separate and disti nct\" class of activities that it held to be beyond the reach of federa l power , dened as \"the intrast ate, cultivati on, on and use of marijuana for persona l medica l purposes on the advice of a physician and in accordance with state law.\" 352 F. 3d, at 1229. The cour t charac terized this class as \"different in kind from drug trafck ing.\" Id., at 1228. The differences between the members of a class so dened and the princi\u00ad pal trafckers in Schedu a policy decisi on exempti ng the narrower class from the coverage of the CSA. The questi on, howe ver, is whether Congress' contrary policy judg ment, i. e., its de\u00ad cision to include this narrower \"class of activities\" within the larger regulatory scheme , was onally decient. We have no difcu lty concludi ng that Congress acted ration\u00ad ally in deter mining that none of the charac teristics mak ing up the purported class, whether viewed indiv idua lly or in the aggregate , compel led an exempti on from the CSA; rather , the subdiv ided class of activities dened by the Cour t 36 See 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 668(a) (bald and golden eagles); 18 U. S. OPIN 27 Cite as: 545 U. S. 1 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t of Appea ls was an essentia l part of the larger regulatory scheme . First, the fact that marijuana is used \"for persona l medica l purposes on the advice of a physician\" cannot itself serve as a disti nguishing factor. Id., at 1229. The CSA desig nates by charac\u00ad terizing marijuana as a Schedu le I drug, Congress expressly found that the drug has no accept able medica l uses. More\u00ad over , the CSA is a comprehensive regulatory regime speci \u00ad cally desig ned to regulate which control led subst ances can be utilized for medici nal purposes, and in what manner . In\u00ad deed, most of the subst ances classi ed the CSA \"have a usefu l and legitimate medica l purpose .\" 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 801(1). Thus, even if respondents are correc t that marijuana does have accepted medica l uses and thus shou ld be redesig nated as a lesser schedu le drug,37 the CSA would still impose con\u00ad trols beyond what is required by California law. The CSA requires manufac turers, physicians, phar macies, and other handlers of control led subst ances to comply with statutory and regulatory prov registrati produc tion quot ng and repor ting obligati ons, and prescr iption requirements. See 37 We acknowledge that evidence proffered by respondents in this case regardi ng the effec tive medica l uses for marijuana, if found credible after trial, would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the ndings that require marijuana to be listed in Schedu le I. See, e. g., Institute of Medici ne, Mar\u00ad ijuana and Medici ne: Assessi ng the Science Base 179 (J. Joy, S. Watson, & J. Benson eds. 1999) (recog nizing that \"[s]cienti c data indicate the potentia l of cannabi noid drugs, primarily THC [Tetrahydrocan\u00ad nabi nol] for pain of nausea vomiti ng, and appetite stimu\u00ad lation\"); see also Conant nizing valid medica l uses for marijuana and its derivatives). But the possibi lity that the drug may be reclassi ed in the future has no relevance to the questi on whether Congress now has the power to regulate its produc tion and distr i\u00ad bution. medica l subst ances 821-830; , the dispensi ng of new drugs, even when doctors approve their use, must await federa l approva l. United States v. Ruther\u00ad ford, 442 U. S. 544 (1979). Accordi ngly, the mere fact that marijuana \u2014like virtually every other control led subst ance regulated by the CSA\u2014is used for medici nal purposes can\u00ad not possibly serve to disti nguish it from the core activities regulated by the CSA. Nor can it serve as an or \"objec tive facto[r]\" the relevant class as the dis\u00ad senters suggest, post, at 47 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); post, at 68 (opinion of Thomas, J.). More fundament ally, if, as the principa l dissent contends, the persona l cultivati on, posses\u00ad sion, and use of marijuana for medici nal purposes is beyond the \" 'outer limits' of Congress' Commerce Clause author ity,\" post, at 42 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), it must also be true that such persona l use of marijuana (or any other homegrown drug) for recreati onal purposes is also beyond those \" 'outer limits, ' \" whether or not a State elects to author ize or even regulate such use. Justice Thomas' separate dissent suf\u00ad fers from the same sweepi ng implicati ons. That is, the dis\u00ad senters' rationale to place lation (includi ng quality, prescr iption, or quantity controls) of any locally cultivated and possessed control led subst ance for any purpose beyond the \" 'outer limits' \" of Congress' Commerce Clause author ity. One need not have a degree in economics to underst and why a nationwide exempti on for the vast quantity of marijuana (or other drugs) locally cultivated for persona l use (which presumably would include use by friends, neighbors, and fami ly members) may have a subst an\u00ad tial impac t on the empti on for such a signicant segment of the total market would under mine the order ly enforcement of the entire regu\u00ad latory scheme is entitled to a strong presumpti on of validity .

Second, limiting the activity to marijuana possessi on and cultivati on \"in accordance with state law\" cannot serve to place respondents' activities beyond congressi onal reach. The Supremacy Clause unambig uously prov ides that if there is any confl ict between federa l and state law, federa l law shall prevail. It is beyond peradventure that federa l power over commerce is \" 'super ior to that of the States to prov ide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabit ants, ' \" howe ver legitimate or dire those necessities may be.

Just as state acquiescence to federa l regulation cannot expand the bounds of the Com\u00ad merce Clause , see, e. g., Morrison, 529 U. S., at 661-662 (Breyer, J., dissenti ng) (noting that 38 States requested fed\u00ad eral interventi on), so too state action cannot circumscr ibe Congress' plenary commerce power . See United States v. Darby , 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941) (\"That power can neither be enlarged nor diminished by the exercise or non-exercise of state power \").38 38 That is so even if California's current controls (enac ted eight years after the Compassi onate Use Act was passed) are \"effec tive,\" as the dis\u00ad senters would have us blindly presume , post, at 53-54 (opinion of O'C on\u00ad nor, J.); post, at 63, 68 (opinion of Thomas, J.). California's decisi on (made 34 years after the CSA was enac ted) to impose \"stric[t] controls\" on the \"cultivati on and possessi on of marijuana for medica l purposes, \" post, at 62 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng), cannot retroac tively divest Congress of its au\u00ad thor ity under the Commerce Clause . Indeed, Justice Thomas' urgings to the contrary would turn the Supremacy Clause on its head, and would resurrec t limits on congressi onal power that have long since been re\u00ad jected. See post, at 41 (Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment )(quoti ng Mc- Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 424 'To impose on [Congress ] 545US1 v.

The dissenters fall prey to similar reasoni ng. See n. 38, supra, at 26 and this page . The notion that California law has surg ically excised a dis\u00ad crete activity that is hermetica lly sealed off from the larger interst ate marijuana market is a dubi ous propositi on, and, more impor tantly , one that Congress could have rationally rejected. Indeed, that the California exempti ons will have a signi\u00ad cant impac t on both the supply and demand sides of the market for marijuana is not just \"plausible\" as the principa l dissent concedes, post, at 56 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), it is readi ly apparent. The exempti on for physicians prov ides them with an economic incentive to grant their patients per\u00ad missi on to use the drug. In contrast to most prescr iptions for legal drugs, which limit the dosage and durati on of the usage , under California law the doctor's permissi on to the necessity of resor ting to means which it cannot control, which another gover nment may furnish or withhold, would render its course precar ious, the resu lt of its measures uncer tain, and create a dependence on other gover nments, which might disappoi nt its most impor tant desig ns, and is incompatible with the lang uage of the constituti on' \"). Moreover , in additi on to casti ng aside more than a century of this Cour t's Commerce Clause jurisprudence , it is notewor thy that Justice Thomas' suggesti on that States possess the power to dictate the extent of Congress' commerce power would have far-reach ing implicati ons be\u00ad yond the facts of this case. For example , under his reasoni ng, Congress would be equa lly power less to regulate, let alone proh ibit, the intrast ate possessi on, cultivati on, and use of marijuana for recrea tional purposes, an activity which all States \"strictly contro[ l].\" Indeed, his rationale seem\u00ad ingly would require Congress to cede its constituti onal power to regulate commerce whene ver a State opts to exercise its \"traditi onal police powers to dene the criminal law and to protec t the health, safety , and welfare of their citizens. \" Post, at 66 ng opinion).

The author ity to grant permissi on whene ver the doctor deter mines that a patient is afflicted with \"any other illness for which mari\u00ad juana prov ides 11362.5( b)(1)(A) (West Supp . 2005), is broad enough to allow even the most scrupulous doctor to conclude that some recre\u00ad ational uses would be therapeutic.39 And our cases have taught us that there are some unscr upulous physicians who over prescr ibe when it is sufciently prot able to do so.40 The exempti on for cultivati on by patients and careg ivers can only increase the supply of marijuana in the Califor\u00ad nia market.41 The likelihood that all such produc tion will 39 California's Compassi onate Use Act has since been amended, limiting the catcha ll category to \"[a]ny other chronic or persistent medica l symp\u00ad tom that either: ...[ s]ubst antia lly limits the ability of the person to con\u00ad duct one or more major life activities as dened\" in the Amer icans with Disabi lities Act of 1990, or \"[i]f not alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient' s safety or physica l or ment al health.\" Cal.

Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 11362.77( a) (West Supp . 2005). However, the quantity limitations serve only as a floor . Based on a doctor's recom\u00ad mendati on, a patient can possess whate ver quantity is necessary to satisfy his medica l needs, and cities and counties are given carte blanch e to estab\u00ad lish more generous limits. Indeed, severa l cities and counties have done just that.

V Respondents also raise a subst antive due process claim and seek to avail themselves of the medica l necessity de\u00ad fense . These theor ies of relief were set forth in their com\u00ad plaint but were not reached by the Cour t of Appea ls. We therefore do not address the questi on whether judicia l relief is available to respondents on these alternative bases. We do note , howe ver, the presence of another avenue of relief. As the Solicitor Genera l conr med during oral argument, the statute author izes procedures for the reclassi cati on of Schedu le I drugs. But perhaps even more impor tant than these legal avenues is the democratic process, in which the voices of voters allied with these respondents may one day be heard in the halls of Congress. Under the present state of the law, howe ver, the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls must be vacated. The case is remanded for further proceed\u00ad ings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, concurr ing in the judg ment. I agree with the Cour t's holdi ng that the Control led Sub\u00ad stances Act (CSA) may validly be appl ied to respondents' cultivati on, for per\u00ad sona l, medici nal use. I write separately because my under\u00ad standi ng of the doctrinal foundati on on which that holdi ng rests is, if not inconsistent with that of the Cour t, at least more nuanced. Since Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971), our cases have mechanica lly recited that the Commerce Clause per\u00ad mits congressi J., concurr ing in judg ment channels of interst ate commerce; (2) the instrument alities of interst ate commerce , and persons or things in interst ate commerce; and (3) activities that \"subst antia t\" inter\u00ad state commerce . Id., at 150; see United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 608-609 (2000); United States v. Lopez, U. (1995); Hodel v. Virg inia Surface Min\u00ad ing & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981). The rst two categor ies are self-e vident, since they are the ingredients of interst ate commerce itself . See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189-190 (1824). The third category , how\u00ad ever, is different in kind, and its recit without explana\u00ad tion is misleadi ng and incomplete is misleading because , unlike the channels, instrumen\u00ad talities, and agents of interst ate commerce , activities that subst antia lly affec t interst ate commerce are not themselves part of interst ate commerce , and thus the power to regu\u00ad late them cannot come from the Commerce Clause alone. Rather , as this Cour t has acknowledged since at least United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72 (1838), Congress' s regulatory author ity over intrast ate activities that are not themselves part of interst ate commerce (includi ng activities that have a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce) derives from the Necessary and Proper Clause . Id., at 78; Katzenbach v. Mc- Clung , (1964); United States v. Wrightwood Dair y Co., 315 U. S. 110, 119 (1942); Shrev eport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342, 353 (1914); United States v. E. C.

Where necessary to make a regulation of interst ate commerce effec tive, Congress may regulate even those intrast ate activities that do not themselves subst an\u00ad tially affec t interst ate commerce . I Our cases show that the regulation of intrast ate activities may be necessary to and proper for the regulation of inter\u00ad state commerce in two genera l circumst ances. Most di\u00ad rectly, the commerce power permits Congress not only to devise rules for the gover nance of commerce between States but also to facilitate interst ate commerce by eliminating po\u00ad tentia l obstr uctions, to eliminating poten\u00ad tial stimulants. See NLRB v. Jones & Laugh lin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1937). That is why the Cour t has repeat\u00ad edly sustained congressi onal legislati on on the ground that the regulated activities had a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce . See, e. g., supra, at (discr imination by restau\u00ad rants); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964) (discr imination by hotels); Mandev ille Island Farms, Inc. v. Ame rican Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 237 (1948) (intrast ate price xing); Board of Trade of Chicago v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1, 40 (1923) (activities of a local grain exchange); Stafford v. Wallace, 258 U. S. 495, 517, 524- 525 (1922) (intrast ate transac tions at stockyard). the expansive scope of Congress' s au\u00ad thor ity in this regard: \"[T]he leg\u00ad islati on regulating that activity will be sustained. \" Lopez, supra, at 560; Morrison, supra, at 610 (same). This principle is not without limitation. In Lopez and Morrison, the Cour t\u2014consci ous of the potentia l of the \"sub\u00ad affec ts\" test to \" 'obliterate the disti nction between what is national and what concurr ing in judg ment (quoti ng A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 554 (1935)); see also Morrison, supra, at 615- 616\u2014re jected the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the effec t that it may have on interst ate commerce through a remote chain of infer\u00ad ences. Lopez, supra, at 564-566; Morrison, supra, at 617- 618. \"[I]f we were to accept [such ] arguments, \" the Cour t reasoned in Lopez, \"we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an indiv idua l that Congress is without power to regu\u00ad late.\" 514 U. S., at 564; see also Morrison, supra, at 615- 616. Thus, although Congress' s author ity to regulate intra\u00ad state activity that subst antia lly affec ts interst ate commerce is broad, it does not permit the Cour t to \"pile inference upon inference ,\" Lopez, supra, at 567, in order to establish that noneconomic activity has a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce . As we implicitly acknowledged in Lopez, howe ver, Con\u00ad gress' s author ity to enac t laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interst ate commerce is not limited to laws di\u00ad rected against economic activities that have a subst antia l ef\u00ad fect on interst ate commerce . Though the conduc t in Lopez was not economic, the Cour t nevertheless recog nized that it could be regulated as \"an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrast ate activity were regulated. \" 514 U. S., at 561. This statement referred to those cases permitti ng the regulation of intrast ate activities \"which in a subst antia l way inter fere with or obstr uct the exercise of the granted power .\" Wrightwood Dair y Co., supra, at 119; see also United States v. Darby , 312 U. S. 100, 118-119 (1941); Shrev eport Rate Cases, supra, at 353. As the Cour t put it in Wrightwood Dair y, where Congress has the author ity to enac t a regulation of interst ate commerce , \"it possesses every power needed to make that regulation effec tive.\" 315 U. PGT: OPIN 37 545 U. S. 1 (2005) Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment Although this power \"to . . regulation effec tive\" commonly over laps with the author ity to regulate economic activities that subst antia lly affec t interst ate commerce ,2 and may in some cases have been confused with that author ity, the two are disti nct. The regulation of an intrast ate activ\u00ad ity may be essentia l to a comprehensive regulation of inter\u00ad state commerce even though the intrast ate activity does not itself \"subst antia lly affec t\" interst ate commerce . Moreover , as the passage from Lopez quoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even noneconomic local activity if that regula\u00ad tion is a necessary part of a more genera l regulation of inter\u00ad state commerce . See Lopez, supra, at 561. The relevant questi on is simply whether the means chosen are \"reasonably adapted\" to the attainment of a legitimate end under the commerce power . See Darby , supra, at 121. In Darby , for instance , policy of excludi ng from inter\u00ad state commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not confor m to the speci ed labor standards, \" 312 U. S., at 121, could not only require employers engaged in the pro\u00ad duction of goods for interst ate commerce to confor m to wage and hour standards, id., at 119-121, but could also require those employers to keep employment records in order to demonstrate compl iance with the regulatory scheme , id., at 125. While the Cour t sustained the former regulation on the alternative ground that the activity it regulated could have a \"great effec t\" on interst ate commerce , id., at 122-123, it afrmed the latter on the sole ground that \"[t]he require\u00ad 2 Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), presented such a case. Be\u00ad cause the unreg ulated produc tion of wheat for persona l consumpti on di\u00ad minished demand in the regulated wheat market, the Cour t said, it carried with it the potentia l to disrupt Congress' s price regulation by driving down prices in the market. Id., at 127-129. This potentia l disruption of Congress' s interst ate regulation, and not only the effec t that persona l consumpti on of wheat had on interst ate commerce , justi ed Congress' s regulation Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment ment for records even of the intrast ate transac tion is an appropr iate means to the legitimate end, \" id., at 125. As the Cour t said in the Shrev eport Rate Cases, the Nec\u00ad essary and Proper Clause does not give \"Congress ...t he author ity to regulate the inter nal commerce of a State, as such, \" but it does allow Congress \"to take all measures nec\u00ad essary or control led.\" 234 U. S., at 353; see also Jones & Laugh lin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 38 (the logic of the Shrev eport Rate Cases is not limited to instrument alities of commerce). II Today' s principa that, by to effec tive interst ate regulation, the Cour t reduces Lopez and Morrison to little \"more than a draf ting guide.\" Post, at 46 (opinion of O'C on\u00ad nor, J.). I think that criticism unjusti ed. Unlike the power to regulate activities that have a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce , power to enac t laws enabl ing effec tive regulation of interst commerce ercised in conjunc tion with congressi onal regulation of an interst ate market, and it extends only to those measures necessary to make the interst ate regulation effec tive. As Lopez itself states, and the Cour t afrms today , Congress may regulate noneconomic intrast ate activities only where the failure to do so \"cou ld... undercut\" its regulation of interst ate commerce . See Lopez, supra, at 561; ante, at 18, 24-25. This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line between \"what is truly national and what is truly local.\" Lopez, supra, at 567-568. Lopez and Morrison afrm that Congress may not regu\u00ad late certain \"purely local\" activity within the States based solely on the attenuated effec t that such activity may have in the interst ate market. But those decisi ons do not declare noneconomic intrast ate as: 545 U. S. 1 (2005) Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment the reach of the Federa l Gover nment. Neither case in\u00ad volved the power of Congress to exer t control over intra\u00ad state activities in connec tion with a more comprehensive scheme of regulation; Lopez expressly disclai med that it was such a case , 514 U. S., at 561, and Morrison did not even discuss the possibi lity that it was. (The Cour t of Appea ls in Morrison made clear that it was not. See Brzo nkala v. Virg inia Polytechn ic Inst., 169 F. 3d 820, 834-835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss this disti nction as \"super cial and formalistic, \" see post, at 47 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng), is to misunderst and the nature of the Necessary and Proper Clause , which empowers Congress to enac t laws in effec tua\u00ad tion of its enumerated powers that are not within its author\u00ad ity to enac t in isolati on. See McCull och v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421-422 (1819). And there are other restrai nts upon the Necessary and Proper Clause author ity. As Chief Justice Marsha ll wrote in McCull och v. Maryland, even when the end is constitu\u00ad tional and legitimate , the means must be \"appropr iate\" and \"plai nly adapted\" to that end. Id., at 421. Moreover , they may not be other wise \"proh ibited\" and must be \"consistent with the letter and spirit of the constituti on.\" Ibid. These phrases are not merely hortatory . For example , cases such as Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997), and New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), afrm that a law is not \"'proper for carry ing into Executi on the Commerce Clause' \" \"[w]hen 923-924; see also New York, supra, at 166. III The appl icati on of these principles to the case before us is straightfor ward. In the CSA, Congress has under taken to extinguish the interst ate market in Schedu le I control led Commerce Clause this. The power to regulate interst ate commerce \"extends not only to those regulations which aid, 545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN J., concurr ing in judg ment foster and protec t the commerce , but embraces those which proh ibit it.\" Darby , 312 U. S., at 113. See also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 45, 58 (1911); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 354 (1903). To effec tuate its objec tive, Congress with to dis\u00ad tribute) and noneconomic activities (simple possessi on). See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a), 844(a). That simple possessi on is a non\u00ad economic activity is immater ial to whether it can be proh ib\u00ad ited as a necessary part of a larger regulation. Rather , Congress' s author ity to enac t all of these proh ibitions of intrast ate control led-subst ance activities depends only upon whether they are appropr iate means of achieving the legiti\u00ad mate end ng Schedu le I subst from inter\u00ad state commerce . By this measure , I think the regulation must be sustained. Not only is it impossible to disti but it hardly makes sense to speak in such terms. Drugs like mar\u00ad ijuana are fung ible commodities. As the Cour t explai ns, marijuana that is grown at home and possessed for persona l use is never more than an instant from the interst ate mar\u00ad ket\u2014and this is so whether or not the possessi on is for me\u00ad dicinal use or lawfu l use under the laws of a particular State.3 3 The principa l dissent claims that, if this is sufcient to sustain the regulation at issue in this case , then it shou ld also have been sufcient to sustain the regulation at issue in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995). See post, at 52 (arguing that \"we could have surmised in Lopez that guns in school zones are 'never more than an instant from the inter\u00ad state market' in guns already subjec t to extensive federa l regulation, re\u00ad cast Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case , and thereby upheld the Gun-F ree School Zones Act\" (citation omitted)). This claim founders upon the shoa ls of Lopez itself, which made clear that the statute there at issue was \"not an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity.\" Lopez, supra, at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent' things, Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 41 Cite as: 545 U. S. 1 (2005) Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment See ante, at 25-33. Congress need not accept on faith that state law will be effec tive in maintaining a strict division between a lawfu l market for \"medica l\" marijuana and the more genera l marijuana market. See ante, at 30, and n. 38. \"To impose on [Congress ] the necessity of resor ting to means which it cannot control, which another gover nment may fur\u00ad nish or withhold, would render its course precar ious, the re\u00ad sult of its measures uncer tain, and create a dependence on other gover nments, which might disappoi nt its most impor\u00ad tant desig ns, and is incompatible with the lang uage of the constituti on.\" McCull och, 4 Wheat., at 424. Finally, neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest any violati on of state sovereig nty of the sort that would ren\u00ad der this regulation \"inappropr iate,\" id., at 421\u2014 except to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to state regulation. See post, at 48, 51 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); post, at 66 (opinion of Thomas, J.); Brief for Respondents 39-42. That is not enough to render federa l regulation an inappropr iate means. The Cour t has repeatedly recog nized that, if author ized by the commerce power , Congress may regulate private endeavors \"even when [that regulation] may pre-empt express state-law deter minations contrary to the resu lt which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress. \" National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 840 (1976); see Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14, 19 (1946); McCull och, supra, at 424. At bottom, respond\u00ad that statement is inexpl icable . Of course it is in additi on difcu lt to imag\u00ad ine what intelligible scheme of regulation of the interst ate market in guns could have as an appropr iate means of effec tuati on the proh ibition of guns within 1,000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent points to a federa l law, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(b)(1), barr ing licensed dealers from selling guns to minors, see post, at 52-53, but the relati onsh ip between the regu\u00ad latory scheme of which \u00a7 922(b)(1) is a part (requir ing all dealers in re\u00ad arms that have traveled in interst ate commerce to be licensed, see \u00a7 922(a)) and the statute at issue in Lopez approaches the nonexistent \u2014wh ich is doubtless why the Gover nment did not attempt to justi fy the statute on the basis of 545US1 ng ents' state-sovereig nty argument reduces to the contenti on that federa l regulation of the activities permitted by Califor\u00ad nia's Compassi onate Use Act is not sufciently necessary to be \"necessary and proper \" to Congress' s regulation of the interst ate market. For the reasons given above and in the Cour t's opinion, I cannot agree . * * * I thus agree with the Cour t that, howe ver the class of regulated activities is subdiv ided, Congress could reasonably conclude that its objec tive ibiting ld undercut\" if those activities were excepted from its genera l scheme of regulation. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. That is sufcient to author ize the appl icati on of the CSA to respondents. Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join as to all but Part III, dissenti ng. We enforce the \"outer limits\" of Congress' Commerce Clause author ity not for their own sake , but to protec t his\u00ad toric spheres of state sovereig nty from excessive federa l encroachment and thereby to maintain the distr ibuti on of power fundament al to our federa list system of gover nment. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 557 (1995); NLRB v. Jones & Laugh lin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 37 (1937). One of federa lism's chief virtues, of course , is that it promotes innovati on by allowing for the possibi lity that \"a single cou\u00ad rageous State may, if its citizens choose , serve as a labora\u00ad tory; and try novel socia l and economic exper iments without risk to the rest of the country .\" New State Ice Co. v. Lieb\u00ad mann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenti ng). This case exempl ies the role of States as laborator ies. The States' core police powers have always included au\u00ad thor ity to dene criminal law and to protec t the health, safety , and welfare of their citizens. Brech t v. Abraham son, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 43 U. S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng n. 30 (1977). Exercisi ng those powers, California (by ballot initiative and then by legislative codicati on) has come to its own conclusi on about the difcu lt and sensitive questi on of whether marijuana shou ld be available to relieve severe pain and suffer ing. Today the Cour t sanc tions an appl icati on of Subst ances Act that extinguishes that exper iment, without any proof that the persona l cultivati on, possessi on, and use of marijuana for medici nal purposes, if economic activity in the rst place , has a subst antia l effec t on interst commerce therefore an appropr iate sub\u00ad ject of federa l regulation. In so doing, the Cour t announces a rule that gives Congress a perverse incentive to legislate broadly pursuant to the Commerce Clause \u2014nestl ing ques\u00ad tionable asser tions of its comprehensive regu\u00ad latory schemes\u2014rather than with precisi on. That rule and the resu lt it produces in this case are irreconci lable with our decisi ons in Lopez, supra, and United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Accordi ngly I dissent. I In Lopez, we considered the constituti onality of the Gun- Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federa l of\u00ad fense \"for any indiv idua a rear m . . . at a place that the indiv idua l knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone ,\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A). We explai ned that \"Congress' commerce author ity includes the power to regulate those activities having a subst antia l rela\u00ad tion to interst ate commerce those activities that sub\u00ad stantia lly affec t interst ate commerce .\" 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citation omitted). This power derives from the conjunc\u00ad tion of the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause . Garc ia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Tran sit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 585-586 (1985) (O'Connor, J., dis\u00ad senti ng) (explai ning that United States v. Darby , 312 U. S. 100 (1941), United States v. Wrightwood Dair y Co., 315 U. S. 110 (1942), and Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), 545US1 12:16:40] J., dissenti ng based their expansi on of the commerce power on the Neces\u00ad sary and Proper Clause , and that \"the reasoni ng of these cases under lies every recent decisi on concer ning the reach of Congress to activities affec ting interst ate commerce\"); ante, at 34(Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment). We held in Lopez that the Gun-F ree School Zones Act could not be sustained as an exercise of that power . Our decisi on about whether gun possessi on in school zones subst antia lly affec ted interst ate commerce turned on four considerati ons. Lopez, supra, at 559-567; see also Mor\u00ad rison, at l effec cases genera lly have regula\u00ad tion of economic activity that affec ted interst ate commerce , but that \u00a7 922(q) was a criminal statute having \"noth ing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enter prise.\" Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. In this regard, we also noted that \"[s]ection 922(q) is not an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrast ate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore , be sustained under our cases upholdi ng regulations of activities that arise out of or are connec ted with a commercia l transac Second, we noted that the statute cont ained no express juris\u00ad dictional requirement to inter\u00ad state commerce . Ibid. Third, we found telling the absence of legislative ndings about the regulated conduc t's impac t on interst ate com\u00ad merce . We explai ned that while express legislative required nor, when prov ided, dispositive , ndings \"enable us such subst antia l effec t [is] visible to the naked eye.\" Id., at 563. Finally, we rejected as too atten\u00ad uated the Gover nment' s argument that rear m possessi on in school zones could resu lt in violent crime which in turn could 545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 45 Cite S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng adversely affec t the national economy . Id., at 563-567. The Constituti on, we said, does tolerate reasoni ng that would \"con vert congressi onal author ity under the Commerce Clause to a genera l police power of the sort retained by the States. \" Id., at 567. Later in Morrison, supra, we relied on the same four considerati ons to hold that \u00a7 40302 of the Violence Agai nst Women Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 1941, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 13981, exceeded Congress' author ity under the Commerce Clause . In my view, the case before us is mater ially indisti nguish\u00ad able from Lopez and Morrison when the same considerati ons are taken into account. II A What is the relevant conduc t subjec t to Commerce Clause analysis in this case? The Cour t takes its cues from Con\u00ad gress, apply ing the above considerati ons to the activity regu\u00ad lated by the Control led Subst ances Act (CSA) in genera l. The Cour t's decisi on rests on two facts about the CSA: (1) Congress chose to enac t a single statute on of all control led subst ances, and (2) Congress did not disti nguish between various forms of intrast ate noncom\u00ad mercia l cultivati on, possessi on, and use of See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 844(a). Today' s decisi on suggests that the federa l regulation of local activity is immune to Commerce Clause challenge because Congress chose to act with an ambiti ous, all-encompassi ng statute , rather than piecemea l. In my view, allowing Congress to set the terms of the constituti onal debate in this way, i. e., by packag ing regulation of local activity in broader schemes, is tantamount to remov ing meani ngful limits on the Commerce Clause . The Cour t's principa l means of disti nguishing Lopez from this case is to observe that the Gun-F ree School Zones Act of 1990 was a \"brief, single-subjec t statute ,\" ante, at 23, 545US1 12:16:40] PAGES dissenti ng whereas the CSA is \"a leng thy and detailed statute creati ng a comprehensive framework for regulating the produc tion, distr ibuti on, and possessi on of ve classes of 'control led sub\u00ad stances, ' \" ante, at 24. Thus, accordi ng to the Cour t, it was possible in Lopez to evaluate in isolati on the constituti onality of criminalizing local activity (there gun possessi on in school zones), whereas the local activity that the CSA targets (in this case cultivati on and possessi on of marijuana for persona l medici nal use) cannot be separated from the genera l drug control scheme of which it is a part. Today' s decisi on allows Congress to regulate intrast ate ac\u00ad tivity without check, so long as there is some implicati on by legislative desig n that regulating intrast ate activity is essen\u00ad tial (and the Cour t appears to equate \"essentia l\" with \"neces\u00ad sary\") to the interst ate regulatory scheme . Seizing upon our lang uage in Lopez that the statute proh ibiting gun pos\u00ad sessi on in school zones was \"not an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrast ate activity were regulated, \" 514 U. S., at 561, the Cour t appears to reason that the placement of local activity in a comprehensive scheme conr ms that it is essentia l to that scheme . Ante, at 24-25. If the Cour t is right, then Lopez stands for noth\u00ad ing more than a draf ting guide: Congress shou ld have de\u00ad scribed the relevant crime as \"transfer or possessi on of a rear m anywhere in the nation\"\u2014thus includi ng commercia l and noncommercia l activity, and ly encompassi ng some activity with assuredly subst on interst ate com\u00ad merce . Had it done so, the major ity hints, we would have sustained its author ity to regulate possessi on of rear ms in school zones. Further more , today' s decisi on suggests we would readi ly sustain a congressi onal decisi on to attach the regulation of intrast ate activity to a pre-existi ng comprehen\u00ad sive (or even not-so-comprehensive) scheme . If so, the Cour t invites increased federa l regulation of local activity even if, as it suggests, Congress would not enac t a new inter\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 47 Cite U. S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng state scheme exclusively for the sake of reach ing intrast ate activity, see ante, at 25, n. 34; ante, at 38-39 (Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment). I cannot agree that our decisi on in Lopez contemplated such evasive or overbroad legislative strateg ies with ap\u00ad prova l. Until today , such arguments have been made only in dissent. See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 657 (Breyer, J., dis\u00ad senti ng) (given that Congress can regulate \" 'an essentia l part of a larger regulation of economic activity,' \" \"can Con\u00ad gress save the present law by includi ng it, or much of it, in a broader 'Safe Transpor t' or 'Worker Safety' act?\"). Lopez and Morrison did not indicate that the constituti onality of federa l regulation depends on super cial formalistic dis\u00ad tinctions. Likew ise I did not underst and our discussi on of the role of cour ts in enforci ng outer limits of the Commerce Clause for the sake of maintaining the federa list balance our Constituti on requires, see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 557; id., at 578 (Kennedy , J., concurr ing), as a signal to Congress to enac t legislati on that is more extensive and more intrusive into the domai n of state power . If the Cour t always defers to Congress as it does today , little may be left to the notion of enumerated powers. The hard work for cour ts, then, is to identi fy objec tive markers for con ning the analysis in Commerce Clause cases. Here, respondents challenge the constituti onality of the CSA as appl ied to them and those similarly situated. I agree with the Cour t that we must look beyond respond\u00ad ents' own activities. Other wise, indiv idua l litigants could always exempt themselves from Commerce Clause regula\u00ad tion merely by pointing to the obvious\u2014that their persona l activities do not have a subst antia l effec t on interst ate com\u00ad merce . See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 193 (1968); Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127-128. The task is to identi fy a mode of analysis that allows Congress to regulate more than noth ing (by declining to reduce each case to its litigants) and less than everyth ing (by declining to let Congress set the 545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES O'Connor, J., dissenti ng terms of analysis). The analysis may not be the same in every case , for it depends on the regulatory scheme at issue and the federa lism concer ns implicated. See genera lly Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567; id., at 579 (Kennedy , J., concurr ing). A number of objec tive markers are available to con ne the scope of constituti onal review here . Both CSA itself, the California medica tion\u2014recog nize recre\u00ad ational) uses of drugs are realistica lly disti nct and can be segregated, and regulate them differently . See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 812; Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 11362.5 (West Supp . 2005); ante, at 5 (opinion Cour t). Respondents chal\u00ad lenge only the appl icati on of the CSA to medici nal use of marijuana. Cf. United States v. Raines , 362 U. S. 17, 20-22 (1960) (descr ibing our preference for as-appl ied rather than facia l challenges). Moreover , because fundament al struc\u00ad tura sovereig nty animate our Com\u00ad merce Clause cases, it is relevant that this case involves the inter play of federa l and state regulation in areas of criminal law and socia l policy, where \"States lay claim by right of history and exper tise.\" Lopez, supra, at 583 (Kennedy , J., see also Morrison, supra, at 617-619; supra, at 580 (Kennedy , J., concurr ing) (\"The statute before us upsets the federa l balance to a degree that renders it an unconstituti onal asser tion of the commerce power , and our interventi on is required\"); cf. Garc ia, 469 U. S., at 586 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng) (\"[S]tate autonomy is a relevant factor in assessi ng the means by which Congress exercises its powers\" under the Commerce Clause). California, like other States, has drawn on its reserved powers to disti n\u00ad guish the regulation of medici Congress' onally justi ed in this case , then, I would focus here on the persona l cultiva\u00ad tion, possessi on, and use OPIN 49 Cite U. S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng B Having thus dened the relevant conduc t, we must deter\u00ad mine whether , under our precedents, the conduc t is economic and, in the aggregate on of mar\u00ad ijuana for one's own medici nal use can proper ly be charac ter\u00ad ized as economic, and I questi on whether it can, it has not been shown that such activity subst antia lly affec ts interst ate neither self-e vident nor dem\u00ad onstrated that regulating such activity is necessary to the interst ate drug control scheme . The Cour t's denition of economic activity is breatht aking. It denes as any activity produc tion, distr ibuti on, and consumpti on of commodities. And it ap\u00ad pears to reason that when an interst ate market for a com\u00ad modity exists, regulating the intrast ate manufac ture sessi on of that commodity is constituti onal either because that intrast ate activity is itself economic, or because regulat\u00ad ing it is a rational part of regulating its market. Putti ng to one side the problem endemic to the Cour t's opinion\u2014the shift in focus from the activity at issue in this case to the entirety of what the CSA regulates, see Lopez, supra, at 565 (\"dependi ng on the level of genera lity, any activity can be looked upon as commercia l\")\u2014the Cour t's denition of eco\u00ad nomic activity for purposes of Commerce Clause jurispru\u00ad dence threatens to sweep all of produc tive human activity into federa l regulatory reach. The Cour t uses a dictionary denition of economics to skirt the real problem of draw ing a meani ngful line between \"what is national and what is local,\" Jones & Laugh lin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37. It will not do to say that Congress may regulate noncommercia l activity simply because it may have an effec t on the demand for commercia l goods, or because the noncommercia l endeavor can, in some sense , substitute for commercia l activity. Most commercia l goods or serv ices have some sort of privately producible 545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] ng substitutes for daycare . Char ades games substitute for mov ie tickets. Backyard or windowsi ll gardeni ng substi\u00ad tutes for going to the super market. To draw the line wher\u00ad ever private activity affec ts the demand for market goods is to draw no line at all, and to declare everyth ing economic. We have already rejected the resu lt that would follow\u2014a federa l police power . Lopez, supra, at 564. In Lopez and Morrison, we suggested that economic activ\u00ad ity usua lly relates direc tly to commercia l activity. See Mor\u00ad rison, 529 U. S., at 611, n. 4 (intrast ate activities that have been within Congress' power to regulate have been \"of an apparent commercia l charac ter\"); at 561 (disti nguishing the Gun-F ree School Zones Act of 1990 from \"activities that arise out of or are connec ted with a commer\u00ad cial transac tion\"). The homegrown cultivati on and possessi on and use of marijuana for medici nal purposes has no apparent commercia l charac ter. Everyone agrees that the marijuana at issue in this case was never in the stream of commerce , and neither were the suppl ies for grow ing it. (Mar ijuana is highly unusua l among the subst ances subjec t to the CSA in that it can be cultivated without any mater ials that have traveled in interst ate commerce .) Lopez makes clear that possessi on is not itself commercia l activity. Ibid. And respondents have not come into possessi on by means of any commercia l transac tion; they have simply grown, in their own homes, marijuana for their own use, without acquir ing, buying, selling, or bartering a thing of value. Cf. id., at 583 (Kennedy , J., concurr ing) (\"The statute now before us from exper imenti ng . . . and it does so by regulating an activity beyond the realm of commerce in the ordinary and usua l sense of that term\"). The Cour t suggests that Wickard, which we have identi\u00ad ed as \"perhaps the most far reach ing example of Commerce Clause author ity over intrast ate activity,\" Lopez, supra, at 560, established federa l regulatory power over any home consumpti on of a commodity for which a national market ex\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 51 Cite S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng ists. I disagree . Wickard involved a challenge to the Ag\u00ad ricultura l Adjustment Act of 1938 (AAA), which direc ted the Secret ary of Agriculture to set national quot as on wheat pro\u00ad duction, and pena lties for excess produc tion. 317 U. S., at 115-116. The AAA itself conr med that Congress made an expl icit choice not to reach\u2014and thus the Cour t could not possibly have approved of federa l control over\u2014sma ll-sca le, noncommercia l wheat farming. In contrast to the CSA 's limitless asser tion of power , Congress prov ided an exemp\u00ad tion within the AAA for small producers. When Filburn planted the wheat at issue in Wickard, the statute exempted planti ngs less than 200 bushels (about six tons), and when he harvested his wheat it exempted planti ngs less than six acres. Id., at 130, n. 30. Wickard, then, did not extend Commerce Clause author ity to someth ing as modest as the home cook 's herb garden. This is not to say that Congress may never regulate small quantities of commodities pos\u00ad sessed or produced for persona l use, or to deny that it some\u00ad times needs to enac t a zero tolerance regime for such com\u00ad modities. It is merely to say that Wickard did not hold or imply that small-sca le produc tion of commodities is always economic, and automatica lly within Congress' reach. Even assumi ng that economic activity is at issue in this case , the Gover nment has made no show ing in fact that the possessi on and use of homegrown marijuana for medica l pur\u00ad poses, in California or elsewhere , has a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce . Similarly, the Gover nment has not shown that regulating such activity is necessary to an inter\u00ad state regulatory scheme . Whate ver the speci c theory of \"subst antia l effec ts\" at issue (i. sub\u00ad stantia lly affec ts interst ate commerce regula\u00ad tion is necessary to an interst ate regulatory scheme , or both ), a concer n for dual sovereig nty requires that Congress' excursi on into the traditi onal domai n of States be justi ed. That is why charac terizing this as a case about the Neces\u00ad sary and Proper Clause does not change the analysis signi\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES dissenti ng cantly . Congress must exercise its author ity under the Nec\u00ad essary and Proper Clause in a manner consistent with basic constituti onal principles. Garc ia, 469 U. S., at 585 (O'C on\u00ad nor, J., dissenti ng) (\"It is not enough that the 'end be legiti\u00ad mate'; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constituti on\"). As Justice Scalia recog nizes, see ante, at 39 (opinion concurr ing in judg ment), Congress cannot use its author ity under the Clause to contravene the principle of state sovereig nty em\u00ad bodied in the Tenth Amendment. Likew ise, that author ity must be used in a manner consistent with the notion of enu\u00ad merated powers\u2014a structura l principle that is as much part of the Constituti on as the Tenth mere as\u00ad sertion is required when Congress purports to have power over local activity whose connec tion to an interst ate market is not self-e vident. Other wise, the Necessary and Proper Clause will always be a back door for unconstituti onal fed\u00ad eral regulation. Cf. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923 (1997) (the Necessary and Proper Clause is \"the last, best hope of those who defend ultra vires congressi onal ac\u00ad tion\"). Indeed, antia l effec ts\" cases for the Cour t to supply conceivable justi cati ons for intrast ate regulation related to an interst ate market, then we could have surmised in Lopez that guns in school zones are \"never more than an instant from the interst ate market\" in guns already subjec t to extensive federa l regulation, ante, at 40 (Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment), recast Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case , and thereby upheld the Gun-F ree School Zones Act of 1990. (Accordi ng to the Cour t's and the concurrence' s logic, for example , the Lopez Cour t shou ld have reasoned that the proh ibition on gun pos\u00ad sessi on in school zones be an appropr means of ef\u00ad on to \"any indiv idua l who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe is less than 545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 53 Cite U. S. 1 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng eighteen years of age.\" 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 922(b)(1) (1988 ed., Supp . II).) There is simply no evidence that homegrown medici nal marijuana users constitute , in the aggregate , a sizable enough class to have a discer nable , let alone subst antia l, im\u00ad pact on the national illicit drug market \u2014or other wise to threaten the CSA regime. Explicit evidence is helpfu l when subst antia l effec t is not \"visible to the naked eye.\" See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 563. And here , in part because common sense suggests that medica l marijuana users may be limited in number and that California's Compassi onate Use Act and similar state legislati on may well isolate activities relati ng to medici nal marijuana from the illicit market, the effec t of those activities on interst ate drug trafc is not self\u00ad evidently subst antia l. In this regard, again, this case is readi ly disti nguishable from Wickard. To decide whether the Secret ary could reg\u00ad ulate local wheat farming, the Cour t looked to \"the actual effec ts of the activity in questi on upon interst ate commerce .\" 317 U. S., at 120. Critica lly, the Cour t was able to consider \"actual effec ts\" because the parties had \"stipu lated a sum\u00ad mary of the economics of the wheat industry .\" Id., at 125. After reviewing in detail the picture of the industry pro\u00ad vided in that summary , the Cour t explai ned that consump\u00ad tion of homegrown wheat was the most variable factor in the size of the national wheat crop, and that on-site consumpti on could have the effec t of vary ing the amount of wheat sent to market by as much as 20 percent. Id., at 127. With real numbers at hand, the Wickard Cour t could easily conclude that \"a factor of such volume and variability as home\u00ad consumed wheat would have a subst antia l influence on price and market conditi ons\" nationwide. Id., at 128; see also id., at 128-129 (\"This record leaves us in no doubt\" record Wickard case itself J., dissenti ng tion for local use and the national market\" and argues that \"we have before us ndings by Congress to the same effect.\" Ante, at 20 (emphasis added). The Cour t refers to a series of declarati ons in the introduc tion to the CSA saying that (1) local distr ibuti on and possessi on of control l the effec tive control\" over inter\u00ad drug trafck ing. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 801(1)-(6). These bare declarati ons cannot be compared to the record before the Cour t in Wickard. They amount to noth ing more than a legislative insistence that the regulation of control led subst ances must be abso\u00ad lute. They are asser suppor ting evidence \u2014 descr iptive , statistica l, or other wise. \"[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity subst an\u00ad tially affec ts interst it so.\" Hodel v. Virg inia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 311 (1981) (Rehnquist , J., concur\u00ad ring in judg ment). Indeed, if declarati ons like these sufce to justi fy federa l regulation, and if the Cour t today is right about what passes rationality review before us, then our de\u00ad cision in Morrison shou ld have come out the other way. In that case , Congress had suppl ied numerous ndings regard\u00ad ing the impac t gender-motivated violence had on the national economy . 529 U. S., at 614; id., at 628-636 (Souter, J., dissenti ng) (chronicl ing ndings). But, recognizing \" ons affec t interst to come under the constituti onal power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicia l rather than a legislative questi on,\" ' \" we found Congress' detailed ndings inadequate Id., at 614 (quoti ng supra, at 557, n. 2, in turn quoti ng Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

The declarati ons are not even speci c to marijuana. (Facts about subst antia l effec ts may be developed in litigati on to compensate for the inadequacy of Congress' ndings; in part because this case comes to us from the grant of a preliminary injunc tion, there has been no such development.) Because here California, like other States, has carved out a limited class of activity for disti nct regulation, the inadequacy of the CSA 's ndings is especia lly glaring.

Nor has it shown that Compassi onate Use Act mar\u00ad ijuana users have been or are realistica lly likely to be respon\u00ad sible for the drug's seepi ng into the market in a signicant way. The Gover nment does cite one estimate that there were over 100,000 Compassi onate Use Act users in Califor\u00ad nia in 2004, Reply Brief for Petitioners 16, but does not ex\u00ad plain, in terms of propor tions, what their presence means for the national illicit drug market. See genera lly Wirtz, 392 U.

The Cour t also offers some ar\u00ad guments about the effec t of the Compassi onate Use Act on the national market. It says that the California statute might be vulnerable to exploit ation by unscr upulous physi\u00ad cians, over pro\u00ad duce , and that the history of the narcotics trade shows the difcu lty of cordoni ng off any drug use from the rest of the market. These arguments are plausible; if borne out in fact they could U.

III We would do well to reca ll how James Madison, the father of the Constituti on, descr ibed our system of joint sover\u00ad eignty to the people of New York: \"The powers delegated by the proposed Constituti on to the federa l gover nment are few and dened. Those which are to remai n in the State gov\u00ad ernments are numerous and inde nite. . . . The powers re\u00ad served to the severa l States will extend to all the objec ts which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concer n the lives, liberties, and proper ties of the people , and the inter nal order , improvement, and prosper ity of the State.\" The Federa list No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter 1961). ing on Congress' abstrac t asser tions, the Cour t has endorsed mak ing it a federa l crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one's own home for one's own medici nal use. This overreach ing stifles an express choice by some States, concer ned for the lives and liberties of their people , to regu\u00ad late medica l marijuana differently . If I were a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medica l marijuana ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have suppor ted the Compassi onate Use Act. But what\u00ad ever wisdom iment with medica l marijuana, the federa lism principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that room for exper iment be protec ted in this case. For these reasons I dissent. Justice Thomas, dissenti ng.

By holdi ng that Congress may regulate activity that is neither interst ate nor commerce under the Interst ate Commerce Clause , the Cour t abandons any attempt to enforce the Constituti on's limits on federa l power . The major ity suppor ts this conclusi on by invoking, without explanati on, the Necessary and Proper Clause . Regulating respondents' conduc t, howe ver, is not \"necessary and proper carry ing into Executi on\" Congress' ic\u00ad tions . Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18. Thus, neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to regulate respondents' conduc t. A As I explai ned at leng th in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate the buying and selling of goods and serv ices traf\u00ad cked across state lines. Id., at 586-589 ing opin\u00ad ion). The Clause' s text, structure , and history all indicate that, at the time of the foundi ng, the term \" 'commerce' con\u00ad sisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transpor t\u00ad ing for these purposes. \" Id., at 585 (Thomas, J., concur\u00ad ring). Commerce , or trade , stood in contrast to produc tive activities like manufac turing and agriculture . Id., ing). Throughout foundi ng-era tion, The Federa list Papers, and the raticati on debates, the term \"commerce\" is consistently used to mean trade or ex\u00ad change \u2014not all economic or gainful activity that has some attenuated connec tion 1 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng J., concurr ing); Barnett, the Com\u00ad merce Clause , 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 101, 112-125 (2001). The term \"commerce\" commonly meant trade or exchange (and shipping for these purposes) not simply to those involved in the draf ting and raticati on processes, but also to the gen\u00ad eral publ ic. Barnett, New Evidence of the Original Mean\u00ad ing of the Commerce Clause , 55 Ark. L. Rev. 847, 857-862 (2003). Even the major ity does not argue that respondents' con\u00ad duct is itself \"Commerce among the severa l States, \" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. Ante, at 22. Monson and Raich neither buy nor sell the marijuana that they consume . They cultivate their cannabis entirely in the State of California\u2014it never crosses state lines, much less as part of a commercia l transac tion. Certainly no evidence from the foundi ng suggests that \"com\u00ad merce\" included the mere possessi on of a good or some purely persona l activity that did not involve trade or ex\u00ad change for value. In the early days of the Republ ic, it would have been unth inkable that Congress could proh ibit the local cultivati on, possessi on, regu\u00ad lates a great deal trafck ing that is interst ate and commercia l in charac ter. The CSA does not, howe ver, criminalize only the interst ate buying and selling of mari\u00ad juana. Instead, it bans the entire market \u2014intrast ate Congress' commerce power as appl ied to their conduc t, which is purely intrast ate and noncommercia l. B More difcu lt, howe ver, is whether the CSA is a valid ex\u00ad ercise of Congress' power to enac t laws that are \"necessary and proper for carry ing into Executi on\" its power to regu\u00ad late interst ate commerce . Art. I, Thomas, J., dissenti ng and Proper Clause is not a warrant to Congress to enac t any law that bears some conceivable connec tion to the exercise of an enumerated power .1 Nor is it, howe ver, a command to Congress to enac t only laws that are absolutely indispensable to the exercise of an enumerated power .2 In McCull och v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), this Cour t, speak ing through Chief Justice Marsha ll, set forth a test for deter mining when an Act of Congress is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause: \"Let the end be legitimate , let it be within the scope of the constituti on, and all means which are appropr iate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not proh ibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constituti on, are constituti onal.\" Id., at 421.

The Cour t of Appea ls found that respond\u00ad ents' \"limited use is clear ly disti nct from the broader illicit drug market, \" because \"th[eir] medici nal marijuana . . . is not intended for, nor does it enter , the stream of commerce .\" Raich v. Ashcro ft, 352 F. 3d 1222, 1228 (CA9 2003). If that is genera lly true of indiv idua ls who grow and use marijuana for medica l purposes under state law, then even assumi ng Congress has \"obv ious\" and \"plai regulating intrast ate cultivati on and possessi on is necessary to regulat\u00ad ing the interst ate drug trade , none of those reasons appl ies to medica patients like t apar t from other intrast ate producers and users of marijuana.

To be sure , Congress declared that state policy would dis\u00ad rupt federa l law enforcement. It believed the across-the\u00ad board ban essentia l to policing interst ate drug trafck ing. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 801(6). But as Justice O'Connor points out, Congress presented no evidence in suppor t of its conclusi ons, which are not so much ndings of fact as asser tions of power . Ante, at 53-55 (dissenti ng opinion). Congress cannot dene the scope of its own power merely by declar ing the necessity of its enac tments. In sum, neither in enac ting the CSA nor in defendi ng its appl icati on to respondents has the nment offered any obvious reason why banni ng medica l marijuana use is neces\u00ad sary to tide of interst ate drug trafck ing. Con\u00ad gress' goal of curtailing the interst ate drug trade would not plainly be thwar ted if it could not apply the CSA to patients like Monson and Raich. That is, unless Congress' aim is really to exercise police power of the sort reserved to the States in order to eliminate even the intrast ate possessi on and use of marijuana. 2 Even assumi ng the CSA 's ban on locally cultivated and consumed marijuana is \"necessary ,\" that does not mean it is Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN 65 Cite S. 1 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng also \"proper .\" The means selec ted by Congress to regulate interst ate commerce cannot be \"proh ibited\" by, or inconsist\u00ad ent with the \"letter and spirit\" of, the Constituti on. McCul\u00ad loch, 4 Wheat., at 421. In Lopez, I argued that allowing Congress to regulate intrast ate, noncommercia l activity under the Commerce Clause would confer on Congress a genera l \"police power \" over the Nati on. 514 U. S., at 584, 600 (concurr ing opinion). This is no less the case if Congress ties its power to the Necessary and Proper Clause rather than the Commerce Clause . When agents from the Drug Enforcement Admin\u00ad istrati on raided Monson' s home , they seized six cannabis plants. If the Federa l Gover nment can regulate grow ing a half-dozen cannabis plants for persona l consumpti on (not be\u00ad cause it is interst ate commerce , but because it is inextr icably bound up with interst ate commerce), then Congress' Arti\u00ad cle I powers\u2014as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause \u2014have no meani ngful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possessi on of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may conti nue to \"appropr iat[e] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce .\" United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurr ing). Even if Congress may regulate purely intrast ate activity when essentia l to exercisi ng some enumerated power , see Dewitt, 9 Wall., at 44; but see Barnett, The Original Meani ng of the Necessary and Proper Clause , 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 183, 186 (2003) (detailing statements by Founders that the Necessary and Proper Clause was not intended to expand the scope of Congress' enumerated powers), Congress may not use its incident al author ity to subver t basic principles of federa lism and dual sovereig nty. Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 923-924 (1997); v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 732-733 (1999); Garc ia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Tran sit Authority, 469 U.

S. 619, 635 (1993); Hillsborough County v. Autom ated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 719 (1985). Further, the Gover nment' s rationale\u2014that it may regulate the produc tion or possessi on of any commodity for which there is an interst ate market \u2014threatens to remove the remai ning vestiges of States' traditi onal police powers.

S. 1 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng II The major ity advances three reasons why the CSA is a legitimate exercise of Congress' author ity under the Com\u00ad merce Clause: ante, 22; second, regulation of respondents' conduc t is essentia l to regulating the interst ate marijuana market, ante, at 24-25; and, third, regulation of respondents' conduc t is inci\u00ad dent al to regulating the interst ate marijuana market, ante, at 22. Justice O'Connor explai ns why the major ity's rea\u00ad sons cannot be reconci led with our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence . The major ity's justi cati ons, howe ver, suffer from even more fundament al flaws. A The major ity holds that Congress may regulate intrast ate cultivati on and possessi on of medica l marijuana under the Commerce Clause , because such conduc t arguably has a subst antia l effec t on interst ate commerce . The major ity's decisi on is further proof that the \"subst antia effec ts\" test is a Morrison, supra, at 627 (Thomas, ing). The major ity's treatment of the subst antia l effec ts test is rootless, because it is not tethered to either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause . Under the Commerce Clause , Congress may regulate interst ate com\u00ad merce ate com\u00ad merce , any more than activities that do not fall within, but that affec t, the subjec ts of its other Article I powers. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 589 (Thomas, J., concurr ing). Whate ver additi onal latitude the Necessary and Proper Clause affords, supra, at 65-66, the questi on is whether Congress' legisla\u00ad tion is essentia l to the regulation of interst ate commerce it\u00ad self\u2014not whether the legislati on [04-07-08 12:16:41] dissenti ng activities that subst antia lly affect interstate commerce. Supra, at 60-61; ante, at 37 (Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment). The major ity's treatment of subst antia l effec ts test is malleable , because major ity expands the relevant con\u00ad duct. By dening the class at a high level of genera lity (as the intrast ate manufac ture and possessi on of marijuana), the major ity over looks that indiv idua ls author ized by state law to manufac marijuana effec t on the interst ate drug market. Supra, at 64. The major ity ignores that whether a particular ac\u00ad tivity subst antia lly within Congress' reach on the major ity's approach\u2014 can turn on a number of objec tive factors, like state action or features of the regulated activity itself . Ante, at 47-48 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng). For instance , here , if California and States are effec tively regulating medica l mari\u00ad juana users, then these users have little effec t on the inter\u00ad state drug trade .6 The subst antia l effec ts test is easily manipu lated for an\u00ad other reason. This Cour t has never held that Congress can 6 Remarkably , the major ity goes so far as to declare this questi on irrele\u00ad vant. It asser if California's current controls are effec tive, because state action can neither expand nor contrac t Congress' powers. Ante, at 29-30, n. ity's asser tion is mis\u00ad leadi ng. Regardless of state action, Congress has the power to regulate intrast ate economic activities that subst antia lly affec t interst ate com\u00ad merce (on the major ity's view) or activities that are necessary and proper to effec tuati ng its commerce power (on my view). But on either ap\u00ad proach, whether an intrast ate activity falls within the scope of Congress' powers turns on factors that the major ity is unwilling to confront. The major ity apparently believes that even if States prevented any medica l marijuana from enter ing the illicit drug market, and thus even if there were no need for the CSA to gover n medica l marijuana users, we shou ld uphold the CSA under the Comme rce Clause and the Necessar y and Proper Clause . Finally, to invoke the Supremacy Clause , as the major ity does, ante, at 29, n. 38, is to beg the questi on. The CSA displaces Califor\u00ad as appl ied to respondents' conduc t, but that is the questi . OPIN 69 S. 1 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng at 613 (\"[T]hus far in our Nati on's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrast ate activity only where that activity is economic in nature\" (emphasis added)); Lopez, supra, at 560. To evade even that modest restr iction on fed\u00ad eral power , the major ity denes economic activity in the broadest possible terms as \"'the produc tion, distr ibuti on, and consumpti on of commodities. ' \" 7 Ante, at 25 (quoti ng Webster 's Third New Inter national Dictionary 720 (1966) (herei nafter Webster 's 3d)). This carves out a vast swath of activities that are subjec t to federa l regulation. See ante, at 49-50 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng). If the major ity is to be taken seriously , the Federa l Gover nment may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States. This makes a mockery of Madison' s assur\u00ad ance to the people of New York that the \"powers delegated\" to the Federa l Gover nment are \"few and dened, \" while those of States are \"numerous and inde nite.\" The Fed\u00ad eralist No. 45, at 313. Moreover , even a Cour t interested more in the moder n than the original underst andi ng of the Constituti on ought to resolve cases based on the meani ng of words that are actu\u00ad ally in the document. Congress is author ized to regulate \"Commerce ,\" and respondents' conduc t does not qualify under any denition of that term.8 The major ity's opinion 7 Other dictionar ies do not dene the term \"economic \" as broadly as the major ity does. See, e. g., The Amer ican Heritage Dictionary of the Eng\u00ad lish Lang uage 583 (3d ed. 1992) (dening \"economic as \"[o]f or relati ng to the produc tion, development, and management of material wealth, as of a country , household, or business enter prise\" (emphasis added)). The ma\u00ad jority does not explai n why it selec ts a remarkably expansive 40-year-old denition. 8 See, e. g., id., at 380 (\"[t]he buying and selling of goods, especia lly on a large scale, as between cities or nations\"); The Random House Dictionary of the English Lang uage 411 (2d ed. 1987) (\"an interchange of goods or commodities, esp. on a large scale between different countr ies... or be\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U54 [04-07-08 12:16:41] Thomas, J., dissenti ng only illustrates the steady drift away from the text of the Commerce Clause . There is an inexorable expansi on from \" '[c]ommerce ,' \" ante, at 5, to \"commercia l\" and \"economic \" activity, ante, at tion, an \"established . . . interst ate market, \" ante, at 26. Federa l power expands, but never contrac ts, with each new locuti on. The major ity is not inter preti ng the Commerce Clause , but rewr iting it. The major ity's rewr iting of the Commerce Clause seems to be rooted in the belief that, unless the Commerce Clause covers the entire web of human activity, Congress will be left power less to regulate the national economy effec tively . Ante, at 18-19; Lopez, 514 U. (Kennedy , J., concurr ing). The interconnec tedness of economic activity is not a moder n phenomenon unfami liar to the Framers. Id., at 590-593 (Thomas, J., concurr ing); Letter from J. Madison to S. Roane (Sept. 2, 1819), in 3 The Founders' Constituti on 259-260 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987). Moreover , the Framers understood what the major ity does not appear to fully appreciate: There is a danger to concentrati ng too much, as well as too little, power in the Federa l Gover nment. This Cour t has carefu lly avoided stripping Congress of its ability to regulate interstate commerce , but it has casua lly allowed the Federa l Gover nment to strip States of their abil\u00ad ity to regulate intrastate commerce \u2014not to menti on a host of local activities, like mere drug possessi on, that are not commercia l. One searches the Cour t's opinion in vain for any hint of what aspec t of Amer ican life is reserved to the States. Yet this Cour t knows that \" '[t]he Constituti on created a Federa l Gover nment of limited powers. ' \" New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 155 (1992) (quoti ng Gregory v. Ashcro ft, tween different parts of the same country\"); Webster 's 3d 456 (\"the ex\u00ad change or buying and selling of commodities esp. on a large scale and involv ing transpor tation OPIN Cite S. 1 (2005) 71 Thomas, J., dissenti ng 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991)). That is why today' s decisi on will add no measure of stability to our Commerce Clause juris\u00ad prudence: This Cour t is willing neither to enforce limits on federa l power , nor to declare the Tenth Amendment a dead letter . If stability is possible , it is only by ng the . severa States. \" Congress may regulate interst ate commerce \u2014not things that affec t it, even when summed together , unless truly \"necessary and proper \" to regulating interst ate commerce . B The major ity also inconsistently contends that regulating respondents' conduc t is both incident al and essentia l to a comprehensive legislative scheme . Ante, at 22, 24-25. I have already explai ned why the CSA 's ban on local activity is not essentia l. Supra, at 64. However, the major ity fur\u00ad ther claims that, because the CSA covers a great deal of interst ate commerce , it \"is of no moment\" if it also \"ensnares some purely intrast ate activity.\" Ante, at 22. So long as Congress casts its net broadly over an interst ate market, accordi ng to the major ity, it is free to regulate interst ate and intrast ate activity alike. This cannot be justi ed under either the Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause . If the activity is purely intrast ate, then it may not be regulated under the Commerce Clause . And if the regu\u00ad lation of the intrast ate activity is purely incident al, then it may not be regulated under the Necessary and Proper Clause . Nevertheless, the major ity terms this the \"pivot al\" dis\u00ad tinction between the present case and Lopez and Morrison. Ante, at 23. In Lopez and Morrison, the parties asser ted facia l challenges, claiming \"that a particular statute or prov i\u00ad sion fell outside Congress' commerce power in its entirety .\" Ante, at 23. Here, by contrast, respondents claim only that the CSA falls outside Congress' commerce power indiv idua l to the major ity, while cour ts may set aside whole statutes or prov may not \"excise indiv idua l appl ons of a concededly valid statutory scheme .\" Ibid.; see also Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 192-193 (1968). It is true that if respondents' conduc t is part of a \"class of activities . . . and that class is within the reach of federa l power ,\" Perez, supra, at 154 (emphasis deleted), then re\u00ad spondents may not point to the de minimis effec t of their own persona l conduc t on the interst ate drug market, Wirtz, supra, at 196, n. 27. Ante, at 47 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng). But that begs the questi on at issue: whether respondents' \"class of activities\" is \"within the reach of federa l power ,\" which depends in turn on whether the class is dened at a low or a high level of genera lity. Supra, at 61-62.

If the major ity is correc t that Lopez and Morrison are disti nct because they were facia l challenges to \"par ticular statute[ ante, at 23, then congressi onal power turns on the manner in which Congress packages leg\u00ad islati on. Under the major ity's reasoni ng, Congress could not enac t\u2014either as a single-subjec t statute or as a separate prov ision in CSA\u2014a of marijuana. Nor could it enac t an intra\u00ad state ban simply to supplement existi ng drug regulations. However, that same proh ibition is perfectly constituti onal when integrated into a piece of legislati on that reaches other regulable conduc t. Lopez, 514 U.

Argued January 10, 2005 \u2014Decided June 6, 2005 States are genera lly entitled \"under both the equa l footi ng doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under the Submerged Lands Act alone to sub\u00ad merged lands extendi ng three miles seaward of [their ] coastl ine[s].\" United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 6 (Alaska (Arctic Coast)). The Federa l Gover nment can overcome the presumpti on of title and defeat a future State's claim, howe ver, by setti ng submerged lands aside before statehood in a way that shows an intent to retain title. Id., at 33-34. Here, Alaska and the United States dispute title to two areas of sub\u00ad merged lands. The rst consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands under lying waters in the Alexander Arch ipelago that are more than three nautica l miles from the coast of the mainland or any indiv id\u00ad ual island. Alaska can claim these pockets and enclaves only if the arch ipelago waters themselves qualify as inland waters. The second area consists of submerged lands beneath the inland waters of Glacier Bay, a well-marked indent ation into the southeaster n Alaskan coast. To claim them, the United States must rebut Alaska' s presumpti on of title. The Specia l Master recommended that summary judg ment be granted to the United States with respec t to both areas, concludi ng that the Alexander Arch ipelago waters do not qualify as inland waters either under a histor ic inland waters theory or under a juridica l bay theory , and concludi ng that the United States had rebutted the presumpti on that title to the disputed submerged lands beneath Glacier Bay passed to Alaska at statehood. Alaska led excepti ons to these conclusi ons. 81-110. The Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters are not histor ic inland waters. To make a histor ic waters claim, a State must show that the United States exercises author ity over the area, has done so conti nu\u00ad ously , and has done so with the acquiescence of foreig n nations. This \"exercise of sovereig nty must have been, histor ically, an asser tion of power to exclude all foreig n vessels and navigati on,\" United States v. Alaska, 422 U. S. 184, 197, includi ng vessels engaged in \"innocent pas\u00ad sage ,\" i. e., passage that does not prejudice the coast al State's peace , good order , or secur ity. Based on his exami nation of ve different peri\u00ad ods from 1821 to the present, the Specia l Master found that Russia and the United States histor ically have not asser ted the [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 76 ALASK A v.

The evidence that Alaska points to\u2014includi ng incidents during Russian and early United States sovereig nty, and the United States' litigati ng a 1903 to demonstrate the conti nu\u00ad ous asser tion of exclusive author ity, with acquiescence of foreig n na\u00ad tions, necessary to suppor t a histor ic inland waters claim. Pp. 81-92. (b) Nor do the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters qualify as inland wa\u00ad ters under the juridica l bay theory Alaska advances in the alternative . The claimed juridica l bays would exist only if, at minimum, four of the arch ipelago' s islands were deemed to form a constr uctive peni nsula ex\u00ad tendi ng from the mainland and dividing the arch ipelago' s waters in two. Yet even assumi ng, arguendo, that each of the islands shou ld assimi\u00ad lated one to another , Alaska' s hypothetica l bays still would not meet the criteria for juridica l bays set forth in Article 7(2) of the Conventi on on the Territorial Sea and the Contig uous Zone (herei nafter Conventi on). In particular, the resu lting bodies of water north and south of Alaska' s constr uctive peni nsula indent ations under the Conventi on, for they do not possess physica l features that would allow a mariner looking at navigati onal char ts that do not depic t bay closi ng lines nonetheless to perceive the bays' limits in order to avoid illegal encroachment into inland waters. Pp. 92-96. (c) The United States has rebutted Alaska' s presumed title to the sub\u00ad merged lands under lying the waters of Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument (now Glacier Bay Nati onal Park). The United States can defeat a fu\u00ad ture State's presumed title to submerged lands by, inter alia, setti ng the lands aside as part of a federa l reservati on \"such as a wildlife refuge .\" Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 273. To deter mine whether Congress has used that power , this Cour t rst asks whether the United States clear ly intended to include the submerged lands within the reservati on. If the answer is yes, the Cour t then asks whether the United States expressed its intent to retain federa l title to the lands within the reservati on. The Specia l Master 's conclusi on that the monument, at the time of Alaska' s statehood, included the submerged lands under lying Glacier Bay has strong suppor t in the precedents and whole record of the case , and Alaska does not take excepti on to it. As for the second questi on, the Alaska Statehood Act's (ASA) overcome from the equa l-footi ng doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) and to reserve Glacier Bay' s sub\u00ad merged lands to the United States. Under the ASA, Alaska acquired title to any proper ty previously be\u00ad long ing to the Territory of Alaska and the United States retained title to its proper ty located within Alaska' s borders, subjec t to PGT: OPIN 77 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Syllabus forth in ASA \u00a7 6. The rst clause of \u00a7 6(e) direc ts a transfer to Alaska of any United States proper ty used \"for the sole purpose of conservati on and protec tion of [Alaska' s] sher ies and wildlife\" under three speci ed federa l laws. The second prov iso following that clause made clear that the initia l clause' s direc tive did not apply to \"lands withdrawn or other\u00ad wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for [wildlife] protec tion.\" In Alaska (Arctic Coast), this Cour t held that the prov iso expressed con\u00ad gressi onal intent to retain title to a reservati on such as the Arctic Na\u00ad tional Wildlife Refuge , and that intent was sufcient to defeat Alaska' s presumed title under both the equa l-footi ng doctrine and the SLA. Alaska cannot avoid resu lt here . Alaska' s narrow readi ng\u2014that the prov iso appl ies only to federa l proper ty covered by \u00a7 6(e)'s initia l clause , which does not include Glacier Bay\u2014is neither necessary nor preferred. A prov iso may refer only to things covered by a precedi ng clause , but it can also state a genera l, independent rule. The Cour t agrees with the United States that the prov iso is best read, in light of the inter pret ation given to it in Alaska (Arctic Coast), as expressi ng an independent and genera l rule uncoupled from the initia l clause . Under the initia l clause the United States obli\u00ad gated itself to transfer to Alaska equipment and other proper ty used for genera l sh and wildlife management responsibi lities Alaska was to under take upon acquir ing statehood. Under the prov iso the United States expressed its intent, notw ithst andi ng this proper ty transfer , to ownersh ip over all federa l refuges and reservati ons set aside for the protec tion of wildlife, regardless of the speci c statutory author ity enabl ing the set-aside .

The State of Alaska has invoked our original jurisdic tion to resolve its dispute with the United States over title to certain submerged lands under lying waters located in south\u00ad east Alaska. Alaska initiated the action by ling a com\u00ad plaint with leave of the Cour t. 530 U. S. 1228 (2000). We appoi nted Professor Gregory E.

For the reasons we discuss, Alaska' s excep\u00ad tions are overr uled. I We begin by reviewing the genera l principles elaborated in the resoluti on of similar submerged lands disputes in our earlier cases. States enjoy a presumpti on of title to submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters within their boundar ies and *Louis R. Cohen led a brief for the Nati onal U. S. 75 (2005) 79 Opinion of the Cour t beneath territorial waters within three nautica l miles of their coasts. This presumpti on flows from two sources. Under the established rule known as the equa l-footi ng doc\u00ad trine, new an 'equa l footi ng' with the original 13 Colonies and succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their bound\u00ad aries.\" United States v. Alaska, 521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (Alaska (Arctic Coast)). Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 67 Stat. 29, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1301 et seq., which appl ies to Alaska through an express prov ision of the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), \u00a7 6(m), 72 Stat. 343, the presumpti on of state title to \"lands beneath navigable waters within the boundar ies tive States\" is \"conr S. C. \u00a7 1311( a); see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U. S., at 5-6. The SLA also \"establishes States' title to sub\u00ad merged lands beneath a 3-mi le belt of the territorial sea, which would other wise be held by the United States. \" Id., at 6. \"As a genera l matter , then, Alaska is entitled under both the equa l footi ng doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under the Submerged Lands Act alone to sub\u00ad merged lands extendi ng three miles l Gover nment can overcome the presumpti on and defeat a future State's title to submerged lands by set\u00ad ting them aside before statehood in a way that shows an intent to retain title. Id., at 33-34. The requisite intent must, howe ver, be \" 'denitely declared or other wise made very plain.' \" Id., at 34 (quoti ng United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 55 (1926)). With these principles in mind, we discuss the two areas of submerged land at issue here . II The rst area of submerged land in dispute , claimed by Alaska under alternative theor ies in counts I and II of its 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 80 ALASK A UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t amended complai nt to quiet title (herei nafter Amended Com\u00ad plaint), consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands under lying waters in between and fringing the southeaster n Alaska islands known as the Alexander Arch ipelago . These disputed submerged lands, shown in red and dark blue on the map in Appendix A, infra, share a common feature: All points within the pockets and enclaves are more than three nautica l miles from the coast of the mainland or of any indi\u00ad vidua l island of the Alexander Arch ipelago . For these pockets and enclaves, the dispositive questi on is whether the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters qualify as in\u00ad land waters. If they do, Alaska' s coastl ine would begin at the outer bounds of these inland waters as marked by the black line drawn on the map in Appendix A, infra. See 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 1301( c) (\"The term 'coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direc t cont act with the open sea and the line mark ing the seaward limit of inland waters\"); see also United States v. Alaska, 422 U. S. 184, 187-188, and n. 5 (1975) (Alaska (Cook Inlet)). Under the equa l-footi ng doctrine and the SLA, a presumpti on of state title would then arise as to all the sub\u00ad merged lands under lying both the inland waters landward of this coastl ine, and also the territorial sea within three nauti\u00ad cal miles of it. Because the United States concedes it could not rebut the presumpti on of state title as to this aspec t of the case , Alaska would have title to all the pockets and en\u00ad claves of submerged lands in dispute . If the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters do not qualify as inland, then they instead qualify as territorial sea. In that case Alaska would have no claim of title to the disputed pock\u00ad ets and enclaves, as these lands are beyond three nautica l miles from the coast of the mainland or any indiv idua l island. The second area of submerged land in dispute , claimed by Alaska in count IV of its Amended Complai nt, consists of the submerged land beneath Glacier Bay, a well-marked indent a\u00ad tion into the coast of the See 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 81 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Appendixes C, D, infra (maps of Glacier Bay). There is no questi on that Glacier Bay' s waters are inland. For the submerged lands under lying these waters, the contro lling questi on is whether the United States can rebut Alaska' s presumpti on of title. After receiv ing the parties' written submissi ons and con\u00ad ducting a hear ing, the Specia l Master recommended that this Cour t grant summary judg ment to the United States with respec t to Alaska' s claims of title to both areas of submerged land in dispute . Repor t 1. As to the pockets and enclaves, the Specia l Master concluded that the waters of the Alexan\u00ad der Arch ipelago do not qualify as inland waters either under the histor ic inland waters theory advanced in count I of Alas\u00ad ka's Amended Complai nt or under the juridica l bay theory advanced in count II. Id., at 137-138, 226. As to the sub\u00ad merged lands under lying Glacier Bay and claimed by Alaska in count IV, the Specia l Master concluded that the United States has rebutted the presumpti on that title passed to Alaska at statehood. Id., at 276. Alaska led excepti ons to each of these three conclusi ons. We address them in turn. III In count I of its Amended Complai nt, Alaska alleges that the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago are histor ic inland waters. As this Cour t has recog nized, \"where a State within the United States wishes to claim submerged lands based on an area' s status as histor ic inland waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States: (1) exercises au\u00ad thor ity over the area; (2) has done so conti nuously; and (3) has done so with the acquiescence of foreig n nations.\" Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 11. \"For this show ing,\" we have elaborated, \"the exercise of sovereig nty must have been, histor ically, an asser tion of power to exclude all foreig n vessels and navigati on.\" Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197. Nati ons may exclude from inland waters even vessels en\u00ad UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t prejudicia l to the peace , good order or secur ity of the coast al State,\" Arts. 14(1), 14(4) of the Conventi on on the Territorial Sea and the Contig uous Zone , Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U.

Louisiana, 394 U. S. 11, 22 (1969). To claim a body of water as histor ic inland water , it is therefore impor tant to establish that the right to exclude innocent passage has somehow been asser ted, even if never actually exercised. See Alabam a and Mississipp i Boundar y Case, 470 U. S., at 113, and n. 13. The Cour t also has considered the \"vital interests of the United States\" in desig nating waters as histor ic inland wa\u00ad ters. Id., at 103. The Specia l Master recommended that the Cour t grant summary judg ment to the United States on this count. The Specia l Master rst made a thorough exami nation of histor\u00ad ical documents, from 1821 to the present, bear ing on the status of the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters. The Specia l Master sorted these documents into ve disti nct periods: (1) Russian sovereig nty id., 38-55; (3) the U. S.-Br itain Boundary Arbitrati on, id., at 56-63; (4) later Amer ican sovereig nty (1903 -1959), id., at 63-89; and (5) the postst atehood era (1959 -present), id., at 89-107. Based on his exami nation of the record evidence from all of these pe\u00ad riods, the Specia l Master concluded that \"Russia and the United States histor ically did not asser t author ity to exclude vessels from mak ing innocent passage through the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago .\" Id., at 109. In the Specia l Master 's view, Alaska had at best \"uncovered and presented only 'questi onable evidence' that the United States exercised the kind of author ity over the waters of the Arch ipelago that would be necessary to prove a histor ic waters claim.\" Id., at 129. PAGES PGT: OPIN 83 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Though Alaska' s failure to demonstrate that the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago had histor ically been treated as inland waters would by itself justi fy granti ng summary judg\u00ad ment to the United States on count I, the Specia l Master also addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other nations and the vital interests of the United States. In the Specia l Master 's view these factors only streng thened the case for granti ng summary judg ment to the United States. Excepti ng to the Specia l Master 's recommendati on on count I, Alaska contends the Specia l Master gave too little weight to histor ical events that tend to suppor t Alaska' s po\u00ad sition. By the same token Alaska argues the Specia l Master gave too much weight to histor ical events that tend to under\u00ad mine its positi on. Alaska also asser ts that foreig n nations have acquiesced in the treatment of the waters of the Alex\u00ad ander Arch ipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the United States suppor t such treatment. We nd Alaska' s arguments uncon vincing. Rather histor ical record dis\u00ad cussed by the Specia l Master in his thorough, commendable repor t, we turn our attenti on to the events Alaska presents as its best evidence that the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters qualify as histor ic inland waters. A First in time among the events to which Alaska points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereig nty. These incidents are pertinent to the inquiry because , as we have held, when Russia ceded the territory of Alaska to the United States in 1867, \"the United States thereby acquired whate ver domi nion Russia had possessed. \" Alaska (Cook Inlet), 422 U. S., at 192, n. 13. In 1824, the United States and Russia entered into a treaty that, inter alia, granted United States vessels the right, over 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 84 ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t the next 10 years, to \"frequent, without any hindrance what\u00ad ever, the inter ior seas, gulphs, harbours, and creeks [of the Alexander Arch ipelago ], for the purpose of shing and trad\u00ad ing with the natives of the country .\" See Conventi on Be\u00ad tween the United States of Amer ica and Russia, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304 (1825) (herei nafter 1824 Treaty or Treaty). In Alaska' s view this Treaty demonstrates that \"the Russian claim extended to the entire Arch ipelago\" and thus that Rus\u00ad sia treated the arch ipelago waters as inland waters. Excep\u00ad tions to Repor t of Specia l Master and Brief in Suppor t for Plaintiff 29 (herei nafter Excepti ons and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska). The principa l problem with Alaska' s asser tion is that the 1824 Treaty by its terms did not address navigati on for the purpose of innocent passage , but rather addressed only navigati on \"for the purpose of shing and tradi ng with the natives. \" Even on the questi onable assumpti on that the Treaty' s reference to \"inter ior seas\" included all the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago and not just waters within three nautica l miles of the coast of the mainland or any par\u00ad ticular island, but see Repor t 27-28 (refuti assump\u00ad tion), the Treaty simply does not prov ide evidence that Russia asser ted a right to exclude innocent passage . Yet evidence of the asser tion of this right\u2014not some lesser right\u2014must be prov ided to suppor t a histor ic inland waters claim. See Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197. Upon the expirati on of the 10-year right granted to United States vessels by virtue of the 1824 Treaty , Russia stationed a brig, the Chichago ff, at the souther n border of Russian Amer ica. Alaska implies that Russia' s purpose in stationing the brig there was to exclude any foreig n vessels from enter\u00ad ing the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters. See Excepti ons and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30-31. Were we to accept this inter pret ation of the Chichago ff incident, we would acknowl\u00ad edge it as some evidence that Russia treated the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters as inland waters. 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 85 Cite as: 545 U.

UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t constitute evidence that Russia viewed the arch ipelago wa\u00ad ters as inland waters, howe ver, because the Loriot was not engaged in innocent passage . The Loriot's missi on, as freely admitted in a contemporary letter written by a State Depar tment ofcia l to a member of the United States lega\u00ad tion in St. Petersburg , was to visit \"the northwest coast of Amer ica, for the purpose of procur ing prov isions, and also Indians to hunt for sea otter on the said coast. \" Id., at 232. By excludi ng the Loriot, which evidently had tried to exceed the limits of mere \"innocent passage ,\" Russia did not, and could not, asser t a right to exclude vessels engaged solely in innocent passage . In sum, none of the incidents Alaska cites from the period of Russian sovereig nty suppor t the propositi on that Russia treated the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago as inland waters prior to ceding Alaska to the United States in 1867. B For the period of early U. S. sovereig nty between 1867 and 1903, Alaska cites not a single incident demonstrati ng that the United States acted in a manner consistent with an un\u00ad derst andi ng that the Alexander Arch ipelago waters were in\u00ad land. Alaska thus leaves itself with at most 56 years to demonstrate conti nuous prest atehood treatment of the Alex\u00ad ander Arch ipelago as inland waters. This alone constitutes a subst antia l weakness in Alaska' s positi on. As to the years between 1867 and 1903, Alaska does at\u00ad tempt to explai n away a signicant event which undercuts its claim, but this attempt is unsuccessfu l. In 1886, Secre\u00ad tary of State Thomas F. Bayard wrote a letter to Secret ary of Treasury Daniel Manni ng concer ning the limits of the ter\u00ad ritorial waters of the United States on both the northeaster n and the northwester n coasts. See 1 J. Moore , Digest of In\u00ad ternational Law 718-721 (1906). The State Depar tment' with respec t to waters surroundi ng fringing islands on both coasts was that the sovereig ns of those islands could 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 87 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t only claim a territorial sea of three miles from the coast of each island. Secret ary Bayard explai ned that, in asser ting the 3-mi le belt of territorial sea, the United States denied neither \"the free right of vessels of other nations to pass, on peacefu l errands, through this zone\" nor the right \"of relief, when suffer ing from want of necessar ies, from the shore .\" Id., at 720-721 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Accordi ng ary Bayard, State Depar tment' s positi on was a well-considered one, rooted in principles of reciprocity and consistent prac tice: \"These rights we insist on being conceded to our sh\u00ad ermen in the northeast, where the mainland is under the British sceptre . We can not refuse them to others on our northwest coast, where the sceptre is held by the United States. We asser ted them . . . against Russia, thus deny ing to her jurisdic tion beyond three miles on her own marg inal seas. We can not claim greater juris\u00ad diction against other nations, of seas wash ing territories which we derived from Russia under the Alaska pur\u00ad chase .\" Id., at 721 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The Specia l Master singled out this letter as \"unambig uously suppor t[ing] the United States' positi on that United States and Russia histor ically did not asser t the right to ex\u00ad clude foreig n vessels from the waters of the Arch ipelago .\" Repor t 109. Emphasi zing the statements in the letter that the United States could not \" 'claim greater jurisdic tion' \" than three miles of marg inal seas and that foreig n vessels had the right to make \" 'free transit, ' \" the Specia l Master concluded that \"[o]fcia ls who held this belief could not, and evidently did not, claim that the United States could exclude innocent passage through the waters. \" Id., at 110. Alaska argues that Secret ary Bayard' s letter is of minimal relevance because \"it was inter nal correspondence that pri\u00ad marily addressed a dispute on the East coast\" and thus \"did not announce to any foreig n nation that the United States 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 88 ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t had abandoned a claim to the Arch ipelago .\" Excepti ons and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 31-32. Alaska' s arguments are un\u00ad persuasive . That Secret ary Bayard' s letter referred to the east coast in no way diminishes the unequivoca l nature of its statements with respec t to the Alaskan coast. It may be true that no foreig n nation ever became aware of Secret ary Bayard' s letter (though the subsequent publ icati on of the let\u00ad ter in the United States' Digest of Inter national Law gives us reason to believe the contrary). Regardless, Secret ary Bayard' s letter still prov ides strong evidence that the United States, as of 1886, did not claim a right to exclude all foreig n vessels from the Alexander Arch ipelago waters and had no intenti on of doing so. We do not need to parse the letter to see whether it \"announce[ d] to any foreig n nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Arch ipelago ,\" for Alaska can muster no proof that the United States as of 1886 had made any such claim in the rst place . C A stronger piece of evidence Alaska identi es to suppor t its histor ic inland waters claim is a litigati ng positi on taken by the United States during an arbitrati on proceedi ng in 1903. This proceedi ng was before the Alaskan Boundary Tribuna l, a body convened to resolve a dispute between the United States and Britain regardi ng the land boundary between southeaster n Alaska and Canada. Repor t 56-63, 116-119. In a written submissi on to the tribuna l, the United States descr ibed its view of the \"politica l coast\" of Alaska as enclos\u00ad ing all of the Alexander Arch ipelago waters, as shown on the map in Appendix A, infra. 4 ABT Proceedi ngs, pt. boundary of Alaska,\u2014that is, the exter ior boundary from which the marine league [of the territorial sea] is measured,\u2014r uns along the outer edge of the Alaskan or Alexander Arch ipelago , embraci ng PGT: OPIN Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) 89 Opinion of the Cour t hundreds of islands. \" 5 id., pt. 1, at 15-16. At oral argu\u00ad ment before the tribuna l, moreover , counsel for the United States made expl icit that the recog nition of such a \"politica l coast\" would render all waters landward of it \"just as much inter ior waters as the inter ior waters of Loch Lomond. \" 7 id., at 611 (1904). Before the Specia l Master in the instant case , the United States sought to discount as mere hypothetica l statements the submissi ons it had made at the tribuna l a full century prior. The Specia l Master rejected this view and instead agreed with Alaska that in its submissi ons to the tribuna l the United States \"was expressi ng a considered analysis of the [Alexander Arch ipelago ] area, not merely speak ing hypo\u00ad thetica lly for the purpose of show ing a flaw in Britain's argu\u00ad ment. \" Repor t 61. Ultimately , howe ver, the Specia l Mas\u00ad ter still concluded that the United States' submissi ons to the tribuna l were \"not an adequate asser tion of author ity over the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago .\" Id., at 118. The Specia l Master noted that the issue before the 1903 tribuna l was not \"[t]he status of the waters of the Alexander Arch i\u00ad pelago ,\" ibid., but rather the land boundary between south\u00ad east Alaska and Canada; that the United States' declarati ons regardi ng the status of the Alexander Arch ipelago took up \"only a few paragraphs in a seven volume record\"; and that \"[f]or these reasons, it would be unrea listic to conclude that counsel' s asser tions at the tribuna l shou ld have made foreig n nations (other than Britain) aware that the United States was asser ting a right to exclude them, \" ibid. Alaska responds that the Specia l Master was incorrec t to conclude that the United States' submissi ons in 1903 could not have made foreig n nations other than Britain aware of its claim. Alaska argues that Norway became aware of the United States' submissi ons and then relied on them in its dispute with the United Kingdom in the well-known Fisher\u00ad ies Case (U. K. v. Nor.), 1951 I. C. J. 116 (Judgment of Dec. 18). As the Specia l Master explai ned, OPIN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t ity of one foreig n nation to discover the United States' argu\u00ad ment when litigati ng a related issue . . . does not mean that foreig n nations shou ld have known of the United States' posi\u00ad tion.\" Repor t 118, n. 34. This reasoni ng carries particular force in light of the precedent a contrary conclusi on would create . If this Cour t were to recog nize histor ic inland wa\u00ad ters claims based on by counsel during liti\u00ad gation about nonmar itime boundar ies, \"the United States would itself become vulnerable to similarly weak claims by other nations that would restr ict the freedom of the seas. \" Reply Brief for United States in Response to Excepti ons of the State of Alaska 15-16 (herei nafter Reply Brief for United States). We are reluc tant to create a precedent that would have this effec t. D The litigati ng positi on taken by the United States at the ABT Proceedi ngs at best would prov ide weak suppor t for inland status of the Alexander Arch ipelago waters even were we to accept it as signaling a signicant change from the view expressed in Secret ary Bayard' s letter of 1886; for there is little evidence that the United States later acted in a manner consistent with this litigati ng positi on. Alaska says that the United States asser ted control over the waters by enac ting and enforci ng shery regulations in the Alexander Arch ipelago during the rst half of the 20th century . Ex\u00ad cepti ons and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 25-29. In particular, Alaska cites the 1906 Alien Fish ing Act, 34 Stat. 263, which proh ibited foreig n, but not domestic, commercia l shing \"in any of the waters of Alaska. \" As its sole evidence that the Act was enforced even in the pockets and enclaves at issue , Alaska cites the seizure by the United States Coast Guard in 1924 of the Canadian vessel Margue rite, whose capt ain was ned $100 for shing in contraventi on of the Act. Assumi ng, arguendo, that the Margue rite was seized in one of the disputed pockets or enclaves, a point which the Specia l Master found unclear , Repor t PGT: OPIN 91 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t hardly sufces to demonstrate a conti nuous policy. Indeed, contrary author ity exists. In 1934 the Depar tments of State and Commerce exchanged letters expressi ng their shared underst andi ng that the United States lacked the power to enforce the Act more than three miles from the shore of any island or the mainland. Id., at 70-71 (quoti ng Letter from Daniel C. Roper , Secret ary of Commerce , to Secret ary of State 1 (Sept. 5, 1934) (\" 'Canadian sher men may operate [in the Alexander Arch ipelago waters ] so long as they remai n out\u00ad side the three mile limit' \"); and Letter from William Phillips, Under Secret ary of State, to Secret ary of Commerce 1 (Sept. 13, 1934) (expressi ng appreciati on for the assurance \"'that the Fishery laws and regulations will be enforced by the Bu\u00ad reau of Fisher ies in confor mity with the view that Canadian sher men may operate [in the Alexander Arch ipelago wa\u00ad ters] so long as they remai n three-mi le limit' \")). This underst andi ng was inconsistent with a view of the Alex\u00ad ander Arch ipelago waters as inland. Repor t 70-71, 110-111. Even were the seizure of the Margue rite taken as evidence of a right asser ted by the United States in 1924, the ofcia l correspondence cited by the Specia l Master establishes that by 1934 the United States had reverted to the positi on taken in Secret ary Bayard' s 1886 letter . As the United States ob\u00ad serves, further more , the fact that Britain protested the sei\u00ad zure of the Margue rite indicates that any claim of right im\u00ad plied from that seizure was not one in which foreig n nations acquiesced. Reply Brief for United States 17, n. 10. Alaska also refers to various postst atehood events which, in its view, conr m the status of the Alexander Arch ipelago waters as inland waters. We nd insufcient prest atehood evidence to establish inland waters status in the rst place , and so we nd it unnecessary to discuss these further events. At best, Alaska' s submissi ons before this Cour t establish that the United States made one ofcia l statement \u2014in the 1903 Alaska Boundary Arbitrati on\u2014 descr ibing the Alexan\u00ad der Arch ipelago waters and that the United States 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 92 ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t seized one foreig n vessel\u2014the Margue rite\u2014in a manner ar\u00ad guably consistent with the status of those waters as inland. These incidents are insufcient to demonstrate the con\u00ad tinuous asser tion of exclusive author ity, with acquiescence of foreig n nations, necessary to suppor t a histor ic inland waters claim. Alaska' s excepti on to the Specia l Master 's recommendati on on count I of the Amended Complai nt is overr uled. IV In count II of its Amended Complai nt, Alaska presents an alternative theory to justi fy treati ng the Alexander Arch i\u00ad pelago' s waters as inland. Alaska' s alternative theory is that the waters of the Alexander Arch ipelago in truth consist of two vast, but as yet unnoticed, juridica l bays. Waters within a juridica l bay would be deemed inland waters. Art. 5(1) of the Conventi on, 15 U. S. T., at 1609. Thus, if ac\u00ad cepted, Alaska' s theory would render all the Alexander Ar\u00ad chipelago' s waters inland waters to the extent they lie within the limits of the bays Alaska identi es. For this reason, and because the United States would not be able to rebut the presumpti on of title that would arise from inland waters sta\u00ad tus, Alaska' s alternative theory would require the Cour t to accept Alaska' s claim of title to the pockets and enclaves in dispute . The parties agree that Alaska' s claimed juridica l bays would exist only if four of the Alexander Arch ipelago' s is\u00ad lands\u2014Kuiu Island, Kupreanof Island, Mitkof Island, and Dry Island\u2014were deemed to be connec ted to each other and to the mainland. We have recog nized that such \"assi mila\u00ad t[ion]\" of islands fringing only in \"excepti onal case[ s]\" in . . . 'are so integra lly related to the mainland that they are realistica lly parts of the \"coast. \" ' \" United States v. Maine, 469 U. S. 504, 517 (1985) (quoti ng United States v. Louisiana, 394 U. S., at 66). If the assimilation Alaska urges were accepted, the four islands Alaska has identi ed 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 93 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t would form a constr uctive peni nsula extendi ng from the mainland and dividing the Alexander Arch ipelago' s waters in two. To bolster its case , Alaska labels the waters north and south of this hypothetica l peni nsula the l peni nsula and the resu lting to accept Alaska' s hypothetica l peni nsula, we would then be required to deter mine whether North Bay and South Bay in fact qualify as juridica l bays under the Conventi on, which we have customar ily consu lted for pur\u00ad poses of \"deter mining the line mark ing the seaward limit of inland waters of the States. \" United States v. Maine, supra, at 513. Article 7(2) of the Conventi on sets forth the following geograph ic criteria for decidi ng whether a body of water qualies as a bay: \"For the purposes of these articles, a bay is a well\u00ad marked indent ation whose penetrati on is in such propor\u00ad tion to the width of its mouth as to cont ain landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indent ation shall not, howe ver, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indent ation.\" 15 U. S. T., at 1609. This denition can be understood to compr ise a number of elements. To apply the denition to a given body of water , one must rst deter mine whether the body of water satises the descr iptive test of being a \"wel l-marked indent ation.\" One must then deter mine, among other things, whether the indent ation's area satises the mathematica l \"semi-circle\" test set forth in the second sentence of Article 7(2). After due considerati on of the parties' arguments, the Spe\u00ad cial Master recommended that the Cour reject Alaska' s al\u00ad ternative theory . The Specia l Master rst conduc ted a de\u00ad tailed assessment of the OPIN ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t islands in questi on in order to form the constr uctive peni Repor t 147-197. Apply\u00ad ing the principles set forth in United States v. Maine, supra, at 514-520, and United States v. Louisiana, supra, at 60-66, the Specia l Master concluded that assimilation would be un\u00ad warranted save for two inconsequentia l channels that \"do not sufce to create the juridica l bays alleged by Alaska. \" Re\u00ad port 197. In the alternative , the Specia l Master concluded that, even were Alaska' s hypothetica peni nsula accepted, could satisfy the de\u00ad scriptive test that a proposed bay constitute a \" 'well-marked indent ation.' \" Id., at 222. Excepti ng to the Speci al Master's recommendations, Alaska makes a detailed argument that this Cour t's prece\u00ad dents regardi ng Excep\u00ad tions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 39-45. Alaska further contends that, once this peni nsula is recog nized, the resu lt\u00ad ing bodies of water satisfy all the criteria set forth in the Conventi on. Id., at 45-49. We overr ule Alaska' s excepti on. For the sake of brevity we assume , arguendo, that each of the islands in Alaska' s hypothetica l peni nsula shou ld be assimilated one to another (though we are aware of, and Alaska itself cites, no precedent foreig n or domestic in which such a massive amount of suc\u00ad cessive assimilation has been accepted for the purpose of identi fying a juridica l bay). Even with the benet of this daunti ng doubt Alaska could not prevail, for its hypothetica l bays do not satisfy the Conventi on's descr iptive requirement of as a well-marked indent ation, a body of water must possess physica l features that would allow a mariner looking at navigati onal char ts that do not depic t bay closi ng lines nonetheless to perceive the bay's limits, and hence to avoid illegal encroachment into inland waters. See G. West\u00ad erman, The Juridica 95 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t cal bays do not possess these features. We have been re\u00ad ferred to no author ity which indicates that a mariner looking at an unador ned map of the southeast Alaskan coast has ever discer ned the limits of Alaska' s hypothetica l bays. So subtle are these limits that even Alaska itself did not discover them until after it had led its rst complai nt in this action. Com\u00ad pare Complai nt to Quiet Title (Nov. 24, 1999) with Amended Complai nt (Dec. 14, 2000). The test is what mariners see, not what litigators invent. Alaska' s hypothetical bays would not be discer nible to the eye of the mariner. A compar ison to United States v. Maine, 469 U. S., at 514- 520, makes clear the force of our conclusi on. In that case the Cour t considered whether Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound together qualify as a juridica l bay. In deter\u00ad mining that they do, the Cour t held that Long Island itself shou ld be assimilated to the mainland. Id., at 517-520. The Cour t then deter mined that the resu lting indent ation formed by Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound satis\u00ad ed the requirements of Article 7(2) of the Conventi on, in\u00ad cludi l-marked indent ation.\" Id., at 515, 519. There is a critica l difference between this body of water and the bodies of water Alaska has christened as North Bay and South Bay. Even before this Cour t held that Long Is\u00ad land Sound and Block Island Sound qualied together as a juridica l bay, mariners and geographers had recog nized Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound as adjacent, cohesive bodies of water\u2014i ndeed, as \"sound[ s],\" which itself is a term used to descr ibe a wide and deep bay, or a strait connec ting other bodies of water . See Webster 's Third New Inter na\u00ad tional Dictionary 2176 (1981) (dening \"sound\" as \"a long and rather broad inlet of the ocean genera lly with its larger part extendi ng rough ly para llel to the coast\"; \"a long passage of water connec ting two larger bodies but too wide and exten\u00ad sive to be termed a strait\"). Nothing of the sort can be said of Alaska' s claimed bays. It is not just that no mariner and 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN A UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t no geographer (and not even Alaska' s litigators) before this action recog nized Alaska' s claimed bays as bays or sounds. It appears that no one before this action recog nized Alaska' s claimed bays as constituti ng cohesive bodies of water at all. Even accepti ng the constr uctive peni nsula Alaska has crafted out of four separate islands within the Alexander Ar\u00ad chipelago , Alaska' s claimed bays still fail to qualify as \"wel l\u00ad marked indent ation[s]\" for purposes of the Conventi on. For this reason, we reject the alternative theory Alaska urges in count II of its Amended Complai nt. Alaska' s excepti on to the Specia l Master 's recommendati on on this count is overr uled. V In count IV of its Amended Complai nt, Alaska claims title to the submerged lands under lying the waters of Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument (now known as Glacier Bay Nati onal Park), located at the norther n end of the Alexander Arch i\u00ad pelago . Concludi ng that the United States had rebutted Alaska' s presumed title to these lands, the Specia l Master recommended granti ng summary judg ment to the United States. As with the other aspec ts of this case , the Specia l Master was correc t in his inter pret ation and appl icati on of the contro lling and principles, and we overr ule Alaska' s excepti on to his recommendati on. A The center piece of Glacier Bay Nati onal Park is Glacier Bay itself . By contrast to the bays Alaska claims in count II, Glacier Bay is a textbook example of a juridica l bay. Its waters mark a dramatic indent ation within the coastl ine of the Alaskan mainland. While the width of Glacier Bay' s mouth measures 5 miles at most, the bay's waters stretch more than 60 miles into the mainland. See Appendix C, infra (map of Glacier Bay). Glacier Bay Nati onal Park is one of the Nati on's largest national parks, embraci ng over 3.2 area 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 97 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t larger than the State of Connec ticut. Rennicke , North to Wild Alaska, Nati Traveler 48, 55 (July/Aug. 1994). John Muir , who rst saw the bay and its surround\u00ad ings in 1879, descr ibed it as a \" 'solitude of ice and snow and newbor n rocks. ' \" Id., at 56. One way to comprehend the solitude is to note that in the area of Glacier Bay there are still not more than 10 miles of established hiking trails. See id., at 50. As the world's largest marine sanc tuary , it is, in one sense , a water park. A ship in the waters of the Paci c in the Gulf of Alaska reaches Glacier Bay by headi ng shoreward to the east through Cross Sound and to Bartlett Cove , there turning to proceed through the bay in a genera lly northwest direc tion. See Appendix D, infra. The entrance to the bay near Bart\u00ad lett Cove is about 100 miles northwest of Juneau and still 600 miles southeast of Anchorage . The bay owes its name to Capt ain Beardslee of the United States Navy , who, upon rst enter ing the bay in 1880, was so impressed by the ice formati ons surroundi ng it that he called it Glacier Bay. 5 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 290 (15th ed. 2003). A glacier is a large formati on of perennia l ice. The denition used by the Specia l Master was a \" 'mix\u00ad ture of ice and rock that moves downh ill over a bed of solid rock or sediment under the influence of grav ity.' \" Repor t 246. Some of the glaciers in the region are tidewater gla\u00ad ciers, so called because they end at the water 's edge . Even large ships must take precauti ons near these glaciers, for ice can break off (a process called calving); and when a large segment plunges to the sea, it becomes an iceberg . Ibid. The weight of a glacier can cause it to move , either advanc\u00ad ing to crush the life before it or recedi ng to allow life forms to begin anew . At Glacier Bay some of the glaciers are ad\u00ad vanci ng, some are recedi ng, and others seem to be stable. See id., at 246-247.

When Capt ain George Vancouver visited in 1794, the bay was but 5 miles inward from Bartlett Cove , while today it penetrates inland for over 60 miles. This re\u00ad treat of the ice is \"considered the fastest glacia l withdrawa l in recorded history . 'Unzippi time.\" Rennicke , supra, at 56. The advance and retreat of the glaciers are of great interest to scientists, and in the areas of glacia l recessi on the sub\u00ad merged floor of the bay is contoured or sculptured in ways that can be studied to learn more of glacia l movement and geolog ic formati ons. See Repor t 246-248. The immense scene is one of remarkable beauty , and the waters, which accommodate large vessels, can be calm enough so that kayaks can be used to explore the bay and its surroundi ngs. Where glaciers have retreated either in the bay or on shore , the retreat reveals how a new life cycle begins. Plant successi on is of absorbi ng interest. \"It can be almost like a bay and the surroundi ng shore and forest areas of the park sustain a chain of sh, bird, and animal life. Over 200 avian species have been noted, most of these in or near the marine environment. Glacier Bay: A Guide to Glacier Bay Nati onal Park and Preserve , Alaska 78 (1983).

S. 262, 274 (2001) (descr ibing the inquiry as encompassi ng the questi on whether \"the purpose of the reservati on would have been compromised if the submerged lands had passed to the State\"); Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U. S., at 42-43 (noting that \"defeati ng state title...w as the United States' objec tive [of] secur ing a supply of oil and gas that would necessar ily exist beneath uplands and sub\u00ad merged lands\"). B Owing to Glacier Bay' s status as a juridica l bay, its waters qualify as inland navigable waters. All the remai PGT: OPIN UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t ters within the boundar ies of Glacier Bay Nati onal Monu\u00ad ment as it existed at statehood, moreover , lie less than three nautica l miles from the coastl ine. Under both the equa l\u00ad footi ng the SLA, therefore , a strong presump\u00ad tion arises that title to the lands under lying all the waters in dispute in count IV of Alaska' s Amended Complai nt passed to Alaska at statehood. See id., at 5-6; see also id., at 33-36. The contro lling questi on here is whether the United States can rebut this presumpti on. It is now settled that the United States can defeat a future State's presumed title to submerged lands not only by con\u00ad veyance to third parties but also by setti ng submerged lands aside as part of a federa l reservati on \"such as a wildlife ref\u00ad uge.\" Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273; Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U. S., at 33-34. To ascer tain whether Congress has made use of that power , we conduc t a two-step inquiry . We rst inquire whether the United States clear ly intended to include submerged lands within the reservati on. If the answer is yes, we next inquire whether the United States expressed its intent to retain federa l title to submerged lands within the reservati on. Id., at 36; Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273. \"We will not infer an intent to defeat a future State's title to inland submerged lands 'unless the intenti on was denitely declared or other wise made very plain.' \" Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 34 (quoti ng Holt State Bank, 270 U.

After carefu l considerati on of the parties' arguments, the Specia l Master recommended granti ng summary judg ment to the United States on Alaska' s claim of title to the sub\u00ad merged lands under lying Glacier Bay. Repor t 227-276. His recommendati on rested on two conclusi ons that track the two-par t test developed in our precedents. First, he con\u00ad cluded that in creati ng Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument the United States had reserved the submerged lands under lying Glacier Bay and the remai ning waters within the monu\u00ad ment' s boundar ies. Id., at 264. Second, 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) 101 Opinion of the Cour t \u00a7 6(e) of the ASA, 72 Stat. 340-341, note precedi ng 48 U. S. C. \u00a7 21, pp. 320-321, expressed congressi onal intent to retain those submerged lands in federa l ownersh ip. Repor t 276. Alaska takes excepti on only to the Specia l Master 's second conclusi on. We nonetheless explai n the Specia l Master 's rst conclusi on (and our own), for it is a necessary part of the reasoni ng for the second step of the analysis. C We need not detain ourselves long with the rst part of the test regardi ng title to submerged lands. In 1925, President Calvin Cool idge invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225, 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 431 et seq., to create Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument. Presidentia l Proclamati on No. 1733, 43 Stat. 1988 (1925 Proclamati on). In 1939, President Frankl in D. Roose velt issued a proclamati on expandi ng the monument to include all of Glacier Bay' s waters and to ex\u00ad tend the monument' s wester n boundary three nautica l miles out to sea. Presidentia l Proclamati on No. 2330, 3 CFR 28 Proclamati infra (depic ting both the initia l boundar ies established by the 1925 Proclamati on and the expanded boundar ies established by the 1939 Proclamati on). In 1955, President Dwight D. Ei\u00ad senhower issued a proclamati on slightly altering the monu\u00ad ment' s boundar ies, but leaving the bay's waters within them. Presidentia l Proclamati on No. 3089, 3 CFR 36 (1954 -1958 Comp .) (1955 Proclamati on). In 1980, Congress desig nated the monument as part of Glacier Bay Nati onal Park and Pre\u00ad serve and expanded the resu on's infra (map of Gla\u00ad cier Bay Nati onal Park). For present purposes, howe ver, the impor tant point is that by the time Alaska achieved statehood in 1959, the Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument had already existed for 34 years as a federa l reservati on. After consider ing the evidence submitted by both parties, the Specia l Master concluded that \"the v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t Monument, as it existed at the time of statehood, clear ly in\u00ad cluded the submerged lands within its , the descr iptions of the monument in the 1925, 1939, and 1955 Proclamati ons themselves showed that the monument embraced submerged lands. Id., at 232-242. The Specia l Master also considered it signicant that exclusi on of the submerged lands would have under mined at least three of the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument. Exclusi on of the submerged lands would impair scienti c study of the majestic tidewater glaciers surroundi ng the bay. Id., at 245-251. It would also impair effor ts both to study and to preserve the remnants of \" 'interg lacia l forests, ' \" which can be found both above and below the tidel ine. Id., at 251-253. Finally, exclusi on of the submerged lands would compromise the goal of safeg uardi ng the flora and fauna that thrive in Glacier Bay' s complex and interdependent ecosys\u00ad tem. Id., at 253-263. The Specia l Master , in our view, had ample suppor t for his conclusi ons that all of these were purposes for creati on of the monument, and each would be compromised were it to be deter mined that submerged lands were not included in the monument. His ultimate deter mination, that Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument included the submerged lands within its boundar ies, has strong suppor t in the precedents and in the whole record of the case. Alaska has not led a formal excepti on to this deter mination, and the four\u00ad sentence footnote in Alaska' s brief which expresses disagree\u00ad ment with it, Excepti ons and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 10-11, n. 4, does not in our view sufce to impeach its validity . D Having established the propositi on that the Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument, at the time of Alaska' s statehood, in\u00ad cluded the submerged lands under lying Glacier Bay, we turn to the remai ning questi on: whether PGT: OPIN 103 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t \" 'denitely declared or other wise made very plain' \" its in\u00ad tent to defeat Alaska' s title to these submerged lands. Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U. S., at 34 (quoti ng Holt State Bank, 270 U. S., at 55). 1 The requisite expressi on of intent might conceivably reside in the very proclamati ons that invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create and then expand Glacier Bay Nati onal Mon\u00ad ument. It is clear , after all, that the Antiquities Act empow\u00ad ers the President to reserve submerged lands. United States v. California, 436 U. S. 32, 36 (1978). An essentia l purpose of monuments created pursuant to the Antiquities Act, further more , is \"to conserve the scenery and the natura l and histor ic objec ts and the wild life therei n and to prov ide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generati ons.\" 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. From these two prem\u00ad ises it would require little additi onal effor t to reach a holdi ng that the Antiquities Act itself delegated to the President suf\u00ad cient power not only to reserve submerged lands but also to defeat a future State's title to them. Given the reasons motivati ng the creati on of Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument and the overa ll complexity of the Glacier Bay ecosystem, it would be unsur prising to nd that the relevant proclama\u00ad tions intent to retain federa l title. One amicus has advanced this argument at leng th, and the United States foreshadows it in a footnote . See Brief for Nati as Amicus Curiae 6-7, 13-16; Reply Brief for United States 32, n. 20. If true, this argument would prov ide a power ful alternative basis for agreei ng with the Specia l Master 's recommendati on to grant summary judg ment to the United States with respec t to Alaska' s claim of title to the submerged lands under lying Glacier Bay. We need pursue this alternative basis no further, howe ver. In our view the prov isions of the ASA PAGES PGT: OPIN A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t overcome the state ownersh ip presumpti on arising from the equa l-footi ng doctrine and the SLA and to reserve the sub\u00ad merged lands in Glacier Bay to the United States. 2 The Specia l Master agreed with the United States that Congress expressed an intent to retain title to all of Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument, includi ng the submerged lands within it, in \u00a7 6(e) of the ASA. Repor t 276. To underst and \u00a7 6(e), we begin by consider ing its context within the ASA, its text, and the constr uction we have given to it in an ear\u00ad lier case. Section 5 of the ASA sets forth a guiding principle regard\u00ad ing title to proper ty within Alaska' s boundar ies: \"The State of isions, re\u00ad spec tively , shall have and retain title to all proper ty, real and persona l, title to which is in the Territory of Alaska or any of the subdiv isions. Except as prov ided in sec\u00ad tion 6 hereof, the United States shall retain title to all proper ty, real and persona l, to which it has title, includ\u00ad ing publ ic lands. \" 72 Stat. 340. Based on this prov ision, the new State of Alaska acquired title to any proper ty previously belong ing to the Territory of Alaska. The United States, in turn, retained title to its proper ty located within Alaska' s borders, \"includi ng publ ic lands, \" subjec t to certain excepti ons set forth in \u00a7 6 of the ASA. One of those excepti ons is cont ained in pertinent part: \"All real and persona l proper ty of the United States sit\u00ad uated in the Territory of Alaska which is speci cally used for the sole purpose of conservati on and protec tion of the sher ies and wildlife of Alaska, under the prov i\u00ad sions of the Alaska game law of July 1, 1943 (57 Stat. 301; 48 U. S. C., secs. 192-211), as PGT: OPIN 105 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t the prov isions of the Alaska commercia l sher ies laws of June 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 478; 48 U. S. C., secs. 230-239 and 241-242), and June 6, 1924 (43 Stat. 465; 48 U. S. C., secs. 221-228), as supplemented and amended, shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropr iate Federa l agency :... Provided, That such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or other wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for the protec tion of wildlife nor facilities utilized in connec tion therew ith, or in connec tion with genera research activities relati ng to sher ies or wildlife.\" Id., at 340-341. The rst quoted part of \u00a7 6(e), the initia l clause , direc ts a transfer to Alaska of any federa l proper ty located in Alaska and used \"for the sole purpose of conservati on and protec tion of the sher ies and wildlife of Alaska\" under three particular federa l game and wildlife laws. The next quoted part, the prov iso, makes clear that the transfer direc tive in the initia l clause has no appl icati on to \"lands withdrawn or other wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for the protec tion of wildlife.\" In Alaska (Arctic Coast), we held that the prov iso of \u00a7 6(e) expressed congressi onal intent to retain title to a reservati on such as the Arctic Nati onal Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and that the statute' s declarati on of intent was sufcient to de\u00ad feat Alaska' s presumed title under both ng doctrine and the Act, ly contemplated conti nued federa l ownersh ip of certain submerged lands\u2014both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea\u2014so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or oth\u00ad erwise set apar t as the protec to Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument, as we held it appl ied to the ANWR in Alaska (Arctic Coast), then it follows that title to the submerged lands under lying Glacier Bay did not pass to Alaska at statehood. 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 106 ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t To avoid this reasoni ng, Alaska rst argues that the pro\u00ad viso is limited in scope to federa l proper ty already covered by the initia l clause; because Glacier Bay is not covered by the initia l clause , the State contends, it is not covered by the prov iso either . Alaska next argues that even assumi ng the scope of the prov iso is broader than the initia l clause , Glacier Bay was \"for tion of s arguments. a Regardi ng the relati onsh ip between the initia l clause and the prov iso, Alaska contends the prov iso appl ies only to wild\u00ad life refuges or reservati ons set aside under the three particu\u00ad lar federa l game and wildlife statutes named in the initia l clause . Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument was not set aside under any of these particular statutes, of course; so Alaska says that omissi on from the initia l clause dictates omissi on from the prov iso. The United States counters that the ini\u00ad tial clause is con ned to speci c proper ty but that the pro\u00ad viso is a statement of intent to retain federa l title which ex\u00ad tends to all reservati ons thus descr ibed without regard to the speci c statutory author ity under which the reservati ons were set aside . As the Specia l Master noted, genera lizations about the re\u00ad lationsh ip between a prov iso and a precedi ng clause prove to be of little help in resolv ing the parties' disagreement about the scope of \u00a7 6(e)'s prov iso. Repor t 268. Though it may be customary to use a prov iso to refer only to things covered by a precedi ng clause , it is also possible to use a prov iso to state a genera l, independent rule. \"[A] prov iso is not always limited in its effec t to the part of the enac tment with which it is immediately associated; it may apply genera lly to all cases within the meani ng of the lang uage used. \" McDonald v. United States, 279 U. S. 12, 21 (1929); see also 2A N. Singer , Statutes and Statutory Constr uction \u00a7 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 107 Cite as: 545 U. S. 75 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t We conclude that Alaska' s narrow readi ng of the prov iso is neither necessary nor preferred. Section 6(e) begins with speci city . It covers \"[a]ll real and persona l proper ty\" \"spe\u00ad cically used for the sole purpose of conservati on and protec\u00ad tion of the sher ies and wildlife of Alaska\" as identi ed under three particular federa l game and wildlife laws. Those prov isions, in turn, make clear that the initia l clause' s transfer requirement appl ies to facilities such as certain sh hatcher ies, and likely would include speci c types of equip\u00ad ment or even vehicles. Having thus transferred the identi ed \"proper ty,\" the sec\u00ad tion proceeds to state a more genera l reservati on, using the word \"lands. \" \"Provided, [t]hat such transfer shall not in\u00ad clude lands withdrawn or other wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for the protec tion of wildlife nor facilities . . . .\" The lands here in questi on were in fact \"withdrawn or other\u00ad wise set apar t,\" that is to say by the proclamati ons which created the monument. Though it may not be the usua l style , it does not strike us as illogical for the draf tsperson of a statute to write it so that it transfers some speci c real and persona l proper ty and then proceeds to reserve lands in a much larger classi cati on. Alaska' s insistence that the prov iso must be limited to what is cont ained at the outset is foreclosed as well by the decisi on in Alaska (Arctic Coast). In the proceedi ngs lead\u00ad ing up to that decisi on, Alaska had argued that \u00a7 6(e)'s pro\u00ad viso did noth ing more than to except lands from the transfer effec ted in \u00a7 6(e)'s initia l clause . In Alaska' s view, even lands covered by the prov iso could still be transferred by virtue of the SLA made appl icable to Alaska via \u00a7 6(m) of the ASA. See Reply Brief for State of Alaska in United States v. Alaska, O. T. 1996, No. 84, Orig., pp. \u00a7 6(e)'s prov iso], then the United States retained title to submerged lands as well as uplands within the Range OPIN v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t This is so despite \u00a7 6(m) of the Statehood Act, which ap\u00ad plied the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 to Alaska. The Submerged Lands Act operated to conr m Alaska' s title to equa l footi ng lands and to transfer title to submerged lands beneath the territorial sea to Alaska at statehood, unless the United States clear ly withheld submerged lands within either category prior to statehood. In \u00a7 6(e) of the Statehood Act, Congress clear ly contem\u00ad plated conti nued federa l ownersh ip of certain sub\u00ad merged lands\u2014both inland submerged lands and sub\u00ad merged lands beneath the territorial sea\u2014so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or other wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for the protec tion of wildlife.' \" 521 U. S., at 56-57 (emphasis in original). Thus we have held that \u00a7 6(e)'s prov iso operates not just neg\u00ad atively 6(e)'s main clause , but also afrma\u00ad tively , as an expressi on of Congress' in\u00ad tent to retain federa l ownersh ip over all lands within such reservati ons. This afrmative and independent expressi on of intent logi\u00ad cally appl ies with just as much force to reservati ons that fall within \u00a7 6(e)'s initia l clause as to those that do not. It would have made little sense for Congress to differentiate between those two sets of reservati ons in mak ing the broad statement of intent we have constr ued \u00a7 6(e)'s prov iso to set forth. It would have made even less sense to differentiate in such a way as to exclude reservati ons set aside pursuant to the An\u00ad tiquities Act, like Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument. on suggested readi ng, moreover , cannot be discer ned from the text of \u00a7 6(e)'s prov iso, which covers all reservati protec tion of wildlife,\" re\u00ad gardless of c author ity under tions OPIN 109 Cite 545 U.

As Alaska ob\u00ad serves, it appears that we assumed the ANWR would fall within \u00a7 6(e)'s initia l clause were it not for the prov iso. Id., at 60-61. For the reasons we have explai ned, howe ver, the broad constr uction we gave to the prov iso in Alaska (Arctic Coast) of necessity carries consequences for the relati onsh ip between it and the initia l clause . b Anticipati ng the possibi its narrow inter pret ation of the prov iso might be rejected, Alaska raises one last argu\u00ad ment. The prov iso does not reach Glacier Bay even under a broad view of the prov iso's scope , Alaska contends, because Glacier Bay was not set apar t \"for the protec ng of \u00a7 This argument can be rejected without extended discus\u00ad sion. As the Specia l Master noted and as we have recog\u00ad nized, Congress has made clear that one of the fundament al purposes of wildlife reservati ons set apar t pursuant to the Antiquities Act is \"to conserve the scenery and the natura l and histor ic objec ts and the wild life therei n and to prov ide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generati ons.\" 16 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. Because Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument serves as habit at for many forms of wildlife, it was set aside in part for its preservati on. Any doubt as to this conclusi on is dispel led by reference to the Presidentia l proclamati ons setti ng aside the monument, for the proclamati ons identi fy the study of flora and fauna as one of the express purposes of the reservati on. 1925 Proclama\u00ad tion, 43 Stat. 1988; 1939 Proclamati 3 CFR 28 (Supp . 1939). As the Specia l Master observed, the study of flora and fauna necessar ily requires their preservati on. OPIN ALASK A v. UNITED STATES Opinion of the Cour t In sum we agree with the United States that the prov iso is best read, in light of our prior inter pret ation of it in Alaska (Arctic Coast), as expressi ng an independent and genera l rule uncoupled from the initia l clause . Under the initia l clause the United States obligated itself to transfer to Alaska equipment and other proper ty used for genera l sh and wildlife management responsibi lities Alaska was to un\u00ad dertake upon acquir ing statehood. Under the prov iso the United States expressed its intent, notw ithst andi ng this proper ty transfer , ip over all federa l ref\u00ad uges and reservati ons set aside for the protec tion of wildlife, regardless of the speci c statutory author ity enabl ing the set-aside . This expressi on of intent encompassed Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument, which was set aside \"for the wildlife\" within the meani \u00a7 6(e). The text thus defeated the presumpti on that the new State of Alaska would acquire title to the submerged lands under lying the monument' s waters, includi ng the inland waters of Glacier Bay. Alaska' s excepti on to the Specia l Master 's recommen\u00ad dation on count IV of Alaska' s Amended Complai nt is overr uled. VI For the foregoi ng reasons, we overr ule each of Alaska' s excepti ons to the Specia l Master 's recommendati ons. Alaska shall take title neither to the submerged lands under\u00ad lying the pockets and enclaves of water at issue in counts I and II of its Amended Complai nt nor to the submerged lands under lying the waters of Glacier Bay at issue in count IV. As to count III of Alaska' s Amended Complai nt, the parties and the Specia l Master are in agreement that this Cour t shou ld conr m the United States' proposed disclai mer of title.

I do not agree with the conclusi on that the United States expressly retained title to submerged lands within Glacier Bay Nati onal Monument (Monument) at the time of Alaskan statehood. The Cour t holds that the United States has rebutted the \"strong presumpti on\" that submerged lands passed to Alaska when it became a State. Ante, at 100, 110. That presump\u00ad tion inheres in the partic\u00ad ular streng and speci city in this case by \u00a7 6(m) of the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 343, which incor porated the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, includi ng the conr mati on that a State \"lands beneath navigable waters within [its] boundar ies\" unless (as relevant here) they were \"ex\u00ad pressly retained by or ceded to the United States when the State entered the Union,\" 43 U.

The shor t of the matter is that if the prov iso created only an excepti on from the precedi ng main clause , it did not reserve Glacier Bay (which was not covered by the main clause) for the United States; whereas if it was an independent and freest andi ng reservati on, it did. The Cour t uncon vincingly attempts to sever the prov iso from its statutory text and context.

As it happens, the main clause of \u00a7 6(e) cont ains the only menti on of a \"transfe[ r]\" in the Statehood Act that precedes the prov iso,1 mak ing it the only logical antecedent. Thus, the word \"such\" indicates the natura l, structura l tie between \u00a7 6(e)'s main clause and its prov iso, mak ing it quite clear that the prov iso does not re\u00ad serve to the United States all \"lands withdrawn or other\u00ad wise set apar t as refuges or reservati ons for the protec tion of wildlife,\" but rather only the lands of that descr iption cov\u00ad ered by the preced ing main clause. the prov iso is phrased as a carveout (\"such transfer shall not include lands\") rather than a freest andi ng rule (e. g., \"no transfer shall include lands\" or \"lands shall not be transferred\"). In sum, the text amply suppor ts Alaska' s claim that the prov iso operates as an excepti on to the main clause , and not the Cour t's conclusi on that it is \"an independent and genera l rule uncoupled from [that] clause ,\" ante, at 110. The Cour t also contends that its 1997 decisi on in Alaska (Arctic Coast) \"foreclose[ s]\" Alaska' s argument that the pro\u00ad viso operates as an excepti on to the main clause of \u00a7 6(e). Ante, at 107. That conclusi on follows from neither the hold\u00ad ing of Alaska (Arctic Coast) nor any reasonable extensi on of its under lying rationale. As the Cour t acknowledges, ante, at 109, \"Alaska (Arctic Coast) did not direc tly address the relati onsh ip between the initia l clause and the prov iso in \u00a7 6(e).\" It quoted them as if they were a single, unitary rule, 521 U. S., at 55, and, as the United States concedes, the Cour t 1 The only other menti on of a \"transfe[ r]\" in \u00a7 6 appeared in subsec tion (k), which \"conr med and transferred\" all grants previously made to the Territory of Alaska. 72 Stat. 343. 545US1 Unit:$U55 [04-07-08 11:17:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN 116 ALASK UNITED STATES Opinion of Scalia, J. \"assum[ ed] with no brieng,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, that the refuge at issue fell within the scope of the main clause of \u00a7 6(e). Given that assumpti on, the case does not stand for the propositi on that the prov iso is a freest andi ng prov ision; a prov iso limited to the main clause would have the same effec t. Or to put the point differently: Alaska (Arctic Coast) holds that what the prov iso takes out of \u00a7 6(e) it also takes out of \u00a7 6(m). In the present case , howe ver, it is undis\u00ad puted that Glacier Bay is not within \u00a7 6(e), and so is not remo ved from \u00a7 6(e) by the prov iso. Nothing in Alaska (Arctic Coast) suggests that the prov iso alone operated \"af\u00ad rmatively and independently ,\" ante, at 108, to trump \u00a7 6(m). The Cour t is thus knock ing down a straw man when it says that, if the prov iso can trump \u00a7 6(m), it would make \"little sense\" to cabin it with the main clause of \u00a7 6(e), ibid. It was not the prov 6(m), but the prov iso's re\u00ad mova from the excepti on of \u00a7 6(e). There is no such remova l here . The only part of the Cour t's opinion on Glacier Bay that displays genui ne enthusiasm is its Ursi ne Rhapsody , which implies that federa l ownersh ip of submerged lands is critica l to ensur ing that brown bears will not be shot from the decks of pleasure yachts during their \"distressi ng[ly] frequen[ t]\" swims to islands where they feast on seabirds and seabird eggs.2 Ante, at 99. Surely this is irrele vant to inter pret a\u00ad tion of the Alaska Statehood Act, unless there is some princi\u00ad ple of constr uction that texts say what the Supreme Cour t thinks they ought to have said. But besides being irrele\u00ad vant, it is not even true.

NOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the fifth circuit No. 03-1388. Argued February 28, 2005 \u2014Decided June 6, 2005 Respondent NCL is a cruise line operati ng foreig n-flag ships depar ting from, and retur United States ports. The petiti oners, disabled indiv idua ls and their compani ons who purchased tickets for round-tr ip NCL cruises from Houston, sued NCL under Title III of the Amer icans with Disabi lities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. 12181 et ices, \" ca\u00ad tions in policies, iers, and communicati on barr iers that are structura l in nature ,\" where ng physica l barr iers to access could not go forward because the federa l agencies charged with promu lgati ng ADA arch itectura l and structura l guidel ines had not done so for cruise ships. The cour t therefore dismissed the barr ier\u00ad remova l claims, but denied NCL's motion to dismiss the petitioners' other claims. The Fifth Circuit held that Title III does not apply to foreig n-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters because of a presumpti on, which the cour t derived from, e. g., Benz v. Compan ia Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, and McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras , 372 U. S. 10, that absent a clear indicati on of congressi onal intent, genera l statutes do not apply to foreig n-flag ships. Emphasi zing that Title III t sustained the dismissa l of the petiti oners' barr ier-remova l claims and reversed on their remai ning claims. Held: The judg ment is reversed, and the case is remanded. 356 F. 3d 641, reversed and remanded. Justice Kennedy delivered an opinion concludi ng that except inso\u00ad far as Title III regulates a vessel' s inter nal affairs, the statute is ap\u00ad plicable to foreig n-flag cruise ships in U. S. waters. Parts II-A-1 and II-B- 2 of that opinion held for the Cour t: (a) Although Title III's WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Syllabus expressly menti on cruise ships, there is no doubt that the NCL ships in questi on fall within both denitions under conventi onal principles of inter pret ation. The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title III inappl ica\u00ad ble because the statute has no clear statement or expl icit text mandati ng coverage for foreig n-flag ships U. S. waters. This Cour t's cases, par\u00ad ticularly Benz and McCull och, do hold, in some circumst ances, that a genera l statute will not apply to certain aspec ts of the inter nal oper\u00ad ations of foreig n vessels temporar ily in U. S. waters, absent a clear statement. The broad clear statement rule adopted by the Cour t of Appea ls, howe ver, would apply to every facet of the business and operati ons of foreig n-flag ships. That formulation is inconsistent with the Cour t's case law and with sound principles of statutory inter pret a\u00ad tion. Pp. 128-130. barr ier remova l as that which is \"easi ly accompl ishable and able to be carried out without much difcu lty or expense ,\" \u00a712181(9). The statute does not further dene \"difcu lty,\" but the section's use of the disjunc tive indicates that it ex\u00ad tends to considerati ons in additi on to cost. Further more , Title III di\u00ad rects that the \"readi ly Title III barr ier-remova l requirement that would bring a vessel into noncompl i\u00ad ance with the Inter national Conventi on for the Safety of Life at Sea or any other inter national legal obligati on would create serious difcu lties for the vessel and would have a subst antia l impac t on its operati on, and thus would not be \"readi ly achievable .\" Congress could not have intended this resu lt. It is logical and proper to conclude , moreover , that whether a barr ier modi cati on is \"readi ly achievable\" on the modi nondiscr imination and accommodati on requirements do not apply if disabled indiv idua ls would pose \"a signicant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modi cati on of policies, prac tices, or 12182( b)(3). It would be incongr uous to attribute to Congress an intent to require modi cati ons threateni ng oth\u00ad ers' safety simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodati on itself . Pp. 135-136. Justice Kennedy , joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Sou\u00ad ter, concluded in Parts II-A- 2, II-B-1, II-B- 3, and III-B: (a) As a matter of inter national comity , a clear statement of congres\u00ad sional intent is necessary before a genera l statutory requirement can inter fere with matters that concer n a foreig n-flag vessel' s inter nal af\u00ad fairs and operati ons. See, e. g., Wildenhu s's Case, 120 U.S. 1, 12. In Benz and McCull och, the Cour t held the Nati onal ons Act inappl icable to labor relati ons its [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 121 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Syllabus foreig n crew not because foreig n ships are genera lly exempt from the NLRA, but because that particular appl icati on of the NLRA would in\u00ad terfere with matters that concer n only the ship's inter nal operati ons. These cases recog nized a narrow rule, appl icable only to statutory duties that implicate the foreig n vessel' s inter nal order rather than the welfare of Amer ican citizens. E. g., McCull och, supra, at 21. In contrast, the Cour t later held the NLRA fully appl icable to labor relati ons between a foreig n vessel and Amer ican longshoremen because this relati onsh ip, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew , does not implicate a foreig n ship's inter nal order and discipl ine. Longsho remen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195, 198-201. This narrow clear statement rule is suppor ted by sound principles of statutory constr uction. It is reason\u00ad able to presume Congress intends no inter ference with matters that are primarily of concer n only to the ship and the foreig n state in which it is registered. It is also reasonable , howe ver, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to entities in U. S. territory that serve , em\u00ad ploy, or other wise affec t Amer ican citizens, or that affec t the peace and tranqui lity of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreig n-flag ships. Cruise ships flying foreig n flags of convenience but depar ting from and retur ning to U. S. ports accommodate and transpor t over 7 million U. S. residents annua lly, includi ng large numbers of disabled indiv idua ls. To hold there is no Title III protec tion for the disabled would be a harsh and unexpec ted inter pret ation of a statute desig ned prov ide broad protec tion for them. Pp. 130-133. (b) Plainly, most of the Title III violati ons alleged below\u2014that NCL required disabled passengers to pay higher fares and specia l surcharges; maintained evacuati on programs and equipment in locati ons not accessi\u00ad ble to them; required them, but not other passengers, to waive any po\u00ad tentia l medica l liability and to travel with compani ons; reserved the right to remove them from ships if they endangered other passengers' comfor t; and, more genera lly, failed to make reasonable modi cati ons necessary to ensure their full enjoyment of the serv ices offered\u2014have noth ing to do with a ship's nal affairs. However, the petiti oners' allegati ons concer ning physica l barr access on board\u2014 e. g., their asser tion that most of NCL 's cabins, includi ng the most attrac tive ones in the most desirable locati ons, are not accessible to disabled passen\u00ad gers\u2014wou ld appear to involve requirements that might be constr ued as relati ng to inter nal ship affairs. The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and signicant structura l modi cati ons to foreig n vessels. Pp. 133-135. (c) Because Title III does not require structura l modi cati ons that confl ict with inter national legal obligati ons or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Title 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 122 SPECTOR v. NOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Syllabus III does not require any permanent and signicant structura l modi ca\u00ad tions that inter fere with cruise ships' inter nal affairs. If so, recourse to the inter nal affairs clear statement rule would not be necessary . Cases may arise, howe ver, where it is prudent for a cour t to invoke that rule without deter mining whether Title III actually imposes a particu\u00ad lar barr ier-remova l requirement entailing a permanent and signicant structura l cati on inter fering with a foreig n ship's inter nal affairs. Conversely , where it is not obvious that a particular physica l modi ca\u00ad tion relates to a vessel' s basic arch itecture and constr uction, but it is clear the modi cati on would confl ict with an inter national legal obliga\u00ad tion, the cour t may simply hold the modi cati on not readi ly achievable , without resor t to the clear statement rule. P. 137. (d) The holdi ng that the clear statement rule operates only when a ship's inter nal affairs are affec ted does not implicate the Cour t's holdi ng in Clark v. Mar tinez, 543 U. S. 371, 380, that statutory lang uage given a limiting constr uction in one context must be inter preted consistently in other contexts, \"even though other of the statute' s appl icati ons, stand\u00ad ing alone, would not suppor t the same limitation.\" Mar tinez appl ied a canon for choosi plausible meani ngs of an ambig uous stat\u00ad ute, not a clear statement rule that implies a specia l subst antive limit on the appl icati on wise unambig uous statutory mandate . Pp. 140-141. Justice Kennedy , joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas, concluded in Part III-A that if Title III imposed a requirement that inter fered with a foreig n-flag cruise ship's inter nal affairs, the clear statement rule would come into play, but that require\u00ad ment would still apply to domestic ships, and Title III requirements having noth ing to do with inter nal affairs would conti nue to apply to domestic and foreig n ships alike. This appl icati on-by-appl icati on ap\u00ad proach is consistent with how the clear statement rule has traditi onally operated. If the rule restr icts some NLRA appl icati ons to foreig n ships (e. g., labor relati ons with foreig n crews in Benz and McCull och) , but not others (e. g., labor relati ons with Amer ican longshoremen in Ari\u00ad adne Shipping), it follows appl icati on is also re\u00ad quired under Title III. The clear statement rule, if it is invoked, would restr ict some appl icati ons of Title III to foreig n ships (e. g., certain structura l barr ier modi cati on requirements), but not others (e. g., the statute' s proh ibition on discr iminatory ticket pricing). The rule is an implied limitation on a statute' s other wise unambig uous genera l terms. It operates much like other implied limitation rules, which avoid appl ica\u00ad tions of other wise unambig uous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domai ns in a way that Congress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the matter . See, e. g., EEOC v. Arab ian Ame rican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260. An all-or-noth ing approach would convert the clear 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 123 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Syllabus statement rule from a principle of inter pretive cauti on into a trap for an unwary Congress, requir ing nullicati on of the entire statute , or of some arbitrary set of appl icati ons larger than the domai n the rule pro\u00ad tects. Pp. 137-139. Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Breyer, agreed that Title III of the Amer icans with Disabi lities Act of 1990 covers cruise ships and allows them to resist modi cati ons that would confl ict with inter national legal obligati ons, but would give no wider berth to the \"inter nal affairs\" clear statement rule in deter mining Title III's appl icati on to respond\u00ad ent's ships. That rule derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes \"shou ld not be inter preted to regulate foreig n persons or conduc t if that regulation would confl ict with principles of inter national law.\" Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California , 509 U. S. 764, 815. This noni nter ference principle is served here by the Cour t's inter pret ation of 42 ly achievable\" lang with inter national legal obligati ons. The plura lity's further suggesti on that the \"inter nal affairs\" clear statement rule may block Title III-prompted structura l modi cati ons, even in the absence of con\u00ad flict with inter national obligati ons, cuts the rule loose from its founda\u00ad tion. Because inter national relati ons are not at risk and the United States has a strong interest in protec ting Amer ican passengers on for\u00ad eign and domestic cruise ships, there is no reason to demand a clearer congressi onal statement that Title III reaches the vessels in questi on. Pp. 142-145. Justice Thomas concluded that Title III of the Amer icans with Disa\u00ad bilities Act of 1990, insofar as it could be read to require structura l changes, lacks a sufciently clear statement that it appl ies to the inter\u00ad nal affairs of foreig n vessels. However, the clear statement rule does not render Title III entirely inappl icable to foreig n vessels; instead, Title III appl ies to foreig n ships only to the extent to which it does not bear on their inter nal affairs.

This case presents the questi on whether Title III of the Amer icans with Disabi lities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat. 353, 42 U. S. C. \u00a712181 et seq., appl ies to foreig n-flag cruise ships in United States waters. The Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Circuit held Title III did not apply because of a presumpti on, which it sought to derive from this Cour t's case law, that, absent a clear indicati on of congressi onal intent, genera l statutes do not apply to foreig n-flag ships. 356 F. 3d 641, 644-646 (2004). The Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit, on the other hand, has held that the ADA does apply to foreig n-flag cruise ships in United States waters. See Stev ens v. Premi er Cruises, Inc., 215 F. 3d 1237 (2000). We granted certiorar i to resolve the confl ict. 542 U. S. 965 (2004). Our cases hold that a clear statement of congressi onal in\u00ad tent is necessary before a genera l statutory requirement can inter fere with matters that concer n a foreig n-flag vessel' s inter nal affairs and operati ons, as contrasted with statutory requirements that concer n the secur ity and well-bei ng of United States citizens or territory . While the clear state\u00ad ment rule could limit Title III's appl icati on to foreig n-flag cruise ships in some instances, when it requires remova l of physica l barr iers, it would appear the rule is inappl icable to many other duties Title III might impose . We therefore re\u00ad verse the decisi on of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Circuit that the ADA is altogether inappl icable to foreig n vessels, and WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of the Cour t I The respondent Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. (NCL), a Bermuda corporati on with a principa l place of business in Miami, Flor ida, operates cruise ships that depar t from, and retur n to, ports in the United States. The ships are essen\u00ad tially floati ng resor ts. They prov ide state\u00ad rooms or cabins, food, and enter tainment. The cruise ships stop at different ports of call where passengers may disem\u00ad bark. Most of the passengers on these cruises are United States residents; under the terms and conditi ons of the tick\u00ad ets, disputes between passengers and NCL are to be gov\u00ad erned by United States law; and NCL relies upon extensive adver tising in the United States to promote its cruises and increase its revenues. Despite the fact that the cruises are operated by a com\u00ad pany based in the United States, serve predomi nantly United States residents, and are in most other respec ts United States-centered ventures, almost all of NCL 's cruise ships are registered in other countr ies, flying so-ca lled flags of con\u00ad venience .

The Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Title III does not apply to foreig n-flag cruise ships in United States waters because the statute has no clear statement or expl icit text mandati ng coverage for these ships. This Cour t's cases, particularly Benz and McCull och, do hold, in some circum\u00ad stances, that a genera l statute will not apply to certain as\u00ad pects of the inter nal operati ons of foreig n vessels temporar\u00ad ily in United States waters, absent a clear statement. The 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 130 SPECTOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of Kennedy , J. broad clear statement rule adopted by the Cour t of Appea ls, howe ver, would apply to every facet of the business and op\u00ad erati ons of foreig n-flag ships. That formulation is inconsist\u00ad ent with the Cour t's case law and with sound principles of statutory inter pret ation. 2 This Cour t has long held that genera l statutes are pre\u00ad sumed to apply to conduc t that takes place aboard a foreig n\u00ad flag vessel in United States territory if the interests of the United States or its citizens, rather than interests inter nal to the ship, are at stake. See Cun ard S. S. Co. v. Mell on, 262 U. S. 100, 127 (1923) (holdi ng that the genera l terms of Proh ibition Act apply to foreig n-flag ships in United States waters because \"[t]here is in the act no prov i\u00ad sion mak ing it [in]appl icable\" to such ships); Uravic v. F. Jarka Co., 282 U. S. 234, 240 (1931) (holdi ng that \"genera l words\" shou ld be appl ied\" and that therefore there is \"no reason for limiting the liability for torts com\u00ad mitted [aboard foreig n-flag ships in United States territory ] when they go beyond the scope of discipl ine and private mat\u00ad ters that do not interest the territorial power \"). The gen\u00ad eral rule that United States statutes apply to foreig n-flag ships in United States territory is subjec t only to a narrow excepti on. Absent a clear statement of congressi onal in\u00ad tent, genera l statutes may not apply to foreig n-flag vessels insofar as they regulate matters that involve only the inter\u00ad nal order and discipl ine of the vessel, rather than the peace of the port. This qualicati on derives from the underst and\u00ad ing that, as a matter of inter national comity , \"all matters of discipl ine and all things done on board which affec[ t] only the vessel or those belong ing to her, and [do] not involve the peace or dignity of the country , or the tranqui lity of the port, shou ld be left by the local gover nment to be dealt with by the author ities of the nation to which the vessel belonged. \" Wildenhu s's Case, 120 U.

The two cases in recent times in which the presumpti on against apply ing genera l statutes to foreig n vessels' inter nal affairs has been invoked, Benz and McCull och, concer n labor relati ons. The Cour t held that the genera l terms of the Na\u00ad tional Labor Relati ons Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 151 et seq., did not gover n the respec tive rights and duties of a foreig n ship and its crew because the NLRA standards would inter fere with the foreig n vessel' s inter nal affairs in those circumst ances. These cases recog nized a narrow rule, appl icable only to statutory duties that implicate the inter nal order of the foreig n vessel rather than the welfare of Amer i\u00ad can citizens. McCull och, 372 U. S., at 21 (holdi ng that \"the law of the flag state ordinarily gover ns the internal affairs of a ship\" (emphasis added)); see also Benz , 353 U. S., at 146- 147. The Cour t held the NLRA inappl icable to labor rela\u00ad tions between a foreig n vessel and its foreig n crew not be\u00ad cause foreig n ships are genera lly exempt from the NLRA, but because the particular appl icati on of the NLRA would inter fere with matters that concer n only the inter nal opera\u00ad tions of the ship. In contrast, the Cour t held that the NLRA is fully appl icable to labor relati ons between a foreig n vessel and Amer ican longshoremen because this relati onsh ip, unlike the one between a vessel and its own crew , does not implicate a foreig n ship's inter nal order and discipl ine. Longsho remen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195, 198- 201 (1970). This narrow clear statement rule is suppor ted by sound principles of statutory constr uction. It is reasonable to pre\u00ad sume Congress intends no inter ference with matters that are primarily of concer n only to the ship and the foreig n 545US1 Unit:$U56 SPECTOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of Kennedy , J. in which it is registered. It is also reasonable , howe ver, to presume Congress does intend its statutes to apply to enti\u00ad ties in United States territory that serve , employ , or other\u00ad wise affec t Amer ican citizens, or that affec t the peace and tranqui lity of the United States, even if those entities happen to be foreig n-flag ships. Cruise ships flying foreig n flags of convenience offer publ ic accommodati ons and transpor tation serv ices to 7 mil\u00ad lion United States residents annua lly, depar ting from and retur ning to ports located in the United States. Large num\u00ad bers of disabled indiv idua ls, many of whom have mobi lity impair ments that make other kinds of vacati on travel dif\u00ad cult, take advant age of these cruises or would like to do so. To hold there is no Title III protec tion for disabled persons who seek to use the amenities of foreig n cruise ships would be a harsh and unexpec ted inter pret ation of a statute de\u00ad signed to prov ide broad protec tion for the disabled. \u00a7 12101. The clear statement rule adopted by the Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Circuit, moreover , would imply that other gen\u00ad eral federa l statutes\u2014i ncludi ng, for example , Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 2000a et seq.\u2014wou ld not apply aboard foreig n cruise ships in United States waters. A clear statement rule with this sweepi ng appl icati on is unlikely to reflec t congressi onal intent. The relevant category for which the Cour t demands a clear congressi onal statement, then, consists not of all appl icati ons of a statute to foreig n-flag vessels but only those appl icati ons that would inter fere with the foreig n vessel' s inter nal affairs. This propositi on does not mean the clear statement rule is irrele vant to the ADA, howe ver. If Title III by its terms does impose duties that inter fere with a foreig n-flag cruise ship's inter nal affairs, the lack of a clear congressi onal state\u00ad ment can mean that those speci c appl icati ons of Title III are precluded. On remand, the Cour t of Appea ls may need to consider which, if any, Title III requirements inter fere 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 133 Cite 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Opinion of Kennedy , J. with the inter nal affairs of foreig n-flag vessels. As we will discuss further, howe ver, Title III's own limitations and qualicati ons may make this inquiry unnecessary . B 1 The precise content of the category \"inter nal affairs\" (or, as it is variously denoted in the case law, \"inter nal order \" or \"inter nal operati ons\") is difcu lt to dene on. There is, moreover , some ambig uity in our cases as to whether the relevant category of activities is restr icted to matters that affec t only the inter nal order of the ship when there is no effec t on United States interests, or whether the clear statement rule further comes into play if the predomi\u00ad nant effec t of a statutory requirement is on a foreig n ship's inter nal affairs but the requirement also promotes the wel\u00ad fare of United States residents or territory . We need not attempt to dene the relevant protec ted category with preci\u00ad sion. It sufces to observe that the guiding principles in deter mining whether the clear statement rule is triggered are the desire for inter national comity and the presumed lack of interest by the territorial sovereig n in matters that bear no subst antia l relati on to the peace and tranqui lity of the port. It is plain that Title III might impose any number of duties on cruise ships that have noth ing to do with a ship's inter\u00ad nal affairs. The pleadi ngs and briefs in this case illustrate , but do not exhaust, the ways a cruise ship might offend such a duty . The petiti oners allege NCL charged disabled pas\u00ad sengers higher fares and required disabled passengers to pay specia l surcharges, Plaintiffs' First Amended Original Complai nt in No. H-00-2649 Tex.), \u00b6 32, programs and equipment in ons not accessible to disabled indiv idua ls, Complai nt \u00b6 19, SPECTOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of Kennedy , J. not other passengers, to waive any potentia l medica l liability and to travel with a compani on, id., at 8, 17-18; and reserved the right to remove from the ship any disabled indiv idua l whose presence endangers the \"comfor t\" of passen\u00ad gers, id., at 8, 20. The petiti oners also allege more genera lly that NCL of the serv ices NCL offered. Com\u00ad plaint \u00b6 30, App. 15. These are bare allegati ons, and their truth is not conceded. We express no opinion on the factual suppor t for those claims. We can say, howe ver, that none of these alleged Title III violati ons implicate any requirement that would inter fere with the inter nal affairs and manage\u00ad ment of a vessel as our cases have employed that term. At least one subset of the petiti oners' allegati ons, howe ver, would appear to involve requirements that might be con\u00ad strued as relati ng to the inter nal affairs of foreig n-flag cruise ships. These allegati ons concer n physica l barr iers to access on board. For example , accordi ng to the petiti oners, most of the cabins on NCL 's cruise ships, includi ng the most at\u00ad tractive cabins in the most desirable locati ons, are not acces\u00ad sible to disabled passengers. Brief for Petitioners 17-18; Complai nt \u00b6 16, App. 11. also allege that the ships' coami ngs\u2014the raised edges around their doors\u2014 make many areas of the ships inaccessible to mobi lity\u00ad impaired passengers who use wheelchairs or scooters. Brief for Petitioners 24. Remova l of these and other access bar\u00ad riers, the petiti oners suggest, may be required by iers affec t the passengers as well as the ship and its crew , the statutory requirement could mandate a permanent and signicant alterati on of a physica l feature of the ship\u2014that is, an element of basic ship desig n [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 135 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t and constr uction. If so, these appl icati ons of the barr ier\u00ad remova l requirement likely would inter fere with the inter nal affairs of foreig n ships. A permanent and signicant modi\u00ad cati on to a ship's physica l structure goes to fundament al issues of ship desig n and constr uction, and it might be impos\u00ad sible for a ship to comply with all the requirements different jurisdic tions might impose . The clear statement rule would most likely come into play if Title III were read to require permanent and signicant structura l modi cati ons to foreig n vessels. It is quite a different questi on, howe ver, whether Title III would require this. The Title III requirements that might impose permanent and subst antia l changes to a ship's arch itecture and desig n, are, like all of Title III's re\u00ad quirements, subjec t to the statute' s own speci c limitations and qualicati ons. These limitations may make resor t to the clear statement rule unnecessary . 2 Title III requires barr ier remova l if it is \"readi ly achiev\u00ad able,\" \u00a7 b)(2)(A)( as \"easi ly accompl ishable and able to be carried out without much difcu lty or expense ,\" \u00a7 12181(9). Title III does not dene \"difcu \"easi ly accompl ishable and able to be carried out without much difcu lty or expense\"\u2014i ndicates that it extends to con\u00ad siderati ons in additi on to cost. Further more , Title III di\u00ad rects that the \"readi ly 12181(9)(B ). Surely a barr ier-remova l requirement under Title III that would bring a vessel into noncompl iance with the Inter na\u00ad tional Conventi on for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), Nov. 1, 1974, [1979 -1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700, or any other inter national legal obligati on, would create serious difcu lties for the vessel and would have WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of the Cour t pact on its operati on, and thus would not be \"readi ly achiev\u00ad able.\" This underst andi ng of the statute , urged by the United States, is eminently reasonable . Brief as Ami cus Curiae 27-28; ADA Title gov/crt/ada /taman3up .html (as visited May 31, 2005, and available in Clerk of Cour t's case le); 56 Fed. Reg. 45600 (1991). , Title III's \"readi tion were not to take confl icts with inter national law into account, it would lead to the anoma lous resu lt that Amer ican cruise ships are obligated to comply with Title III even if doing so brings them into noncompl iance with SOLAS, whereas foreig n ships\u2014wh ich unlike Amer ican ships have the benet of the inter nal affairs clear statement rule\u2014 would not be so obligated. Congress could not have in\u00ad tended this resu lt. It is logical and proper to conclude , moreover , that whether a barr ier modi cati on is \"readi ly achievable\" under Title III into considerati on the modi cati on's . A prov ision of Title III mandates that the statute' s nondiscr imination and accommo\u00ad dation requirements do not if disabled indiv idua ls would pose \"a signicant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modi cati on of policies, prac\u00ad tices, or procedures or prov 12182( b)(3). This reference is to a safety threat posed by a disabled indiv idua l, whereas here the questi on would be whether the structura l modi cati on itself may pose the safety threat. It would be incongr uous, nevertheless, to attribute to Congress an intent to require modi cati ons that threaten safety to others simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person but from the accommodati on itself . The anoma ly is avoided ng that struc\u00ad tura l modi cati on is not readi ly achievable within the mean\u00ad ing of \u00a7 12181(9) if it would pose a direc t threat to the health or safety of others. 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 137 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Opinion of Kennedy , J. 3 Because Title III does not require structura l modi cati ons that would confl ict with inter national legal obligati ons or pose any real threat to the safety of the crew or other pas\u00ad sengers, it may well follow\u2014though we do not decide the questi on here \u2014that Title III does not require any perma\u00ad nent and signicant structura l modi cati ons that inter fere with the inter nal affairs of any cruise ship, foreig n flag or domestic. If that is indeed the case , recourse to the clear statement rule would not be necessary . Cases may arise, howe ver, where it is prudent for a cour t to turn rst to the inter nal affairs clear statement rule rather than decidi ng the precise scope and operati on of the statute . Suppose , for example , it is a difcu lt questi on whether a particular Title III barr ier-remova l requirement is readi ly achievable , but the requirement does entail a per\u00ad manent and signicant structura l with a foreig n ship's inter nal affairs. In that case a cour t sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without deter\u00ad mining whether Title III actually imposes the requirement. On the other hand, there may be many cases where it is not obvious that a particular physica l modi cati on relates to a vessel' s basic arch itecture and constr uction, but it is clear the modi cati on would confl ict with SOLAS or some other inter national legal obligati on. In those cases, a cour t may deem it appropr iate to hold that the physica l barr ier modi \u00ad cation in questi on is not readi ly achievable , without resor t to the clear statement rule. III A In light of the precedi ng analysis, it is likely that under a proper inter pret ation of \"readi ly achievable\" Title III would impose no requirements that inter fere with the inter nal af\u00ad fairs of foreig n-flag cruise ships. If Title III did impose a duty that required cruise ships to make permanent and sig\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 138 SPECTOR LINE LTD. of Kennedy , J. nicant structura l modi cati ons that did not confl ict with in\u00ad ternational law or threaten safety , or if the statute other wise inter fered with a foreig n ship's inter nal affairs, the clear statement rule recog nized in Benz and McCull och would come into play at that point. The Title III requirement in questi on, howe ver, would still apply to domestic cruise ships, and Title III requirements having noth ing to do with inter\u00ad nal affairs would conti nue to apply to domestic and foreig n ships alike. This appl icati on-by-appl icati on use of the inter nal affairs clear statement rule is consistent with how the rule has tra\u00ad ditionally operated. In Benz and McCull och, the Cour t con\u00ad cluded that the NLRA did not apply to labor relati ons be\u00ad tween a foreig n-flag ship and its foreig n crew because of inter ference with the foreig n ships' inter nal affairs. In Ari\u00ad adne Shipping, howe ver, the Cour t held that the NLRA does apply to labor relati ons between a foreig n-flag ship and Amer ican longshoremen. Ariadne Shipping acknowledged the clear statement rule invoked in Benz and McCull och but held that the \"considerati ons that informed the Cour t's con\u00ad struction of the statute in [those cases ] are clear ly inappl ica\u00ad ble\" to the questi on whether the statute appl ies to foreig n ships' labor relati ons with Amer ican longshoremen. 397 U. S., at 199. Ariadne Shipping held the longshore\u00ad men' the [foreig n] vessels plainly belied any involvement on their part with the ships' 'inter nal discipl ine and order .' \" Id., at 200. Therefore , appl icati on of the have threatened no inter ference inter nal affairs of foreig n-flag ships.\" Ibid. If the clear statement appl icati ons of the NLRA to foreig n ships (e. g., labor relati ons with the foreig n crew), but not others (e. g., labor relati ons with Amer ican longshoremen), it follows that the case-by-case ap\u00ad plicati on is also required under Title III of the ADA. The rule, where it is even necessary to invoke it, would restr ict 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 139 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Opinion of Kennedy , J. some appl icati ons of Title III to foreig n ships (e. g., certain structura l barr ier-modi cati on requirements), but not others (e. g., the proh ibition on discr iminatory ticket pricing). The inter nal affairs clear statement rule is an implied limi\u00ad tation on other wise unambig uous genera l terms of the stat\u00ad ute. It operates much like the principle that genera l stat\u00ad utes are constr ued not to apply extraterr itorially, EEOC v. Arab ian Ame rican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991), or the rule that genera l statutes are presumed not to impose mone\u00ad tary on nonconsenti ng States, Atascade ro State Hos\u00ad pital v. Scan lon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985). Impl ied limitation rules avoid appl icati ons of other wise unambig uous statutes that would intrude on sensitive domai ns in a way that Con\u00ad gress is unlikely to have intended had it considered the mat\u00ad ter. In these instances, the absence of a clear congressi onal statement is, in effec t, equiva lent to a statutory qualicati on saying, for example , \"Notwithst andi ng any genera l lang uage of , this statute shall not apply extraterr itori\u00ad ally\"; or \" ...t hisstatute shall sovereig n immunity of nonconsenti ng States\"; or \" ...t his statute does not regulate the inter nal affairs of foreig n-flag vessels. \" These clear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or genera l lang uage , legislate on a sensitive topic inad\u00ad vertently or without due deliberati on. An all-or-noth ing ap\u00ad proach, under which a statute is altogether inappl icable if but one of its speci c appl icati ons trenches on the domai n protec ted by a clear statement rule, would convert the clear statement rule from a principle of inter pretive cauti on into a trap for an unwary Congress. If Congress passes broad legislati on that has some appl icati ons that implicate clear statement rule\u2014say itorial appl icati regulate foreig n ships' inter nal affairs\u2014an all-or-noth ing approach would require that the entire statute , or some arbitrary set of appl icati ons larger than the domai n protec ted by the clear statement rule, would be nullied. We decline to adopt that posture WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of Kennedy , J. B Our holdi ng that the clear statement rule operates only when a ship's inter nal affairs are affec ted does not implicate our holdi ng in Clark v. Mar tinez, 543 U. S. 371 (2005). Mar\u00ad tinez held that statutory lang uage given a limiting constr uc\u00ad tion in one context must be inter preted consistently in other contexts, \"even though other of the statute' s appl icati ons, standi ng alone, would not suppor t the same limitation.\" Id., at 380. This was simply a rule of consistent inter pret ation of the statutory words, with no bear ing on the implement a\u00ad tion of a clear statement rule addressed to particular statu\u00ad tory appl icati ons. The statute in Mar tinez, U. S. C. \u00a7 1231( a)(6), Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 678, 696-699 (2001), the Cour t had inter\u00ad preted this statute to impose time limits on detenti on of aliens held for certain reasons stated in the statute .

But see ante, at 137. That rule, as I underst and it, derives from, and is moored to, the broader guide that statutes \"shou ld not be inter preted to regulate foreig n persons or conduc t if that regulation would confl ict with principles of inter national law.\" Hartford Fire Ins.

Title III is proper ly read to avoid such confl ict, but shou ld not be hemmed in where there is no potentia l for inter national discord.1 The rst of the moder n cases to address the appl icati on of a domestic statute to a foreig n-flag ship in U.

As we concluded in Benz , before readi ng our law to \"run inter ference in such a delicate eld of inter national relati ons,\" \"where the possibi lities of inter national discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain,\" the Cour t shou ld await Congress' clear ly expressed instruction.

Apply ing our law \"to the inter nal management and affairs\" of the vessels in questi on, we observed, McCull och, 372 U.

I agree with this inter pret ation, but would create no larger space for the inter nal affairs rule. The plura lity, howe ver, suggests that the clear statement rule has a further ofce: It may block structura l modi ca\u00ad tions prompted by Title III that are \"readi ly achievable\"\u2014 because they do not confl ict with inter national legal obliga\u00ad tions\u2014but Cite as: 545 U.

In positi ng an extended appl icati on of the inter nal affairs rule, the plura lity cuts the rule loose from its foundati on. As Benz and McCull och demonstrate , the clear statement rule is an inter pretive principle counsel ing against constr uction of a statute in a manner produc tive of inter na\u00ad tional discord. When inter national relati ons are not at risk, and there is good reason to apply our own law, asser ted in\u00ad ternal affairs of a ship shou ld hold no greater sway than as\u00ad serted management prerogatives of a landlocked enter prise.3 As the plura lity rightly notes, Title III is a broad remedia l statute desig ned to protec t persons with disabi lities in a va\u00ad riety of activities and setti ngs. See ante, at 132; \u00a7 12101( b). The United States has a strong interest in ensur ing that U. S. resident cruise passengers enjoy Title III's protec tions on both domestic and foreig n ships. See \u00a7 12101; Brief for United States as Ami cus Curiae 10.4 Once confl icts with inter national legal obligati ons are avoided, I see no reason to demand a clearer congressi onal statement that Title III reaches the vessels in questi on, ships that regularly sail to and from U. S. ports and derive most of their income from U. S. passengers. In sum, I agree that \u00a7 12182( b)(2)(A)( iv), proper ly read, does not require shipowners to make modi \u00ad cations that would confl ict with inter national legal obliga\u00ad tions. But I would attribute to the inter nal affairs clear statement rule no further limitation on Title III's gover\u00ad nance in this case. 3 One could hardly anticipate that, absent confl ict with inter national legal obligati ons, the appl icati on of Title III sought in this case would generate a \"stor m of diplomatic protest. \" Id., at 146 (noting \"stor m of diplomatic protest\" against proposa l to apply U.

For those reasons, I join Part I-A of Justice Scalia 's dis\u00ad sent. While I conclude that the rule appl ies to certain as\u00ad pects of Title III, I agree with the plura lity that it does not require an \"all-or-noth ing approach. \" Ante, at 139. Conse\u00ad quently , those appl icati ons of Title III that do not pertain to inter nal affairs apply to foreig n-flag vessels. For that rea\u00ad son, I join Part III-A of the plura lity opinion. I reach this resu lt, howe ver, only because I conti nue to reject the \"lowest common denomi nator \" principle the Cour t articulated for the rst time in Clark v. Mar tinez, 543 U. S. 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 147 Cite as: 545 U. S. 119 (2005) Opinion of Thomas, J. 371 (2005). See id., at 395-397 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng). The plura lity, by contrast, accepts Clark. Moreover , it claims that apply ing Title III of the ADA to matters that are not within the realm of a ship's inter nal order is consist\u00ad ent with Clark. The plura lity's effor plura lity says that today' s case differs from Clark be\u00ad cause it invokes a clear statement rule to inter pret unambig\u00ad uous text. Accordi ned the icati on previously adopted limiting constr uction of ambig uous text, which this to amel iorate un\u00ad related constituti onal Ante, at 140-141. As an ini\u00ad tial matter , howe ver, the statute at issue in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), and Clark was not ambig uous. Clark, as\u00ad sumi ng for the sake ambig uous, the disti nction the plura lity draws has no basis in Clark. In Clark, this Cour t addressed the period of detenti on 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1231( a)(6) author ized for inadmissible aliens. This questi on left open by Zadvydas , supra, which had addressed the period of detenti on under the same statute but with re\u00ad spec t to a different class of aliens\u2014those who had been ad\u00ad mitted into the country Zadvydas lity of of admitted aliens raised signicant constituti onal doubts and, in light of those doubts, it limited the Attorney Genera l's power to de\u00ad tain admitted aliens. 533 U. 689-690, 699. Section 1231( a)(6) does not disti nguish between the two classes of aliens. Thus, this Cour t in Clark concluded it was com\u00ad pelled to apply that same constr uction, which was warranted only by the speci c constituti onal concer ns arising for ad\u00ad mitted aliens, to the unadmitted aliens before it. 543 U. S., at 378. Clark's conclusi on stemmed from the narrow ing constr uction adopted in Zadvydas , not the type of rule or canon that gave rise to that constr uction. 543 U. NOR WEGIAN CRUISE LINE LTD. Opinion of Thomas, J. The plura lity's reasoni ng cannot be squared with Clark's Under Clark, \"[t]he lowest , as it were , must gover n.\" Id., at 380. Just as in Zadvydas and Clark, this Cour t is called upon to inter pret the same statutory text with respec t to two different classes of cases\u2014those that implicate the inter nal affairs of a vessel and those that do not. And just like the statute at issue in Zadvydas and Clark, Title III \"appl ies without differentiati on\" to the inter nal and exter nal affairs of foreig n-flag vessels, as well as the inter nal and ex\u00ad ternal affairs of domestic-flag ships. 543 U. S., at 378. Thus, the limiting uction of Title III's denitions must gov\u00ad ern all appl icati ons of the statute , not just those appl icati ons that pertain to inter nal affairs. Accordi ng to Clark, the Cour t may not narrow Title III on a case-by-case basis, de\u00ad pendi ng on whether a particular appl on of Title III in\u00ad terferes with a ship's inter nal order . In fact, it may not apply Title III to any ship or, for that matter , any entity at all, because Title III does not disti nguish between any of the covered entities. This demonstrates why the principle Clark established is flawed. Today' s decisi on, then, cabins the Clark principle to apply only when the canon of constituti onal avoidance is invoked to choose among ambig uous readi ngs of a statute . But even here Clark will conti nue to make misch ief. As I explai ned in Clark, the lowest common denomi nator principle requires cour ts to search out a single hypothetica l constituti onally doubtfu l case to limit a statute' s terms in the whol ly different case actually before the cour t, lest the cour t fail to adopt a readi ng of the statute that reflec ts the nomi nator . 400 (dissenti ng opinion). requires a reverse- Salerno analysis that upends our facia l challenge requirements. See Clark, supra, at 381-382; see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987) (for a facia l challenge to succeed, there must be no circumst in which 149 Cite U. S. 119 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng the statute is constituti onal). For this and other reasons I have explai ned, the Clark analysis allows much havoc to be wrought from the canon of constituti onal avoidance . See Clark, supra, at 395-401 (dissenti ng opinion). In sum, I believe that Title III of the ADA, insofar as it requires structura l changes, lacks a sufciently clear state\u00ad ment that it appl ies to the inter nal affairs of foreig n vessels. In my view the clear statement rule does not render Title III entirely inappl icable to foreig n vessels; instead, Title III appl ies to foreig n ships only to the extent to which it does not bear on their inter nal affairs. I therefore would remand for considerati on of those Title III claims that do not pertain to the structure of the ship. Accordi ngly, I concur in Part III-A of the plura lity opinion, join Part I-A of Justice Scalia 's dissent, and concur in the judg ment in part. Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and Jus\u00ad tice O'Connor join, and with whom Justice Thomas joins as to Part I-A, dissenti ng. recog nizes that Congress must clear ly express its intent to apply its laws to foreig n-flag ships when those laws inter fere with the ship's inter nal order . Its attempt to place Title III of the Amer icans with Disabi lities Act of 1990 (ADA) outside this rule through creative statutory inter pret ation and piecemea l appl icati on of its prov isions is unsuppor ted by our case law. Title III plainly affec ts the inter nal order of foreig n-flag cruise ships, subjec ting them to the possibi lity of confl icting inter national obligati ons. I would hold that, since there is no clear statement of coverage , Title III does not apply to foreig n-flag cruise ships. I A As the plura lity explai ns, where a law would inter fere with the regulation of a ship's inter nal order , we require a clear statement that Congress intended such a resu lt. See 545US1 Unit:$U56 CRUISE LINE LTD. Scalia, J., dissenti ng ante, at 130. This rule is predicated on the \"rule of inter\u00ad national law that the law of the flag state ordinarily gover ns the inter nal affairs of a ship,\" McCull och v. Sociedad Nacional de Mar ineros de Honduras , 372 U. S. 10, 21 (1963), and is desig ned to avoid \"the possibi lit[y] of inter national discord, \" Benz v. Compan ia Naviera Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957); see also McCull och, supra, at 19. The clear-st atement rule nds suppor t not only in Benz and McCull och, but in cases like Cun ard S. S. Co. v. Mell on, 262 U. S. 100, 128-129 (1923), where we held that the Na\u00ad tional Proh ibition Act, 41 Stat. 305, forbade foreig n-flag ships from carry ing or serv ing alcohol in United States territorial waters. Though we did not say so expressly in that case , proh ibiting the carry ing and serv ing of alcohol in United States waters cannot be said to affec t the \"inter nal order \" of the ship, because it does not in any way affec t the opera\u00ad tion or func tioning of the craft.1 Similarly, in Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U. S. 571 (1953), and Hellenic Lines Ltd. v. Rho\u00ad ditis, 398 U. S. 306 (1970), we did not employ a clear\u00ad statement rule in deter mining whether foreig n seamen in\u00ad jured aboard foreig n-flag ships could recover under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 688. We disti nguished these cases in McCull och, explai ning that a clear statement is not required \"in different contexts, such as the Jones Act . . . where the pervasive regulation of the internal order of a ship may not be presen t.\" 372 U. S., at 19, n. 9 (empha\u00ad sis added).2 1 The plura lity also appears to the Nati onal Proh ibition Act cont ained a clear statement of intent to reach foreig n-flag vessels, because the Act had been amended to state that it appl ied to \"all territory subjec t to [the] jurisdic tion\" of the United States. Cun ard S. S. Co. v. Mell on, 262 U.

See ante, at 131-132. McCull och, 372 U. S., at 19, expressly rejected this approach, explai ning that any attempt to weigh the ship's cont acts with the United States 151 Cite U.

(Safety has, under inter na\u00ad tional law, traditi onally been the prov ince of a ship's flag state.) This is quite different from proh ibiting alcohol in United States waters or imposi ng tort liability for injuries sustained on foreig n ships in port\u2014the laws at issue in Cu\u00ad nard and the Jones Act cases. Those restr ictions affec ted the ship only in limited circumst ances, and in ways ancillary to its operati on at sea. A ship's desig n and constr uction, by contrast, are at least as integra l to the ship's operati on and func the bargai ning relati onsh ip between ship\u00ad owner and crew at issue in Benz and McCull och. Moreover , the structural changes petitioners request would be permanent. Whereas a ship precluded from serv\u00ad ing or carry ing alcohol in United States waters may cer\u00ad tainly carry and serve alcohol on its next trip from Italy to Greece , structura l modi cati ons made to comply with Amer i\u00ad can laws cannot readi ly be removed once the ship leaves our waters and ceases to carry Amer ican passengers. This is again much like the situati on presented in Benz and McCul\u00ad loch, where the appl icati on of Amer ican labor laws would have conti nued to gover n contrac ts between foreig n ship\u00ad owners and their foreig n crews well beyond their time in our waters.

Though many of these regulations may be compatible with Title III, it is easy to imag ine confl icts arising, given the detailed nature of ADAAG's regulations. See PVAAC Re\u00ad port, chs. 1-11. As we have previously noted, even this \"possib ility of inter national discord\" with regard to a sea\u00ad going vessel' s inter nal order , McCull och, 372 U.

This argument comes at the expense of an expansive en passan t inter pret ation of the excepti ons to the barr ier-remova l requirements of Title III\u2014wh ich inter pret ation will likely have more that the argument is even correc t,3 it is entirely beside the point. It has never been a conditi on for appl icati on of the foreig n-flag atement rule that an actual confl ict with foreig n or inter national law be established\u2014any more than that has been a conditi on for appl icati on itorial effec t of congres\u00ad 3 This by no means clear . Title III denes \"readi ly achievable\" as \"easi ly accompl ishable and able to be carried out without much difcu lty or expense .\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12181(9). It is, at best, ambig uous whether a barr ier remova l can be rendered not \"easi ly acco mplishabl e\" or not \"able to be out without much difcu lty\" by factors extr insic to the re\u00ad mova l itself . Confl ict of an easily altered structure with foreig n laws seems to me not much different from the tendency of an easily altered structure to deter customers. That is why, as suggested in text, the Cour t's unexpec ted Title III holdi ng may be J., dissenti ng sional enac tments. The reason to apply the rule here is that the structure of a ship pertains to the ship's inter nal order , which is a matter presumably left to the flag state unless Congress indicates other wise. The basis for that presump\u00ad tion of congressi onal intent is principa lly (though perhaps not exclusively) that subjec ting such matters to the com\u00ad mands of various jurisdic tions raises the possib ility (not nec\u00ad essar ily the certainty) of confl ict among jurisdic tions and with inter national treaties. Even if the Cour t could, by an imag inative inter pret ation of Title III, demonstrate that in this particular instance there would be no confl ict with the laws of other nations or with inter national treaties,4 it would remai n true that a ship's structure is preemi nently part of its inter nal order; and it would remai n true that sub\u00ad jecting ship structure to multiple national requirements invites confl ict. That is what triggers appl icati on clear-st atement rule. Safety concer traditi onally the responsibi lity of the flag state. Which is to say they are regarded as part of the ship's inter nal order . And even if Title III makes ample prov ision for a safety excepti on to the barr ier-remova l re\u00ad quirements, what it considers necessary for safety is not nec\u00ad essar ily what other nations or inter national treaties con\u00ad sider necessary . The foregoi ng renders quite unnecessary the Court's worry that Title III might require Amer ican cruise ships to adhere to Congress' s prescr iption in violati on of SOLAS. See ante, at 135-136. If and when that possibi lity presents itself, the Cour t remai ns free to do what it does here: to inter pret Title III so as to avoid any confl ict. But the avail\u00ad 4 The Cour t, of course , has not even shown that Title III is consistent with the laws of the cruise ships' flag state; much less has it under taken the Hercu lean task\u2014wh ich its theory of presumed coverage by domestic law would require \u2014of show ing Title III consistent with the laws of all the cruise ships' ports of call. 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 155 Cite U. S. 119 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng ability of such an inter pret ation has no bear ing upon whether the structura l features of an oceangoi ng vessel are part of its inter nal order . (I must observe , howe ver, that it seems much more plausible that Congress intended to re\u00ad quire Amer ican cruise ships to adhere to Title III regardless of SOLAS, than that\u2014what the Cour t apparently believes\u2014 Congress intended Title III to be inter preted with an eye to SOLAS.) In any event, the appl icati on of Title III to ocean\u00ad going vessels under Amer ican flag is not at issue here . I would therefore hold that, because Title III's barr ier\u00ad remova l prov isions n-flag ons, readi ng of Title III\u2014no matter how creative \u2014can alter the presumpti on that Title III does not apply to foreig n-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress.5 B The plura lity holds that, even \"[i]f Title III did impose a duty that required [foreig n-flag ] cruise ships to inter nal affairs, . . . Title III requirements having noth ing to do with inter nal affairs would conti nue to apply to domestic and foreig n ships alike.\" Ante, at 137-138. I disagree or not Title III's prescr iptions regardi ng such matters implicate the \"inter nal order \" of the ship, they still relate to the ships' maritime operati ons and are part of the same Title III.6 The require\u00ad ments of that enac tment either apply to foreig n-flag ships or 5 Of course this clear-st atement rule would not apply to the onshore operati ons of foreig n cruise companies, which would be treated no differ\u00ad ently from the operati ons of other foreig n companies on Amer ican soil. 6 This includes the pricing and ticketi ng policies, which are intimately related to the ships' maritime operati ons (and perhaps to inter nal order) because they are desig ned to defray the added cost and prov ide the added protec tion that the cruise-sh ip companies deem necessary for safe trans\u00ad port of disabled passengers. 545US1 Unit:$U56 OPIN 156 CRUISE LINE LTD. Scalia, J., dissenti ng they do not. It is not within our power to desig n a statute some of whose prov isions apply to foreig n-flag ships and other of whose prov isions do not\u2014any more than it is within our power to prescr ibe that the statute appl ies to foreig n\u00ad flag cruise ships 60% of whose passengers are United States citizens and does not apply to other foreig n-flag cruise ships. The plura lity's asser tion that those portions of Title III that do not implicate a ship's inter nal order apply to foreig n\u00ad flag ships displays a confusi on between a principle of inter\u00ad pret ation based upon a true-to-fac t intent, and a cour t-made rule. The plura lity seems to forget that it is a matter of deter mining whether Congress in fact intended that its enac tment cover foreig n-flag ships. To believe that there was any such intent section-by-sec tion and paragraph-by-paragraph is delusi onal. Either Congress enac ted Title III only with domestic entities (and not foreig n-flag ships) in mind, or it intended Title III to apply across-the-board. It could not possibly be the real congres\u00ad sional intent that foreig n-flag cruise of certain prov isions but not for oth\u00ad ers. That Congress had separate foreig n-flag intent with respec t to each requirement \u2014and would presumably adopt a clear statement prov ision-by-prov ision\u2014is utter ly implau\u00ad sible . And far from its being the case that this creates \"a trap for an unwary Congress, \" ante, at 139, it is the plu\u00ad rality's dispositi on that, in piecemea with foreig vessels in mind.7 We recently addressed a similar questi on 7 The plura lity's discussi on of Longsho remen v. Ariadne Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195 (1970), is misleadi ng. Although Ariadne clear ly recog nized the existence of an inter nal-order rule in our case law, see id., at 200, Ariadne did not hold, similarly to what the plura lity holds here Labor Relati from being appl ied to foreig n-flag ships but allowed others to be appl ied. Rather , it held that the clear-st atement rule did not apply at all to activities that were not \"within the 'mar itime operati OPIN 157 Cite U. S. 119 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng in Clark v. Mar tinez, 543 U.

That principle shou ld apply here . Since some appl icati ons of Title III plainly affec t the inter nal order of foreig n-flag ships, the absence of a clear statement renders the statute inappl icable \u2014even though some appl i\u00ad cations of the statute , if severed from the rest, would not require clear statement. This does not mean that a clear statement is required whene ver a cour t appl ies Title III to any entity\u2014only that a clear statement is required to apply any part of Title III to foreign-fl ag ships. Raygo r v. Regents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533 (2002), and Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456 (2003), do not dictate other wise. Raygo r held that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367( d) does not include , in its tolling of the limita\u00ad tions period, claims against States, because it cont ains no clear statement that States are covered. Jinks held that \u00a7 1367( d)'s tolling prov quirement appl ies to those entities. In other words, a clear statement is required to apply \u00a7 1367( d) to States, just as a clear statement is required to apply Title III to foreig n-flag ships. A clear statement is not required to apply \u00a7 1367( d) to politica l subdiv isions of States, just as a clear statement is not required to apply Title III to domestic ships or other domestic entities. The questi on in each of these cases is whether the statute at issue covers certain entities, not whether some provisions of a statute cover a given entity . is relevant only to questi ons the Cour t does not decide here \u2014namely , ap\u00ad plicati on of Title III to onshore operati ons of the foreig n-flag ships.

Scalia, J., dissenti ng The ne tuning of legislati on that the plura lity requires would be better left to Congress. To attempt it through the process of case-by-case adjudicati on is a recipe for endless litigati on and confusi on. The plura lity's resoluti on of today' s case proves the point. It requires this Title III claimant (and every other one who brings a claim against a foreig n shipowner) to show that each particular remedy he seeks does not implicate the inter nal order of the ship. That show ing, where structura l modi cati on is involved, would not only require the distr ict cour t to deter mine what is \"readi ly achievable ,\" ante, at 135-136 (major ity opinion), and what would \"pose 'a signicant risk to the health or safety of others, ' \" ante, at 136 (major ity opinion) (quoti ng \u00a7 12182( b)(3)), but would also require it to deter mine the obli\u00ad gations imposed by foreig n law and inter national treaties.8 All this to establish the preliminary point that Title III ap\u00ad plies and the claim can proceed to adjudicati on. If Congress desires to impose this time-consumi ng and intricate process, it is certainly able to do so\u2014though I think it would likely prefer some more manageable soluti on.9 But for the plura l\u00ad 8 The plura lity attempts to simplify this inquiry by explai ning that, if it is \"a difcu lt questi on whether a particular Title III barr ier-remova l requirement is readi ly achievable , but the requirement does entail a per\u00ad manent and signicant structura l n ship's inter nal affairs[,] a cour t sensibly could invoke the clear statement rule without deter mining whether Title III actually imposes the require\u00ad ment. \" Ante, at 137. It is impossible to reconci le this with the plura l\u00ad ity's rationale, which excludes the clear-st atement rule when there is no actual confl ict with foreig n law. On the plura lity's own analysis, signi\u00ad cant structura l modi cati ons are least likely to pose an actual confl ict with foreig n law, since they are most likely to be regarded as (under the plura l\u00ad ity's new Title III jurisprudence) not \"readi ly achievable\" and hence not required. I am at a loss to underst and what the plura lity has in mind. 9 After this Cour t concluded, in EEOC v. Arab ian Ame rican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) (ARAMCO), that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protec t Amer ican citizens work ing for Amer ican em\u00ad ployers in foreig n countr ies, Congress amended Title VII. Unlike what would have been this Cour t's only available resoluti on of the issue had it 545US1 Unit:$U56 [03-31-08 12:54:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN 159 Cite U. S. 119 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng ity to impose it as a novel consequence of the venerable clear-st atement rule seems to me unreasonable . I would therefore decline to apply all of Title III to foreig n-flag ships without a clear statement from Congress. II As the Cour t appears to concede , neither the III ships. The former basis of disabi lity in the full and equa l enjoyment of the goods, serv\u00ad ices, facilities, privileges, advant ages, or accommodati ons of any place of publ ic accommodati on by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of publ ic accommo\u00ad dation.\" 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 12182( a). Though Congress gave a seemi ngly failed to menti n-flag speci ca\u00ad tion, this is not a clear statement that foreig n-flag ships are covered. Petitioners also claim that, because cruise ships are essentia lly floati ng hotels that cont ain restaurants and other facilities expl icitly named in \u00a7 12181(7), they shou ld be covered. While this may suppor t the argument that cruise ships are \"publ ic accommodati ons,\" it does not suppor t the positi on that Congress intended to reach foreign-fl ag cruise ships. The \"in the full and equa l come to the opposite conclusi on in ARAMCO \u2014that Title VII appl ies to all Amer ican employers operati ng abroad\u2014 Congress was able to craft a more soluti on by exempti ng employers if compl iance with Title VII would run afou l of the law in the country where the workplace was located.

But even if the statute speci cally men tioned ships, that would not be a clear statement that foreign-fl ag ships are included\u2014any more than the reference to \"employer \" in the NLRA constituted a clear statement that foreig n-flag ship employers were covered, see McCull och, 372 U. S., at 19-21. Title III of the ADA stands in contrast to other statutes in which Congress has made clear its intent to extend its laws to foreig n ships. For example , the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 94 Stat. 1159, 46 U. S. C. App. \u00a7 1901 et seq., which permits the inspec tion and apprehensi on of t jurisdic tion of the United States, \" \u00a7 1903( a), which includes vessels \"located within the customs waters of the United States, \" \u00a7 1903( c)(1)(D ), and \"vessel[ s] registered in a foreig n nation where the flag nation has consented or waived objec tion\" to United States jurisdic\u00ad tion, \u00a7 1903( c)(1)( C).

CALIFORNIA certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appella te district No. 04-6964. Argued April 18, 2005 \u2014Decided June 13, 2005 Petitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a California state cour t of assau lting and murder ing a white child. During jury selec tion, a number of prospec tive jurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remai ned, three of whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to remove the prospec tive black jurors, resu lting in an all-wh ite jury. Defense counsel objec ted to those strikes on the ground that they were unconstituti onally based on race. The trial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explai n his strikes, but instead simply found that petiti oner had failed to establish a prima facie case of purposefu l discr imination under the gover ning state precedent, People v. Wheeler, which required a show ing of a strong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was based on group bias. The judge explai ned that, although the case was close , her review of the record convinced her that the prosecutor 's strikes could be justi ed by race\u00ad neutra l reasons. The California Cour t of Appea l set aside the convic\u00ad tion, but the State Supreme Cour t reinstated it, stressi ng that Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79, permits state cour ts to establish the standards used to evaluate the sufciency of prima facie cases of Reviewing Batson, Wheeler, and , the cour t concluded that Wheeler's \"strong likelihood\" standard is entirely consistent with Batson. Under Batson, the cour t held, a state cour t may require the objec tor to present not merely enough evi\u00ad dence to permit an inference that discr imination has occurred, but suf\u00ad ciently strong evidence to establish that the challenges, if not explai ned, were more likely than not based on race. Apply ing that standard, the cour t acknowledged that the exclusi on of all three black prospec tive jurors looked suspici ous, but deferred to the trial judge' s ruling. Held: California's \"more likely than not\" standard is an inappropr iate yardstick by which to measure the sufciency of a prima facie case of purposefu l This narrow but impor tant issue concer ns the scope of the rst of three steps Batson enumerated: (1) Once the defendant has made out a prima facie case and (2) the State has satised its burden to offer permissible race-neutra l justi cati ons for the strikes, e. g., 476 U. S., at 94, then (3) the trial cour t must decide whether the defendant has proved S. 162 (2005) Syllabus Purke tt v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765 (per curiam). Batson does not permit California to require at step one that the objec tor show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplai ned, were based on imper missible group bias. The Batson Cour t held that a prima facie case can be made out by offer ing a wide variety of evi\u00ad dence , so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives \"rise to an in\u00ad ference of discr iminatory purpose .\" 476 U. S., at 94. The Cour t ex\u00ad plained that to establish a prima facie case , the defendant must show that his membersh ip in a cognizable racia l group, the prosecutor 's exer\u00ad cise of peremptory challenges to remove members of that group, the indisput able fact that such challenges permit those inclined to discr imi\u00ad nate to do so, and any other relevant circumst ances raise an inference that the prosecutor excluded venire members on account of race. Id., at 96. The Cour t assumed that the trial judge would have the benet of all relevant circumst ances, includi explanati on, be\u00ad fore decidi ng whether it was more likely than not that the peremptory challenge was improper ly motivated. The Cour t did not intend the rst step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge \u2014on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty\u2014that the challenge was more likely than not the produc t of purposefu l discr imination. Instead, by produci ng evidence sufcient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discr imina\u00ad tion has occurred. The facts of this case illustrate that California's standard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson. The permissible inferences of discr imination, which caused the trial judge to comment that the case was close and the California Supreme Cour t to acknowledge that it was suspici ous that all three black prospec\u00ad tive jurors were removed, were sufcient to establish a prima facie case.

Instead, the trial judge shou ld have only re\u00ad quired petiti oner to proffer discr imination.2 The Appea ing relied on decisi ons of this Cour t, prior California case law, and the decisi on of the United States Cour t of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit in Wade v. Terhune, 202 F. 3d 1190 (2000). Apply ing the proper \"reasonable inference\" stand\u00ad ard, the major ity concluded that petiti oner had produced suf\u00ad cient evidence to suppor t a prima facie case. Respondent appea led, and the California Supreme Cour t reinstated petiti oner 's conviction over the dissent of two jus\u00ad tices. The cour t stressed that Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state cour ts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the sufciency of defendants' prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314, 71 P. 3d, at 277. The cour t then reviewed Batson, Wheeler, and those decisi ons' , and 'reasonable inference' state the same standard\"\u2014 one that is entirely consistent with Batson. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277.

Batson, the cour t held, \"per mits a cour t to require the objec tor not intent more likely than not if the chal\u00ad lenges are not explai ned. \" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71 P. 3d, at 278. The cour t opined that while this burden is it remai ns \"subst antia l.\" Ibid., 71 P. 3d, at 279. Apply ing that standard, the cour t acknowledged that the case involved the \"highly relevant\" circumst ance that a black defendant was \"charged with killing 'his White girlfriend' s child,' \" and that \"it certainly suspici ous that all three African-Amer ican prospec tive jurors were removed from the jury.\" Id., at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet petiti oner 's Batson show ing, the cour t held, consisted \"primarily of the statis\u00ad tical dispar ity of peremptory challenges between African- Amer icans and others. \" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71 P. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics were indeed \"troubl ing and, as the trial cour t stated, the questi on was close ,\" id., at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the cour t decided to defer to the trial judge' s \"carefu lly considered ruling.\" Ibid.3 We granted certio\u00ad rari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdic tion because the judg ment was not yet nal.

It con\u00ad cerns the scope of the rst of three steps this Cour t enumer\u00ad ated in Batson, which together guide trial cour ts' constitu\u00ad tional review of peremptory strikes. Those three Batson steps shou ld by now be fami liar. First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case \"by show ing that the totality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of discr iminatory purpose .\" 476 U. S., at 93-94 (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239-242 (1976)).4 Second, once the defendant has made out a prima facie case , the \"burden shifts to the State to explai n adequately the racia l exclusi on\" by offer ing permissible race-neutra l justi cati ons for the strikes. 476 U. S., at 94; see also Alexande r v. Louisiana, 405 U. S. 625, 632 (1972). Third, \"[i]f a race-neutra l explanati on is tendered, the trial cour t must then decide . . . whether the opponent of the strike purposefu l racia l discr im\u00ad ination.\" Purke tt S. 765, 767 (1995) (per curiam). The questi on before us is whether Batson permits Califor\u00ad nia to require at step one that \"the objec tor must show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory chal\u00ad lenges, if unexplai ned, were based on imper missible group bias. \" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at 280. Although we recog nize that States do have flexibi lity in formulating ap\u00ad propr iate procedures to comply Batson, we conclude that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is an inap\u00ad propr iate yardstick by which to measure the sufciency of a prima facie case. 4 An \"inference\" is genera lly understood to be a \"conclusi on reached by consider ing other facts and deduci ng a logical consequence from them. \" Black 's Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed. 1999). 545US1 Unit:$U57 [03-26-08 15:39:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN 169 Cite as: 545 U.

We explai ned: \"[A] defendant may establish l discr imination in tion of the petit jury solely on evidence concer ning the prosecutor 's exercise of pe\u00ad remptory challenges at the defendant' s trial. To estab\u00ad lish such a case , the defendant rst must show that he is a member of a cognizable racia l group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to re\u00ad move from the venire members of the defendant' s race. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute , that peremptory chal\u00ad lenges constitute a 'those to are of a mind to discr iminate .'

Rather , we remanded the case for further proceedi ngs because the trial cour t failed to demand an explanati on from the prosecutor\u2014i. e., to proceed to Batson's second step \u2014 despite the fact that the petiti oner 's evidence suppor ted as\u00ad sumed in Batson that the trial judge would have the benet of all relevant circumst ances, includi ex\u00ad planati on, before decidi ng whether it was more likely than not that the challenge was improper ly motivated. We did not intend the rst step to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge \u2014on the basis of all the facts, some of which are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty\u2014that the challenge was more likely than not the produc t of purposefu l discr imination. Instead, a defend\u00ad ant satises the of Batson's rst step by pro\u00ad ducing evidence sufcient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discr imination has occurred. Respondent, howe ver, focuses on Batson's ultimate sen\u00ad tence: \"If the trial cour prima facie , purposefu l discr imination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutra l explanati on for his action, our precedents require that petiti oner 's conviction be reversed. \" Ibid. For this to be true, respondent contends, a Batson claim must prove the ultimate facts by a prepon\u00ad derance of the evidence in the prima facie case; other wise, the argument goes, a prosecutor 's failure to respond to a prima facie case would inexpl icably entitle a defendant to judg ment as a matter of law on the basis of noth ing more than an inference that discr imination may have occurred.

The disagreements among the state-cour t judges who re\u00ad viewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecisi on of relying on judicia l specu lation to resolve plausible claims of discr imination. In this case the inference of discr imination was sufcient to invoke a comment by the trial judge \"that 'we are very close ,' \" and on review, the California Supreme Cour t acknowledged that \"it certainly looks suspici ous that all three African-Amer ican prospec tive jurors were removed from the jury.\" 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those inferences that discr imination may have oc\u00ad curred were sufcient to establish a prima facie case under Batson. The facts of this case well illustrate that California's \"more likely than not\" standard is at odds with prima facie in\u00ad quiry mandated by Batson. The judg ment of the California Supreme Cour t is therefore reversed, and the case is re\u00ad manded for further proceedi ngs not inconsistent with this opinion.

STUMPF certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the sixth circuit No. 04-637. Argued April 19, 2005 \u2014Decided June 13, 2005 Respondent Stumpf and his accompl ice Wesley committed an armed rob\u00ad bery that left Mr. Stout wounded and Mrs. Stout dead. Stumpf ad\u00ad mitted shooti ng Mr. Stout but has always denied killing Mrs. Stout. In Ohio state cour t proceedi ngs, Stumpf pleaded guilty to, among other things, aggravated murder and one of three capit al murder speci ca\u00ad tions charged in his indictment. This left Stumpf eligible for the death pena lty. In a contested pena lty hear ing before a three-judge panel, Stumpf 's principa l mitigati on arguments were that he had participated in the robbery at Wesley' s urging, that Wesley had killed Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf 's minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence . The State, howe ver, claimed that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout, and that he therefore was the principa l offender in her murder . In the alternative , the State noted that even an accompl ice can be sen\u00ad tenced to death under Ohio law if he acted with the speci c intent to cause death, and the State argued that such intent could be inferred from the circumst ances of the robbery regardless of who actually shot Mrs. Stout. The panel concluded that Stumpf was the principa l of\u00ad fender and sentenced him to death. At Wesley' s subsequent jury trial, howe ver, the State presented evidence that Wesley had admitted to shooti ng Mrs. Stout. But Wesley argued that the prosecutor had taken a contrary positi on in Stumpf 's trial, and Wesley was sentenced to life in prison with the possibi lity of parole . After Wesley' s trial, Stumpf moved to withdraw his own plea or vacate his death sentence , arguing that the evidence endorsed by the State in Wesley' s trial cast doubt on Stumpf 's conviction and sentence . This time, howe ver, the prosecutor emphasi zed other evidence conr ming Stumpf as the shooter and again raised, in the alternative , the aider-and-abettor theory . The cour t de\u00ad l District Cour t denied Stumpf habeas relief, but the Sixth Circuit reversed on two grounds. First, the Sixth Circuit found that Stumpf had not understood that speci c intent to cause death was a necessary element of the aggravated murder charge , and that his guilty plea therefore had not been know ing, volunt ary, and intelligent. Second, the cour t found that the conviction and sentence could not stand 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 176 BRADSHA W v. STUMPF Syllabus because the State had secured convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theor ies. Held: 1. The Sixth Circuit erred in concludi ng that Stumpf was uninformed of the aggravated murder charge' s speci c intent element. Whil e a guilty plea is invalid if the defendant has not been informed of the crime's elements, Stumpf 's attor neys represented at his plea hear ing that they had explai ned the elements to their client, and Stumpf con\u00ad rmed that the represent ation was true. This Cour t has never held that the judge must himself explai n a crime's elements to the defendant. Rather , constituti onal requirements may be satised where the record accurately reflec ts that the charge' s nature and the crime's elements were explai ned to the defendant by his own, competent counsel. Stumpf argues that his plea was so inconsistent with his denia l of having shot Mrs. Stout that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the aggravated murder charge' s speci c intent element. But that argument fails because Stumpf 's conviction did not require a show ing that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout. Ohio law also considers aiders and abettors who act with speci c intent to cause death liable for aggravated murder . Stumpf and Wesley entered the Stout home with guns, intend\u00ad ing to commit armed robbery , and Stumpf admitted shooti ng Mr. Stout. Taken together , these facts could show that the two men had agreed to kill both Stouts, which in turn could make both men guilty of aggravated murder regardless of who shot Mrs. Stout. Stumpf 's claim that he and his attor neys were confused about the relevance and timing of defenses that they planned to make is not suppor ted by the record. Finally, the plea' s validity may not be collatera lly attacked on the ground that Stumpf made what he now claims was a bad deal. Pp. 182-186. 2. The Sixth Circuit was also wrong to hold that prosecutor ial in\u00ad consistencies between the Stumpf and Wesley cases required voidi ng Stumpf 's guilty plea. The precise identity of the trigger man was imma\u00ad terial to Stumpf 's aggravated murder conviction, and Stumpf has never explai ned how the prosecuti on's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affec ted the know ing, volunt ary, and intelligent nature of his plea. Pp. 186-187. 3. The prosecutor 's use of allegedly inconsistent theor ies may have a more direc t effec t on Stumpf 's sentence , howe ver, for it is arguable that the sentenci ng panel' s conclusi on about his role was mater ial to its sen\u00ad tenci ng deter mination. The opinion below leaves some ambig uity as to the over lap between how the lower cour t resolved Stumpf 's due process challenge to his conviction and how it resolved his challenge to his sen\u00ad tence .

Likew ise, the parties' brieng here , and the questi on on which this Cour t granted certiorar i, largely focused on the conviction. In these circumst ances, it would be premature for this Cour t to resolve the merits of Stumpf 's sentenci ng claim before giving the Sixth Circuit the oppor tunity to consider in the rst instance the questi on of how the prosecutor 's conduc t in the Stumpf and Wesley cases related to Stumpf 's death sentence in particular.

Needing money for gas, the men stopped the car along the highway . While Edmonds waited in the car, Stumpf and Wesley walked to the home of Norman and Mary Jane Stout, about 100 yards away . Stumpf and Wesley , each concea ling a gun, talked their way into the home by telling the Stouts they needed to use the phone . Their real objec t, howe ver, was robbery: Once inside , Stumpf held the Stouts at gunpoi nt, while Wesley ransacked the house . When Mr. Stout moved toward Stumpf, Stumpf shot him twice in the head, causi ng Mr. Stout to black out. After he regai ned consci ousness, Mr. Stout heard two male voices comi ng from another room, and then four gunshots\u2014the shots that killed his wife.

Rather than proceed to trial, howe ver, Stumpf and the State worked out a plea agreement: Stumpf would plead guilty to aggravated murder and attempted aggravated mur\u00ad der, and the State would drop most of the other charges; with respec t to the aggravated murder charge , Stumpf would plead guilty to one of the three capit al speci cati ons, with the State droppi ng the other two. The plea was ac\u00ad cepted after a colloquy with the presidi ng judge , and after a hear ing in which the panel satised itself as to the factual basis for the plea. Because the capit al speci cati on to which Stumpf pleaded guilty left him eligible for the death pena lty, a contested pen\u00ad alty hear ing was held before the same three-judge panel. Stumpf 's mitigati on case was based in part on his difcu lt childhood, limited educati on, dependable work history , youth, and lack of prior serious offenses. Stumpf 's principa l argu\u00ad ment, howe ver, was that he had participated in the plot only at the urging and under the influence of Wesley , that it was Wesley who had red the fatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that Stumpf 's asser tedly minor role in the murder counseled against the death sentence . See \u00a7 2929.04(B )(6) (direc ting the l mitigati ng circum\u00ad stance , \"[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principa l offender , the degree of the offender 's partic\u00ad ipati on in the offense\"). The State, on the other hand, ar\u00ad gued that Stumpf had indeed shot Mrs. Stout. Still, while the prosecutor claimed Stumpf 's allegedly primary role in the shooti ng as a specia l reason to reject Stumpf 's mitigati on argument, the prosecutor also noted that Ohio law did not restr ict the death pena lty to those who commit murder by their own hands\u2014an accompl ice to murder could also receive *Unless other wise noted, all citations to Ohio statutes refer to the ver\u00ad sions of those statutes in effec t in 1984, at the time of the crime and trial. 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 180 BRADSHA W STUMPF Opinion of the Cour t the death pena lty, so long as he acted with the speci c intent to cause death. As a resu lt, the State argued, Stumpf de\u00ad served death even if he had not persona lly shot Mrs. Stout, because the circumst ances of the robbery prov ided a basis from which to infer Stumpf 's intent to cause death. The three-judge panel, agreei ng with the State's rst cally found that Stumpf \"was the principa l offender \" in the aggravated murder of Mrs. Stout. App. 196. Deter\u00ad mining that the aggravati ng factors in Stumpf 's case out\u00ad weighed any mitigati ng factors, the panel sentenced Stumpf to death. Afterward, Wesley was successfu lly extradited to Ohio to stand trial. His case was tried to a jury, before the same judge who had presided over the panel overseei ng Stumpf 's proceedi ngs, and with the same prosecutor . This time, how\u00ad ever, the prosecutor had new evidence: James Eastman, Wes\u00ad ley's cellmate after his extraditi on, testi ed that Wesley had admitted to ring the shots that killed Mrs. Stout. The prosecutor introduced Eastman' s testi mony in Wesley' s trial, and in his closi ng argument he argued for Eastman' s credibi l\u00ad ity and lack of motive to lie. The prosecutor claimed that Eastman' s testi mony , combi ned with and with the implausibi lity of Wesley' s own account of events, proved that Wesley was the principa l offender in Mrs. Stout' s murder\u2014and that Wesley therefore deserved to be put to death. One way Wesley countered this argument was by noting that the prosecutor had taken a contrary posi\u00ad tion in Stumpf 's trial, and that Stumpf had already been sen\u00ad tenced to death for the crime. Wesley also took the stand in his own defense , and testi ed that Stumpf had shot Mrs. Stout. In the end, the jury sentenced Wesley to life imprisonment with the possibi lity of parole after 20 years. After the Wesley trial, Stumpf, whose direc t appea l was still pendi ng in the Ohio Cour t of Appea ls, retur ned to the Cour t of Common Pleas with a moti on to withdraw his guilty plea or vacate his death sentence . Stumpf argued that 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 181 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Eastman' s testi mony that testi mony in Wesley' s trial, cast doubt upon Stumpf 's conviction and sentence . The State (represented again by the same prosecutor who had tried both Wesley' s case and Stumpf 's original case) disagreed. Accordi ng to the prose\u00ad cutor , the cour t's rst task was to decide whether the East\u00ad man testi mony was sufcient to alter the cour t's prior deter\u00ad mination that Stumpf had been the shooter . Id., at 210. Contrary to the argument he had presented in the Wesley trial, howe ver, the prosecutor now noted that Eastman' s tes\u00ad timony was belied by certain other evidence (ballistics evi\u00ad dence and Wesley' s testi mony in his own defense) conr ming Stumpf to have been the primary shooter . In the alterna\u00ad tive, the State noted as it had before that an aider-and\u00ad abettor theory might allow the death sentence to be imposed against Stumpf even if he had not shot Mrs. Stout. Although one judge specu lated during oral argument that the cour t's earlier conclusi on about Stumpf 's principa l role in the killing \"may very well have had an effec t upon\" the prior sentenci ng deter mination, ibid., the Cour t of Common Pleas denied Stumpf 's moti on in a brief summary order with\u00ad out explanati on. That order was appea led together with the original judg ment in Stumpf 's case , and the Ohio Cour t of Appea ls afrmed, as did the Ohio Supreme Cour t. State v. Stumpf , 32 Ohio St. 3d 95, 512 N. E. 2d 598 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1079 (1988). After a subsequent request for state postcon viction relief was denied by the state cour ts, Stumpf led this federa l habeas petiti on in the United States District Cour t for the Souther n District of Ohio in November 1995. The District Cour t denied Stumpf relief, but granted permissi on to appea l on four claims, includi ng the two at issue here . The United States Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit reversed, con\u00ad cludi ng that habeas relief was warranted on \"either or both\" of \"two alternative grounds. \" Stumpf v. Mitchell, 367 F. 3d 594, 596 (2004). First, the cour t deter mined 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 182 BRADSHA W v. STUMPF Opinion of the Cour t guilty plea was invalid because it had not been entered know ingly and intelligently . More precisely , the cour t con\u00ad cluded that Stumpf had pleaded guilty to aggravated murder without underst andi ng that speci c intent to cause death was a necessary element of the charge under Ohio law. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2903.01(B ) and (D). Noting that Stumpf had all along denied shooti ng Mrs. Stout, and con\u00ad sider ing those denia ls inconsistent with an informed choice to plead guilty to aggravated murder , the Cour t of Appea ls concluded that Stumpf must have entered his plea out of ignorance . Second, the cour t concluded that \"Stumpf 's due process rights were violated by the state's deliberate action in secur ing convictions of both Stumpf and Wesley for the same crime, using inconsistent theor ies.\" 367 F. 3d, at 596. This violati on, the cour t held, required setti ng aside \"both Stumpf 's plea and his sentence .\" Id., at 616. One member of the panel dissented. II Because Stumpf led his habeas petiti on before enac tment of the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A), we review his claims under the standards of the pre-AEDP A habeas statute . See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320 (1997). Moreover , because petiti oner has not ar\u00ad gued that Stumpf 's habeas claims were barred as requir ing announcement of a new rule, we do not apply the rule of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), to this case. See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994); Godinez v. Moran, 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8 (1993). A The Cour t of Appea ls concluded that Stumpf 's plea of guilty to aggravated murder was invalid because he was not aware of the speci c intent element of the charge \u2014a deter\u00ad mination we nd unsuppor table. Stumpf 's guilty plea would indeed be invalid if he had not been aware of the nature of the charges against him, includ\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 183 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ing the elements of the aggravated murder charge to which he pleaded guilty. A guilty plea operates as a waiver of im\u00ad portant rights, and is valid only if know\u00ad ingly, vant circumst ances and likely consequences. \" Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970). Where a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime's elements, this standard is not met and the plea is invalid. Henderson v. Morgan, 426 U. S. 637 (1976). But the Cour t of Appea ls erred in nding that Stumpf had not been proper ly informed before pleadi ng guilty. In Stumpf 's plea hear ing, his attor neys represented on the rec\u00ad ord that they had explai ned to their client the elements of the aggravated murder charge; Stumpf himself then con\u00ad rmed that this represent ation was true. See App. 135, 137-138. While the cour t taking a defendant' s plea is re\u00ad sponsible for ensur ing \"a record adequate for any review that may be later sought, \" Boykin v. Alabam a, 395 U. S. 238, 244 (1969) (footnote omitted), we have never held that the judge must himself explai n the elements of each charge to the de\u00ad fendant on the record. Rather , the constituti onal prerequi\u00ad sites of a valid plea be satised where the record accu\u00ad rately reflec ts that the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime were explai ned to the defendant by his own, competent counsel. Cf. Henderson, supra, at 647 (granti ng relief to a defendant unaware of the elements of his crime, but disti nguishing that case from others where \"the record cont ains either an explanati on of the charge by the trial judge , or at least a represent ation by defense counsel that the nature of the offense has been explai ned to the accused\"). Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the cour t usua lly may rely on that counsel' s assurance that the defendant has been proper ly informed of the nature and ele\u00ad ments of the charge to which he is pleadi ng guilty. Seek ing to counter this natura l inference , Stumpf argues, in essence , that his choice to plead guilty to the aggravated 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 184 BRADSHA W v. STUMPF Opinion of the Cour t murder charge was so inconsistent with his denia l of having shot the victim that he could only have pleaded guilty out of ignorance of the charge' s speci c intent requirement. But Stumpf 's asser ted inconsistency is illusory . The aggravated murder charge' s intent element did not require any show ing that Stumpf had himself shot Mrs. Stout. Rather , Ohio law considers aiders and abettors equa lly in violati on of the ag\u00ad gravated murder statute , so long as the aiding and abetti ng is done with the speci c intent to cause death. See In re Washington, 81 Ohio St. 3d 337, 691 N. E. 2d 285 (1998); State v. Scott, 61 Ohio St. 2d 155, 165, 400 N. E. 2d 375, 382 (1980). As a resu lt, Stumpf 's steadfast asser tion that he had not shot Mrs. Stout would not necessar ily have precluded him from admitti ng his speci c intent under the statute . That is particularly so given the other evidence in this case. Stumpf and Wesley had gone to the Stouts' home to\u00ad gether , carry ing to armed rob\u00ad bery . Stumpf, by his own admissi on, shot Mr. Stout in the head at close range . Taken together , these facts could show that Wesley and Stumpf had together agreed to kill both of the Stouts in order to leave no witnesses to the crime. And that, in turn, could make both men guilty of aggravated mur\u00ad der regardless of who actually killed Mrs. Stout. See ibid. Stumpf also points to aspec ts of the plea hear ing transcr ipt which he says show that both he and his attor neys were con\u00ad fused about the relevance and timing of defenses Stumpf and his attor neys had planned to make . First, at one point dur\u00ad ing the hear ing, the presidi ng judge stated that by pleadi ng guilty Stumpf would waive his trial rights and his right to testi fy in his own beha lf. Stumpf 's attor ney answered that Stumpf \"was going to respond but we have informed him that there is, after the plea, a hear ing or trial relative to the under lying facts so that he is of the belief that there will be [a] present ation of evidence .\" App. 140. The presidi ng judge responded that \"[o]f course in the sentenci ng portion of this trial you do have those rights to speak in your own 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 185 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t beha lf [and] to present on own beha lf.\" Ibid. A few moments later , there was another ex\u00ad change along similar lines, after the judge asked Stumpf whether he was \"in fact guilty of\" the aggravated murder charge and defend\u00ad ant has asked me to explai n his answer . His answer is yes. He will recite that with obviously his underst and\u00ad ing of his right to present evidence at a later time relative to his conduc t, but he'll respond to that. \"JUDGE HENDERSON: At no time am I imply ing that the defendant will not have the right to present evidence in [the] mitigati on hear ing . . . . And I'm going to ask that the defendant, himself, respond to the questi on that I asked with that underst andi ng that he has the right to present evidence in mitigati on. I'm going to ask the defendant if he is in fact guilty of the charge set forth in Count one, includi ng speci cati on one ...? \"THE DEFEND ANT: Yes, sir.\" Id., at 142. Reviewing this exchange , the Cour t of Appea ls the [S]tate's account of his actions\"\u2014that is, to show that he did not intend to kill Mrs. Stout. 367 F. 3d, at 607. But the desire to contest the State's versi on of events would not necessar ily entail the desire to contest the aggravated murder charge or any of its elements. Rather , Stumpf 's de\u00ad sire to put on evidence \"relative to the under lying facts\" and \"relative to his conduc t\" could equa lly have meant that Stumpf was eager to make his mitigati on case \u2014an inter pre\u00ad tation bolstered by the attor ney's and Stumpf 's approv ing answers after the presidi ng judge conr med that the defense could put evidence \"in mitigati on\" and in \"the sentenci ng\" Stumpf 's mitigati on case was premised on the argument that Stumpf had not shot Mrs. Stout, that was 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 186 BRADSHA W v. STUMPF Opinion of the Cour t fully consistent with his plea of guilty to aggravated murder . See supra, at 183-184. Finally, Stumpf, like the Cour t of Appea ls, relies on the percepti on that he obtained a bad bargai n by his plea\u2014that the State's droppi ng severa l nonmurder charges of the three capit al murder speci cati ons was a bad tradeoff for Stumpf 's guilty plea. But a plea' s validity may not be collatera lly attacked merely because the defendant made what turned out, in retrospec t, to be a poor deal. See Brady , 397 U. S., at 757; Mabr y v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984). Rather , the shor tcomi ngs of the deal Stumpf ob\u00ad tained cast doubt on the validity of his plea only if they show either that he made the unfavorable plea on the constituti on\u00ad ally defec tive advice of counsel, see Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 267 (1973), or that he could not have understood the terms of the bargai n he and Ohio agreed to. Though Stumpf did bring an independent claim asser ting ineffec tive assist ance of counsel, that claim is not before us in this case. And in evaluati ng the validity of Stumpf 's plea, we are reluc\u00ad tant to accord much weight to his post hoc reevaluati on of the wisdom of the bargai n. Stumpf pleaded guilty know ing that the State had copious evidence against him, includi ng the testi mony of Mr. Stout; the plea eliminated two of the three capit al speci cati ons the State could rely on in seek ing the death pena lty; and the plea allowed Stumpf to asser t his accept ance of responsibi lity as an argument in mitigati on. Under these circumst ances, the plea may well have been a know ing, volunt ary, and intelligent reac tion to a litigati on situati on that was difcu lt, to say the least. The Cour t of Appea ls erred in concludi ng that Stumpf was uninformed about the nature of the charge he pleaded guilty to, and we reverse that portion of the judg ment below . B The Cour t of Appea ls was also wrong to hold that prosecu\u00ad torial inconsistencies between the Stumpf 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 187 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t required voidi ng Stumpf 's guilty plea. Stumpf 's asser tions of inconsistency relate entirely to the prosecutor 's argu\u00ad ments about which of the two men, Wesley or Stumpf, shot Mrs. Stout. For the reasons given above , see supra, at 183- 184, the precise identity of the trigger man was immater ial to Stumpf 's conviction for aggravated murder . Moreover , Stumpf has never prov ided an explanati on of how the prose\u00ad cution's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affec ted the know ing, volunt ary, and intelligent nature of his plea. The prosecutor 's use of allegedly inconsistent theor ies may have a more direc t effec t on Stumpf 's sentence , howe ver, for it is at least arguable that the sentenci ng panel' s conclusi on about Stumpf 's principa l role in the offense was mater ial to its sentenci ng deter mination. The opinion below leaves some ambig uity as to the over lap between how the lower cour t resolved Stumpf 's due process challenge to his convic\u00ad tion, and how it resolved Stumpf 's challenge to his sentence . It is not clear whether the Cour t of Appea ls would have con\u00ad cluded that Stumpf was entitled to resentenci ng had the cour t not also considered the conviction invalid. Likew ise, the parties' brieng to this Cour t, and the questi on on which we granted certiorar i, largely focused on the lower cour t's deter mination about Stumpf 's conviction. See, e. g., Pet. for Cert. ii (requesti ng review of Stumpf 's conviction, not sen\u00ad tence); Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenge to Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on is focused on issue of conviction); Brief for Respondent 15, n. 3 (\"arg uments regardi ng Stumpf 's death sentence are not before this Cour t\"). In these circum\u00ad stances, it would be premature for this Cour t to resolve the merits of Stumpf 's sentenci ng claim, and we therefore express no opinion on whether the prosecutor 's actions amounted to a due process violati on, or whether any such violati on would have been prejudicia l. The Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals shou ld have the oppor tunity to consider , in the rst instance , the questi on of BRADSHA STUMPF Souter, J., concurr ing prosecutor 's conduc t in the Stumpf and Wesley cases re\u00ad late to Stumpf 's death sentence in particular. Accordi ngly, we vacate the portion of the judg ment below relati ng to Stumpf 's prosecutor ial inconsistency claim, and we remand the case for further proceedi ngs consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurr ing. I join the opinion of the Cour t and add this word to explai n the issue that I underst and we are remandi ng for further considerati on. As the Cour t notes in its opinion, although respondent John Stumpf challenged both his conviction and his death sentence , his attack on the sentence was not always disti nct from the issue raised about the conviction. I underst and Stumpf to claim that it violates the basic due process standard, barr ing fundament ally unfair procedure , to allow his death sentence to stand in the aftermath of three positi ons taken by the State: (1) at Stumpf 's sentenci ng hear\u00ad ing; (2) at the trial of Stumpf 's codefendant, Clyde Wesley; and (3) in response to Stumpf 's moti on to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the State's positi on at the Wesley trial. At the hear ing on Stumpf 's sentence , the State argued that he was the trigger man, and it urged considerati on of that fact as a reason to impose a death sentence . App. 186, 188-189. The trial cour t found that Stumpf had pulled the trigger and did sentence him to death, though it did not state that nding Stumpf to be the shooter was dispositive in deter mining the sentence . App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a. After the sentenci ng proceedi the State tried the codefendant, Wes\u00ad ley, and on the basis of testi mony from a new witness argued that Wesley was in fact the trigger man, App. 282, and shou ld be sentenced to death. The new witness was apparently un\u00ad convincing to the jury, which in any event was informed that Stumpf had already been sentenced to death for the crime; the jury rejected the speci cati on that PAGES PGT: OPIN 189 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Souter, J., concurr ing trigger man, and it recommended a sentence of life, not death. Stumpf then challenged his death sentence (along with his conviction) on the basis of the prosecuti on's positi on in the Wesley case. In response , the State did not repudiate the positi on it had taken in the codefendant' s case , or explai n that it had made a mist ake there . Instead, it merely dis\u00ad missed the testi mony of the witness it had vouched for at Wesley' s trial, id., at 125, and maintained that Stumpf 's death sentence shou ld stand for some or all of the reasons it originally argued for its impositi on. At the end of the day, the State was on record as maintaining that Stumpf and Wesley shou ld both be executed on the ground that each was the trigger man, when it was undisputed that only one of them could have been. Stumpf 's claim as I underst and it is not a challenge to the evidentiary basis for arguing for the death pena lty in either case; nor is it a claim that the prosecuti on deliberately de\u00ad ceived or attempted to deceive either trial cour t, as in Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935) (per curiam); nor does it implicate the rule that inconsistent jury verdic ts may be enforced, United States v. Powell, 469 U. S. 57 (1984); Dunn v. United States, 284 U. S. 390 (1932). As I see it, Stumpf 's argument is simply that a death sentence may not be allowed to stand when it was imposed in response to a factual claim that the State necessar ily contradic ted in sub\u00ad sequently arguing for a death sentence in the case of a co\u00ad defendant. Stumpf 's positi on was anticipated by Justice Stevens 's observati on 10 years ago that \"serious questi ons are raised when the sovereig n itself takes inconsistent po\u00ad sitions in two separate criminal proceedi ngs against two of its citizens, \" and that \"[t]he heightened need for reliabil\u00ad ity in capit al cases only underscores the grav ity of those questi ons . . . .\" Jacobs v. Scott, 513 U. S. 1067, 1070 (1995) (citations and inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Justice Stevens 's statement in turn echoed the more genera l one expressed by Justice Suther land in Berger v. United States, 545US1 Unit:$U58 [03-26-08 15:41:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN 190 BRADSHA W v. STUMPF Thomas, J., concurr ing 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935), that the State's interest in winning some point in a given case is transcended by its interest \"that justice shall be done .\" Ultimately , Stumpf 's argument appears to be that sustaining a death sentence in circum\u00ad stances like those here resu lts in a sentenci ng system that invites the death pena wantonly and . S. 764, 774 (1990) (quoti ng Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewar t, Powel l, and Stevens, JJ.); inter nal quo\u00ad tation marks omitted). If a due process violati on is found in the State's mainte\u00ad nance of such inconsistent positi ons, there will be remedia l questi ons. May the death sentence stand if the State de\u00ad clines to repudiate its inconsistent positi on in the ant's case? Would it be sufcient simply to reexami ne the original sentence and if so, which party shou ld have the bur\u00ad den of persuasi on? If more would be required, would a de novo sentenci ng hear ing sufce? Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, concurr ing. I join the Cour t's opinion. As the Cour t notes, the State has not argued that Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), forecloses Stumpf 's claim that the prosecuti on's present ation of inconsistent theor ies violated his right to due process. Ante, at 182. With certain narrow excepti ons, basis of \"new\" rules of constituti onal law established after their convictions become nal. 489 U. S., at 310 (plu\u00ad rality opinion). This Cour t has never hinted, much less held, that the Due Process Clause prevents a State from prosecuti ng defendants based on inconsistent theor ies. Moreover , it is \"[a] threshold questi on in every habeas case . . . whether the cour t is obligated to apply the Teague rule to the defendant' s claim,\" and \"if PAGES PGT: OPIN 191 Cite as: 545 U. S. 175 (2005) Thomas, J., concurr ing that the defendant seeks the benet of a new rule of constitu\u00ad tional law, the cour t must apply Teague before consider ing the merits of the claim.\" Horn v. Banks , 536 U. S. 266, 271 (2002) (per curiam) (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The State also has not argued that Stumpf procedura lly de\u00ad faulted his due process claim, even though it appears that Stumpf never presented this argument to the Ohio cour ts. Stumpf did not even raise the inconsistent-theor ies claim in his rst federa l habeas lings. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 134a -140a. Instead, the District Cour t raised the issue for Stumpf sua sponte, and ordered supplement al brieng on the point. See App. 97-98. The Cour t's opinion does not pre\u00ad clude the State from advanci ng either of these procedura l defenses on remand in suppor t of Stumpf 's death sentence . Moreover , I agree with the Cour t that \"Stumpf has never prov ided an explanati on of how the prosecuti on's postplea use of inconsistent arguments could have affec ted the know\u00ad ing, volunt ary, and intelligent nature of his plea. \" Ante, at 187. Similar reasoni ng appl ies to Stumpf 's sentence . Stumpf equa lly has never explai ned how the prosecuti on's use of postsentence inconsistent arguments\u2014wh ich were based on evidence unavai lable until after Stumpf was sen\u00ad tenced\u2014 could have affec ted the reliability or procedura l fair\u00ad ness of his death sentence . At most, the evidence and purportedly inconsistent theory presented at Wesley' s trial would constitute newly discovered evidence casti ng doubt on the reliability of Stumpf 's death sentence , a sort of claim that our precedents and this Nati on's traditi ons have long foreclosed, see Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 408-417 (1993); id., at 427-428 (Scalia, J., concurr ing). The Bill of Rights guarantees vigorous adversar ial testi ng of guilt and innocence and conviction only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES I, LTD., et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the federal circuit No. 03-1237. Argued April 20, 2005 \u2014Decided June 13, 2005 It is not \"an act of [patent ] infringement . . . or impor States a patented inventi on . . . solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submissi on of informati on under a Federa l law which regulates the... use...o fdrugs.\" 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(e)(1). The Federa l Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) is such a law. Under the FDCA, a drugmaker must submit research data to the Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) in an investigati onal new drug appl ica\u00ad tion (IND ) when seek ing author ization to conduc t human clinical trials, and in a new drug appl icati on (ND A) when seek ing author ization to market a new drug. Respondents led a patent-i nfringement suit, claiming, inter alia, that petiti oner had willfully infringed their patents by supply ing respondents' RGD peptides to other defendants for use in precl inical research. Petitioner answered, among other things, that \u00a7 271(e)(1) exempted its actions from infringement. The jury found oth\u00ad erwise and awarded damages. In post-tr ial moti ons, the District Cour t afrmed the jury' s award and denied petiti oner 's moti on for judg ment as a matter of law. The Federa l Circuit afrmed that denia l, nding that \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s safe harbor did not apply . It reversed the District Cour t's refusa l to modi fy the damages award and remanded for further proceedi ngs. Held: The use of patented compounds in precl inical studies is protec ted under \u00a7 271(e)(1) at least as long as there is a reasonable basis to believe that the compound tested could be the subjec t of an FDA submissi on and the exper iments will produce the types of informati on relevant to an IND or NDA. The statutory text makes clear that \u00a7 271(e)(1) pro\u00ad vides a wide berth for the use of patented drugs in activities related to the federa l regulatory process, includi ng uses reasonably related to the development and submissi on of any informati on under the FDCA. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Med tronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661, 665-669. This necessar ily includes precl inical studies, both those pertaining to a drug's safety in humans and those related to, e. g., a drug's efcacy and mechanism of action. Additi onally, \u00a7 271(e)(1) exempts from infringement the use of patented compounds in precl inical research, even when the patented compounds do not themselves become the subjec t of an FDA submissi on. 545US1 Unit:$U59 [03-26-08 LIFESCIENCES I, LTD. Syllabus The \"reasonable relati on\" be read s activities leadi ng to FDA approva l for all drugs to those activities leadi ng to FDA approva l for gener ic drugs. Similarly, the use of a patented compound in exper iments not themselves included in a \"submissi on of informati on\" to the FDA does not, standi ng alone, render the use infringing. Because the Federa l Circuit appl ied the wrong standard in rejecting petiti oner 's challenge to the jury' s nding that petiti oner failed to show that its activities were covered by \u00a7 271(e)(1), the trial evidence has yet to be reviewed under the standard set forth in the jury instruction, and developed in more detail here .

As an initia l matter , we think it apparent from the statu\u00ad tory text that \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s exempti on from infringement ex\u00ad tends to all uses of patented inventi ons that are reasonably related to the development and submissi on of any informa\u00ad tion under the FDCA. Cf. Eli Lilly, 496 U. S., at 665-669 (declining to limit \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s exempti on from infringement to submissi ons under particular statutory prov isions that regulate drugs). This necessar ily includes precl inical stud\u00ad ies of patented compounds that are appropr iate for submis\u00ad sion to the FDA in the regulatory process. There is simply no room in the statute for excludi ng certain informati on from the exempti on on the basis of the phase of research in which it is developed or the particular submissi on in which it could be included.6 6Although the Cour t of Appea ls' opinion suggests in places that \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s exempti on from infringement is limited to research con\u00ad ducted in clinical trials, see 331 F. 3d, at 866, we do not underst and it to have adopted that positi on. The Cour t of Appea ls recog nized that in\u00ad formati on included in an IND would come within \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s safe har\u00ad bor. Ibid. Because an IND must be led before clinical trials may begin, such informati on would necessar ily be developed Cite as: 545 U.

In respondents' view, precl inical studies related to phar macok inetics, and phar macolog y are not reasonably included in an IND or an NDA, and are therefore outside the scope of the exempti on. We do not underst and the FDA's interest in informati on gathered in precl inical studies to be so constrai ned. To be sure , its regulations prov ide that the agency' s \"primary ob\u00ad jectives in reviewing an IND are ...t o assure the safety and rights of subjec ts,\" 21 CFR \u00a7 312.22( a) (2005), but it does not follow that the FDA is not interested in reviewing infor\u00ad mati on related to other charac teristics of a drug. To the contrary , the FDA requires that appl icants include in an ical, toxicolog ical, phar maco\u00ad kinetic, and the drug in animals. See \u00a7 312.23( a)(5); U. S.

The pri\u00ad mary (and, in some cases, only) way in which a drugmaker may obtain such informati on is through precl inical in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover , the FDA does not evaluate the safety of pro\u00ad posed clinical exper iments in a vacuum; rather , as the statute and regulations reflec t, it asks whether the proposed clinica l trial poses an \"unreasonable risk.\" 21 U.

Rather , such studies must in\u00ad clude \"a brief statement of the reason for the .\" Ibid. 's prov ision of the patented RGD peptides for research at Scripps appeared to rest on two somewhat related propositi ons.

INTEGRA LIFESCIENCES I, LTD. Opinion of the Cour t the intent to develop a particular drug or a reasonable belief that the compound will cause the sort of physi ological effec t the researcher intends to induce , is surely not \"reasonably related to the development and submissi on of informati on\" to the FDA. It does not follow from this, howe ver, that \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s exempti on are not ulti\u00ad mately the subjec t of an FDA submissi on or (2) use of pat\u00ad ented compounds in exper iments that are not ultimately submitted to the FDA. Under certain conditi ons, we think the exempti on is sufciently broad to protec t the use of pat\u00ad ented compounds in both situati ons. As to the rst propositi on, it disregards the reality that, even at late stages in the development of a new drug, scien\u00ad tic testi ng is a process of trial and error . In the vast ma\u00ad jority of cases, neither the drugmaker nor its scientists have any way of know ing whether an initia lly promisi ng candidate will prove successfu l over a battery of exper iments. That is the reason they conduc Thus, to as of did, not to protec t re\u00ad search conduc ted on patented compounds for which an IND is not ultimately led is effec tively to limit assurance of ex\u00ad empti on to the activities necessary to seek approva l of a ge\u00ad neric drug: One can know at the outset that a particular com\u00ad pound will be the subjec t of an eventua l appl icati on to the FDA only if the active ingredient in the drug being tested is identica l to that in a drug that has already been approved. The statutory text does not require such a resu lt. Con\u00ad gress did not limit \u00a7 271(e)(1)' s safe harbor to the develop\u00ad ment of informati on for inclusi on in a submissi on to the FDA; nor did it create an exempti on appl icable only to the research relevant to ling an ANDA for approva l of a gener ic drug. Rather , it exempted from infringement all uses of patented compounds \"reasonably related\" to the process of developi ng informati on for submissi on under any federa regulating the manufac ture , use, or PAGES PGT: OPIN 207 Cite as: 545 U. S. 193 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Lilly, 496 U. S., at 674. We decline to read the \"reasonable relati on\" requirement so narrowly as to render s stated protec tion of activities leadi ng to FDA approva l for all drugs illusory . Proper ly constr ued, \u00a7 271(e)(1) leaves ad\u00ad equate space for exper iment ation and failure on the road to regulatory approva l: At least where a drugmaker has a rea\u00ad sonable basis for believing that a patented compound may work, through a particular biological process, to produce a particular physi ological effec t, and uses the compound in re\u00ad search that, if successfu l, would be appropr iate to include in a submissi on to the FDA, that use is \"reasonably related\" to the \"development and law.\" \u00a7 271(e)(1). For similar the use of a patented compound in exper iments that are not themselves included in a \"submis\u00ad sion of informati on\" to the FDA does not, standi ng alone, render the use infringing. The relati onsh ip of the use of a patented compound in a particular exper iment to the \"devel\u00ad opment and submissi on of informati on\" to the FDA does not become more attenuated (or less reasonable) simply because the data from that exper iment are left out of the submissi on that is ultimately passed along to the FDA. Moreover , many of the uncer tainties that exist with respec t to the se\u00ad lection of a speci c drug exist as well with respec t to the decisi on of what research to include in an IND or NDA. As a District Cour t has observed, \"[I]t will not always be clear to parties setti ng out to seek FDA approva l for their new produc t exac tly which kinds of informati on, and in what quantities, it will take to win that agency' s approva l.\" In\u00ad aff'd, (CA Fed. 1993). This is espe\u00ad cially true at the precl inical stage of drug approva l. FDA regulations prov ide only that \"[t]he amount of informati on on a particular drug that must be submitted in an IND . . . depends upon such factors as the novelty of the drug, the extent to which it has been studied previously , the known or 545US1 Unit:$U59 [03-26-08 15:48:41] 208 MERCK KG v.

We thus agree with the Gover nment that the use of patented compounds in precl inical studies is protec ted under \u00a7 271(e)(1) as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the exper iments will produce \"the types of informati on that are relevant to an IND or NDA.\" Brief for United States as Ami cus Curiae 23 (emphasis deleted). * * * Before the Cour t of Appea ls, petiti oner challenged the suf\u00ad of the evidence suppor ting the jury' s nding that it failed to show that \"all of the accused activities are covered by [\u00a7271(e)(1)]. \" App. 62a.

AUSTIN et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the sixth circuit No. 04-495. Argued March 30, 2005 \u2014Decided June 13, 2005 \"Super max\" prisons are ic\u00ad tive conditi ons, desig ned to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the genera l prison popu lation. Their use has increased in recent years, in part as a response to the rise in prison gangs and prison vio\u00ad lence . Ohio opened its only Super max facility, the Ohio State Peniten\u00ad tiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its maxi mum-secur ity prisons. In the OSP almost every aspec t of an inmate' s life is control led and monitored. Incarcerati on there is synonymous with extreme isolati on. Oppor tuni\u00ad ties for visitation are rare and are always conduc ted through glass walls. Inmates are depr ived of almost any environment al or sensory stimuli and of almost all human cont act. Placement at OSP is for an inde nite period, limited only by an inmate' s sentence . Inmates other wise eligi\u00ad ble for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP . When OSP rst became operati onal, no ofcia policy gover ning place\u00ad ment there was in effec t, and the procedures used to assig n inmates to the facility were inconsistent and unde ned, resu lting in haphazard and erroneous placements. In an effor t to establish guidel ines for the selec\u00ad tion and classi cati inmates, Ohio its Policy 111-07. Rele vant here are two versi ons Policy\" and the \"New Policy.\" Because assig nment problems persisted after the Old Policy took effec t, Ohio promu lgated the New Policy to prov ide more guidance regardi ng the factors to be considered in placement decisi ons and to afford inmates more procedura l protec tion against erroneous placement. Under the New Policy, a prison ofcia l conduc ts a classi \u00ad cation review either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e. g., organi zed crime, or (2) during the incarcerati on if the inmate engages in speci ed conduc t, e. g., leads a prison gang . The New Policy also prov ides for a three-tier review process after a recommendati on that an inmate be placed in OSP . Among other things, the inmate must receive notice of the factual basis leadi ng to considerati on for OSP placement and a fair oppor tunity for rebutt al at a hear ing, although he may not call witnesses. In additi on, the inmate is invited to submit objec tions prior to the nal level of re\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 210 WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Syllabus view. Although a subsequent reviewer may over turn an afrmative recommendati on for OSP placement at any level, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process ter\u00ad minates. Ohio also prov ides for a placement review within 30 days of an inmate' s initia l assig nment to OSP , and annua l review thereaf ter. A class of current and former OSP inmates led this suit for equit able relief under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Old Policy, which was then in effec t, violated the Fourteenth Amendment' s Due Process Clause . On the eve of trial, Ohio promu lgated its New Policy and represented that it cont ained the procedures to be followed in the future . After extensive evidence was presented, the District Cour t made ndings and conclusi ons and issued a detailed remedia l order . First, relying on Sand in v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, the cour t found that inmates have a liberty interest in avoidi ng assig nment to OSP . Second, it found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford many of them notice and an adequate oppor tunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give them sufcient notice of the grounds for their retenti on at OSP; and failing to give them tunity to un\u00ad derst and the reasoni evidence used to retain them at OSP . Third, it held that, although the New Policy prov ided more procedura l safeg uards than the Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedura l due process requirements. The cour t therefore ordered modi cati ons modi cati ons nar\u00ad in recommendi ng assig n\u00ad ment l modi cati The Sixth Circuit afrmed the District Cour t's conclusi on that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoidi ng OSP placement and upheld the lower cour t's procedura l modi cati ons in their entirety aside the far-reach ing subst antive modi cati ons on the ground they exceeded the District Cour t's author ity. Held: The procedures by which Ohio's New Policy classi es prisoners for placement at its Super max facility prov ide prisoners with sufcient pro\u00ad tection to comply with the Due Process Clause Pp. 221-230. (a) Inmates have a at OSP . Such an interest may arise from state policies or regulations, subjec t to the impor tant limitations set forth in Sand in, which requires a deter mination whether OSP assig nment \"imposes on the inmate in relati on to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" 515 U. S., at 483. The Cour t is satised that assig nment to OSP imposes such a hardsh ip compared to any plausible basel ine from which to measure the Ohio prison system. For an inmate placed in OSP , almost all 545 U. S. 209 (2005) Syllabus even to the point that conversati on is not permitted from cell to cell; his cell's light may be dimmed, but is on for 24 hours; and he may exercise only one hour per day in a small indoor room. Save perhaps for the especia lly severe limitations on all human cont act, these conditi ons likely would apply to most solitary con nement facilities, but here there are two added components. First is the durati on. Unlike the 30-day placement in segregated con nement at issue in Sand in, placement at OSP is inde nite and, after an initia l 30-day review, is reviewed just annua lly. Second is that placement disqua lies an other wise eligible inmate for parole considerati on. Taken together these conditi ons im\u00ad pose an and (b) The New sufcient to satisfy due process. Evaluati ng the sufciency of particular prison procedures requires con\u00ad siderati on of three disti nct factors: (1) the private interest that will be affec ted by the ofcia l action; (2) the risk of an erroneous depr ivati on of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additi onal or substitute procedura l safeg includi ng the func tion involved sca l admi nistrative burdens that additi onal or substitute procedura l require\u00ad ment would entail. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335. Apply ing those factors demonstrates that Ohio's New Policy prov ides a sufcient level of process. First, the inmate' s interest in avoidi ng erroneous placement at OSP , while more than minimal, must nonetheless be evalu\u00ad ated within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtail\u00ad ment of liberties. The liberty of prisoners in lawfu l con nement is cur\u00ad tailed by denition, so their procedura l protec tions are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from all con nement. Second, the risk of an erroneous placement is minimized by the New Policy's requirements. Ohio prov ides multiple levels of re\u00ad view for any decisi on recommendi ng OSP placement, with power to over turn the recommendati on at each level. In additi on, Ohio reduces the risk of erroneous placement by prov iding for a placement review within 30 days of an inmate' s initia l assig nment to OSP . Notice of the factual basis for a decisi on and a fair oppor tunity for rebutt al are among the most impor depr ivati ons. See, e. g., Greenho ltz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 15. Third, in the context of prison management and the speci c circumst ances of this case nant considerati on. Ohio's rst obligati on must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the publ ic, and the prisoners themselves. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 473. Prison secur ity, imper iled by the brutal reality 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Syllabus backdrop of the State's interest. Another component of Ohio's interest is the problem of scarce resources. The high cost of maintaining an inmate at OSP would make it difcu lt to fund more effec tive educati on and lives. Cour ts must give subst antia l decisi ons before additi correc tional ofcia ls a prisoner has engaged in dis\u00ad ruptive behav ior. Were Ohio required to prov ide other attributes of an adversary hear ing before order ing transfer to OSP , both the State's immediate objec tive of control ling the prisoner and its greater objec tive of control ling the prison could be defeated. Where , as here , the inquiry draws more on the exper ience of prison admi nistrators, and where the State's interest implicates the safety of other inmates and prison person\u00ad nel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenho ltz and Hewitt prov ide the appropr iate model. If an inmate were to demon\u00ad strate that the New Policy did not in prac tice operate in the fashion descr ibed, any cognizable injury could be the subjec t of an appropr iate future challenge . In of the foregoi ng, the procedura l modi cati ons ordered by the District Cour t and afrmed by the Sixth Circuit were in error .

See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 2. In 1998, Ohio opened its only Super max facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its maxi mum\u00ad secur ity prisons. OSP has the capacity to house up to 504 inmates in single-inmate cells and is desig ned to \" 'separate the most predatory and dangerous prisoners from the rest of the... genera l [prison] popu lation.' Ohio 2002) of R. Wilkinson, at OSP are more restr ictive than any other form of incarcerati on in Ohio, includi ng conditi ons on its death row or in its admi nistrative control units. The latter are themselves a highly restr ictive form of solitary con ne\u00ad ment. See Austin I, supra, at 724-725, and n. 5 (citing Ohio Admin. Code \u00a7 5120-9-13 (2001) (resci nded 2004)). In OSP almost every aspec t of an inmate' s life is control led and moni\u00ad tored. Inmates must remai n in their cells, which measure 7 by 14 feet, for 23 hours per day. A light remai ns on in the cell at all times, though it is someti mes dimmed, and an in\u00ad mate who attempts to shield the light to sleep is subjec t to further discipl ine. During the one hour per day that an in\u00ad mate may leave his cell, access is limited to one of two indoor recreati on cells. Incarcerati on at OSP is synonymous with extreme isola\u00ad tion. In contrast to any other Ohio prison, includi ng any segregati on unit, OSP cells have solid metal doors with metal strips along their sides and bottoms which prevent conversati on or communicati on with other inmates. All meals are taken alone in the inmate' s cell instead of in a common eating area. Oppor tunities for visitation are rare and in all events are conduc ted through glass walls. It is fair to say OSP inmates are depr ived of almost any environ\u00ad ment al or sensory stimuli and of almost all human cont act. Aside from the severity of the conditi ons, placement at OSP is for an inde nite period of time, limited only by an 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite as: 209 (2005) 215 Opinion of the Cour t inmate' s sentence .

In\u00ad mates other wise eligible for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP . 189 F. Supp . 2d, at 728. Placement at OSP is deter mined in the following manner: Upon enter ing the prison system, all Ohio inmates are as\u00ad signed a numer ical secur ity classi cati on from level 1 through level 5, with 1 the lowest secur ity risk and 5 the highest. See Brief for Petitioners 7. The initia l secur ity classi cati on is based on numerous factors (e. g., the nature of the under lying offense , criminal history , or gang aflia\u00ad tion) but is subjec t to modi cati on at any time during the inmate' s prison term if, for instance , he engages in miscon\u00ad duct or is deemed a secur ity risk. Ibid. Level 5 inmates are placed in OSP , and levels 1 through 4 inmates are placed at lower secur ity facilities throughout the State. Ibid. Ohio concedes that when OSP rst became operati onal, the procedures used to assig n inmates to the facility were incon\u00ad sistent and unde ned. For a time, no ofcia l policy gover n\u00ad ing placement was in effec t. See Austin I, supra, at 726- 727. Haphazard placements were not uncommon, and some indiv idua ls who did not pose high-secur ity risks were desig\u00ad nated, nonetheless, for OSP .

The New Policy appears to operate as follows: A classi cati on review for OSP placement can occur either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was con\u00ad victed of certain offenses, e. g., organi zed crime, or (2) during the term of incarcerati on if an inmate engages in speci ed conduc t, e. g., leads a prison gang . App. 42-43. The review process begins when a prison ofcia l prepares a \"Secur ity Designation Long Form\" (Long Form). Id., at 20. This three-page form details matters such as the inmate' s recent violence , escape attempts, gang afliation, under lying of\u00ad fense , and other pertinent details. Id., at 20, 38-45. A three-member Classi cation Committee (Committee) convenes to review the proposed classi cati on and to hold a hear ing. At least 48 hours before the hear ing, the inmate is prov ided with written notice summar izing the conduc t or offense trigger ing the review. Id., at 22, 58. At the time of notice , the inmate also has access to the Long Form, which details why the review was initiated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-17. The inmate may attend the hear ing, may \"offer any pertinent infor mati on, explanation and/or objections to [OSP ] placement, \" and may submit a written statement. App. 22. He may not call witnesses. If the Committee does not recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. Id., at 62, 65. See also Brief for Peti\u00ad tioners 9.

If, after reviewing CCR , the warden (or the desig nated concludes that OSP is inappropr iate, the process terminates and the inmate is not placed in OSP . If the warden agrees, he indicates his approva l on the CCR , prov ides his reasons, and forwards CCR to the Bureau of Classi cati on (Bureau) for a nal decisi on. Id., at 64. (The Bureau is a body of Ohio prison ofcia ls vested with nal decisi onmak ing author ity over all Ohio in\u00ad mate assig nments.) The annot ated CCR is served upon the inmate , notifying him of the Committee' s and warden' s rec\u00ad ommendati ons and reasons. Id., at 65. The inmate has 15 days to le any objec tions with the Bureau. Ibid. After the 15-day period, the Bureau reviews the CCR and makes a nal deter mination.

We refer to the class of plaintiff inmates, respondents here , col\u00ad lectively as \"the inmates. \" We refer to prison ofcia ls, petiti oners here , as \"Ohio.\" The inmates' complai nt alleged that Ohio's Old Policy, which was in effec t at the time the suit was brought, violated due process. In additi on the inmates brought a claim that certain conditi ons at OSP violated the Eighth Amendment' s ban on cruel and unusua l punishments, but that claim was settled in the District Cour t. The extent to which the set\u00ad tlement resolved the prac tices that were the subjec t of the inmates' Eighth Amendment claim is unclear but, in any event, that issue is not before us. The inmates' suit sought declaratory and injunc tive relief. On the eve of trial Ohio promu lgated its New Policy and represented that it con\u00ad tained the procedures to be followed in the future . The Dis\u00ad trict Cour t and Cour t of Appea ls evaluated the adequacy of the New Policy, and it therefore forms the basis for our deter mination here . After an 8-day trial includi tes\u00ad timony t made nd\u00ad ings and conclusi ons and issued a detailed remedia l order . First, relying on this Cour t's decisi on in Sand in v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995), the District Cour t found that the in\u00ad mates have a liberty interest in avoidi ng assig 2d, at 738-740. Second, the District Cour t found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford a large number of them notice and an ade\u00ad quate oppor tunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give inmates sufcient notice of the grounds serv ing as the basis for their retenti on at OSP; and failing to give the inmates sufcient oppor S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t dence used to retain them at OSP . Id., at 749. Third, the District Cour t held that, although Ohio's New Policy pro\u00ad vided more procedura l safeg uards than its Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedura l due process re\u00ad quirements. Id., at 736, 750-754. a separate order it di\u00ad rected extensive modi cati ons 1024 (ND Ohio 2002). The the District Cour t ordered to Ohio's New Policy included both subst antive and procedura l re\u00ad forms. The former narrowed the grounds that Ohio could consider in recommendi ng of drugs in small amounts, accordi ng to the District Cour t, could not serve as the basis for an OSP assig nment. Id., at 1028. The following are some of the procedura l modi cati ons the District Cour t ordered: (1) Finding that the notice prov isions of Ohio's New Policy were inadequate , the District Cour t ordered Ohio to prov ide the inmates with an exhaustive list of grounds believed to justi fy placement at OSP and a summary of all evidence upon which the Committee would rely. Matters not so identi ed, the District Cour t ordered, could not be considered by the Committee . Id., at 1026. (2) The District Cour t supplemented the inmate' s oppor\u00ad tunity to appear before the Committee and to make an oral or written statement by order ing Ohio to allow inmates to present document ary evidence and call witnesses before the Committee , prov ided that doing so would not be undu ly haz\u00ad ardous or burdensome . The District Cour t further ordered that Ohio must attempt to secure the participati on of any witness housed within the prison system. Id., at 1026 -1027. (3) Finding the New Policy's prov ision of a brief state\u00ad ment of reasons for a recommendati on of OSP placement inadequate , the District Cour t ordered the Committee to summar ize all evidence suppor ting its recommendati on. Id., at 1027. Likew ise, the District Cour t ordered the the Cour all grounds\" justi \"vag ue,\" or \"boilerplate lan\u00ad guage ,\" and must be delivered to the inmate within ve days. Id., at 1027 -1028. (4) The District Cour t supplemented the New Policy's 30\u00ad day and annua l review processes, order ing Ohio to notify the inmate twice per year both in writing and orally of his prog\u00ad ress toward a speci c conduc t is nec\u00ad essary for that prisoner to be reduced from Level 5 and the amount of time it will take before [Ohio] reduce[ s] the inmate' Id., at 1028. Ohio appea led. First, it maintained that the inmates lacked a constituti onally protec ted liberty interest in avoid\u00ad ing placement at OSP . Second, it argued that, even assum\u00ad ing a liberty interest, its New Policy prov ides constitu\u00ad tionally adequate procedures and thus the District t's modi cati ons were unnecessary . The Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit afrmed the District Cour t's conclusi on that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoidi ng placement at OSP . 372 F. 3d 346, 356 (2004). The Cour t of Appea ls also afrmed the District Cour t's procedura l modi cati ons in their entirety . Id., at 359-360. Finally, it set aside the District of the District Cour t's au\u00ad thor ity. This last aspec t of the Cour t of Appea ls' ruling is not the subjec t of review in this Cour t. We granted certiorar i to consider what process an inmate must be afforded under the Due Process Clause when he is considered for placement at OSP . 543 U. S. 1032 (2004). For reasons discussed below , we conclude that the inmates have a protec ted liberty interest in avoidi ng assig nment at OSP . We further hold that the procedures set forth in the New Policy are sufcient to satisfy the Constituti on's re\u00ad quirements; S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t tions ordered by the District Cour t and afrmed by the Cour t of Appea ls were in error . III Withdraw ing from the positi on taken in the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals, Ohio in its briefs to this Cour t conceded that the in\u00ad mates have a liberty interest in avoidi ng at Brief for Petitioners i. The United States, suppor ting Ohio as amicus curiae, disagrees with Ohio's concessi on and argues that the inmates have no lib\u00ad erty interest in avoidi ng assig with more restr ictive conditi ons of con nement. See Brief for United States 10. At oral argument Ohio initia lly adhered to its earlier concessi on, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, but when pressed, the State backtracked. See id., at 6-7. We need reach the questi on of what process is due only if the inmates establish a constituti onally protec ted liberty interest, so it is appropr iate to address this threshold questi on at the outset. The Fourteenth Amendment' s Due Process Clause pro\u00ad tects persons against depr ivati ons of life, liberty, or prop\u00ad erty; and those who seek to invoke its procedura l protec tion must establish that one of these interests is at stake. A liberty interest may arise from the Constituti on itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the word \"liberty,\" see, e. g., Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480, 493-494 (1980) (liberty interest in avoidi ng involunt ary psych iatric treatment and transfer to ment al instituti on), or it may arise from an expec tation or interest created by state laws or policies, see, e. g., Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 556-558 (1974) (liberty interest in avoidi ng withdrawa l of state-created system of good-ti me credits). We have held that the Constituti on itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoidi ng transfer to more adverse conditi ons of con nement. Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 225 (1976) (no liberty interest arising from Due Process Clause itself in transfer from low- to maxi mum-secur ity 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES WILKINSON v. Opinion of the Cour t prison because \"[c]on nement in any of the State's institu\u00ad tions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has author ized the State to impose\"). We have also held, howe ver, that a liberty interest in avoidi ng particular conditi ons of con nement may arise from state policies or regulations, subjec t to the impor tant limitations set forth in Sand in v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995). Sand in involved prisoners' claims to procedura l due proc\u00ad ess protec tion before placement in segregated con nement for 30 days, imposed as discipl ine for disruptive behav ior. Sand in observed that some of our earlier cases, Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460 (1983), in particular, had employed a methodolog y for identi fying state-created liberty interests that a particular [prison] \"the nature of the depr ivati on.\" Sand in, 515 U. S., at 481. In Sand in, we criticized this methodolog y as creati ng a disincentive for States to lgate proce\u00ad for prison and as the federa l cour ts in the day-to-day management of prisons. Id., at 482-483. For these reasons, we abrogated the methodolog y of parsi ng the lang uage of particular regulations. \"[T]he search for a negative implicati on from mandatory lang uage in prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concer ns underg irding the liberty protec ted by the Due Process Clause . The time has come to retur n to the due process principles we believe were correc tly es\u00ad tablished in and appl ied Meachum. Fol\u00ad lowing Wolff, tain circumst ances create liberty interests which are protec ted by the Due Process Clause . But these inter\u00ad ests will genera lly be limited to freedom from restrai nt which, while not exceedi ng the sentence in such an unex\u00ad pected manner as to give rise to protec tion by the Due Process Clause of its own force , nonetheless imposes atypical and signicant hardsh ip PGT: OPIN 223 Cite S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t tion to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 483-484 (citations and footnote omitted). After Sand in, it is clear that the touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of a protec ted, state-created liberty inter\u00ad est of lang uage of regulations regardi ng those conditi ons but the nature of those conditi ons themselves \"in relati on to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 484. Apply ing this rened inquiry , Sand in found no liberty in\u00ad terest protec ting against a 30-day assig nment to segregated con nement because it did not \"present a dramatic depar ture from the basic conditi ons of [the inmate' s] sentence .\" Id., at 485. We noted, for example , that inmates in the genera \"signicant amounts of of con nement in discipl inary seg\u00ad regati on was not excessive . Id., at 486. We did not nd, moreover , the shor t durati on of segregati on to work a major disruption in the inmate' s environment. Ibid. The Sand in standard requires us to deter mine if assig n\u00ad ment to OSP \"imposes atypical and signicant hardsh ip on the inmate in relati on to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 484. In Sand in's wake the Cour ts of Appea ls have not reached consistent conclusi ons for identi fying the basel ine from which to measure what is atypical and sig\u00ad nicant in any particular prison system. Compare , e. g., Beverati v. Smith, 120 F. 3d 500, 504 (CA4 1997), and Keen an v. Hall, 83 F. 3d 1083, 1089 (CA9 1996), with Hatch v. District of Columb ia, 184 F. 3d 846, 847 (CADC 1999). See also Wagne r v. Hanks , 128 F. 3d 1173, 1177 (CA7 1997). This divergence the difcu lty of locati ng the appropr iate basel ine, an issue that was not explored at leng th in the briefs. We need not resolve the issue here , howe ver, for we are satised that assig nment to OSP imposes an atypical and signicant hardsh ip under any plausible basel ine. For an inmate placed in OSP , almost all human cont act is proh ibited, even to the point that permit\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 224 WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Opinion of the Cour t ted from cell to cell; the light, though it may be dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per day, but only in a small indoor room. Save perhaps for the especia lly severe limitations on all human cont act, these conditi ons likely would apply to most solitary con nement facilities, but here there are two added components. First is the durati on. Unlike the 30-day placement in Sand in, placement at OSP is inde nite and, after an initia l 30-day review, is reviewed just annua lly. Second is that placement disqua lies an other\u00ad wise eligible inmate for parole considerati on. Austin I, 189 F. Supp . 2d, at 728. While any of these conditi ons standi ng alone might not be sufcient to create a liberty interest, taken together they impose an atypical and signicant hard\u00ad ship within the correc tional context. It follows that re\u00ad spondents have in OSP 483. OSP' s harsh conditi ons may well be necessary and appro\u00ad priate in light of the danger that high-r isk inmates pose both to prison ofcia ls and to other prisoners. See infra, at 227. That necessity , howe ver, does not diminish our conclusi on that the conditi ons give rise to a liberty interest in their avoidance . IV A liberty interest having been established, we turn to the questi on of what process is due an inmate whom Ohio seeks to place in OSP . Because the requirements of due process are \"flexible and cal[l] for such procedura l protec tions as the particular situati on demands, \" Morrissey v. Brew er, 408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972), we genera lly have declined to establish rigid rules and instead have embraced a framework to evalu\u00ad ate the sufciency of particular procedures. The frame\u00ad work, established in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), requires considerati on of three disti nct factors: \"First, the private interest that will be affec ted by the ofcia l action; second, the risk 15:51:40] S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t tion of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additi onal or substitute and the l and admi nistrative burdens that the additi onal or substitute procedura l requirement would entail.\" Id., at 335. The Cour t of Appea ls upheld the District Cour t's proce\u00ad dura l modi cati ons under the assumpti on that Sand in al\u00ad tered the rst Mathews factor. It reasoned that, \"[i]n this rst factor, Sand in affec ts the due process balance: because only those conditi ons that constitute 'atypical and signicant hardsh ips' give rise to liberty interests, those interests will necessar ily be of a weight requir ing greater due process protec tion.\" 372 F. 3d, at 358-359. This propositi on does not follow from Sand in. Sand in concer ned only whether a state-created liberty interest existed so as to trigger Mathews balanci ng at all. Having found no liberty interest to be at stake, Sand in had no occasi on to consider whether the private interest was weighty vis-a`-vis the remai ning Mathews factors. Apply ing the three factors set forth in Mathews, we nd Ohio's New Policy prov ides a sufcient level of process. We rst consider the signicance of the inmate' s interest in avoidi ng erroneous placement at OSP . Prisoners held in lawfu l con nement have their liberty curtailed by denition, so the procedura l protec tions to which they are entitled are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from con nement at all. See, e. g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975); Wolff, 418 U. S. 539. The pri\u00ad vate interest at stake here , while more than minimal, must be evaluated, nonetheless, within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties. The second factor addresses the risk of an erroneous place\u00ad ment under the procedures in place , and the probable value, if any, of additi onal or alternative procedura l safeg uards. The New Policy prov ides notice 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 226 WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Opinion of the Cour t of the factual basis leadi ng to considerati on for OSP place\u00ad ment fair oppor tunity for rebutt al. Our procedura l due process cases have consistently observed that these are among the most impor tant procedura l mechanisms for pur\u00ad erroneous depr ivati ons. See Greenho ltz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1, 15 (1979); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 543 (1985); Fuen tes v. Shevin, 407 U. S. 67, 80 (1972) (\"For more than a century the centra l meani ng of procedura l due process has been clear: 'Parties whose rights are to be affec ted are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must rst be notied' \" (quoti ng Bald\u00ad win v. Hale, 1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864))). Requir ing ofcia ls to prov ide a brief summary of the factual basis for the classi \u00ad cation review and allowing the inmate oppor tunity safeg uards against the inmate' s being mist aken for another or singled out for insufcient reason. In additi on to having the oppor tunity to be heard at the Committee stage, Ohio also invites the inmate to submit objec tions prior to the nal level of review. This second oppor tunity further reduces the possibi lity of an erroneous depr ivati on. Although a subsequent reviewer may over turn an afrm\u00ad ative recommendati on for OSP placement, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. This avoids one of the problems ap\u00ad parently present under the Old Policy, where , even if two levels of reviewers recommended against placement, a later reviewer could over turn their recommendation without explanati on. If the recommendati on is OSP placement, Ohio requires that the decisi onmaker prov ide a shor t statement of reasons. This requirement guards against arbitrary decisi onmak ing while also prov iding the inmate a basis for objec tion before the next decisi onmaker or in a subsequent classi cati on review. The statement also serves as a guide for future behav ior. See Greenho ltz, Cite U. S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t As we have noted, Ohio prov ides multiple levels of review for any decisi on recommendi ng OSP placement, with power to over turn the recommendati on at each level. In additi on to these safeg uards, Ohio further reduces the risk of errone\u00ad ous placement by prov iding for a placement review within 30 days of an inmate' s initia l assig nment to OSP . The third Mathews factor addresses the State's interest. In the context of prison management, and in the speci c cir\u00ad cumst ances of this responsibi lity for imprisoni 44,000 inmates. Austin I, 189 F. Supp . 2d, at 727. The State's rst obligati on must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the publ ic, and the prisoners themselves. See Hewitt, 459 U. S., at 473. Prison secur ity, imper iled by the brutal reality of prison gangs, prov ides the backdrop of the State's interest. Clan\u00ad desti zed, fueled by race-based hosti lity, and com\u00ad mitted to fear and violence as a means of discipl ining their own members and their rivals, gangs seek noth ing less than to control prison life and to extend their power outside prison walls. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 6. Murder of an inmate , a guard, or one of their fami ly members on the outside is a common form of gang discipl ine and control, as well as a conditi on for mem\u00ad bersh ip in some gangs. See, e. g., United States v. Santiago, 46 F. 3d 885, 888 (CA9 1995); United States v. Silverstein, 732 F. (CA7 1984). Testifying against, or oth\u00ad erwise informing on, gang activities can invite one's own death sentence . It is worth noting in this regard that for prison gang members serv ing life sentences, some without the possibi lity of parole , the deterrent effec ts of ordinary criminal punishment may be subst antia lly diminished. See id., at 1343 (\"[T]o many inmates of Marion's Control Unit the price of murder must not be high and to some it must be close to zero\"). 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 228 WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Opinion of the Cour t The problem of scarce resources is another component of the State's interest. The cost of keepi ng a single prisoner in one of Ohio's ordinary maxi mum-secur ity prisons is $34,167 per year , and the cost to maintain each inmate at OSP is $49,007 per year . See Austin I, supra, at 734, n. 17. We can assume that Ohio, or any other pena l system, faced with costs like these will nd it difcu lt to fund more effec\u00ad tive and vocati onal assist ance programs to im\u00ad prove the lives of the prisoners. It follows that cour ts must give subst antia l deference decisi ons correc tional ofcia ls conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behav ior. The State's interest must be understood against this back\u00ad ground. Were Ohio to allow an inmate to call witnesses or prov ide other attributes of an adversary hear ing before or\u00ad dering transfer to OSP prisoner and its greater objec tive of con\u00ad trolling the prison could be defeated. This problem, more\u00ad over , is not alleviated by prov iding an exempti on for wit\u00ad nesses who pose a hazard, for noth ing in the record indicates simple mechanisms exist to deter mine when witnesses may be called without fear of repr isal. The danger to witnesses, and the difcu lty in obtaining their cooperati on, make the probable value of an adversary-ty pe hear ing doubtfu l in com\u00ad parison to its obvious costs. A balance of the Mathews factors yields the conclusi on that Ohio's New Policy is adequate to safeg uard an inmate' s liberty interest in not being assig ned to OSP . Ohio is not, for example , attempti ng to remove an inmate from free soci\u00ad ety for a speci c parole violati on, see, e. g., Morrissey , 408 U. S., at 481, or to revoke good-ti me credits for speci c, seri\u00ad ous misbehav ior, see, e. g., Wolff, 418 U. S., at 539, where more formal, adversary-ty pe procedures might be usefu l. Where the inquiry draws more on the exper ience of prison admi nistrators, U. S. 209 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t safety of other inmates and prison personnel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenho ltz, 442 U. S. 1, and Hewitt v. Helms, supra, prov ide the appropr iate model. Greenho ltz, supra, at 16 (level of process due for inmates being considered for release on parole includes oppor tunity to be heard and notice of any adverse decisi on); Hewitt, supra, at 473-476 (level of process due for inmates being considered for transfer to admi nistrative segregati on in\u00ad cludes some notice of charges and an oppor tunity to be heard). Although Sand in abrogated Greenho ltz's and Hew\u00ad itt's methodolog y for establishing the liberty interest, these cases remai n instructive for their discussi on of the appro\u00ad priate level prov ides informal, nonadversary procedures comparable to those we upheld in Greenho ltz and Hewitt, and no further procedura l modi cati ons are necessary in order to satisfy due process under the Mathews test. Neither the District Cour t nor the Cour t of Appea ls shou ld have ordered the New Policy altered. The effec t of the Prison Litigati on Refor m Act of 1995, in particular 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3626( a)(1)(A), in this case has not been discussed at any leng th in the briefs. In view of our disposi\u00ad tion it is unnecessary to address its appl icati on here . Prolonged con nement in Super max may be the State's only option for the control of some inmates, and claims alleg\u00ad ing violati on of the Eighth Amendment' s proh ibition of cruel and unusua l punishments were resolved, or withdrawn, by settlement in an early phase of this case. Here, any claim of excessive punishment in indiv idua l circumst ances is not before us. The complai nt challenged OSP assig nments under the Old Policy, and the unwr itten policies that preceded it, and al\u00ad leged injuries resu lting from those systems. Ohio conceded that assig nments made under the Old Policy were , to say the least, imprecise . The District Cour t found constituti onal vi\u00ad olati ons had arisen held 545US1 Unit:$U60 [03-26-08 15:51:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 230 WILKINSON v. AUSTIN Opinion of the Cour t that the New Policy would produce many of the same consti\u00ad tutional problems. Austin I, 189 F. Supp . 2d, at 749-754. We now hold that the New Policy as descr ibed in this opinion strikes a constituti onally permissible balance between the factors of the Mathews framework. If an inmate were to demonstrate that the New Policy did not in prac tice operate in this fashion, resu lting in a cognizable injury, that could be the subjec t of an appropr iate future challenge . On remand, the Cour t of Appea ls, or the District Cour t, may consider in the rst instance what, if any, prospec tive relief is still a necessary and appropr iate remedy for due process viola\u00ad tions under Ohio's previous policies. Any such relief must, of course , satisfy the conditi ons set forth in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3626( a)(1)(A). * * * The Cour t of Appea ls was correc t to nd the inmates Appea ls was incorrec t, howe ver, to sustain the pro\u00ad cedura l modi cati ons ordered by the District Cour t.

The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls is afrmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedi ngs consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN , DIRECTOR COR- RECTION AL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the fifth circuit No. 03-9659. Argued December 6, 2004 \u2014Decided June 13, 2005 When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory strikes against 10 of the 11 qualied black venire members during jury selec tion for Miller-El' s capit al murder trial, he objec ted, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could not be presumed legitimate since the District Attorney's Ofce had a history of excludi ng blacks from criminal juries. The trial cour t denied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death sentence . Whil e his appea l was pendi ng, this Cour t decided, in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79, that discr imina\u00ad tion by a prosecutor in selec ting a defendant' s jury violated the Four\u00ad teenth Amendment. On remand, the trial cour t reviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Maca luso' s justi cati ons for the strikes that were not explai ned during voir dire, and found no show ing that prospec\u00ad tive black jurors were struck because of their race. The State Cour t of Criminal Appea ls afrmed. Subsequently , the Federa l District Cour t denied Miller-El federa l habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit denied a certicate of appea lability. This Cour t reversed, nding that mer\u00ad its of Miller-El' s Batson claim were , at least, debat able by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322. The Fifth Circuit granted a certicate of appea lability but rejected Miller-El' s Batson claim on the merits. Held: Miller-El is entitled to prevail on his Batson claim and, thus, enti\u00ad tled to habeas relief. Pp. 237-266. (a) \"[T]h is Cour t consistently reafr med that ra\u00ad cial discr imination by the jury selec tion offends the Equal Pro\u00ad tection Clause .\" Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 44. The rub has been the prac tical difcu nature and subjec t to a myriad of legitimate influences. The Batson Cour t held that a defendant can make out a prima facie case of discr iminatory jury selec tion by \"the totality of the relevant facts\" about a prosecutor 's conduc t during the defendant' s own trial. 476 U. S., at 94. Once that show ing is made , the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutra l explanati on, id., at 97, and the t Unit:$U61 LER-EL v. DRETKE Syllabus must deter mine if the defendant has shown \"pur posefu l discr imination,\" id., at 98, in light of \"all relevant circumst ances, \" id., at 96-97. Since this case is on review of a denia l of habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, and since the Texas trial cour t's prior deter mination that the State's race-neutra l explanati ons were true is a factual deter mination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by show ing the trial cour t's conclusi on to be \"an unreasonable deter mination of the facts in light of the evidence pre\u00ad sented in Pp. prosecutors used peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panel ists, a dispar ity unlikely to have been produced by happenst ance . Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 342. More power ful than the bare statistics are side-by-side compar isons of some black venire panel ists who were struck and white ones who were not. If a prosecutor 's proffered reason for striking a black panel ist ap\u00ad plies just as well to a white panel ist allowed to serve , that is evidence tendi ng to prove purposefu l discr imination. The details of two panel member compar isons bear out this Cour t's observati on, id., at 343, that the prosecuti on's reason for exercisi ng peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared to apply equa lly to some white jurors. There are strong similarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a black venireman who expressed unwaver ing suppor t for the death pena lty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but the differences seem far from signicant, particularly when readi ng Fields' s voir dire in . Upon that readi ng, Fields shou ld have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seek ing a death sentence , and the prosecutors' explanati ons for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death if rehabi litation were possible testi mony when there veniremen expressi ng comparable views on reha\u00ad bilitation not struck. The prosecuti on's reason that Fields' s brother had prior convictions is not credit able in light of its failure to enquire about the matter . The prosecuti on's proffered reasons for striking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably unlikely . The fact that the reason for striking him, that he thought death was an easy way out and defendants shou ld be made to suffer more , also appl ied to nonblack panel members who were selec ted is evidence of pretext. The suggesti on of pretext is not, moreover , mitigated by Maca luso' s ex\u00ad planati on that Warren was struck when the State could afford to be libera l in using its 10 remai ning peremptory challenges. Were that the explanati on for striking Warren and later accepti ng similar panel mem\u00ad bers, prosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was exami ned and accepted before Warren despite her similar views. Maca luso' s explanati on also weakens S. 231 (2005) Syllabus cept ance of Woods, the one black juror , shows that race was not in play. When he was selec ted as the eighth juror , the State had used 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members; and the record shows that at least 3 of the remai ning venire panel opposed capit al pun\u00ad ishment. Because the prosecutors had to exercise prudent restrai nt, the late-st age decisi on to accept a black panel member willing to impose the death pena lty does not neutra lize the early-st age decisi on to chal\u00ad lenge a comparable venireman, Warren. The Fifth Circuit' s substituted reason for the elimination, Warren' s genera l ambiva lence about the pen\u00ad alty, was erroneous as a matter of fact and law. As to fact, Maca luso said noth ing about genera Warren' s answer to severa l questi ons was that he could impose the death pena lty. As for law, the Batson rule prov ides the prosecutor an oppor tunity to give the reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess the reason' s plausi\u00ad bility in light of all of the evidence , but it does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis. Because a prosecutor is re\u00ad sponsible for the reason he gave , the Fifth Circuit' s substituti on of a reason for excludi ng Warren does noth ing to satisfy the prosecutors' burden of stating a racia lly neutra l explanati on for their own actions. Compar ing Warren' s strike with the treatment of panel members with similar views suppor ts a conclusi on that race was signicant in deter\u00ad mining who was challenged and who was not. Pp. 240-252. (c) The prosecuti on's broader patter tice during jury tion also suppor t the case for discr imination. Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards bear ing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are questi oned. Members seated in the back may escape voir dire, for those not questi oned by the end of each week are dismissed. Here, the prosecuti on shuffled the cards when a number of black members were seated at the front of the panel at the beginning of the second week. The third week, they shuffled when the rst four members were black, placi ng them in the back. After the defense re\u00ad shuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared in the front, the cour t denied the prosecuti on's request for another shuffle . No racia lly neutra l reason for the shuffl ing has ever been offered, and noth ing stops the suspici on of discr iminatory intent from rising to an inference . ng voir dire questi ons posed respec tively to black and nonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to avoid black jurors. Prosecutors gave a bland descr iption of the death pena lty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking about the indiv idua l's feelings on the subjec t, but used a script descr ibing impositi on of the death pena lty in graph ic terms for 53% of the black venire members. The argument that prosecutors used the graph ic script to weed out am\u00ad biva lent panel members simply does not t the Black venire 545US1 Unit:$U61 v. DRETKE Syllabus members were more likely to receive that script regardless of their ex\u00ad pressi ons of certainty or ambiva lence about the death pena lty, and the State's chosen explanati on failed for four out of the eight black panel members who received it: two received it after clear ly stating their op\u00ad positi on to the death pena lty and two received it even though they un\u00ad ambig uously favored that pena lty. The State's explanati on misses the mark four out of ve times with regard to the nonblacks who received the graph ic descr iption. Ambiva lent black panel members were also more likely to receive the graph ic script than nonblack ambiva lent ones. The State's attempt at a race-neutra l rationalization fails to explai n what the prosecutors did. The explanati on that the prosecutors' rst objec t was to use the graph ic script to make a case for excludi ng black panel members opposed to, or ambiva lent about, the death pena lty is more persuasive than the State's explanati on, and the reasonable infer\u00ad ence is that race was the major considerati on when the prosecuti on chose to follow the graph ic script. The same is true for another kind of disparate questi oning. The prosecutors asked all black panel members opposed to, or ambiva lent about, the death pena lty how low a sentence they would consider imposi ng for murder without telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but prosecutors did not put that ques\u00ad tion to most white panel members who had expressed similar views. The nal body of evidence conr ming the conclusi on here is that the Dallas County District Attorney's Ofce had, for decades, followed a speci c policy of systematica lly excludi ng blacks from juries. The Miller-El prosecutors' notes of the race of each panel member show that they took direc tion from a jury selec tion l (d) The Fifth Circuit' s conclusi on that Miller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the state cour t's no-discr imination nding was wrong is as unsuppor as the \"dismissive and strai ned inter pret ation\" of his evidence that this Cour t disapproved when decid\u00ad ing that he was entitled to a certicate of appea lability, Miller-El, supra, at 344. Ten of the eleven black venire members were perempto\u00ad rily struck. At least two of them were ostensibly accept able to prose\u00ad cutors seek ing the death pena lty. The prosecutors' chosen race-neutra l reasons for the strikes do not hold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair conclusi on. The selec tion process was replete with evidence that prosecutors were selec ting and rejecting po\u00ad tentia l jurors because of race. And the prosecutors took their cues from a manua l on jury selec tion with an emphasis on race. It blinks reality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because they were black. The facts correlate to noth ing as well as to race. The Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 235 Cite as: 545 U.

During jury selec tion in Miller-El' s trial for capit al murder , prosecutors used peremp\u00ad tory strikes against 10 qualied black venire members. Miller-El objec ted that the strikes were based on race and could not be presumed legitimate , given a history of exclud\u00ad ing black members from criminal juries by the Dallas County District Attorney's Ofce . The trial cour t received evidence of the prac tice alleged but found no \"systematic exclusi on of blacks as a matter of policy\" by that ofce , App. 882-883, and therefore no entitlement to relief under Swain v. Alabam a, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the case then dening and mark ing the limits of relief from racia lly biased jury selec tion. The cour t denied Miller-El' s request to pick a new jury, and the trial ended with his death sentence for capit al murder . While an appea l was pendi ng, this Cour t decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), which replaced Swain's threshold requirement to prove systemic discr imination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury claim, with the rule that discr imination by the prosecutor in selec ting the jury sufced to establish the constituti onal violati on. The Texas Cour t of Criminal Appea ls then remanded the matter to the trial cour t to deter mine whether Miller-El could show that prosecutors in his case peremptor ily struck prospec tive black jurors because of race. Miller-El v. State, 748 S. W. 2d 459 (1988) (en banc). The trial cour t found no such demonstrati on. After re\u00ad viewing the voir dire record of the explanati ons given for some of the challenged strikes, and after hear ing one of the prosecutors, Paul Maca luso, give his justi cati on for those previously unexplai ned, the trial cour t accepted the stated race-neutra l reasons for the strikes, which the judge called \"completely credible [and] sufcient\" as the grounds for a nding of \"no purposefu l discr imination.\" Findings of Fact and Conclusi ons of Law Upon Remand from the Cour t of Criminal Appea ls in State v.

The Cour t of Criminal Appea ls afrmed, stating it found \"ample suppor t\" in the voir dire record for the race-neutra l explanati ons offered by prosecutors for the peremptory strikes. Miller-El v. State, No. 69,677 (Sept. 16, 1992) (per curiam), p. 2, App. 931. Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, again pressi ng his Batson claim, among others not now before us. The District Cour t denied relief, Miller-El v. Johnson, Civil No. 3:96-CV-1992 -H (ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Cir\u00ad cuit precluded appea l by deny ing a certicate of appea labil\u00ad ity, Miller-El v.

After exami ning the record of Miller-El' s extensive evidence of purposefu l discr imination by the Dallas County District Attorney's Ofce before and during his trial, we found an appea l was in order , since the merits of the Batson claim were , at the least, debat able by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 (2003). After granti ng a certicate of appea lability, the Fifth Circuit rejected Miller-El' s Bat\u00ad son claim on the merits. 361 F. 3d 849 (2004). We again granted certiorar i, 542 U. S. 936 (2004), and again we reverse . II A \"It is well known that prejudices often exist against par\u00ad ticular classes in the community , which sway the judg ment of jurors, and which, therefore , operate in some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that protec\u00ad tion which others enjoy.\" Straude r v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 309 (1880); see also Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at 86. Defendants are harmed, of course , when racia l dis\u00ad crimination in jury selec tion the right of trial by impar tial jury, Straude r v. West Virginia, supra, at 308, but racia l minorities are harmed more lly, for of the Cour t tors draw ing racia l lines in picking juries establish \"state\u00ad sponsored group stereoty pes rooted in, and reflec tive of, his\u00ad torical prejudice ,\" J. E. B. v. Alabam a ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 128 (1994). Nor is the harm con ned to minorities. When the gover n\u00ad ment' s choice of jurors is tainted with racia l bias, that \"over t wron g... casts doubt over the obligati on of the parties, the jury, and indeed the cour t to adhere to the law throughout the trial . . . .\" Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 412 (1991). That is, the very integr ity of the cour ts is jeopardi zed when a prosecutor 's ting under mines publ ic condence in adjudicati on, Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 49 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesv ille Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 628 (1991); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at 87. So, \"[f]or more than a century , this Cour t consistently and repeatedly has reafr med that racia l discr imination by the State in jury se\u00ad lection offends the Equal Protec tion Clause .\" Georgia v. McCollum, supra, at 44; see Straude r v. West Virginia, supra, at 308, 310; Norris v. Alabam a, 294 U. S. 587, Powers v. Ohio, supra, 404. The rub has been the prac tical choices subjec t to myriad legitimate influences, whate ver the race of the indiv idua ls on the panel from which jurors are selec ted. In Swain v. Alabam a, we tackled the problem of \"the quantum of proof necessary\" to show purposefu l dis\u00ad crimination, 380 U. S., at 205, with an eye to preserv ing each side' s histor ical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or challenge , the very nature of which is traditi onally \"without a reason stated, \" id., at 220. The Swain Cour t tried to re\u00ad late peremptory challenge to equa l protec tion by presumi ng the legitimacy of prosecutors' strikes except in the face of a longst andi ng patter n of discr imination: case , whate ver PAGES PGT: OPIN 239 Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ries, then \"giving even the widest leeway to the operati on of irrati onal but trial-related suspici ons and antagonisms, it would appear that the purposes of the peremptory challenge [were ] being perver ted.\" Id., at 223-224. Swain's demand to make out a conti nuity of discr imination over time, howe ver, turned out to be difcu lt to the point of unworkable , and in Batson v. Kentucky , we recog nized that this requirement to show an extended patter n imposed a \"crippling burden of proof \" that left prosecutors' use of pe\u00ad remptor ies \"largely immune from scrutiny.\" 476 law implementi ng equa l protec tion elsewhere had evolved into less discourag\u00ad ing standards for assessi ng a claim of purposefu l discr imina\u00ad tion, id., at 93-95 (citing, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Developmen t Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977)), and we accordi ngly held that a defendant could make out a prima facie case of discr iminatory jury selec tion by \"the totality of the relevant facts\" about a prosecutor 's conduc t during the defendant' s own trial. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S., at 94, 96. \"Once the defendant makes a prima facie show ing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutra l explana\u00ad tion for challeng ing . . . jurors\" within an arguably targeted class. Id., at 97. Although there may be \"any number of bases on which a prosecutor reasonably [might ] believe that it is desirable to strike a juror who is not excusable for cause . . . , the prosecutor must give a clear and reasonably speci c explanati on of his legitimate reasons for exercisi ng the challeng[ e].\" Id., at 98, n. 20 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). \"The trial cour t then will have the duty to deter\u00ad mine if the defendant has established purposefu l discr imina\u00ad tion.\" Id., at 98. Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the prosecuti on without having to cast Swain's wide net, the net was not entirely consig ned to his\u00ad tory, for Batson's indiv PGT: DRETKE Opinion of the Cour t of its own owing to its very emphasis on the particular rea\u00ad sons a prosecutor might give. If any facia lly neutra l reason sufced to answer a Batson challenge , then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain. Some stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are shown up within the four corners of a given case , someti mes a cour t may not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand. Hence Batson's explanati on that a defendant may rely on \"all relevant circumst ances\" to raise an inference of purposefu l discr imination. 476 U. S., at 96-97. B This case comes to us on review of a denia l of habeas relief sought under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254, following the Texas trial cour t's prior deter mination of fact that the State's race\u00ad neutra l explanati ons were true, see Purke tt v. Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 769 (1995) (per curiam); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at 98, n. 21. Under the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Miller-El may obtain relief only by show ing the Texas conclusi on to be \"an unreasonable deter mination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State cour t proceedi ng.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(2). Thus we presume the Texas cour t's factual ndings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts the \"presumpti on of correc .\" \u00a7 e)(1). The standard is demand\u00ad ing but not insatiable; as we said the last time this case was here , \"[d]eference does not by denition preclude relief.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 340. III A The numbers descr ibing the prosecuti on's use of perempto\u00ad ries are remarkable . Out of 20 black members of the 108\u00ad person venire panel for Miller-El' s trial, only 1 served. Al\u00ad though 9 were excused for cause or by agreement, 10 were 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 241 Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t peremptor ily struck by the prosecuti on. Id., at 331. \"The prosecutors used their peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of this dispar ity.\" Id., at 342. More power ful than these bare statistics, howe ver, are side-by-side compar isons of some black venire panel ists who were struck and white panel ists allowed to serve . If a prosecutor 's proffered reason for striking a black panel ist ap\u00ad plies just as well to an other wise-si milar nonblack who is permitted to serve , that tendi ng to prove pur\u00ad posefu l discr imination to be considered at Batson's third step. Cf. Reev es v. Sande rson Plumb ing Produc ts, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 147 (2000) (in employment discr imination cases, \"[p]roof that the defendant' s explanati on is unwor thy of cre\u00ad dence is simply one form of circumst antia that is probative of intenti onal discr imination, and it may be quite persuasive\"). While we did not develop a comparative juror analysis last time, we did note that the prosecuti on's reasons for exercisi ng peremptory strikes against some black panel members appeared equa lly on point as to some white jurors who served. Miller-El v. Cockrell, supra, at 343.1 The de\u00ad tails of panel member compar isons bear this out.2 1 Whil e many of these explanati ons were offered contemporaneously , \"the state trial cour t had no occasi on to judge the credibi lity of these explanati ons at that time because our equa l protec tion jurisprudence then, dictated by Swain, did not require it.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 343. Other evidence was presented in the Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), hear ing, but this was offered two years after trial and \"was subjec t to the usua l risks of imprecisi on and distor tion from the passage of time.\" 537 U. S., at 343. 2 The dissent contends that compar isons of black and nonblack venire panel ists, on's ate questi oning of black and nonblack panel ists and its use of jury shuffles, are not proper ly before this Cour t, not having been \"put before the Texas cour ts.\" Post, at 279 (opinion of Thomas, J.). But the dissent conflates the difference between evidence that must be presented to the state cour ts to be considered by federa l cour ts in habeas proceedi ngs and theor ies about that evidence . See 28 U. Opinion of the Cour t The prosecuti on used its second peremptory strike to ex\u00ad clude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed unwaver\u00ad ing suppor t for the death pena lty. On the questi onnaire lled out by all panel members before indiv idua l exami nation on the stand, Fields said that he believed in capit al punish\u00ad ment, Joint Lodg ing 14, and during questi oning he disclosed his belief that the State acts on God' s beha lf when it imposes the death pena lty. \"Therefore , if the State exac ts death, then that' s what it shou ld be.\" App. 174. He testi ed that he had no religious or philosoph ical reservati ons about the death pena lty and that the death pena lty deterred crime. Id., at 174-175. He twice averred, without apparent hesit a\u00ad tion, that he could sit on Miller-El' s jury and make a decisi on to impose this pena lty. Id., at 176-177. Although at one point in the questi oning, Fields indicated that the possibi lity of rehabi litation might be relevant to the likelihood that a defendant would commit future acts of vio\u00ad lence , id., at 183, he responded to ensui ng questi ons by say\u00ad ing that although he believed anyone could be rehabi litated, this belief would not stand in the way of a decisi on to impose the death pena lty: \"[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor ] said as far as the crime goes, there are only two things that could be ren\u00ad dered, death or life in prison. If for some reason the testi mony didn' t warrant death, then life imprisonment must be assessed \"in light of the evidence presented in the State cour t proceedi ng\"); Miller-El v. show unreasonabi light of the record before the [state] cour t\"). There can be no questi on that the transcr ipt of voir dire, recordi ng the evidence on which Miller-El bases his arguments and on which we base our resu lt, was before the state cour ts, nor does the dissent contend that Miller-El did not \"fair ly presen[ t]\" his Batson claim to the state cour ts. Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971). Only as to the juror questi onnaires and informati on cards is there ques\u00ad tion about what was before the state cour ts. Unlike the dissent, see post, at 281-282, we reach no decisi on about whether the limitation on evidence in \u00a7 2254( d)(2) is OPIN 243 Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t would give an indiv idua l an oppor tunity to rehabi litate. But, you know , you said that the jurors didn' t have the oppor tunity to make a persona l decisi on in the matter with reference to what I thought or felt, but it was just based on the questi ons accordi ng to the way the law has been handed down. \" Id., at 185 (alterati on omitted). Fields also noted on his questi onnaire that his brother had a criminal history . Joint Lodg ing 13. During questi oning, the prosecuti on went into this, too: \"Q Could you tell me a little bit about that? \"A He was arrested and convicted on [a] number of oc\u00ad casions for \"Q Was that here in Dallas? \"A Yes. \"Q Was he involved in any trials or anyth ing like that? \"A I suppose of sorts. I don't really know too much about it. \"Q Was he ever convicted? \"A Yeah, he served time. \"Q Do you feel that that would in any way inter fere with your serv ice on this jury at all? \"A No.\" App. 190 (alterati on omitted). Fields was struck peremptor ily by the prosecuti on, with prosecutor James Nelson offer ing a race-neutra l reason: \"[W]e . . . have concer n with reference to some of his statements as to the death pena lty in that he said that he could only give death if he thought a person could not be rehabi litated and he later made the comment that any person could be rehabi litated if they nd God or are introduced to God and the fact that we have a concer n that his religious feelings may affec t his jury serv ice in this case.\" Id., at 197 the mischarac terized Fields' s testi mony . He represented that Fields said he would not vote for death if rehabi litation was possible , whereas Fields unequivoca lly stated that he could impose the death pena lty regardless of the possibi lity of rehabi litation. Perhaps Nelson misunder\u00ad stood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for keepi ng Fields off the jury we think he would have proceeded differently . In light of Fields' s outspoken suppor t for the death pena lty, we expec t the prosecutor would have cleared up any misun\u00ad derst andi ng by asking further questi ng to the point of exercisi ng a strike. If, indeed, Fields' s thoughts on rehabi litation did make the prosecutor uneasy , he shou ld have worr ied about a number of white panel members he accepted with no evident reserva\u00ad tions. Sandra Hearn said that she believed in the death pena lty \"if a criminal cannot be rehabi litated and conti nues to commit the same type of crime.\" Id., at 429.3 Hearn went so far as to express doubt that at the pena lty phase of a capit al case she could conclude that a convicted murderer \"wou ld probably commit some criminal acts of violence in the future .\" Id., at 440. \"People change ,\" she said, mak ing it hard to assess the risk of someone' s future dangerousness. \"[T]he evidence would have to be awfu l strong .\" Ibid. But the prosecuti on did not respond to Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delv ing into her views about rehabi lita\u00ad tion with any further questi on, it raised no objec tion to her serv ing on the jury. White panel ist Mary Witt said she would take the possibi lity of rehabi litation into account in decidi ng at the pena lty phase of the trial about a defendant' s probabi lity of future dangerousness, 6 Record of Voir Dire 2433 (herei nafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no further questi on about her views on refor mati on, and they 3 Hearn could give the death pena lty for murder if the defendant had committed a prior offense of robbery , in which case she would judge \"ac\u00ad cordi ng to the situati on,\" App. 430, and she thought the death pena lty might be appropr iate for offenses OPIN 245 Cite 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t accepted her as a juror , id., at 2464 -2465.4 Lati no venire\u00ad man Fernando Gutierrez, who served on the jury, said that he would consider the death pena lty for someone who could not be rehabi litated, App. 777, but the prosecutors did not questi on him further about this view. In sum, nonblack ju\u00ad rors whose remarks on rehabi litation could well have sig\u00ad naled a limit on their willingness to impose a death sentence were not questi oned further and drew no objec tion, but the prosecuti on expressed apprehensi on about a black juror 's be\u00ad lief in the possibi lity of refor though he repeat\u00ad edly stated his approva l of the death pena lty and testi ed that he could impose it accordi ng to state legal standards even when the alternative sentence of life imprisonment would give a defendant (like everyone else in the world) the oppor tunity to refor m.5 The on rehabi litation had anyth ing to do with the peremptory strike of Fields is under\u00ad scored by the prosecuti on's response after Miller-El' s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor had misrepresented Fields' s responses on the subjec t. A moment earlier the prosecutor 4 Witt ultimately did not serve because she was peremptor ily struck by the defense . 6 Record 2465. The fact that Witt and other venire mem\u00ad bers discussed here were peremptor ily struck by the defense is not rele\u00ad vant to our point. For each of them, the defense did not make a decisi on to exercise a peremptory until after the prosecuti on decided whether to accept or reject, so each was accepted by the prosecuti on before being ultimately struck by the defense . And the under lying questi on is not what the defense thought about these jurors but whether the State was concer ned about views on rehabi litation when the venireperson was not black. The dissent offers other reasons why these nonblack panel members who expressed views on rehabi litation similar to Fields' s were other wise more accept able to the prosecuti on than he was. See post, at 293-296. In doing so, the dissent focuses on reasons the prosecuti on itself did not offer . See infra, at 252. 5 Prosecutors did exercise peremptory strikes on Penny Crowson and Char lotte Whaley, who expressed views about rehabi litation similar to those of Witt and t had nished his misdescr of Fields' s on potentia l rehabi litation with the \"Those are for exercisi ng our...s trike at this time.\" Id., at 197. When defense counsel called him on his misst atement, he neither defended what he said nor withdrew the strike. Id., at 198. Instead, he suddenly came up with Fields' s brother 's prior conviction as another reason for the strike. Id., at 199. It would be difcu lt to credit the State's new explanati on, which reeks of afterthought. While the Cour t of Appea ls tried to bolster it with the observati on that no seated juror was in Fields' s positi on with respec t to his brother , 361 F. 3d, at 859-860, the cour t's readi ness to accept the State's substi\u00ad tute reason ignores not only its pretextua l timing but the other reasons render ing it implausible . Fields' s testi mony indicated he was not close to his brother , App. 190 (\"I don't really know too much about it\"), and the prosecuti on asked noth ing further about the influence his brother 's history might have had on Fields, as it probably would have done if the fami ly history had actually mattered. See, e. g., Ex parte Travis, 776 So. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000) (\"[T]he State's failure to engage in any meani ngful voir dire exami nation on a subjec t the State alleges it is concer ned about is evidence suggesti ng that the explanati on is a sham and a pretext for discr imination\"). There is no good reason to doubt that the State's afterthought about Fields' s brother was anyth ing but makeweight. The Cour t of Appea ls's judg ment on the Fields strike is unsuppor table for the same reason the State's rst explana\u00ad tion is itself ments that everyone be rehabi litated, failing to note that Fields afrmed that he could give the death pena lty if the law and evidence called for it, regardless of the possibi l\u00ad ity of divine grace . The Cour t of Appea ls made no menti on of the fact that the prosecuti on Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) 247 Opinion of the Cour t saying he could not give death if rehabi litation were possible . 361 F. 3d, at 856. In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors similarly situ\u00ad ated to Fields, we nd strong similarities as well as some differences.6 But the differences seem far from signicant, particularly when we read Fields' s voir dire testi mony in its entirety . Upon that readi ng, Fields shou ld have been an ideal juror in the eyes of a prosecutor seek ing a death sen\u00ad tence , and the prosecutors' explanati ons for the strike cannot reasonably be accepted. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 339 (the credibi lity of reasons given can be measured by \"how reasonable , or how improbable , the explanati ons are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strateg y\"). The prosecuti on's proffered reasons for striking Joe War\u00ad ren, another black venireman, are comparably unlikely. Warren gave this answer when he was asked what the death pena lty accompl ished: \"I don't know . It's really hard to say because I know someti mes you feel that it might help to deter crime and then you feel that the person is not really suffer ing. You're taking the suffer ing away from him. So it's like I said, someti mes you have mixed feelings about whether or not this is punishment or, you know , you're 6 The dissent contends that there are no white panel ists similarly situ\u00ad ated to Fields and to panel member Joe Warren because \" ' \"[s]imilarly situated\" does not mean match ing any one of severa l reasons the prosecu\u00ad tion gave for striking a potentia l juror\u2014it means match ing all of them. ' \" Post, at 291 (quoti ng Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 362-363 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng)). None of our cases announces a rule that no compar ison is probative unless the situati on of the indiv idua ls compared is identica l in all respec ts, and there is no reason to accept one. Nothing in the combi\u00ad nation of Fields' s statements about rehabi litation and his brother 's history discredits our grounds for inferr ing that these purported reasons were pretextua l. A per se rule that a defendant cannot win a Batson claim unless there is an exac tly identica l white juror would leave Batson inoper\u00ad able; potentia l jurors are not produc ts set of cook ie cutters. 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: DRETKE Opinion of the Cour t relieving persona l punishment. \" App. 205; 3 Record 1532. The prosecuti on said noth ing about these remarks when it struck Warren from the panel, but prosecutor Paul Maca luso referred to this answer as the rst of his reasons when he testi ed at the later Batson hear ing: \"I thought [Warren' s statements on voir dire] were in\u00ad consistent responses. At one point he says, you know , on a case-by-case basis and at another point he said, well, I think\u2014I got the impressi on, at least, that he sug\u00ad gested that the death pena lty was an easy way out, that they shou ld be made to suffer more .\" App. 909. On the face of it, the explanati on is reasonable from the State's point of view, but its plausibi lity is severely undercut by the prosecuti on's failure to objec t to other panel members who expressed views much like Warren' s. Kevin Duke , who served on the jury, said, \"someti mes death would be better to me than\u2014bei ng in prison would be like dying every day and, if you were in prison for life with no hope of parole , I['d] just as soon have it over with than be in prison for the rest of your life.\" Id., at 372. Troy Woods, the one black panel\u00ad ist to serve as juror , said that capit al punishment \"is too easy . I think that' s a quick relief. . . . I feel like [hard labor is] more of a punishment than putti ng them to sleep .\" Id., at 408. Sandra Jenkins, whom the State accepted (but who was then struck by the defense) testi ed that she thought \"a harsher treatment is life imprisonment with no parole .\" Id., at 542. Leta Girard, accepted by the State (but also struck by the defense) gave her opinion that \"living someti mes is a worse \u2014is worse to me than dying would be.\" Id., at 624. The fact that Maca luso' s reason also appl ied to these other panel members, most of them white, none of them struck, is evidence of pretext. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 249 Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The suggesti on of pretext is not, moreover , mitigated much by Maca luso' s explanati on that Warren was struck when the State had 10 peremptory challenges left and could afford to be libera l in using them. Id., at 908. If that were the explanati on for striking Warren and later accepti ng panel members who thought death would be too easy , the prosecu\u00ad tors shou ld have struck Sandra Jenkins, whom they exam\u00ad ined and accepted before Warren. Indeed, the disparate treatment is the more remarkable for the fact that the prose\u00ad cutors repeatedly questi oned Warren on his capacity and willingness to impose a sentence of death and elicited state\u00ad ments of his ability to do so if the evidence suppor ted that resu lt and the answer to each specia l questi on was yes, id., at 202.2, 202.3, 205, 207, whereas the record before us dis\u00ad closes no attempt to deter mine whether Jenkins would be able to vote for death in spite of her view that it was easy on the convict, id., at 541-546. Yet the prosecutors accepted the white panel member Jenkins and struck the black venire\u00ad man Warren. Maca luso' s explanati on that the prosecutors grew more spar ing with peremptory challenges as the jury selec tion wore on does, howe ver, weaken any suggesti on that the State's accept ance of Woods, the one black juror , shows that race was not in play. Woods was the eighth juror , qualied in the fth week of jury selec tion. Joint Lodg ing 125. When the State accepted him, 11 of its 15 peremptory strikes were gone , 7 of them used to strike black panel members. Id., at 137. The juror questi onnaires show that at least three members of the venire panel yet to be questi oned on the stand were opposed to capit al punishment, Janice Mackey , id., at 79; Paul Bailey, id., at 63; and Anna Keaton, id., at 55.7 With at least three remai ning panel members 7 Each of them was black and each was peremptor ily struck by the State after Woods' s accept ance . It is unclear whether the prosecutors knew they were black prior to the voir dire questi oning on the stand, though DRETKE Opinion of the Cour t highly undesirable to the State, the prosecutors had to exer\u00ad cise prudent restrai nt in using strikes. This late-st age deci\u00ad sion to accept a black panel member willing to impose a death sentence does not, therefore , neutra lize the early-st age decisi on to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren. In fact, if the prosecutors were going to accept any black juror to obscure the other wise consistent patter n of oppositi on to seati ng one, the time to do so was getti late.8 The lties by stating that the prosecuti on's reason for striking Warren was a more genera l ambiva lence about the pena lty and his ability to impose it, 361 F. 3d, at 856-857 (and the dissent presses that explanati on here , post, at 286-289). But this rational\u00ad ization was erroneous as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. As to fact, Maca luso said noth ing about any genera l . He simply alluded to the possibi lity that Warren might think the death pena lty too easy on some defendants, saying noth ing about Warren' s ability to impose the pena lty when it appeared to be warranted.9 On the contrary , though there is some indicati on that they did: prosecutors noted the race of each panel ist on all of the juror cards, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 347, even for those panel ists who were never questi oned indiv idua lly because the week ended before it was their turn. 8 Nor is pretextua l indicati on mitigated by Maca luso' s further reason that Warren had a brother-i n-law convicted of a crime having to do with food stamps for which he had to make restituti on. App. 910. Maca luso never questi oned his at all; as with Fields' s brother , the failure to ask under mines the persuasiveness of the claimed concer n. And Warren' s brother 's criminal history was comparable to those of relatives of other panel members not struck by prosecutors. Cheryl Davis's husband had been convicted of theft and received seven years' probati on. Id., at 695-696. Chatt a Nix's brother was involved in white-col lar fraud. Id., at 613-614. Noad Vickery' s sister served time in a penitentiary severa l decades ago. Id., at 240-241. 9 But even if Maca luso actually had explai ned that he exercised the strike because Warren was difdent about imposi ng death, it would have been hard to square that explanati on with the prosecuti 251 Cite as: 545 U. S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Warren had indeed questi oned the extent to which the death pena lty served a purpose in society , App. 205, he explai ned his positi on in response to the very next questi on: it was not any qualm about imposi ng what society genera lly deems its harshest punishment, but his concer n that the death pena lty might not be severe enough, ibid. When Warren was asked whether he could impose the death pena lty he said he thought he could; when told that answer ing yes to the specia l issue questi ons would be tantamount to voting for death he said he could give yes answers if the evidence suppor ted them. Id., at 207.10 As for law, the rule in Batson prov ides an oppor tunity to the prosecutor to give the reason for striking the juror , and a number of ambiva lent white panel members. Juror Marie Mazza, for example , admitted some concer n about what her associates might think of her if she sat on a jury that called for the death pena lty. Id., at 354-355. Rona ld Salsini, accepted by the prosecuti struck by the de\u00ad fense , worr ied that if he gave the death pena lty he might have a \"problem\" in the future with having done so. Id., at 593. Witt, another panel mem\u00ad ber accepted by the State but struck by the defense , said she did not know if she could give that sentence . 6 Record 2423. 10 The Cour t of Appea ls also found ambiva lence in Warren' s statement, when asked how he felt genera lly about the death pena lty, that, \"there are some cases where I would agree , you know , and there are others that I don't.\" App. 202.2 (quoted in 361 F. 3d 849, 857 (CA5 2004)). But a look at Warren' s next answers shows what he meant. The sorts of cases where he would impose it were those where \"maybe things happen that could have been avoided, \" such as where there is a choice not to kill, but he would not impose it for killing \"in self[-]defense someti mes. \" App. 202.2 - 202.3. Where the death pena lty is sought for murder committed at the same time as another felony , Warren thought that it \"depends on the case and the circumst ances involved at the time.\" Id., at 204. None of these responses is excepti onable . A number of venire members not struck by the State, includi ng some seated on the jury, offered some versi on of the uncontroversia l, and responsible , view that impositi on of the death pena lty ought to depend on the circumst ances. See Joint Lodg ing 176 (Mar ie Mazza, a seated juror); id., at 223 (Filemon Zablan, a seated juror); App. 548 (Colleen Moses, struck by the defense); id., at 618 (Mary Witt, struck by the defense); 11-(B) Record 4455 DRETKE Opinion of the Cour t it requires the judge to assess the plausibi lity of that reason in light of all evidence with a bear ing on it. 476 U. S., at 96-97; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 339. It is true that peremptor ies are often the subjec ts of instinct, Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at 106 (Marsha ll, J., concurr ing), and it can someti mes be hard to say what the reason is. But when illegitimate grounds like race are in issue , a prosecutor sim\u00ad ply has got to state his reasons as best he can and stand or fall on the plausibi lity of the reasons he gives. A Batson challenge does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis. If the stated reason does not hold up, its pretextua l signicance does not fade because a trial judge , or an appea ls cour t, can imag ine a reason that might not have been shown up as false. The Cour t of Appea ls's and the dissent' s substituti on of a reason for eliminating Warren does noth ing to satisfy the prosecutors' burden of stating a racia lly neutra l explanati on for their own actions. The whole of the voir dire testi mony subjec t to consider\u00ad ation casts the prosecuti on's reasons for striking Warren in an implausible light. Compar ing his strike with the treat\u00ad ment of panel members who expressed similar views sup\u00ad ports a conclusi on that race was signicant in deter mining who was challenged and who was not.11 11 There were other black members of the venire struck purportedly because of some ambiva lence , about the death pena lty or their capacity to impose it, who Miller-El argues must actually have been struck because of race , none of them having expressed any more ambiva lence than white jurors Mazza and Hearn. We think these are closer calls, howe ver. Edwin Rand said at points that he could impose the death pena lty, but he also said \"right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might not.\" App. 265 (alterati on omitted). Wayman Kennedy testi ed that he could impose the death pena lty, but on his questi onnaire and voir dire, he was more speci c, saying that he believed in the death pena lty for mass murder . Id., at 317; Joint Lodg ing 46.

The of the venire its en\u00ad quiry into views on the death pena lty, its questi oning about minimum accept able sentences: all indicate decisi ons prob\u00ad ably based on race. Finally, the appearance of discr imina\u00ad tion is conr med by widely known evidence of the genera l policy of the Dallas County District Attorney's Ofce to ex\u00ad clude black venire members from juries at the time Miller- El's jury was selec ted. The rst clue to the prosecutors' intenti ons, disti nct from the peremptory challenges themselves, is their resor t during voir dire to a procedure known in Texas as the jury shuffle . In the State's criminal prac tice, either side may litera lly re\u00ad shuffle the cards bear ing panel members' names, thus re\u00ad arrang ing the order in which members of a venire panel are seated and reached for questi oning.12 Once the order is es\u00ad tablished, the panel members seated at the back are likely to escape voir dire altogether , for those not questi oned by the end of the week are dismissed. As we previously explai ned, Gutierrez to mean this only as an example .) Roder ick Bozeman stated that he thought he could vote for the death pena lty but he didn' t really know . Id., at 145. Finally, Carrol Boggess expressed uncertainty whether she could go through with giving the death pena lty, id., at 298- 299, although she later averred that she could, id., at 302-304. We do not decide whether there were white jurors who expressed am\u00ad biva lence just as much as these black members of the venire panel. There is no need to go into these instances, for the prosecutors' treatment of Fields and Warren suppor ts stronger arguments that Batson was violated. 12 The procedure is conduc ted under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 35.11 (Vernon Supp . 2004 -2005). Whil e that statute says that the cour t clerk is to conduc t a shuffle on the request of either party, the transcr ipts in this case make clear that each side did its own shuffles. See, e. g., App. 124. 545US1 Unit:$U61 PGT: t \"the prosecuti on's decisi on to seek a predomi nant number of African-Amer icans were seated in the front of the panel, along with its decisi on to delay a formal objec tion to the defense' s shuffle until after the new racia l compositi on was revealed, raise a suspici on that the State sought to exclude African-Amer icans from the jury. Our concer ns are ampl ied by the fact that the state cour t also had before it, and apparently ignored, testimony demonstrating that the Dallas County District Attorney's Ofce had, by its own admis\u00ad sion, used this process to manipu late the racia l composi\u00ad tion of the jury in the past. \" Miller-El v.

At the beginning of the third week, the rst four panel members were black. The prosecuti on shuffled, and these black panel members ended up at the back.

S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t stops the suspici on of discr iminatory intent from rising to an inference .14 The next body of evidence that the State was trying to avoid black jurors is the contrasti ng voir dire questi ons posed respec tively to black and nonblack panel members, on two different subjec ts. First, there were the prosecutors' statements precedi ng questi ons about a potentia l juror 's thoughts on capit al punishment. Some of these prefatory statements were cast in genera l terms, but some followed the so-ca lled graph ic script, descr ibing the method of ex\u00ad ecuti on in rhetor ical and clinical detail. It is intended, Miller-El contends, to prompt some expressi on of hesit ation to consider the death pena lty and thus to elicit plausibly neu\u00ad tral grounds for a peremptory strike of a potentia l juror sub\u00ad jected to it, if not a strike for cause . If the graph ic script is given to a higher propor tion of blacks than whites, this is evidence that prosecutors more often wanted blacks off the jury, absent some neutra l and extenuati ng explanati on. As we pointed out last time, for 94% of white venire panel members, prosecutors gave a bland descr iption of the death pena lty before asking about the indiv idua l's feelings on the subjec t. Miller-El 537 U. S., at 332. The ab\u00ad strac t account went someth ing like this: \"I feel like it [is] only fair that we tell you our positi on in this case. The State of Texas ...i sactively seek ing the death pena lty in this case for Thomas Joe Miller-El. We anticipate that we will be able to present to a jury the quantity and type of evidence necessary to convict him of capit al murder and the quantity and type of evi\u00ad 14 The Cour t of Appea ls declined to give much weight to the evidence of racia lly motivated jury shuffles because \"Miller-El shuffled the jury ve times and the prosecutors shuffled the jury only twice.\" 361 F. 3d, at 855.

A yes answer to each of those questi ons resu lts in an automatic death pena lty from Judge McDowel l.\" App. 564-565. Only 6% of white venire panel ists, but 53% of those who were black, heard a different descr iption of the death pena lty be\u00ad fore being asked their feelings about it. This is an example of the graph ic script: \"I feel like you have a right to know right up front what our positi on is. Mr. Kinne, Mr. Maca luso and my\u00ad self, representi ng the people of Dallas County and the state of Texas, are actively seek ing the death pena lty for Thomas Joe Miller-El .... \"We do that with the anticipati on that, when the death pena lty is assessed, at some point Mr. Thomas Joe Miller-El\u2014the man sitting right down there \u2014will be taken to Hunts ville and will be put on death row and at some point taken to the death house and placed on a gurney and injected with a letha l subst ance until he is dead as a resu lt of the proceedi ngs that we have in this cour t on this case. So that' s basica lly our positi on going into this thing.\" Id., at 572-573 (alterati on omitted). The State concedes that this disparate questi oning did occur but argues that use of the graph ic script turned not on a panel ist's race but on expressed ambiva lence about the death pena lty in the preliminary questi onnaire .15 Prosecu\u00ad 15 So far as we can tell from the volumi nous record before us, many of the juror questi onnaires, along with juror informati on cards, were added to the habeas record after the ling of the petiti on in the District Cour t. See Supplement al Brieng on Batson/Swain Claim Based on Previously Unavai lable Evidence , Record in No. 00-10784 (CA5), p. 2494. The State raised no objec tion to receipt of the supplement al mater ial in the District Cour t or the Fifth Circuit, and in this Cour t the State has joined with Miller-El in proposi ng that we consider S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t tors were trying, the argument goes, to weed out noncom\u00ad mitt al or uncer tain jurors, not black jurors. And while some white venire members expressed oppositi on to the death pena lty on their questi onnaires, they were not read the graph ic script because their feelings were already clear . The State says that giving the graph ic script to these panel members would only have antagoni zed them. Brief for Re\u00ad spondent 27-32. This argument, howe ver, rst advanced in dissent when the case was last here , Miller-El v. Cockrell, supra, at 364- 368 (opinion of Thomas, J.), and later adopted by the State and the Cour t of Appea ls, simply does not t the facts. Look ing at the answers on the questi onnaires, and at voir dire testi answers on the questi on\u00ad tional copies in a joint lodg ing (apparently as an alternative to a more costly printing as part of the joint appendix). Neither party has referred to the prov ision that the reasonableness of the state-cour t deter mination be judged by the evidence before the state cour t, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(2), and it is not clear to what extent the lodged mater ial expands upon what the state judge knew; the same judge presided over the voir dire, the Swain hear ing, and the Batson hear ing, and the jury questi onnaires were subjec ts of reference at the voir dire. The last time this case was here the State expressly relied on the questi onnaires for one of its arguments, Brief for Respondent in Miller-El v. Cockrell, O. T. 2002, No. 01-7662, p. 17, and although it objec ted to the Cour t's considerati on of some other evidence not before the state cour ts, id., at 28-29, it did not objec t either to questi onnaires or juror cards. This time around, the State again relies on the jury questi onnaires for its argument that the prosecuti on's dispar\u00ad ate questi oning was not based on race. We have no occasi on here to reach any questi on about waiver under \u00a7 2254( d)(2). It is worth noting that if we excluded the lodged mater ial in this case , the State's arguments would fare even worse than they do. The panel members' cards and answers to the questi onnaires were the only items of informati on that the prosecutors had about them, other than their appear\u00ad ances, before reach ing the point of choosi ng whether to employ the graph ic script; if we excluded considerati on of the questi onnaires, the State would be left with no basis even to argue extenuati on of the extreme racia l dis\u00ad parity in the use of the graph ic script. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: the Cour t naires,16 we nd that black venire members were more likely than nonblacks to receive the graph ic script regardless of their expressi ons of certainty or ambiva lence about the death pena lty, and the State's chosen explanati on for the graph ic script fails in the cases of four out of the eight black panel members who received it.17 Two of them, Janice Mackey and Anna Keaton, clear ly stated oppositi on to the death pena lty but they received the graph ic script,18 while the black panel members Wayman Kennedy and Jeannette Butler were unambig uously in favor 19 but got the graph ic 16 We con ne our analysis to these sources because the questi onnaires and any testi mony about their answers prov ided the only informati on available to prosecutors about venire members' views on the death pena lty before they decided whether to use the graph ic script. 17 The dissent has conduc ted a similar statistica l analysis that it contends suppor ts the State's argument that the graph ic script was used to expose the true feelings of jurors who professed ambiva lence about the death pena lty on their questi onnaires. See post, at 296-302. A few examples sufce to show that the dissent' s conclusi ons rest on charac terizations of panel members' questi onnaire responses that we consider implausible . In the dissent' s analysis, for example , Keaton Mackey were ambiva lent, despite Keaton' s questi onnaire response that she did not believe in the death pena lty and felt it was not for her to punish anyone , Joint Lodg ing 55, and Mackey' s response that \"[t]hou shall [n]ot kill,\" id., at 79. But we believe neither can be fairly charac terized as someone who might turn out to be a juror accept able to the State upon pointed questi oning. The dis\u00ad Sztybel' s questi onnaire stated that she believed in the death pena lty \"[i]f a person is found guilty of murder or other crime...w ithout a valid defense\" because \"[t]hey may conti nue to do this again and again.\" Id., at 184.

But if we posit instead that the prosecutors' rst objec t was to use the graph ic script to make a case for excludi ng black panel members opposed to or ambiva lent about the death pena lty, there is a much tighter t of fact and explanati on.29 Of the 10 30% received the graph ic treatment.31 But of the seven blacks who expressed ambiva lence or oppo\u00ad sition,32 86% heard ambiva lence explanati on and Miller-El' s racia l one, race is much the better , and the reasonable inference is that race was the major considerati on when the prosecuti on chose to follow the graph ic script. 26 App. 775 (Gutierrez); id., at 547 (Moses); 4 Record 1569 (Vickery). 27 These were Linda Baker , Joint Lodg ing 71; Paul Bailey, id., at 63; Carrol Boggess, id., at 38; and Troy Woods, id., at 207. 28 App. 294 (Boggess); id., at 652-653 (Baker); id., at 405-406 (Woods); id., at 737 (Bailey). 29 The dissent posits that prosecutors did not use the graph ic script with panel members opposed to the death pena lty because it would only have antagoni zed them. See post, at 301. No answer is offered to the ques\u00ad tion why a prosecutor would take care with the feelings of a panel member he would excuse for cause or strike yet would antagoni ze an ambiva lent member whose feelings he wanted to smoke out, but who might turn out to be an accept able juror . 30 These were John Nelson, 2 Record 625; James Holtz, id., at 1022; Moses, 3 id., at at 624; Evans, id., at 627-628; Gutierrez, Joint Lodg ing 231. 31 These were Desinise, App. 573; Evans, id., at 626; and Gutierrez, id., at 775. 32 These were Jerry Mosley , 7 Record 2658; Baker , Joint Lodg id., at 79; Boggess, id., at 38; and Woods, id., at 207. 33 Only Mosley did not.

S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The same is true for another kind of disparate questi on\u00ad ing, which might fairly be called trickery . The prosecutors asked members of the panel how low a sentence they would consider imposi ng for murder . Most potentia l jurors were rst told that Texas law prov ided for a minimum term of ve years, but some members of the panel were not, and if a panel member then insisted on a minimum above ve years, the prosecutor would suppress his normal preference for tough jurors and claim cause to strike. Two Terms ago, we descr ibed how this disparate questi oning was correlated with race: \"Ninety-four percent of whites were informed of the statutory minimum sentence , compared [with] only twelve and a half percent of African-Amer icans. No explanati on is proffered for the statistica l dispar ity. Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U. S. 354, 361-362 (1939) (' \"The fact that the testi mony challenged by evidence appropr iately direc t, cannot be brushed aside .\" Had there been evidence obtainable to contradic t and disprove the testi mony offered by petiti oner , it cannot be assumed that the State have refrai ned from introduci ng it' (quoti ng Norris v. Alabam a, 587, 594-595 (1935))). Indeed, while petiti oner 's appea l was pendi ng before the Texas Cour t of Criminal Ap\u00ad peals, that cour t found a Batson violati on where this precise line of disparate questi oning on mandatory mini\u00ad mums was employed by one of the same prosecutors who tried the instant case. Chambe rs v. State, 784 S. W. 2d 29, 31 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). \" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 345. The State concedes that the manipu lative minimum pun\u00ad ishment questi oning was used to create cause to strike, Brief for Respondent 33, and n. 26, but now it offers the extenua\u00ad tion that prosecutors omitted the 5-year informati on not on the basis of race , but on stated oppositi on to the death the Cour t alty, or ambiva lence about it, on the onnaires and in the voir dire testi at 34-35. On the State's identi\u00ad cati on of black panel members opposed or ambiva lent, all were asked the trick questi on.34 But the State's rationale flatly fails to explai n why most white panel members who expressed similar oppositi on or ambiva lence were not sub\u00ad jected to it. It is entirely true, as the State argues, id., at 35, that prosecutors struck a number of nonblack members of the panel (as well as black members) for cause or by agree\u00ad ment before they reached the point in the standard voir dire sequence to questi on about minimum punishment. But this is no answer; 8 of the 11 nonblack indiv idua ls who voiced oppositi on or ambiva lence were asked about the accept able minimum only after being told what state law required.35 34 The State puts the number of black panel members who expressed oppositi on or ambiva lence at seven, and each received the minimum pun\u00ad ishment ruse. Bozeman, id., at 162; Fields, id., at Warren, id., at 213-214; Rand, id., at 270; Boggess, id., at 306-307; Kennedy , id., at 327- 328; and Baker , id., at 654. Woods, the State argues, had been revealed through questi oning as a suppor ter of the death pena lty, and accordi ngly he was told that ve years was the statutory minimum. As explai ned supra, at 241-252, Fields and Warren were neither ambiva lent nor op\u00ad posed; on our analysis of black venire members opposed or ambiva lent, all received the trick questi on, along with two proponents of capit al punishment. 35 Moses conr med at voir dire that she repor ted on her questi onnaire that she did not know the answer to Questi on 58, 3 Record 1141, although she did express suppor t for the death pena lty, App. 548.

Once again, the implica\u00ad tion of race in the prosecutors' choice of questi oning cannot be explai ned away .36 There is a nal body of evidence that conr ms this conclu\u00ad sion. We know that for decades leadi ng up to the time this case was tried prosecutors in the Dallas County ofce had followed a speci c policy of systematica lly excludi ng blacks from juries, as we explai ned the last time the case was here . pena lty, 6 Record 2423, but was not subjec ted to the script, id., at 2439. Whaley thought that she could not give the death pena lty without proof of premedit ation, even though Texas law did not require it, 10 id., at 3750, but she was not subjec ted to the script, id., at 3768. Hearn said that the death pena lty shou ld be given only to those who could not be rehabi litated, App. 429, but she was not subjec ted to the script, id., at 441. The three nonblacks who expressed ambiva lence or oppositi on and were subjec ted to the script were James Holtz, id., at 538; Margaret Gibson, id., at 514; and Fernando Gutierrez, 11-(B) Record 4397. 36 The dissent reaches a different statistica l resu lt that suppor ts the State's explanati on. See post, at 302-304. There are two flaws in its calculations. First, it excises from its calculations panel members who were struck for cause or by agreement, on the theory that prosecutors knew they could be rid of those panel members without resor ting to the minimum punishment ruse. See post, at 303. But the prosecuti on's cal\u00ad culation about whether to ask these manipu lative questi ons occurred be\u00ad fore prosecutors asked the trial cour t to strike panel members for cause and, frequently , before prosecutors and defense counsel would have reached agreement about remova l. It is unlikely that prosecutors were so assured of being able to remove certain panel members for cause or by agreement that they would forgo the chance to create additi onal grounds for remova l by employ ing the minimum punishment ruse. Second, as with its analysis of the panel ists receiv ing the graph ic script, the dissent charac terizes certain panel members in ways that in our judg ment are uncon vincing. For example , for purposes of the minimum punishment analysis, the dissent considers Colleen Moses and Noad Vickery to be pan\u00ad elists so favorable to the prosecuti on that there was no need to resor t to the minimum punishment ruse, post, at 304, yet the dissent acknowledged Moses' s and Vickery' s ambiva lent questi onnaire responses in its discussi on of the graph ic script, post, at 301. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: Opinion of the Cour t \"Although most of the witnesses [presented at the Swain hear ing in 1986] denied the existence of a system\u00ad atic policy to exclude African-Amer icans, others dis\u00ad agreed.

S. 231 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The Cour t of Appea ls concluded that Miller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the state cour t's nding of no discr imination was wrong , whether his evidence was viewed collectively or separately . 361 F. 3d, at 862. We nd this conclusi on as unsuppor table as the \"dismissive and strai ned inter pret ation\" of his evidence that we disap\u00ad proved when we decided Miller-El was entitled to a cate of appea lability. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, supra, at 344. It is true, of course , that at some points the signi\u00ad cance of Miller-El' s evidence is open to judg ment calls, but when this evidence on the issues raised is viewed cumu la\u00ad tively its direc tion is too power ful to conclude anyth ing but discr imination. In the course of draw ing a jury to try a black defendant, 10 of the 11 qualied black venire panel members were pe\u00ad remptor ily struck. At least two of them, Fields and Warren, were ostensibly accept able to prosecutors seek ing a death verdic t, and Fields was ideal. The prosecutors' chosen race-neutra l reasons for the strikes do not hold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is the fair con\u00ad clusi on, indicati ng the very discr imination the explanati ons were meant to deny . The strikes that drew these incredible explanati ons oc\u00ad curred in a selec tion process replete with evidence that the prosecutors were selec ting and rejecting potentia l jurors be\u00ad cause of race. At least two of the jury shuffles conduc ted by the State make no sense except as effor ts to delay consid\u00ad erati on of black jury panel ists to the end of the week, when they might not even be reached. The State has in fact never offered any other explanati on. Nor has the State denied that disparate lines of questi oning were pursued: 53% of black 3% of nonblacks were questi oned with a graph ic script meant to induce qualms about apply ing the death pena lty (and thus explai n a strike), and 100% of blacks but only 27% of nonblacks were subjec ted to a trick questi on about the minimum accept able pena lty , J., concurr ing meant to induce a disqua lifying answer . prosecutors' questi oning of particular witnesses on nonracia l grounds t the evidence less well than the racia lly discr iminatory hypothesis. If anyth ing more is needed for an undeniable explanati on of what was going on, history suppl ies it. The prosecutors took their cues from a 20-year-old manua l of tips on jury selec tion, as shown by their notes of the race of each poten\u00ad tial juror . By the time a jury was chosen, the State had peremptor ily challenged 12% of qualied nonblack panel members, but eliminated 91% of the black ones. It blinks reality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren, included in that 91%, because they were black. The strikes correlate with no fact as well as they correlate with race , and they occurred during a selec tion infected by shuf\u00ad fling and disparate questi oning that race explai ns better than any race-neutra l reason advanced by the State. The State's pretextua l positi ons conr m Miller-El' s claim, and the prose\u00ad cutors' own notes proclai m that the Spar ling Manua l's em\u00ad phasis on race was on their minds when they considered every potentia l juror . The state cour t's conclusi on that the prosecutors' strikes of Fields and Warren were not racia lly deter mined is shown up as wrong to a clear and convincing degree; the state cour t's conclusi on was unreasonable as well as erroneous. The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls is reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of judg ment for petiti oner together with orders of appropr iate relief. It is so ordered. Justice Breyer, concurr ing. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the Cour t adopted a burden-sh ifting rule desig ned to ferret out the unconstituti onal use of race in jury selec tion. In his sepa\u00ad rate opinion, Justice Thurgood Marsha ll predic ted that the Cour t's rule would not achieve its goal. The only way to 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 267 Cite as: U. S. 231 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing \"end the racia l discr imination that peremptor ies inject into the jury-selec tion process, \" he concluded, was to \"eliminat[e] peremptory challenges entirely .\" Id., at 102-103 (concur\u00ad ring opinion). Today' s case reinforces Justice Marshall's concer ns. I To begin with, this case illustrates the prac tical problems of proof that Justice Marsha ll descr ibed. As the Cour t's opinion makes clear , Miller-El marsha led extensive evidence of racia l bias. But despite the streng th of his claim, Miller- El's challenge has resu lted in 17 years l and 8 different judicia l opinions, and involv ing 23 judges, of whom 6 found the Batson standard violated and 16 the contrary . The complexity of this process reflec ts the difcu lty of nding a legal objec tively measure the in\u00ad herently subjec tive reasons that lie use of a peremp\u00ad tory challenge . Batson seeks to square this circle by (1) requir ing defendants to establish a prima facie case of discr imination, (2) asking prosecutors then to offer a race\u00ad neutra l explanati on for their use of the peremptory , and then (3) requir ing defendants to prove that the neutra l reason offered is pretextua l. See ante, at 239. But Batson em\u00ad bodies defec ts intrinsic to the task. At Batson's rst step, litigants remai n free to misuse pe\u00ad remptory challenges as long as the strikes fall below the prima facie threshold level. See 476 U. S., at 105 (Marsha ll, J., concurr ing). At Batson's second step, prosecutors need only tender a neutra l reason, not a \"persuasive , or even plau\u00ad sible ,\" one. Purke tt Elem, 514 U. S. 765, 768 (1995) (per curiam); see also id., at 766 (\" 'must aches and the beards look suspici ous' \"). And most impor tantly , at step three , Batson asks judges to engage in the awkward, someti me hopeless, task of second-g uessi ng a prosecutor 's instinctive judg ment \u2014the under lying basis for which may be invisible 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES J., concurr ing even to the prosecutor exercisi ng the challenge .

And it has held that equa l protec tion principles proh ibit excusi ng jurors on account of gender . See J. E. B. v. Alabam a ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127 (1994). Some lower cour ts have extended Batson's rule to religious afliation as well. See, e. g., United States v. Brown, 352 F. 3d 654, 668-669 (CA2 2003); State v.

On the other hand, the use of race- and gender-based ste\u00ad reoty pes in the seems better orga\u00ad nized and more systemati zed than ever before . See, e. g., Post, A Loaded Box of Stereoty pes: Despite 'Batson, ' Race , Gender Play Big Roles in Jury Selec tion., Nat. L. J., Apr. 25, 2005, pp. 1, 18 (discussi ng common reliance on race and gender in jury selec tion). For example , one jury-selec tion as age, occupati on, and marital status\u2014i n additi on to race as well as gender . See V. Starr & M. McCor mick, Jury Selec\u00ad tion 193-200 (3d ed. 2001).

Finally, a jury system without peremptor ies is no longer unth inkable . Members of the legal professi on have begun serious considerati on of that possibi lity. See, e. State, 1992) (Hubbar t, J., concurr ing); Broder ick, Why the Peremptory Challenge Shou ld Be Abol ished, 65 Temp. L. Rev. 369 (1992) (authored by Seni or Judge on the U. S.

And England, a common-law jurisdic tion that has eliminated peremptory challenges, conti nues to admi nister fair trials based largely on random jury selec tion. See Criminal Justice Act, 1988, ch. 33, \u00a7 118(1), 22 Halsbury' s Statutes 357 (4th ed. 2003 reis\u00ad sue) (U. K.); see also 2 Jury Serv ice in Victoria, Final Repor t, ch. 5, p. 165 (Dec. 1997) (1993 study of English barr isters showed major ity suppor t for system without peremptory challenges). III I recog nize that peremptory challenges have a long histor\u00ad ical pedigree . They may help to reassure a party of the fair\u00ad ness of the jury. But long ago, Blackstone recog nized the peremptory challenge as an \"arbitrary and capr icious species of [a] challenge .\" 4 W. Blackstone , Comment aries on the Laws of England 346 (1769). If used to express stereoty pi\u00ad cal judg ments about race , gender , religion, or national origin, peremptory challenges betray the jury' s democratic origins and under mine its represent ative func tion. See PGT: OPIN 273 Cite as: S. 231 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing Tocque ville, Democracy in America 287 (H. Reeve transl., rev. ed. 1900) (\"[T]he instituti on of the jury raises the people . . . to the bench of judicia l author ity [and] invests [them ] with the direc tion of society\"); 94-96 (1998) (descr ibing the Founders' vision of juries as venues for democratic participati on); see also Stevens, Foreword, Symposium: The Jury The Amer ld not be denied the oppor tunity to serve as jurors unless an impar tial judge states a reason for the denia l, as with a strike for cause). The \"scienti c\" use of peremptory challenges may also contr ibute to publ ic cynicism about the fairness of the jury system and its role in Amer ican gover n\u00ad ment. See, e. g., S. O'Connor , Juries: They May Be Broke , But We Can Fix Them, Chaut auqua Instituti on Lecture , July 6, 1995. And, of course , the right to a jury free of discr imi\u00ad natory taint is constituti onally protec ted\u2014the right to use peremptory challenges is not. See Stilson v. United States, 250 U. S. 583, 586 (1919); see also Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 88 (1988) (defendant' s loss of a peremptory challenge does not violate his right to an impar tial jury). Justice Goldberg , dissenti ng in Swain v. Alabam a, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), wrote , \"Were it necessary to make an abso\u00ad lute choice between the right of a defendant to have a jury chosen in confor mity with the requirements of the Four\u00ad teenth Amendment and the right to challenge peremptor ily, the Constituti on compels a choice of the former.\" Id., at 244; see also Batson, 476 U. S., at 107 (Marsha ll, J., concur\u00ad ring) (same); Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 630 (opinion for the Cour t by Kennedy , J.) (\"[I]f race stereoty pes are the price for accept ance of a jury panel as fair, the price is too high to meet the standard of the Constituti on\"). This case suggests the need to confront that choice . In light of the considera\u00ad tions I have menti oned, I believe it necessary to reconsider Batson's test and the peremptory challenge system as a whole . With that qualicati on, I join the Thomas, J., dissenti ng Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join, dissenti ng. In the early morning hours of November 16, 1985, peti\u00ad tioner Thomas Joe Miller-El and an accompl ice, Kennard Flowers, robbed a Holiday Inn in Dallas, Texas. Miller-El and Flowers bound and gagged hotel employees Dona ld Hall and Doug Walker, and then laid them face down on the floor . When Flowers refused to shoot them, Miller-El shot each twice in the back, killing Walker and render ing Hall a para\u00ad pleg ic. Miller-El was convicted of capit al murder by a jury composed of seven white fema les, two white males, a black male, a Filipino male, and a Hispanic male. For near ly 20 years now, Miller-El has contended that prosecutors peremptor ily struck potentia l jurors on the basis of race. In that time, seven state and six federa l judges have reviewed the evidence and found no error . This Cour t concludes other wise, because it relies on evidence never pre\u00ad sented to the Texas state cour ts. That evidence does not, much less \"clear[ ly] and convincing[ly],\" show that the State racia lly discr iminated against potentia l jurors. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( e)(1). However, we ought not even to consider it: In decidi ng whether to grant Miller-El relief, we may look only to \"the evidence presented in the State cour t proceedi ng.\" 2254( d)(2). The major ity that restr iction on our review to grant Miller-El relief. I respec tfully dissent. I Miller-El requests federa l habeas relief from a state-cour t judg ment, and hence our review is control led by the Antiter\u00ad rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A), 110 Stat. 1214. Because Miller-El' s claim of racia l discr imi\u00ad nation in jury selec tion was adjudicated on the merits in Texas state cour t, AEDP A direc ts that a writ of habeas cor\u00ad pus \"shall not be gran ted\" unless the state cour t's decisi on \"was based on an unreasonable deter mination of facts in 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 275 Cite U. S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng light of the evidence presen ted in the State court proceed\u00ad ing.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(2) (emphasis added). To obtain habeas relief, then, Miller-El must show that, based on the evidence before the Texas state cour ts, the only reasonable conclusi on was that prosecutors had racia lly dis\u00ad criminated against prospec tive jurors. He has not even come close to such a show ing. The state cour ts held two hear ings, but despite ample , Miller-El presented that discr imination occurred during jury se\u00ad lection. In view of the evidence actually presented to the Texas cour ts, their conclusi on that the State did not discr imi\u00ad nate was eminently reasonable . As a close look at the state-cour t proceedi ngs reveals, the major ity relies almost entirely on evidence that Miller-El has never presented to any Texas state cour t. A Jury selec tion in Miller-El' s trial took place over ve weeks in February and March 1986. During the process, 19 of the 20 blacks on the 108-person venire panel were not seated on the jury: 3 were dismissed for cause , 6 were dis\u00ad missed by the parties' agreement, and 10 were peremptor ily struck by prosecutors. Miller-El objec ted to 8 of these 10 strikes, asser ting that the prosecutors were discr iminating against black veniremen. Each time, the prosecutors a race-neutra l, case-related reason for exercisi ng the challenge , and the trial cour t permitted the venireman to be removed. The remai ning black venireman, Troy Woods, served on the jury that convicted Miller-El. At the completi on of voir dire, Miller-El moved to strike the jury under this Cour t's decisi on in Swain v. Alabam a, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), which required Miller-El to prove \"sys\u00ad tematic exclusi on of black persons through the use of pe\u00ad remptor ies over a period of time.\" Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 405 (1991). At the pretr ial Swain hear ing in March 1986, Miller-El presented three types of document ary evi\u00ad dence: the juror questi dissenti ng struck by the State; excer pts from a series of newspaper articles on racia l bias in jury selec tion; and a manua l on jury selec tion in criminal cases authored by a former Dallas County prosecutor . The voir dire transcr ipt was part of the ofcia l record. Miller-El, howe ver, introduced none of the other 98 juror questi onnaires, no juror cards, and no evidence related to jury shuffl ing. See ante, at 256-257, n. 15. Miller-El also presented nine witnesses, ve of whom had spent time as prosecutors in the Dallas County District At\u00ad torney's (D. A.) Ofce and ve of whom were current or for\u00ad mer judges in Dallas County . Their testi mony made three things clear . First, D. A.'s Ofce had never includi ng the county' s Chief Publ ic Defender as well as one of the rst black prose\u00ad cutors to serve in the D. A.'s Ofce . App. 842 (Baraka); id., at 846-848 (Tait); id., at 860 (Entz); id., at 864 (Kinkeade). Second, witnesses testi ed that, despite the absence of any ofcia l policy, indiv idua l prosecutors had almost certainly ex\u00ad cluded blacks in particular cases. Id., at 830, 833 (Hampton); id., at 841-842 (Baraka); id., at and most impor tant, no witness testi that the trial\u2014N orman Kinne, Paul Maca iminatory jury selec tion. Id., at 843 (Baraka); id., at 859 (Entz); id., at 863 (Kinkeade). The trial cour t concluded that, although racia l discr imination \"may have been done by indiv idua l prosecutors in indiv idua l cases, \" there was no evi\u00ad dence of \"any systematic exclusi on of blacks as a matter of policy by the District Attorney's ofce .\" Id., at 882-883. Miller-El was then tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. While his appea l was pendi ng, this Cour t decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986). Batson announced a new three-step process for evaluati ng claims that a prose\u00ad peremptory challenges OPIN 277 S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng \"First, a defendant must make a prima facie show ing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race[; s]econd, if that show ing has been made , the prosecuti on must offer a race-neutra l basis for strik\u00ad ing the juror in questi on[; and t]hird, in light of the parties' submissi ons, the trial cour t must deter mine whether the defendant has shown purposefu l discr imi\u00ad nation.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 322, 328-329 (2003) (Miller-El I). The Texas Cour t of Criminal Appea ls remanded Miller-El' s case for a hear ing to be held under Batson. B At the Batson hear ing in May 1988, before the same judge who had presided over his trial, Miller-El sought to estab\u00ad lish that prosecutors at his trial had struck potentia l jurors on the basis of their race. To make his prima facie case , Miller-El reintroduced some of what he had presented two years earlier at the Swain hear ing: the testi mony of the nine witnesses, the 10 juror questi onnaires, and the excer pted newspaper articles. App. 893-895. The cour t instructed the State to explai n its strikes. Id., at 898-899. Of the 10 peremptory strikes at issue , prosecutors had already ex\u00ad plained 8 at trial in response to Miller-El' s objec tions. The State therefore called Paul Maca luso, one of the prosecutors who had conduc ted the voir dire, to testi fy regardi ng his reasons for striking veniremen Paul Bailey and Joe Warren. Maca luso testi ed that he had struck Bailey because Bai\u00ad ley seemed rmly opposed to the death pena lty, even though Bailey tempered his stance during voir dire. Id., at 905- 906. This was accurate . Bailey expressed forcefu l opposi\u00ad tion to lty oned by Maca luso. See, Dire (herei nafter Rec\u00ad ord) (\"I don't believe in capit punishment. Like I said on [my juror questi onnaire ], I don't believe anyone has the right to take another person' s life\"); id., at 4112 dissenti felt \"[v]ery strong ly\" that the State shou ld not impose the death pena lty). Later , howe ver, when questi oned by de\u00ad fense counsel, Bailey said that he could impose the death pena lty if the State proved the necessary cumst overr uled the State's challenge for cause , the State exercised a peremptory challenge . Id., at 4168. Maca luso next testi ed that he dismissed venireman War\u00ad ren because Warren gave inconsistent answers regardi ng his ability to apply the death pena lty and because Warren' s brother had been recently convicted. App. 908-910. Maca\u00ad luso conceded that Warren was not as clear ly unfavorable to the State as Bailey. Id., at 911. Nevertheless, Maca luso struck Warren because it was early in the jury selec tion process and the State had plenty of remai ning peremptor ies with which it could remove marg inal jurors. Maca luso can\u00ad didly stated that he might not have removed Warren if fewer peremptor ies had been available . Id., at 910. After the State presented nonracia l, case-related reasons for all its strikes, the focus shifted to Batson's third step: whether Miller-El had \"carr ied curiam); Batson, supra, at 97-98. At this point, Miller-El stood his Swain evidence . App. 921. That evi\u00ad dence bore on whether some Dallas County prosecutors had discr iminated genera lly in past years; none of the evidence indicated that the prosecutors at Miller-El' s trial\u2014Ki nne, none lized expla\u00ad nations were pretextua l in Miller-El' s particular trial. Miller-El did not even attempt to rebut the State's racia lly neutra l reasons at the hear ing. He presented no evidence and made no arguments. Id., at 919-922. Nevertheless, the major ity concludes that the trial judge was unreasonable in nding as a factual matter that the 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 279 Cite U. S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng State did not discr iminate against black veniremen. Ante, at 266. That is not so \"in light of the evidence presented in the State cour t proceedi ng.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(2). From the scanty evidence presented to the trial cour t, \"it is at least reasonable to conclude\" that purposefu l discr imination did not occur , \"which means that the state cour t's deter mination to that effec t must stand. \" Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 11 (2002) (per curiam). II Not even the major ity is willing to argue that the evidence before the state cour t shows that the State discr iminated against black veniremen. Instead, it bases its decisi on on juror questi onnaires and juror cards that Miller-El' s new at\u00ad torneys unear thed during his federa l habeas proceedi ngs and that he never presented to the state cour ts.1 Ante, at 256- 257, n. 15. Worse still, the major ity marsha ls those docu\u00ad ments in suppor t of theor ies that Miller-El never argued to the state cour ts. AEDP A does not permit habeas peti\u00ad tioners to engage in this sort of sandbagg ing of state cour ts. A The major ity discusses four types of evidence: (1) the al\u00ad leged similarity between black veniremen who were struck by the prosecuti on and white veniremen who were not; (2) the apparent disparate questi oning of black and white veniremen with respec t to their views on the death pena lty and their ability to impose the minimum punishment; (3) the use of the \"jury shuffle\" by the on; and (4) D. A.'s Ofce in the selec\u00ad tion of juries. Only the last was ever put before the Texas cour ts\u2014and it does not prove that any constituti onal viola\u00ad 1 The supplement al mater ial appears in a joint lodg ing submitted by the parties. It includes the State's copies of questi onnaires for 12 prospec tive jurors (11 of whom served at Miller-El' s trial) and the State's juror cards for all 108 members of the venire panel. 545US1 Unit:$U61 dissenti occurred at Miller-El' s trial. The major ity's discussi on of the other types of evidence relies on documents like juror questi onnaires and juror cards that were added to the record before the District Cour t. The major ity's willingness to reach outside the state-cour t record and embrace evidence never presented to the Texas state cour ts is hard to fathom. AEDP A mandates that the reasonableness of a state cour t's factual ndings be assessed \"in light of the evidence presented in the State cour t pro\u00ad ceedi ng,\" 28 also circumscr ibes the ability of federa l habeas litigants to present evidence that they \"failed to develop\" before the state cour ts. \u00a7 Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 429-430 (2000). Miller-El did not argue disparate treatment or disparate questi oning at the Batson hear ing, so he had no reason to submit the juror questi onnaires or cards to the trial cour t. However, Miller-El could have developed and presented all of that evi\u00ad dence at the Batson eral cour t\u2014someth ing he do. Williams, supra, at 437 (\"Federa l cour ts sitting in habeas are not an alternative forum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made insufcient effor t to pursue in state proceedi ngs\"). For instance , there is no doubt that Miller-El' s supplement al ma\u00ad terial could have been \"pre viously discovered through the exercise of due diligence .\" \u00a7 2254( e)(2)(A)( ii). Just last Term, we summar ily reversed the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals for the Sixth Circuit for doing what the Cour t does 2 The juror questi onnaires had been in Miller-El' s possessi on since the 1986 Swain hear ing; Miller-El' s attor neys used them during the voir dire. But because Miller-El did not argue disparate treatment or questi oning at the Batson hear ing, Miller-El' s attor neys had no reason to submit the questi onnaires to the trial cour t. The juror cards could have been requested at any point under the Texas Publ ic Infor mati on Act. See Supplement al Brieng on Batson/Swain Claim Based on Previously Un\u00ad available Evidence (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng here: granti ng habeas relief on the basis of evidence not pre\u00ad sented to the state cour t. See Holland v. Jackso n, 542 U. S. 649, 652 (2004) (per curiam). We reafr med \"that whether a state cour t's decisi on was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the cour t had before it.\" Ibid.; see also Miller-El I, 537 U. S., at 348 (\"[P]etiti oner must onstrate that mination was 'objec light of the record before the cour t\"). In an about-face , the major ity now reverses the Cour t of Appea ls for the Fifth Circuit for failing to grant habeas relief on the basis of evidence not before the state cour t. By crediti ng evidence that Miller-El never placed be\u00ad fore the state cour ts, the major ity flouts AEDP A's plain terms and encourages habeas appl icants to attack state judg\u00ad ments collatera lly with evidence never tested by the original triers of fact. B The major ity presents three arguments for ignoring AEDP A's requirement that the state-cour t decisi on be unreasonable \"in light of the evidence presented in the State cour t proceedi ng.\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(2). None is persuasive . 1 First, without brieng or argument on the questi on, the major ity hints that we may ignore AEDP A's limitation on the record under \u00a7 2254( d)(2) because the parties have ignored it. Ante, at 256-257, n. 15. The major ity then quickly retreats and expressly does not decide the questi on. Ibid. But its retreat is as Un\u00ad less \u00a7 2254( d)(2) is waivable and the parties have waived it, the major ity cannot consider evidence outside the state-cour t proceedi ngs, as it concededly does. The major ity's venture beyond the state-cour t record is indefensible . Even if \u00a7 2254( d) is not jurisdic tional, but see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. Its ts rather than to indiv idua ls,\" id., at 344. Section 2254( d) speaks direc tly to federa l cour ts when it states that a habeas appl icati on by a state prisoner \"shall not be gran ted\" except under the speci or waivable . Through AEDP A, Congress sought to ensure that federa l cour ts would defer to the judg ments of state cour ts, not the wishes of litigants. Nevertheless, there is no need to decide whether \u00a7 2254( d)(2) may be waived, for the State has not waived it. Contrary to the major ity's asser tions, ante, at 256-257, n. 15, the State has argued that \u00a7 2254( d)(2) bars our review of cer\u00ad tain evidence not before the state trial cour t, Brief for Re\u00ad spondent 41-42, just as it did in its last appearance , see Brief for Respondent in Miller-El I, O.

The major ity is correc t that the State has not argued \u00a7 2254( d)(2) precludes considerati on of the juror questi onnaires and juror cards in particular, ante, at 256-257, n. 15, but the major ity does not asser t that the State may selec tively invoke \u00a7 2254( d)(2) to cherry-pick only favorable evidence that lies outside the state-cour t record. 2 The major ity next suggests that the supplement al mate\u00ad rial, particularly the juror questi onnaires, might not expand on what the state trial cour t knew , since \"the same judge presided over the voir dire, the Swain hear ing, and the Bat\u00ad son hear ing, and the jury questi onnaires were subjec ts of reference at the voir dire.\" Ante, at 257, n. 15. This is incorrec t. At the Batson hear ing, Miller-El introduced into evidence only the questi onnaires of the 10 black veniremen peremptor ily struck by the State. App. 893-895. The questi onnaires of the other 98 veniremen\u2014i ncludi ng many on which the major ity into ev\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 283 Cite S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng idence or other wise placed before the trial judge . Miller-El and the State had copies; the trial judge did not. Yet the major ity insinuates that the questi onnaires effec\u00ad tively were cour t because they \"were sub\u00ad jects of reference at the voir dire.\" Ante, at 257, n. 15. That is extremely misleadi ng on the facts of this case. Al\u00ad though counsel for Miller-El and the State questi oned wit\u00ad nesses partially on the basis of onnaire responses, the lawyers' references to questi onnaires were scattered and sporadic. Even the major ity does not attempt to show that the speci c questi onnaire responses on which it relies were called to the trial cour t's attenti on. Clear ly they were not called to the trial cour t's attenti on at the only time that mat\u00ad tered: the Batson hear ing. The major ity's insinuati on is doubly misleadi ng when cou\u00ad pled with its insistence that \"the transcr ipt of voir dire ... was before the state cour ts.\" Ante, at 242, n. 2. Miller-El' s arguments gave the state cour t no reason to go leang through the voir dire transcr ipt. What is more , voir dire at Miller-El' s trial lasted ve weeks, and the transcr ipt occupies 11 volumes number ing 4,662 pages. To think that two years after the fact a trial cour t shou ld dredge up on its own initia\u00ad tive passi ng references to unseen questi onnaires\u2014references than 4,600-page transcr unre\u00ad alistic. d)(2) demands that state cour ts be taken to task only on the basis of evidence \"presented in the State cour t proceedi ng.\" The 98 questi onnaires before questi onnaires Miller-El en\u00ad tered into evidence , were not \"presented\" to the state cour t. The major ity also asser ts that by consider ing the questi on\u00ad naires, it is only attempti ng to help the State. After all, the State claims that any disparate questi oning and treatment of black and white veniremen their questi on\u00ad naires, not their respec tive races. As the major ity sees it, if the questi onnaires are not proper ly before us, then the State cannot subst antiate J., dissenti ng This is a startling repudiati on of both Batson and AEDP A. A strong presumpti on of validity attaches to a trial cour t's factual nding at Batson's third step, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 364 (1991) (plura lity opinion); id., at 372 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment); see also Batson, 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21, and that presumpti on is doubly strong when the Batson nding is under collatera l attack in habeas, Miller-El I, 537 U. S., at 340. Thus, it is Miller-El' s burden to prove racia l discr imination under Batson, and it is his bur\u00ad den to prove it by clear and convincing evidence under AEDP A. Without the questi onnaires never submitted to the trial cour t, Miller-El comes nowhere near establishing that race motivated any disparate questi oning or treatment, which is precisely why the major ity must strai n to include the questi onnaires within the state-cour t record. That Miller-El needs the juror questi onnaires could not be clearer in light of how the Batson hear ing unfolded. After offer ing racia lly neutra l reasons for all of its strikes, the State could have remai ned silent\u2014as Miller-El did. How\u00ad ever, the State pointed out, among other things, that any disparate questi oning of black and white veniremen was based on answers given on the juror questi onnaires or dur\u00ad ing the voir dire process. App. 920-921. The State further noted that Miller-El had never alleged disparate treatment of black and white veniremen. Id., at 921. Because Miller-El did not dispute the State's asser tions, there was no need for the State to enter the juror questi onnaires into the record. There was noth ing to argue about. Miller-El had presented evidence which no one believes was sufcient in itself to prove a Batson violati on. That is why Miller-El, not the State, marsha led supplement al mater ial during his federa l habeas proceedi ngs. Without that evidence , he can\u00ad not prove now what he never attempted to prove 17 years ago: that the State's justi cati ons for its U. S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng 3 Finally, the major ity suggests that the 2-year delay be\u00ad tween the voir dire and the post-tr ial Batson hear ing is rea\u00ad son for weakened deference . See ante, at 241, n. 1. This is an argument not for setti ng aside \u00a7 2254( d)(2)' s limit on the record, but for relaxi ng the level of deference due state under factual ndings on ha\u00ad beas review, howe ver, does not depend on the manner in which the trial cour t reaches its factual ndings, for rea\u00ad sons I have explai I, supra, at 357-359 (dissenti ng opinion). The major ity leaves those arguments unanswered. The major ity's own argument is implausible on its face: \" '[T]he usua l risks of imprecisi on and distor tion from the passage of time' \" are far greater after 17 years than after 2. Ante, at 241, n. 1 (quoti ng Miller-El I, supra, at 343). The major ity has it just backward. The passage of time, as AEDP A requires and as this Cour t has held, counsels in favor of more deference , not less. At least the trial cour t, unlike this Cour t, had the benet of gaug ing the witnesses' prosecutors' supra, is neces\u00ad sary because a reviewing cour t, which analyzes only the transcr ipts from voir dire, is not as well positi oned as the trial cour t is to make credibi lity deter Batson, supra, at 98, n. 21. III Even taken on its own terms, Miller-El' s cumu lative evi\u00ad dence does not come remotely close to clear ly and convinc\u00ad ingly establishing that the state cour t's factual nding was unreasonable . I discuss in turn Miller-El' s four types of evi\u00ad dence: (1) the alleged disparate treatment and (2) disparate questi oning of black and white Ofce in the selec tion of juries. Although each type of evidence \"is open to judg ment calls,\" ante, at 265, the major ity nds that a successi on of unpersuasive arguments amounts to a compe lling case. In the end, the major ity's opinion is its own best refut ation: It strai ns to demonstrate what shou ld instead be patently obvious. A The major ity devotes the bulk of its opinion to a side-by\u00ad side compar ison of white panel ists who were allowed to serve and two black panel ists who were struck, Billy Jean Fields and Joe Warren. Ante, at 240-252. The major ity ar\u00ad gues that the prosecuti on's reasons for striking Fields and Warren apply equa lly to whites who were permitted to serve , and thus those reasons must have been pretextua l. The voir dire transcr ipt reveals that the major ity is mist aken. It is worth noting at the outset, howe ver, that Miller-El' s and the Cour t's claims have always been a mov ing target. Of the 20 black veniremen at Miller-El' s trial, 9 were struck for cause or by the parties' agreement, and 1 served on the jury. Miller-El claimed at the Batson hear ing that all 10 remai ning black veniremen were dismissed on account of race. That number dropped to 7 on appea l, and then again to 6 during his federa l habeas proceedi ngs. Of those 6 black veniremen, this Cour t once found debat able that the entire lot was struck based on race. Miller-El I, supra, at 343. However, 4 (Carrol Boggess, Roder ick Bozeman, Wayman Kennedy , and Edwin Rand) were dismissed for reasons other than race , as the major ity effec tively concedes. Ante, at 252-253, n. 11; Miller-El I, supra, at 351-354 (Scalia, J., concurr ing). The major ity now focuses exclusively on Fields and War\u00ad ren. But Warren was obviously equivoca l about the death pena lty. In the end, the major ity's case reduces to a single venireman, Fields, and its readi ng of PGT: OPIN 287 Cite S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng transcr ipt that is ambig uous at best. This is the antithesis of clear and convincing evidence . 1 From the outset of questi oning, Warren did not speci fy when he would vote to impose the death pena lty. When asked by prosecutor Paul Maca luso about his ability to im\u00ad pose the death pena lty, Warren stated, \"[T]here are some cases where I would agree , you know , and there are others that I don't.\" 3 Record 1526. Maca luso then explai ned at leng th the types of crimes that qualied as capit al murder under Texas law, and asked whether Warren would be able to impose the death pena lty for those types of heinous crimes. Id., at 1527 -1530. Warren conti nued to hedge: \"I would say it depends on the case and the circumst ances involved at the time.\" Id., at 1530. He offered no sense of the circumst ances that would lead him to conclude that the death pena lty was an appropr iate punishment. Maca luso then changed tack and asked whether Warren believed that the death pena lty accompl ished any socia l pur\u00ad pose Warren impos\u00ad sible to pin down: \"Yes and no. Someti mes I think it does and someti mes I think it don't. Someti mes you have mixed feelings about things like that. \" Id., at 1532. Maca luso then focused on what the death pena lty accompl ished in those cases where Warren believed it usefu l. Ibid. Even then, Warren expressed no rm view: \"I don't know . It's really hard to say because I know someti mes you feel that it might help to deter crime and then you feel that the person is not really suffer ing. You're taking the suffer ing away from him. So it's like I said, someti mes you have mixed feelings about whether or not this is punishment or, you know , you're relieving persona l punishment. \" Ibid. While Warren' s ambiva lence was driven by his uncer tainty that the death pena lty was severe 250-251, Thomas, J., dissenti ng that is beside the point. Throughout the exami nation, War\u00ad ren gave no indicati on whether or when he would prefer the death pena lty to other forms of punishment, speci cally life imprisonment. 3 Record 1532 -1533. To prosecutors seek\u00ad ing the death pena lty, reason for Warren' s ambiva lence was irrele vant. At voir dire, there was no dispute that the prosecuti on struck Warren not for his race , but for his ambiva lence on the death pena lty. Miller-El' s attor neys did not objec t to the State's strikes of Warren or Paul Bailey, though they objec ted to the remova l of every other black venireman. Both Bailey and Warren shared the same charac teristic: It was not clear , based on their questi onnaires and voir dire testi mony , that they could impose the death pena lty. See supra, at 277-278. In fact, Bailey was so clear ly struck for nonracia l reasons that Miller-El has never objec ted to his remova l at any stage in this case. There also was no questi on at the Batson hear ing why the prosecuti struck Warren. Maca luso testi ed: s statements on voir dire] were in\u00ad consistent responses. At one point he says, you know , on a case-by-case basis and at another point he said, well, I think\u2014I got the impressi on, at least, that he sug\u00ad gested that the death pena lty was an easy way out, that they shou ld be made to suffer more .\" App. 909. In additi on, Maca luso noted that Warren' s brother recently had been convicted for a crime involv ing food stamps. Id., at 909-910. This suggested that Warren might be more sympathetic to defendants than other jurors. Maca luso was quite candid that Warren was not as obviously disfavorable to the State as Bailey, and Maca luso stated that he might not have exercised a peremptory against Warren later in jury selec tion. Id., at 910-911. But Maca luso used only his 6th of 15 peremptory challenges Warren. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 289 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Accordi ng to the major ity, Maca luso testi ed that he struck Warren for his statement that the death pena lty was \" 'an easy way out,' \" ante, at 248 (quoti ng App. 909), and not for his ambiva lence about the death pena lty, ante, at 250- cally testi the Batson hear ing that he was trou\u00ad bled by the \"inconsisten[cy] \" of Warren' s responses. App. 909 (emphasis added). Maca luso was speak ing of Warren' s ambiva lence about the death pena lty, a reason whol ly un\u00ad related to race. This was Maca luso' s \"stated reason, \" and Maca luso ought to \"stand or fall on the plausibi lity\" of this reason\u2014not one concoc ted by the major ity. Ante, at 252. The major ity points to four other panel members\u2014Ke vin Duke , Troy Woods, Sandra Jenkins, and Leta Girard\u2014who supposedly expressed views much like Warren' s, but who were not struck by the State. Ante, at 248. Accordi ng to the major ity, this is evidence of pretext. But the major i\u00ad ty's premise is faulty. None of these veniremen was as dif\u00ad cult to pin down on the death pena lty as Warren. For in\u00ad stance , Duke suppor ted the death pena lty. App. 373 (\"I've always believed in having the death pena lty. I think it serves a purpose\"); ibid. (\"I mean, it's a sad thing to see, to have to kill someone , but they shou ldn't have done the things that they did. Someti mes they deserve to be killed\"); id., at 394 (\"If I feel that I can answer all three of these [specia l\u00ad issue ] questi ons yes and I feel that he's done a crime worthy of the death pena lty, yes, I will give the death pena lty\"). By contrast, Warren never expressed a rm view one way or the other . Troy Woods, who was black and who served on the jury, was even more suppor tive of the death pena lty than Duke . The major ity suggests that prosecutors might have allowed Woods to serve on the jury because they were runni ng low on peremptor ies or they wanted to obscure a patter n of dis\u00ad crimination. Ante, at 249-250. That dissenti ng can serve as \"clear and convincing evidence\" is error in its own right, but it is also belied by the record. Woods said that capit al punishment was \"too quick \" because defendants \"don' t feel the pain.\" App. 409. When asked what sort of punishment defendants ought to receive , Woods said that he would \"[p]our some honey on them and stake them out over an ant bed. \" Ibid. He testi ed that he would mete out such sentences because if defendants \"surv ive for a leng th of time, that would be enough punishment and . . . they wouldn't do it again.\" Id., at 410 (alterati on omitted). Woods also testi ed that he was a lifelong believer in the death pena lty, id., at 410-411; that he could impose death genera lly as a juror , id., at 413; and that he could impose death for murder during the course of a robbery , the speci c crime of which Miller-El stood accused, ibid. It is beyond cavil why the State accepted Woods as a juror: He could impose the punishment sought by the State. Nevertheless, even assumi ng that any of these veniremen expressed views similar to Warren' s, Duke , Woods, and Gi\u00ad rard were much later in the jury selec tion proc\u00ad ess, when the State had fewer peremptor ies to spare . Only Sandra Jenkins was questi oned early in the voir dire process, and thus only Jenkins was even arguably similarly situated to Warren. However, Jenkins and Warren were different in impor tant respec ts. Jenkins expressed no doubt whatso\u00ad ever about the death pena lty. She testi ed that she had re\u00ad searched the death pena lty in high school, and she said in response to questi oning by both parties that she strong ly believed in the death pena lty's value as a deterrent to crime. 3 Record 1074 -1075, 1103 -1104. This alone explai ns why the State accepted Jenkins as a juror , while Miller-El struck her. In additi on, Jenkins did not have a relative who had been convicted of a crime, but Warren did. At the Batson hear ing, Maca luso testi ed that he struck Warren both for Warren' s inconsistent responses regardi ng the death pena lty and for his brother 's conviction. Supra, at 278. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 291 Cite U. S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng The major ity thinks it can prove pretext by pointing to white veniremen who match only one of the State's proffered reasons for striking Warren. Ante, at 248. This dees logic. \" 'Similarly situated' does not mean match ing any one of severa l reasons the prosecuti on gave for striking a poten\u00ad tial juror\u2014it means match ing all of them. \" Miller-El I, 537 U. S., at 362-363 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng); cf. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC , 462 U. S. 669, 683 (1983) (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 discr imina\u00ad tion occurs when an employee is treated \" ' \"in a manner which but for that person' s sex would be different\" ' \" (quot\u00ad ing Los Angel es Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhar t, 435 U. S. 702, 711 (1978))). Given limited peremptor ies, prosecu\u00ad tors often must focus on the potentia l jurors most likely to disfavor their case. By ignoring the totality of reasons that a prosecutor strikes any particular venireman, it is the ma\u00ad jority that treats potentia l jurors as \"produc ts of a set of cook ie cutters, \" ante, at 247, n. 6\u2014as if potentia l jurors who share only some among many traits must be treated the same to avoid a Batson violati on. Of course jurors must not be \"identica l in all respec ts\" to gauge pretext, ante, at 247, n. 6, but to isolate race as a variable , the jurors must be compara\u00ad ble in all respec ts that the prosecutor proffers as impor tant. This does not mean \"that a defendant cannot win a Batson claim unless there is an exac tly identica l white juror .\" Ibid. It means that a defendant cannot suppor t a Batson claim by compar ing veniremen of different races unless the veniremen are truly similar. 2 The second black venireman on whom the major ity relies is Billy Jean Fields. Fields expressed suppor t for the death pena lty, App. 174-175, but Fields also expressed views that called into questi on his ability to impose the death pena lty. Fields was a deeply religious man, id., at 173-174, 192-194, and prosecutors feared that his religious convictions might make him reluc tant to impose the death dissenti ng fears were conr med by Fields' view that all people could be rehabi litated if introduced to God, a fear that had specia l force consider ing the specia l-issue questi ons necessary to im\u00ad pose the death pena lty in Texas. One of those questi ons asked whether there was a probabi lity that the defendant would engage in future violence that threatened society . When they reached this questi on, Maca luso and Fields had the following exchange: \"[MA CAL USO:] What does that word probabi lity mean to you in that connot ation? \"[FIELDS:] Well, it means is there a possibi lity that [a defendant ] will conti nue to lead this type of life, will he be rehabi litated or does he intend to make this a life\u00ad long ambiti on. \"[MA CAL USO:] Let me ask you, Mr. Fields, do you feel as though some people simply cannot be rehabi litated? \"[FIELDS:] No. \"[MACAL litated? \"[FIELDS:] Yes.\" Id., at 183-184. possibi lity of rehabi litation was ever-present and relevant to whether a defendant might commit future acts of violence . In light of that view, it is underst andable that prosecutors doubted whether he could vote to impose the death pena lty. Fields did testi fy that he could impose the death pena lty, even on a defendant who could be rehabi litated. Id., at 185. For the major ity, this shows that the State's reason was pre\u00ad textua l. Ante, at 244. But of course Fields said that he could fairly consider the death pena lty\u2014i f he had answered other wise, he would have been challengeable for cause. The point is that Fields' earlier answers cast signicant doubt on whether he could impose the death pena lty. The very purpose of peremptory strikes is to allow parties to 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 293 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng remove potentia l jurors whom they suspec t, but cannot prove , may exhibit a particular bias. See Swain, 380 U. S., at 220; J. E. B. v. Alabam a ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 148 (1994) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing). Based on Fields' voir dire testi mony , it was perfectly reasonable for prosecutors to suspec t that Fields might be swayed by a penitent defend\u00ad ant's testi mony .3 The prosecutors may have ied for noth ing about Fields' religious senti ments, but that does not mean they were instead worr ied about Fields' race. As with Warren, the major ity attempts to point to simi\u00ad larly situated nonblack veniremen who were not struck by the State, but its effor ts again miss their mark for severa l reasons. First, the major ity would do better to begin with white veniremen who were struck by the State. For in\u00ad stance , it skips over Penny Crowson, a white panel ist who expressed a rm belief in the death pena lty, but who also stated that she probably would not impose the death pena lty if she believed there was a chance the defendant could be rehabi litated. Ante, at 245, n. 5; 3 Record 1211. The State struck Crowson, which demonstrates that it \"was concer ned 3 The major ity argues that prosecutors mischarac terized Fields' testi\u00ad mony when they struck him. Ante, at 244. This is partially true but whol ly irrele vant. When Miller-El' s counsel suggested that Fields' strike was related to race , prosecutor Jim Nelson responded: \"[W]e're certainly not exercisi ng a preemptory [sic] strike on Mr. Fields because of his race in this case , but we do have concer n with reference to some of his statements as to the death pena lty in that he said that he could only give death if he thought a person could not be rehabi litated and he later made the comment that any person could be rehabi litated if they nd God or are introduced to God and the fact that we have a concer n that his religious feelings may affec t his jury serv ice in this case.\" App. 197 (alterati partially misst ated Fields' testi mony . Fields had not said that he would give the death pena lty only if a person was beyond rehabi lita\u00ad tion, id., at 185, but he had said that any person could be rehabi litated if introduced to God, id., at 184. This is precisely why prosecutors were concer ned that Fields' \"religious feelings [might ] affec about views on rehabi litation when the venireperson was not black. \" Ante, at 245, n. 4. Second, the nonblack veniremen to whom the major ity points\u2014 Sandra Hearn, Mary Witt, and Fernando Gutier\u00ad rez\u2014were more favorable to the State than Fields for vari\u00ad ous reasons.4 For instance , Sandra Hearn was adamant about the value of the death pena lty for callous crimes. App. 430, 451-452. Miller-El, of course , shot in cold blood two men who were lying before him bound and gagged. In additi on, Hearn's father was a specia l agent for the Federa l Bureau of Investigati on, and her job put her in daily cont act with police ofcers for whom she expressed the utmost admi\u00ad ration. Id., at 445-446, 457-460. This is likely why the State accepted Hearn and Miller-El challenged her for cause . Id., at 447, 467. In fact, on appea l Miller-El' s counsel had this to say about Hearn: \"If ever\u2014i f ever\u2014there was a Venireperson that shou ld have been excluded for cause from the Jury in this case , or any capit al Murder Jury, it was Venirewoman HEARN . It is hoped that the Lord will save us from future jurors with her type of thinking and beliefs.\" Id., at 1015 (emphasis added and alterati on omitted); see also id., at 1010. This same juror whom Miller-El' s counsel once found so re\u00ad pugnant has been transfor med by the major ity's revisionist history into a defense-prone juror just as objec tionable to the State as Fields. Ante, at 244. 4 In explai ning why veniremen Hearn, Witt, and Gutierrez were more favorable to the State than Fields, the major ity faults me for \"focus[i ng] on reasons the prosecuti on itself did not offer .\" Ante, at 245, n. 4. The major ity's complai nt is hard to underst and. The State accepted Hearn, Witt, and Gutierrez. Although it is apparent from the voir dire transcr ipt why the State wanted to seat these veniremen on the jury, it was never required to \"offer \" its reasons for doing so. If the major ity instead means that I focus on whether these veniremen opposed the death pena lty and whether they had relatives with signicant criminal histor ies, those are precisely the reasons offered by the State for its strike of Fields. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 295 Cite S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Mary Witt did not even have the same views on rehabi lita\u00ad tion as Fields: She testi ed to the commonplace view that some , but not all, people can be rehabi litated. 6 Record 2461. Moreover , Witt expressed strong suppor t for Id., at 2414 -2416, 2443 -2444. She that the death lty was appropr iate for the crime of mur\u00ad der in the course of a robbery , id., at 2428, or for a convict who was released from prison and committed murder (Miller-El previously had twice spent time in prison for armed robber ies), id., at 2462 -2463. This is likely why the State accepted Witt and Miller-El struck her. Id., at 2464 - 2465. Finally, Fernando Gutierrez testi ed that he could impose the death pena lty for brutal crimes. 11-(B) Record 4391 -4392. In fact, the only issue during voir dire was whether Gutierrez could apply Texas' more lenient pena lties, not its more severe -4414, 4431. The leng th, and ulti\u00ad mately he was accepted by both parties and seated on the jury. Id., at 4439 -4449. Third, Hearn, Witt, and Gutierrez were not similarly situ\u00ad ated to Fields even apar t from their views on the death pen\u00ad alty. Fields was dismissed not only for his prodefense views on rehabi litation, but also because his brother had severa l drug convictions and had served time in prison. App. 190, 199. Hearn, Witt, and Gutierrez did not have relatives with signicant criminal histor ies. Thus, there was an additi onal race-neutra l reason to dismiss Fields that simply was not true of the other jurors. Surely the State did not need to expend peremptor ies on all veniremen who expressed some faith in rehabi litation to avoid violati ng Batson. \"makeweight\" justi\u00ad cati on as to Fields' brother , ante, at 246, but it is the major i\u00ad ty's arguments that are contr ived. The State questi oned Fields during voir dire about his brother 's drug offenses, where the offenses occurred, whether his brother had been tried, whether his brother had been convicted, and whether 545US1 Unit:$U61 dissenti his brother 's criminal history would affec t Fields' ability to serve on the jury. App. 190. The State did not fail to en\u00ad gage in a \" 'meani ngful voir dire exami nation,' \" as the major\u00ad ity contends. Ante, at 246 (quoti ng Ex parte Travis, 776 So. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000)). The major ity also contends that the State's justi cati on as to Fields' brother illustrates pretext, because the State rst pointed to Fields' views on rehabi litation as the reason for its strike. Ante, at 245-246. The timing of the State's explanati on was unexcepti onal. In context, the State discussed Fields' brother at essentia lly the same time it discussed Fields' religious views. The entire exchange be\u00ad tween the State and counsel for Miller-El took place in a couple of minutes at most. App. 197-199. Thus, to call the State's second reason an \"afterthought, \" ante, at 246, ignores what is obvious even from a cold record: that the State simply offered both of its reasons in quick successi on. B Miller-El' s claims of disparate questi oning also do not t the facts. Miller-El argues, and the major ity accepts, that the prosecuti on asked different questi ons at voir dire of black and nonblack veniremen on two subjec ts: (1) the man\u00ad ner of executi on and (2) the minimum punishment allowed by state law. The last time this case was here , I refuted Miller-El' s claim that the prosecutors' disparate questi oning evinced racia l bias, and explai ned why it did not even entitle him to a certicate of appea lability. Miller-El I, 537 U. S., at 363-370 (dissenti ng opinion). This time, the major ity has shifted gears, claiming that a different set of jurors demonstrates the State's racia l bias. The major ity's new claim is just as flawed as its last. The State questi oned panel ists differently when their questi S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng reality that more nonblack veniremen favored the death pen\u00ad alty and were willing to impose it. 1 While most veniremen were given a gener ic descr iption of the death pena lty at the outset of their voir dire exami na\u00ad tions, some were questi that de\u00ad tailed method of executi on. Ante, at 255. Accordi ng to Miller-El and the major ity, prosecutors used the graph ic script to create cause for remov ing black veniremen who were ambiva lent about or opposed to the death pena lty. Ante, at 260. This is incorrec t. The jury questi onnaires asked two questi ons tly rele\u00ad vant the death Questi on 56 \"Do you be\u00ad lieve in the death pena lty?\" It offered panel ists the chance to circle \"yes\" or \"no,\" and then asked them to \"[p]lease explai n your answer \" in the prov ided space . E. g., Joint Lodg ing 6. Questi on 58 asked, \"Do you have any mora l, religious, or persona l beliefs that would prevent you from retur ning a verdic t which would ultimately resu lt in the exe\u00ad cution of another human being?\" and offered panel ists only the chance to circle \"yes\" or \"no.\" Ibid. Accordi ng to the State, those veniremen who a con\u00ad sistent stand on the death pena lty\u2014 either for or against it\u2014 did not receive the graph ic script. These prospec tive jurors either answered \"no\" to questi on 56 and \"yes\" to questi on 58 (meani ng they did not believe in the death pena lty and had qualms about imposi ng it), or answered \"yes\" to questi on 56 and \"no\" to questi on 58 (meani ng they did believe in the death pena lty and had no qualms about imposi ng it). Only those potentia l thereby indicati ng ambiva lence about the death pena lty, received the graph ic script. The questionnaires bear out this distinction. Fifteen blacks were questi oned during voir dire. Only eight of them\u2014or 53%\u2014received the graph ic script. All eight had 12:20:36] PAGES given ambiva lent questi onnaire answers regarding their ability to impose the death pena lty. There is no questi on that veniremen Baker , Bailey, Boggess, Woods, and Butler were ambiva lent in their questi onnaire answers. See ante, at 260, n. 27; 4 Record 1874 -1875.5 The major ity claims that Keaton, Kennedy , and Mackey were not ambiva lent, ante, at 258-259, and nn. 17, 19, but their questi onnaire answers show other wise. For instance , Keaton circled \"no\" for questi on 56, indicati ng she did not believe in the death pena lty, and wrote , \"It's not for me to punished [sic] anyone .\" Joint Lodg ing 55. However, she then circled \"no\" for questi on 58, indicati ng that she had no qualms about imposi ng the death pena lty. Ibid. Likew ise, Mackey she did not be\u00ad lieve in the death pena lty and wrote \"Thou Shall Not Kill\" in the explanati on space . Id., at 79. Mackey then said that she had no qualms, religious or other wise, about imposi ng the death pena lty, even though she had just quoted one of the Ten Commandments. Ibid. Keaton' s and Mackey' s answers cannot be reconci led, and the major ity makes no attempt to do so. Ante, at 258, n. 17. Kennedy wrote on his questi onnaire that he would impose the death pena lty \"[o]nly in extreme cases, such as multiple murders. \" Joint Lodg ing 46. This left prosecutors uncer tain about whether Kennedy could impose the death pena lty on Miller-El, who had murdered only one person (though he had para lyzed another). Of the seven blacks who did not receive the graph ic script, six took a stand on the death pena lty\u2014 either for or against it\u2014in their questi onnaires. There was no need to use the graph ic script to clarify their positi ons. Veniremen Boze\u00ad 5 The major ity's own recit ambiva lence . Ante, at 258-259, n. 19.

Venireman Mosley was the opposite: He said that he was opposed to the death pen\u00ad alty, 7 Record 2656, 2681, and that he denitely could not impose it, id., at 2669 -2670. The same appears true of ve\u00ad nireman Smith, 2 id., at 927-928, who was so adamantly op\u00ad posed to the death pena lty throughout her voir dire that she was struck for cause , id., at 1006. The only apparent excep\u00ad tion is venireman Carter. She said that she believed in the death pena lty, but wrote on the questi onnaire , \"Yes and no. It would depend on what the person had done .\" 4 id., at 1993 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). She then an\u00ad swered \" '[y]es' \" to questi on 58, she some with her ambiva lence , Carter did not receive the full graph ic script. Prosecutors told her only that Miller-El \"[would] be executed by letha l injection at Hunts ville.\" Id., at 1952. Thus far, the State's explanati on for its use of the graph ic script fares far better than Miller-El' s or the major ity's. Questi onnaire answers explai n prosecuto rs' use of the graph ic script with 14 out of the 15 blacks, or 93%. By con\u00ad trast, race explai ns use of the script with only 8 out of 15 veniremen, or 53%. The major ity's more nuanced explana\u00ad likew ise inferior to the State's. It hypothesi zes that the script was used to remove only those black veniremen ambiva lent about or opposed to the death pena lty. Ante, at 260. But that explanati on accounts for only 12 out of 15 veniremen, or 80%. The major ity cannot explai n why prose\u00ad cutors did not use the script on Mosley and Smith, who were opposed to the death pena lty, or Carter, who was ambiva lent. 6 The State's concer ns with Fields and Warren stemmed not from their questi onnaire responses, but from their subsequent voir Thomas, J., dissenti ng Because the major ity does not account for veniremen like Carter, and also mischarac terizes veniremen like Keaton, Kennedy , and Mackey , it arrives at different percent ages. This is not clear and convincing evidence of racia l bias. The State's explanati on also accounts for its treatment of the 12 nonblack veniremen (10 whites, 1 Hispanic, and 1 Fili\u00ad pino) on whom the major ity relies. Granted, it is more dif\u00ad cult to draw conclusi ons about these nonblack veniremen. With the blacks, 11 of their 15 questi onnaires are available; with the nonblacks, that number plummets to 3 of 12, be\u00ad cause those veniremen were not discussed before the state cour t. See supra, at 279. Nevertheless, the questi onnaires and voir dire permit some tentative conclusi ons. First, of the ve nonblacks who received the graph ic script\u2014Desinise, Evans, Gutierrez, Sztybel, and Zablan\u2014 four were his questi onnaire , Gutierrez an\u00ad swered both that he believed in the death pena lty and that he had qualms about imposi ng it. Joint Lodg ing 231. Szty\u00ad bel and Zablan averred that they believed in the death pen\u00ad alty and could impose it, but their written answers to ques\u00ad tion 56 made it unclear under what circumst ances they could vote to impose the death pena lty.7 Desinise is a closer call, but he was genui nely undecided about his ability to impose the death pena lty, and the parties struck him by agreement. 3 Record 1505 -1506, 1509, 1511, 1514. Of the ve nonblacks who received the graph ic script, Evans was the only one steadfastly opposed to the death pena lty. 6 id., at 2588 - 2589, 2591, 2595. Of the seven nonblacks who allegedly did not receive the graph ic script, four were strong ly opposed to the death pen\u00ad alty. See Miller-El I, 537 U. S., at 364-365 (Thomas, J., dis\u00ad 7 Joint Lodg ing 184 (Sztybel ) (\"If a person is found guilty of murder or other crime, which they have taken someone else' s life, without a valid defense . They may conti nue to do this again and again. Even if they are sentenced to jail when they are released this could keep happeni ng\"); id., at 223 (Zablan) (\"If it's the law the J., dissenti ng senti ng). Berk, Hinson, and Nelson were so opposed that they were struck for cause , and Holtz was struck by the State because he was opposed unless a policeman or reman was murdered. Ibid. Administer ing the graph ic script to these potentia l jurors would have been useless. \"No trial lawyer would willingly antagoni ze a potentia l juror ardently opposed to the death pena lty with an extreme portrait of its implement ation.\" Id., at 364. Of the remai ning three nonblacks, the major ity is correc t that Moses was ambiva lent in her questi onnaire responses, 3 Record 1140 -1141, 1177, although it is not certain that Vick\u00ad ery was, 4 id., at 1611. Neither received the graph ic script. However, the nal nonblack, Girard, conr ms the State's explanati on. It was not clear from Girard' s questi onnaire whether she was ambiva lent.8 On the stand, prosecutor Nelson started off with the abstrac t script. 6 id., at 2520 - 2521. But it quickly became apparent that Girard was \"just not real sure\" about her ability to impose the death pena lty, and she testi ed that she had not decided its value as a form of punishment. Id., at 2522 -2523. At that point, Nelson gave her the graph ic script\u2014for no other reason than to dis\u00ad cern her basic reac tion. Id., only did it succeed\u2014 Girard testi ed that she did not want to serve on a capit al jury, id., at 2529, 2531\u2014but Miller-El' s attor ney also used the graph ic script when he questi oned Girard, id., at 2553. Miller-El' s counsel was using the graph ic script just as the State was: to discer n a potentia l juror 's true feelings, not to create cause for remov ing a venireman. After all, Girard' s views were favorable to Miller-El. In any event, again the State's explanati on fares well. The State's explanati on accounts for prosecutors' choice be\u00ad tween the abstrac t and graph ic scripts for 9 of 12 nonblack 8 Girard did not answer questi on 56 about her belief in the death pena lty, 6 Record 2522, but she indicated in answer to questi on 58 that her persona l beliefs would not prevent her from imposi ng the death or 75%. Moses and Vickery were likely ambiva\u00ad lent but did not receive the graph ic script, while Evans was opposed to the death pena lty but did receive it. However, the major ity's theory accounts for the State's treatment of only 6 of 12 nonblacks, or 50%. The major ity can explai n why jurors like Moses and Vickery did not receive the graph ic script, because it believes the State was using the graph ic script primarily with blacks opposed to or ambiva\u00ad lent about the death pena lty. Ante, at 260. But the ma\u00ad jority cannot explai n the State's use of the script with an opposed nonblack like Evans, or ambiva lent nonblacks like Desinise, Girard, Gutierrez, Sztybel, and Zablan. Finally, the major ity cannot take refuge in any supposed dispar ity between use of the graph ic script with ambiva lent black and nonblack veniremen. Ante, at 257-259. The State gave the graph ic script to 8 of 9 ambiva lent blacks, or 88%, and 5 of 7 ambiva lent nonblacks, or 71%. This is hardly much of a difference . However, when the major ity lumps in veniremen opposed to the death pena lty, ibid., the dispar ity increases. The State gave the graph ic script to 8 of 11 ambiva lent or opposed blacks, or 73%, and 6 of 12 am\u00ad biva lent or opposed nonblacks, or 50%. But the reason for the increased dispar ity is not race: It is, as the State main\u00ad tains, that veniremen who were opposed to the death pena lty did not receive the graph ic script. In sum, the State can explai n its treatment of 23 of 27 potentia l jurors, or 85%, while the major ity can only account for the State's treatment of 18 of 27 potentia l jurors, or 67%. This is a far cry from clear and convincing evidence of ra\u00ad cial bias. 2 Miller-El also alleges that the State employed two differ\u00ad ent scripts on the basis of race when asking questi ons about impositi on of the minimum sentence . This disparate\u00ad questi oning argument is even more flawed than the last one. The evidence conr ms that, as the State argues, prosecutors 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 303 Cite U. S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng used different questi oning on minimum sentences to create cause to strike veniremen who were ambiva lent about or op\u00ad posed to the death pena lty. Brief for Respondent 33, and n. 26. Of the 15 blacks, 7 were given the minimum punishment script (MPS). All had expressed ambiva lence about the death pena lty, either in their questi onnaires (Baker , Boggess, and Kennedy) or during voir dire (Bozeman, Fields, Rand, and Warren).9 Woods expressed ambiva lence in ques\u00ad tionnaire , but his voir dire testi mony made clear that he was a superb juror for the State. See supra, at 289-290. Thus, Woods did not receive the MPS. There was no reason to give the MPS to Butler , Carter, Mosley , or Smith, all of whom were dismissed for cause or by agreement of the par\u00ad ties. That leaves Bailey, Keaton, and Mackey , all of whom were so adamantly opposed to the death pena lty during voir dire that the State attempted to remove them for cause . 11-(A) Record 4112, 4120, 3950, 3953 (Mackey). Because the State believed that it already had grounds to strike these potentia l jurors, it did not need the MPS to disqua lify them. However, even assumi ng that the State shou ld have used the MPS on these 3 veniremen, the State's explanati on still accounts for 7 of the 10 ambiva lent blacks, or 70%. The major ity does not seriously contest any of this. Ante, at 261-262, and n. 34. Instead, it contends that the State used the MPS less often with nonblacks, which demonstrates that the MPS was a ruse to remove blacks. This is not true: The State used the MPS more often with ambiva lent non\u00ad blacks who were not other wise removable for cause or by agreement. 9 In mak ing the decisi on whether to employ the MPS, prosecutors could rely on both the questi onnaires and subst antia l voir cause the minimum punishment questi oning occurred much later in the voir dire than questi oning about the death pena lty. Miller-El I, 537 U. S. 322, J., dissenti ng Of the nonblacks who reached the point in the voir dire sequence where the MPS was typically admi nistered, the major ity points to 11 whom it alleges were ambiva lent and shou ld have received the script. Ante, at 262, and n. 34. Three of these veniremen\u2014 Gibson, Gutierrez, and Holtz\u2014 were given the MPS, just like many of the blacks. Four of the remai ning eight veniremen\u2014Moses, Salsini, Vickery , and that Miller-El pe\u00ad remptor ily struck them.10 The State had no interest in dis\u00ad qualifying these jurors. Two of the remai ning four venire\u00ad men\u2014H earn and Mazza \u2014indicated that they could impose the death pena lty, both on their questi onnaires and during voir dire. The State likew ise had no interest in disqua lify\u00ad ing these jurors. Assumi ng that the State shou ld have used the MPS on the two remai ning veniremen, Crowson and Whaley, the State's explanati on still accounts for 9 of the 11 ambiva lent nonblacks, or 81%. Miller-El' s evidence is not even minimally persuasive , much less clear and convincing. C Miller-El' s argument that prosecutors shuffled the jury to remove blacks is pure specu lation. At the Batson hear ing, Miller-El did not raise , nor was there any discussi on of, the topic of jury shuffl ing as a racia l tactic. The record shows only that the State shuffled the jury during the rst three weeks of jury selec tion, while Miller-El shuffled the jury dur\u00ad ing each of the ve weeks. This evidence no more proves that prosecutors sought to eliminate blacks from the jury, than it proves that Miller-El sought to eliminate whites even more often. Miller-El I, 537 U.S., at 360 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng). 10 Moses gave ambiva lent answers on onnaire , as perhaps did Vickery . Supra, at 302. However, Moses and Vickery indicated during their voir dire testi mony that they could impose the death pena lty, 3 Rec\u00ad ord 1139 -1141; 4 id., at 1576 -1579, and thus they were not questi oned on minimum sentences. But see ante, at 263, n. 36. 545US1 Unit:$U61 [04-07-08 12:20:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 305 Cite S. 231 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Miller-El notes that the State twice shuffled the jury (in the second and third weeks) when a number of blacks were seated at the front of the panel. Ante, at 254. Accordi ng to the major ity, this gives rise to an \"inference\" that pros\u00ad ecutors were discr iminating. Ante, at 255. But Miller-El shou ld not be asking this Cour t to draw \"inference[ s]\"; he shou ld be asking it to exami ne clear and convincing proof . And the inference is not even a strong one. We do not know if the nonblacks near the front shared charac teristics with the blacks near the front, prov iding race-neutra l reasons for the shuffles. We also do not know the racia l compositi on of the panel during the rst week when the State shuffled, or during the fourth and fth weeks when it did not. More impor tantly , any number of charac teristics other than race could have been apparent to prosecutors from a visual inspec tion of the jury panel. See Ladd v. State, 3 S. W. 3d 547, 563-564 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Granted, we do not know whether prosecutors relied on racia lly neutra l reasons, ante, at 254-255, but that is because Miller-El never asked at the Batson hear ing. It is Miller-El' s burden to prove racia l discr imination, and the jury-shuffle evidence it\u00ad self does not prov ide such proof . D The major ity's specu lation would not be complete , how\u00ad ever, without its discussi on (block-quoted from Miller-El I) of the history of discr imination in the D. A.'s Ofce . This is noth ing more than guilt by associati on that is unsuppor ted by the record. Some of the witnesses at the Swain hear ing did testi fy that indiv idua l prosecutors had discr iminated. Ante, at 264. However, no one testi ed that the prosecutors in Miller-El' s trial\u2014N orman Kinne, Paul Maca luso, and Jim Nelson\u2014had ever among those to in racia lly discr iminatory jury selec tion. Supra, at 276. The major ity then tars prosecutors with a manua l entitled Jury Selec tion in a dissenti ng Spar ling Manua l), authored by John Spar ling, a former Dal\u00ad las County prosecutor . There is no evidence , howe ver, that Kinne, Maca luso, or Nelson had ever read the Manua l\u2014 which was written in 1968, almost two decades before Miller-El' s trial.11 The reason there is no evidence on the questi on is that Miller-El never asked. During the entire Batson hear ing, there is no menti on of the Spar ling Manua l. Miller-El never questi oned he never questi oned Kinne or Nelson at all. The major ity simply as\u00ad sumes that all Dallas County prosecutors were racist and remai ned that way through the mid-1980' s. Nor does the major ity rely on the Manua l for anyth ing more than show . The Manua l cont a single, admittedly line on race: \"Minority races almost always em\u00ad path ize with the Defendant. \" App. 102. Yet the Manua l also tells prosecutors not to selec t \"anyone who had a close friend or relative that was prosecuted by the State.\" Id., at 112. That was true of both Warren and Fields, and yet the major ity cava lierly dismisses as \"makeweight\" the State's justi cati on that Warren and Fields were struck because they were related to indiv idua ls convicted of crimes. Ante, at 246, 250, n. 8. If the Manua l is to be attributed to Kinne, Maca luso, and Nelson, then it ought to be attributed in its entirety . But if the major ity did that, then it could not point to any black venireman who was even arguably dismissed on account of race. Finally, the major ity notes that prosecutors \" 'marked the race of each prospec tive juror on their juror cards. ' \" Ante, at 264 (quoti ng Miller-El I, supra, at 347). This suffers from the same problems as Miller-El' s other evidence . Prosecutors did mark the juror cards with the jurors' race , sex, and juror number . We have no idea\u2014and even the ma\u00ad jority cannot bring itself to specu late\u2014whether this was 11 Judge Larry Baraka, one of the rst black prosecutors to serve in the D. A.'s Ofce , testi ed that, to the best of his recol lection, the Manua l was no longer used in 1977 when he attended the training course .

The reason we have no idea is that the juror cards were never introduced before the state cour ts, and thus prosecutors were never questi oned about their use of them. * * * Thomas Joe Miller-El' s charges of racism have swayed the Cour t, and AEDP A's restr ictions will not stand in its way. But Miller-El has not established, much less established by clear and convincing evidence , that prosecutors racia lly dis\u00ad criminated in the selec tion of his jury\u2014and he certainly has not done so on the basis of the evidence presented to the Texas cour ts.

Grable subsequently brought a quiet title action in state cour t, claiming that Darue's title was invalid because 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6335 required the IRS to give Grable notice of the sale by persona l serv ice, not certied mail. Darue removed the case to Federa l District Cour t as presenti ng a federa l questi on because the title claim depended on an inter pret ation of federa l tax law.

Whether Grable received notice is an essentia l element of its quiet title claim, and the federa l statute' s meani ng tant law in federa l cour t. The Gover nment has a strong interest in promptly collecting delinquent taxes, and the IRS' s ability to satisfy its claims from delinquents' proper ty requires clear terms of notice to assure buyers like Darue that the IRS has good title. Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a federa l-law issue , federa l jurisdic tion to disagreement over federa l tax title prov isions will portend only a microscopic effec t on the federa l\u00ad state division of labor . This conclusi on puts the Cour t in venerable company , quiet title actions having been the subjec t of some of the earliest exercises of federa l-questi on jurisdic tion over state-law claims. E. g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490-491. Pp. 314-316. (c) Merrell Dow Phar Thompso n, 478 U. S. 804, is not to the contrary . federa l claim resti ng in part on an allegati on that the defendant drug company had violated a federa l brandi ng law, the Cour t noted that Congress had not prov ided a private federa l cause of action for such violati ons.

If the federa l label ing standard without a cause of action could get a state claim into federa l cour t, so could any other federa l standards without causes of action. And that would mean an enor mous number of cases. A comparable analysis yields a different jurisdic tional con\u00ad clusi on here , because state quiet actions rarely involve contested federa l-law issues. Pp. 316-320. 377 F. 3d 592, afrmed.

With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor Gene ral Clemen t, Assistan t Attor ney Gene ral O'Conno r, Deputy Solicitor General Hungar , and Gilbert S.

The questi on is whether want of a federa l cause of action to try claims of title to land obtained at a federa l tax sale precludes remova l to federa l cour t of a state action with nondiverse parties raisi ng a disputed issue of federa l title law. We answer no, and hold that the national interest in prov iding a federa l forum for federa l on is sufciently subst antia l\u00ad questi on jurisdic tion over the disputed issue on remova l, which would not distor t any division of labor between the state and federa l cour ts, prov ided or assumed by Congress. I In 1994, the Inter nal Revenue Serv ice seized Mich igan real proper ty belong ing to petiti oner Grable & Sons Metal Produc ts, Inc., to satisfy Grable' s federa l tax delinquency . Title 26 U. S. C. \u00a7 6335 required the IRS to give notice of the seizure , and there is no dispute that Grable received actual notice by certied mail before the IRS sold the proper ty to respondent Darue Engineer ing & Manufac turing. Although Grable also received notice of the sale itself, it did not exercise its statutory right to redeem the proper ty within 180 days of the sale, \u00a7 6337( b)(1), and after that period *Mr. Zagran s led a brief for Jerome R. Miku Cite as: 545 U. S. 308 (2005) 311 Opinion of the Cour t had passed, the Gover nment gave Darue a m deed, \u00a7 6339. Five years later , Grable brought a quiet title action in state cour t, claiming that Darue's record title was invalid because the IRS had failed to notify Grable of its seizure of the proper ty in the exac t manner required by \u00a7 6335( a), which prov ides that written notice must be \"given by the Secret ary to the owner of the proper ty [or] left at his usua l place of abode or business. \" Grable said that the statute required persona l serv ice, not serv ice by certied mail. Darue removed the case to Federa l District Cour t as presenti ng a federa l questi on, because the claim of title depended on the inter pret ation of the notice statute in the federa l tax law. The District Cour t declined to remand the case at Grable' s behest after nding that the \"clai m does pose a 'signicant questi on of federa l law,' \" Tr. 17 (Apr . 2, 2001), and ruling that Grable' s lack of a federa l right of action to enforce its claim against Darue did not bar the exercise of federa l jurisdic tion. On the merits, the cour sum\u00ad ment to Darue, holdi ng that although \u00a7 6335 its l serv ice, subst antia l compl iance with the enough. 207 F. Supp . 2d 694 (WD Mich. 2002). The Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit afrmed. 377 F. 3d 592 (2004). On the jurisdic tional questi on, the panel thought it sufced that the title claim raised an issue of fed\u00ad eral law that had to be resolved, and implicated a subst antia l federa l interest (in constr uing federa l tax law). The cour t went on to afrm the District Cour t's judg ment on the mer\u00ad its. We granted certiorar i on the jurisdic tional questi on alone,1 543 U.

Opinion of the Cour t a federa l cause of action as a on for ng now afrm. II Darue was entitled to remove the quiet title action if Gra\u00ad ble could have brought it in federa l distr ict cour t originally, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1441( a), as a civil action \"arising under the Con\u00ad stituti on, laws, or treaties of the United States, \" \u00a7 1331. This prov ision for federa l-questi on invoked by and large by plaintiffs pleadi ng a cause of action created by federa l law (e. g., claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983). There is, howe ver, another longst andi ng, if less frequently encoun\u00ad this Cour t having recog nized for near ly 100 years that in certain cases federa l-questi on jurisdic tion will lie over state-law claims implicate signicant federa l issues. E. g., Hop\u00ad kins v. Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490-491 (1917). The doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federa l cour t ought to be able to hear claims recog nized under state law that nonetheless turn on subst antia l questi ons of federa l law, t to the exper ience , solicitude , and hope of uniformity that a federa l forum offers on federa l issues, see ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdic tion Between State and Federa l Cour ts 164-166 (1968). The classic example is Smi th v. Kan sas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180 (1921), a suit by a shareholder claiming that the defendant corporati on could not lawfu lly buy certain bonds of the Nati onal Gover nment because their Missour i law prov ided t federa l-questi on juris\u00ad diction because the principa l issue in the case was the federa l constituti onality of the bond issue .

The Smi th statement has been subjec t to some trimmi ng to t earlier and later cases recog nizing the vitality of the basic doctrine, but shying away from the expansive view that mere need to apply federa l law in a state-law claim will sufce to open the \"arising under \" door . As early as 1912, this Cour t had con ned federa l-questi on jurisdic tion over state-law claims subst antia lly in\u00ad volv[ e] [federa this v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569. This limitation was the ancestor of Jus\u00ad tice Cardozo' s later explanati on that a request to exercise federa l-questi on jurisdic tion over a state action calls for a \"common-sense of judg ment selec tive process which picks the subst antia l causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside .\" Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, 299 U. S. 109, 117-118 (1936). It has in fact be\u00ad come a const ant refrai n in such cases that federa l jurisdic tion demands not only a contested federa l issue , but a subst antia l one, indicati ng a serious federa l interest in claiming the ad\u00ad vant ages thought to be inherent in a federa l forum. E. g., Chicago v. International College of Surgeo ns, 522 U. S. 156, 164 (1997); Merrell Dow, supra, at 814, and n. 12; Franch ise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 28 (1983). But even when the state action discloses a contested and subst antia l federa l questi on, the exercise of federa l jurisdic\u00ad tion is subjec t to a possible veto . For the federa l issue will ultimately qualify for a federa l forum only if federa l jurisdic\u00ad tion is consistent with congressi onal judg ment about the sound division of labor and federa PRODUCTS, INC . v. DARUE ENGINEERING & MFG . Opinion of the t the appl ned that the appropr iateness of a federa l forum to hear an embedded issue could be evaluated only after consider ing the \"welter of issues regardi ng the interrelati on of federa l and state author ity and the proper management of the fed\u00ad eral judicia l system. \" Id., at 8. Because arising-under ju\u00ad risdic tion to hear a state-law possibi l\u00ad ity of upsetti ng the state-federa l line drawn (or at least assumed) by Congress, the presence of a disputed federa l issue and the ostensible impor tance of a federa l forum are never necessar ily dispositive; there must always be an as\u00ad sessment risdic tion. See Merrell Dow, 478 U. S., at 810. These considerati ons have kept us from stating a \"single, precise , all-embraci ng\" test for in nondiverse par\u00ad ties. Christianson v. Colt Indu stries Operating Corp., 486 U. S. 800, 821 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurr ing). We have not kept them out simply because they appeared in state rai\u00ad ment, as Justice Holmes would have done , see Smi th, supra, at 214 (dissenti ng opinion), but neither have we \"fed\u00ad a password openi any state action embraci ng a point of federa l law. Instead, the ques\u00ad tion is, does a state-law claim necessar ily raise a stated federa l issue , actually disputed and subst antia l, which a fed\u00ad without disturbi ng any congres\u00ad sionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibi lities. III A This case warrants federa l s state complai the Mich. Ct. Rule 3.411(B )(2)(c) (West 2005), and Grable has premised its super ior title claim on a failure by the IRS to give it adequate notice , as dened 315 Cite as: 545 U. S. 308 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t law. Whether Grable was given notice within the meani ng of the federa l statute is thus an essentia l element of its quiet title claim, and the meani ng of the federa l statute is actually in dispute; it appears to be the only legal or factual issue contested in the case. The meani ng of the federa l tax an impor tant issue of federa l law that sensibly belongs in a federa l cour t. The Gover nment has a strong interest in the \"prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes, \" United States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677, 709 (1983), and the ability of the IRS to satisfy its claims from the proper ty of delinquents requires clear terms of notice to allow buyers like Darue to satisfy themselves that the Serv ice has touched the bases necessary for good title. The Gover nment thus has a direc t interest in the availability of a federa l forum to vindicate its own admi nistrative action, and buyers (as well as tax delinquents) may nd it valuable to come before judges used to federa l tax matters. Finally, because it will be the rare state title case that raises a contested matter of federa l law, federa l jurisdic tion to resolve genui disagree\u00ad ment over federa l tax title prov isions will portend only a microscopic effec t on the federa l-state division of labor . See n. 3, infra. This conclusi on puts us in venerable company , quiet title actions having been the subjec t of some of the earliest exer\u00ad cises of federa l-questi on jurisdic tion over state-law In Hopkins, 244 U. S., at 490-491, the questi on was federa l jurisdic tion over a quiet title action based on the plaintiffs' allegati on that federa l mining law gave them the super ior claim. Just as in this case , \"the facts show ing the plaintiffs' title and the existence and invalidity of the instrument or record sought to be eliminated as a cloud upon the title are essentia l parts of the plaintiffs' cause of action.\" 3 Id., at 3 The quiet title cases also show the limiting effec t of the requirement that the federa l issue in a state-law claim must actually be in dispute to justi fy federa l-questi on jurisdic tion. In Shul McDougal, 225 U. S. 561 (1912), this Cour t found that there MET AL PRODUCTS, INC . v. DARUE ENGINEERING & MFG . Opinion of the Cour t 490. As in this case again, \"it is plain that a controversy respec ting the constr uction and effec t of the [federa l] laws involved and is sufciently real and subst antia l.\" Id., at 489. This Cour t therefore upheld federa l jurisdic tion in Hopkins, as well as in the similar quiet title matters of Northern Pacic R. Co. v. Sode rberg, 188 U. S. 526, 528 (1903), and Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo y Marcos , 236 U. S. 635, 643-644 (1915). Consistent with those cases, the recog nition of federa l jurisdic tion Dow Phar maceu ticals Inc. v. Thompso n, 478 U. S. 804 (1986), on which Grable rests its positi on, is not to the contrary . Merrell Dow considered a state tort claim resti ng in part on the allegati on that the defendant drug company had violated a federa l misbrandi ng proh ibition, and was thus presumptively negligent under Ohio law. Id., at 806. The Cour t assumed that federa l law would have to be appl ied to resolve the claim, but after closely exami ning the streng th of the federa l interest at stake and the implicati ons of open\u00ad ing the federa private federa l cause of action for violati on of the federa l brandi ng requirement, and the Cour t found \"it would... flout, or at least under mine, con\u00ad gressi onal intent conclude remedies for violati ons of that federa l statute solely because the violati on . . is 'proxi mate cause' under state law.\" Id., at 812. to hear a plaintiff's quiet title claim in part because the federa l statutes on which title depended were not subjec t to \"any controversy respec ting their validity , constr uction, or effec t.\" Id., at 570. As the Cour t put it, the requirement of an actual dispute about federa l law was \"especia lly\" impor tant in \"suit[ s] involv ing rights to land acquired under a law of the United States, \" because other wise \"every suit to establish title to land in the centra l and wester n states would so arise [under federa l law], as all titles in those States are traceable back to those laws. \" Id., at 569-570. [03-26-08 16:16:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 317 Cite 545 U. S. 308 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Because federa l law prov ides for no quiet title action that could be brought against Darue,4 Grable argues that there can be no federa Dow (includi ng the passage just that on its face suppor ts Grable' s positi on, see Note, Cour t: Federa State Merrell L. Rev. ng split in Cour ts of Ap\u00ad peals over private right of action requirement after Merrell Dow). But an opinion is to be read as a whole , and Merrell Dow cannot be read whole as over turning decades of prece\u00ad dent, as it would have done by effec tively adopti ng the Holmes dissent in Smi th, see supra, at 314, and converting a federa l cause of action from a sufcient conditi on for federa l-questi on jurisdic tion 5 into a necessary one.

And as a nal indicati on that it did not mean to make a federa l right of action mandatory , it ex\u00ad pressly approved the exercise of jurisdic tion sustained in Smi th, despite the want of any federa l cause of action avail\u00ad able to Smi th's shareholder plaintiff. 478 U.

That right of action is not relevant here , howe ver, because the Federa l Gover nment no longer has any inter\u00ad est in the proper ty, having transferred its interest to Darue through the quitclai m deed. 5 For an extremely rare excepti on to the sufciency of a federa l right of action, see Shosho ne Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S. 505, 507 (1900). 545US1 Unit:$U62 [03-26-08 16:16:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 318 MET AL PRODUCTS, INC . v. DARUE ENGINEERING & MFG . Opinion of the Cour t Merrell Dow then, did not toss out, but speci cally retained, the contextua l enquiry that had been Smi th's hallmark for over 60 years. At the end of Merrell Dow, Justice Holmes was still dissenti ng. Accordi ngly, Merrell Dow shou ld be read in its entirety as treati ng the absence of a federa l private right of action as evidence relevant to, but not dispositive of, the absence of l cause of action affec ted Merrell Dow's resu lt two ways. The Cour t saw the fact as worth some considerati on in the assessment of subst antia lity. But its primary impor tance emerged when the Cour t treated the combi nation of no federa l cause of action and no preempti on of state remedies for misbrandi ng as an impor tant clue to Congress' s concepti on of the jurisdic be exer\u00ad cised tion not as a missi ng federa l door key, always required, but as a missi ng welcome mat, required in federa l jurisdic state misbrand\u00ad ing action would have attrac ted a horde of original lings and remova l cases raisi ng other state claims with embedded federa l issues. For if the federa l label ing standard without a federa l cause of action could get a state claim into federa l cour t, so could any other federa l standard without a federa l cause of action. And that would have meant a tremendous number of cases. One only needed to consider the treatment of federa l viola\u00ad tions genera lly in garden variety state tort law. \"The viola\u00ad tion of federa l statutes and regulations is commonly given negligence per se effec t in state tort proceedi ngs.\" 6 Re\u00ad 6 Other jurisdic tions treat a violati on of a federa l statute as evidence of negligence or, like Ohio itself in Merrell Dow Phar maceu ticals Inc. v.

A genera l rule of exercisi federa l mislabel ing and other have gation,\" and ing to \"legisla\u00ad tive intent, \" Merrell Dow thought it improbable that the Congress, having made no prov ision for a federa l cause of action, would have meant to welcome any state-law tort case implicati ng federa l law \"solely because the violati on of the federa l statute is said to [create ] a rebutt able presumpti on [of negligence ]... under state law.\" 478 U.

Merrell Dow's analysis thus ts within the framework of exami ning the impor tance of having a federa l forum for the issue , and the consistency of such a forum with Congress' s intended division of labor between state and federa l cour ts. As already indicated, howe ver, a comparable analysis yields a different jurisdic tional conclusi on in this case. Al\u00ad though Congress also indicated ambiva lence in this case by prov iding no private right of action to Grable , it is the rare state quiet title action that involves contested issues of fed\u00ad eral law, see n. 3, mater ially affec t, or threaten to affec t, the normal currents of litigati on.

In an appropr iate case , and perhaps with the benet of better evidence as to the original meani ng of \u00a7 1331' s text, I would be willing to consider that course .* 7 At oral argument Grable' s counsel espoused the positi on that after Merrell Dow, federa l-questi on jurisdic tion over state-law claims absent a federa l right of action could be recog nized only where a constituti onal issue was at stake. There is, howe ver, no reason in text or other wise to draw such a rough line.

Back in state cour t, petiti oners attempted to reserve the right to retur n to federa l cour t for adjudicati on of their federa l takings to the Federa l District Cour t, advanci ng a series of federa l takings claims that depended on issues identica l to those previously resolved in the state cour ts. In order to avoid being barred from suit by the gen\u00ad eral rule of issue preclusi on, petiti oners asked the District Cour t to exempt their federa l takings claims from the reach of the full faith and credit statute , 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738. Rely ing on the Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.

Held: This Cour t will not create an excepti on to the full faith and credit statute in order to prov ide a federa l forum for litigants seek ing to ad\u00ad vance federa l takings claims. Pp. 336-348. (a) t rejects petiti oners' contenti on that whene ver plaintiffs reserve their federa l takings claims in state cour t under England v. Louisiana Bd. of Med ical Examine rs, 375 U. S. 411, federa l cour ts shou ld review the reserved federa l claims de novo, regardless of what issues the state cour t may have decided or how it may have decided them. The England Cour t's discussi on of the \"typical case\" in which reservati ons of federa l issues are appropr iate makes clear that the deci\u00ad sion was aimed cases fundamen tally disti nct petiti oners'. lly involve federa l constituti onal challenges to a state statute that can be avoided if a state cour t constr ues the statute in a particular manner . Id., at 420. In such cases, the purpose of absten\u00ad tion is not to afford state cour ts an to adjudicate an tionally identica l to the federa l questi on, but to avoid resolv\u00ad ing the federa l questi on by encourag ing a state-law deter mination that may moot the federa l controversy . See id., at 416-417, and n. 7. Addi\u00ad tionally, the Cour t made clear that the effec tive reservati on of a federa l claim was dependent on the conditi on that plaintiffs take no action to broaden the scope of the state cour t's review beyond decidi ng the ante\u00ad cedent state-law issue . Id., at 419. Because the Ninth Circuit invoked Pullm an abstenti on after deter mining that a ripe federa l questi on ex\u00ad isted as to petiti oners' facia l takings challenge , they were entitled to insulate from preclusive effec t that one federa l issue while they re\u00ad turned to state cour t to resolve their mandamus petiti on. Petitioners, howe ver, chose to advance broader issues than the limited ones in the mandamus petiti on, putti ng forth facia l and as-appl ied takings chal\u00ad lenges to the city ordinance in their state action. By doing so, they effec tively asked the state cour t to resolve the same federa l issue they had previously asked it to reserve . England does not suppor t the exer\u00ad cise of any such right. Petitioners' as-appl ied takings claims fare no better . The Ninth Circuit found those claims unripe under Williamson County, and therefore afrmed their dismissa l. They were never prop\u00ad erly before the District Cour t, and there was no reason to expec t that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedi ngs. Pp. 336-341. (b) Federa l cour ts free to disregard \u00a7 1738 simply to guaran\u00ad tee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federa l cour t. U. S. 323 (2005) Syllabus tioners misplace their reliance on the Second Circuit' s Santini decisi on, which held that parties who are forced to litigate their state-law takings claims in state cour t pursuant to Williamson County cannot be pre\u00ad cluded from having those very claims resolved by a federa l cour t. The Santini cour t's reasoni First, both petiti oners and Santini ultimately depend on an assumpti on that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federa l claims in a federa l forum. This Cour t has repeatedly held to the contrary . See, e. g., Allen v. McCur ry, 449 U. S. 90, 103-104. Second, petiti assumes that cour ts may simply create excepti ons to \u00a7 1738 where ver they deem them appropr iate. However, this Cour t has held that no such excepti on will be recog nized unless a later statute cont ains an ex\u00ad press or implied partial repea l. E. g., Kreme r v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 468. Congress has not expressed any intent to exempt federa l takings claims from \u00a7 1738. Third, petiti throughout this litigati on. Be\u00ad cause they were never required to ripen in state cour t their claim that the city ordinance was facia lly invalid for failure to subst antia lly ad\u00ad vance a legitimate state interest, see Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534, they could have raised the hear t of their facia l takings challenges direc tly in federa l cour t. With respec t to those federa l claims that did require ripeni ng, petiti oners state cour ts from hear ing simultaneously a plaintiff's request for compensati on under state law together with a claim that, in the alterna\u00ad tive, the denia l of compensati on would violate the Fifth Amendment of the Federa l Constituti on.

In order to avoid the bar of issue preclusi on, petiti oners asked the District Cour t to exempt from \u00a7 1738' s reach claims brought under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Petiti oners' argument is predicated on Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.

Unless cour ts disregard \u00a7 1738 in takings cases, petiti oners argue, plaintiffs will be forced to litigate their claims in state cour t without any realistic possibi lity of ever obtaining review in a federa l forum.

When the hotel fell into nancia l difcu lties and a \"dilapidated conditi on\" in the early 1970' s, Rober t and Thomas Field purchased the facility, restored it, and began to operate it as a bed and breakfast inn. See San Remo Hotel, L. P. v. City and County of San Franc isco, 100 Cal. Rptr . 2d 1, 5 (Cal. App. 2000) (ofcia lly depubl ished). In 1979, San Francisco' s Superv isors responded to \"a severe atorium on conversi on of residentia l hotel units into tour\u00ad ist units. San Francisco Residentia l Hotel 197a.

And that zoning deter mination ultimately meant that, despite the fact that the San Remo Hotel had operated in prac tice as a tour ist hotel for many years, 145 F. 3d, at 1100, petiti oners were required to apply for a conditi onal use permit to do business ofcia lly as a \"tour ist hotel, \" San Remo Hotel, L.

After the HCO was revised in 1990, petiti oners appl ied to convert all of the rooms in the San Remo Hotel into tour ist use rooms under the relevant HCO prov isions and requested a conditi onal use permit under the appl icable zoning laws. In 1993, the City Planni ng granted petiti oners' requested conversi only after imposi ng severa l conditi ons, one of which included pay a $567,000 was unconstituti onal and other wise improper ly appl ied to their hotel.

The City Board of Superv isors rejected petiti oners' appea l on April 19, 1993. 2 It seems that despite this initia l classi cati on, the San Remo Hotel has operated as a mixed hotel for tour ists and long-ter m residents since long before the HCO was enac ted.

That action lay dormant for severa l years, and the parties ultimately agreed to stay that action after petiti oners led for relief in Federa l District Cour t. Petitioners led in federa l cour t for the rst time on May 4, 1993. Petitioners' rst amended complai nt alleged four counts of due process (subst antive and procedura l) and takings (facia l and as-appl ied) 4 violati ons under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitu\u00ad tion, one count seek ing damages under Rev.

As relevant to this action, the cour t found that petiti oners' facia l takings claim was untimely under the appl icable statute of limitations, and that the as-appl ied tak\u00ad ings claim was unripe under Williamson County, 473 U.

See Williamson County, 473 U.

We therefore assume for purposes of our decisi on that all other issues in this protrac ted controversy have been correc tly decided. We assume , for instance , that the Ninth Circuit proper ly inter preted Cali\u00ad fornia preclusi on law; that the California Supreme Cour t was correc t in its deter mination that California takings law is coextensive with federa l law; that, as a matter of California law, the HCO was lawfu lly OPIN 338 SAN REMO HOTEL, L. P. v. CITY and COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO Opinion of the Cour t The essence of petiti oners' argument is as follows: because no claim that a state agency has violated the federa l Takings Clause can be heard in federa l cour t until the proper ty owner has \"been denied just compensati on\" through an avail\u00ad able state compensati on l [shou ld be] required decisi on of the state cour t\" in order to ensure that federa l takings claims can be \"considered on the merits in... federa l cour t,\" Brief for Petitioners 8, 14. Therefore , the argument goes, when\u00ad ever plaintiffs reserve their claims under England v. Louisi\u00ad ana Bd. of Med ical Examine rs, 375 U. S. 411 (1964), federa l cour ts shou ld review the reserved federa l claims de novo, regardless of what issues the state cour t may have decided or how it may have decided them. We reject petiti oners' contenti on. Although petiti oners were certainly entitled to reserve some of their federa l claims, as we shall explai n, England does not suppor t their erroneous expec tation that their reservati on would fully ne\u00ad gate the preclusive effec t of the state-cour t judg ment with respec t to any and all federa l issues that might arise in the future federa l litigati on. Federa l cour ts, moreover , are not free to disregard 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1738 simply to guarantee that all takings plaintiffs can have their day in federa l cour t. We turn rst to England. III England involved a group of plaintiffs who had graduated from chiroprac tic school, but sought to prac tice in Louisiana without comply ing with the educati onal requirements of the State's Medica l Prac tice Act. 375 U.

The Federa l District Cour t dis\u00ad missed the federa l action without addressi ng the merits of the federa l claim. On appea l, we held that when a federa l cour cour ts to address an antecedent state-law issue , the plaintiff may reserve his right to retur n to federa l cour t for the dispo\u00ad sition of his federa l claims. Id., at 419. In that case , the antecedent state issue requir ing abstenti on was distinct from the reserved federa l issue . See id., at 418-419.

Petitioners, howe ver, chose to advance broader issues than the limited issues cont ained within their state petiti on for writ of admi nistrative mandamus on which the Ninth Circuit relied when it invoked Pullm an abstenti on. In their state action, petiti oners advanced not only their request for a writ of admi nistrative mandate , 27 Cal. 4th, at 653, 41 P. 3d, at 93, but also their various claims that the HCO was unconstitu\u00ad tional on its face and as appl ied for (1) its failure to subst an\u00ad tially advance a legitimate interest, (2) its lack of a nexus between the required fees and the ultimate objec tives sought to be achieved via the ordinance , and (3) its impositi on of an undue economic burden on indiv idua l proper ty owners. Id., at 672-676, 41 P. 3d, at 106-109. By broadeni ng their state action beyond the mandamus petiti on oners effec tively state cour t to resolve the same federa l issues they asked it to reserve . England does not suppor t the exercise of any such right. Petitioners' as-appl ied takings claims fare no better . As an initia l matter , the Cour t of Appea ls did not abst ain with respec t to those claims. Instead, the cour t found that they were unripe under Williamson County. The cour t there\u00ad fore afrmed the District Cour t's dismissa l of those claims. 145 F. 3d, at 1106. Unlike their \"subst antia lly advances\" claims, petiti oners' as-appl ied claims were never proper ly be\u00ad fore the District Cour t, and there was no reason to expec t that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedi ngs.

For suppor t, peti\u00ad tioners rely on the Cour t of Appea ls for the Second Circuit' s decisi on in Santini, 342 F. 3d, at 130. In Santini, the Second Circuit held that parties \"who liti\u00ad gate state-law takings claims in state cour t involunt arily\" pursuant to Williamson County cannot be precluded from having those very claims resolved \"by a federa l cour t.\" 342 F. 3d, at 130. The cour t did not rest its decisi on on any prov ision of the federa l full faith and credit statute or our cases constr uing that law. Instead, the cour t reasoned that \"[i]t would be both ironic and unfair if the very procedure that the Supreme Cour t required [plai ntiffs] to follow before bringing a Fifth Amendment takings claim . . . also pre\u00ad cluded [them First, petiti oners and Santini ultimately depend on an assumpti on that plaintiffs have a right to vindicate their federa l claims in a federa l forum. We have repeatedly held, to the contrary , that issues actually decided in valid state\u00ad cour t judg ments may well depr ive plaintiffs of the \"right\" to have their federa l claims relitigated in federa l cour t. See, e. g., Migra v. Warren City Scho ol Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75, 84 (1984); Allen, 449 U. S., at 103-104. This is so even when the plaintiff would have preferred not to litigate in state cour t, but was required to do so by statute or pruden\u00ad tial rules. See id., at 104. The relevant questi on in such cases is not whether the plaintiff has been afforded access to a federa l forum; rather , the questi on is whether the state cour t actually decided an issue of fact or law that was neces\u00ad sary to its judg ment. In Allen, the plaintiff, Willie McCurry , invoked the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in an unsuccessfu l attempt to suppress evidence in a state criminal trial. After he was convicted, he sought to remedy his alleged constituti U. S. 323 (2005) 343 Opinion of the Cour t lation by bringing a suit for damages under 42 U. S.

Rely ing on \"'the specia l role of federa l cour ts in protec ting civil rights' \" the fact that \u00a7 1983 prov ided the \"only route to a federa l forum,\" the Cour t of Appea ls held that McCurry was entitled to a federa l trial unencumbered by collatera l estoppel. 449 U. S., at 93. We rejected that argument emphatica lly. \"The actual basis of the Cour t of ls' holdi ng ap\u00ad pears to be a genera lly framed principle that every per\u00ad son asser ting a federa l right is entitled to one unencum\u00ad bered oppor tunity to litigate that right in a federa l distr ict cour t, regardless of the legal posture in which the federa l claim arises. But the author ity for this principle is difcu lt to discer n. It cannot lie in the Con\u00ad stituti on, which makes no such guarantee , but leaves the scope of the jurisdic tion of the federa l distr ict cour ts to the wisdom of Congress. And no such author ity is to be found in \u00a7 1983 itself . . . . There is, in shor t, no reason to believe that Congress intended to prov ide a person claiming a federa l right an unrestr icted oppor tu\u00ad nity to relitigate an issue already decided in state cour t simply because the issue arose in a state proceedi ng in which he would rather not have been engaged at all.\" Id., at 103-104 (footnote omitted).24 As in Allen, we are presently concer ned only with issues actually decided by the state cour t that are dispositive of federa l claims raised under \u00a7 1983.

Unfortunately for petiti oners, it is entirely uncl ear why their preference for a federa l forum shou ld matter for constituti onal or statutory purposes.

Consequently , we apply our normal assumpti on that the weighty interests in nality and comity trump the interest in giving losing liti\u00ad gants access to an additi onal appel late tribuna l.

The requirement that aggr ieved proper ty owners must seek \"compensati on through the pro\u00ad cedures the State has prov ided for doing so,\" 473 U.

As a conse\u00ad quence , there is scant precedent for the litigati on in federa l distr ict cour t of claims that a state agency has taken prop\u00ad erty in violati on of the Fifth Amendment' s Takings Clause . To the contrary , most of the cases in our takings jurispru\u00ad dence , includi ng near ly all of the cases on which petiti oners rely, came to us on writs of certiorar i from state cour ts of last resor t.26 Moreover , this is not the only area of law in which we have recog nized limits to plaintiffs' ability to press their federa l claims in federa l cour ts. See, e. g., Fair Assessmen t in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100, 116 (1981) (hold\u00ad ing that taxpayers are \"barred by the principle of comity from asser ting \u00a7 1983 actions against the validity of state tax systems in federa l cour ts\"). State local land-use than federa complex fac\u00ad tual, technica l, and legal questi ons related to zoning and land-use regulations. At base , petiti oners' claim amounts to little more than the concer n that it is unfair to give preclusive effec t to state\u00ad cour t proceedi ngs that are not chosen, but are instead re\u00ad quired in order to ripen federa l takings claims. Whate ver the merits of that concer n may be, we are not free to disre\u00ad gard the full faith and credit statute solely to preserve the availability of a federa l forum. The Cour t of Appea ls was correc t to decline petiti oners' invitation to ignore the re\u00ad 26 See, e. g., Dolan, 512 U. S., at 383; Yee, 503 U. S., at 526; Nollan, 483 U.

Indeed, Justice Holmes' famous \"too far\" formulation, which spawned our regulatory takings jurisprudence , was announced in a case that came to this Cour t via a writ of certiorar i to Pennsylvania' s highest cour t.

I agree that the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls shou ld be afrmed. Whate ver the reasons for petiti oners' chosen course of litigati on in the state cour ts, it is quite clear that they are now precluded by the full faith and credit statute , 28 U. S.

Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 485 (1982). I write separately to explai n why I think part of our decisi on in Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), may have been mist aken. In Williamson County, the respondent land developer led a \u00a7 1983 suit in federa l cour t alleging a regulatory tak\u00ad ings claim after a planni ng commissi on respondent' s plat proposa ls, but before respondent appea led that decisi on to the zoning board of appea ls. Id., at 181-182. Rather than reach ing the merits, we found the claim was brought prematurely . Id., at 200. We rst held that the claim was \"not ripe until the gover nment entity charged with implementi ng the regulations nal decisi on regardi ng the appl icati on of the regulations to the proper ty at issue .\" Id., at 186. Because respondent failed to seek variances from the planni ng commissi on or the zoning board of appea ls, we decided that respondent had failed to meet the nal-decisi on requirement. Id., at 187-191. We then 20:56:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite as: U. S. 323 (2005) Rehnquist , C. J., concurr ing in judg ment noted a \"second reason the taking claim [was] not yet ripe\": \"respondent did not seek compensati the the State [had] prov ided for doing so.\" Id., at 194. Until the claimant had received a nal denia l of compensa\u00ad tion through all available state procedures, such as by an inverse condemnati on action, we said he could not \"clai m a violati on of the Just Compensati on Clause .\" Id., at 195-196. It is not clear to me that Williamson County was correc t in demandi ng that, once a gover nment entity has reached a nal decisi on with respec t to a claimant' s proper ty, the claim\u00ad ant must seek compensati on in state cour t before bringing a federa l takings claim in federa l cour t. The Cour t in Wil\u00ad liamson County purported to inter Fifth Amend\u00ad ment in divining this state-l itigati on requirement. See, e. g., id., at 194, n. 13 (\"The nature of the constituti onal right . . . requires that a proper ty owner utilize procedures for obtain\u00ad ing compensati on before bringing a \u00a7 1983 action\"). More recently , we have referred to it as merely a prudentia l re\u00ad quirement. Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency , 520 U. S. 725, 733-734 (1997). It is not obvious that either constituti onal or prudentia l principles require claimants to utilize all state compensati on procedures before they can bring a federa l takings claim. Cf. Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 516 (1982) (holdi ng that plaintiffs suing under \u00a7 1983 are not required to have exhausted state admi n\u00ad istrative remedies).1 The Cour t today attempts to shore up the state-l itigati on requirement by referr ing to Fair Assessmen t in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U. S. 100 (1981). Ante, at 347. 1 In creati ng the state-l itigati on rule, the Cour t, in additi on to relying on the Fifth Amendment' s text, analogized to Ruckel shau s v. Mon santo Co., 467 U. S. 986 (1984), and Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527 (1981). As severa l of petiti oners' amici in this case have urged, those cases prov ided limited suppor t for the state-l itigati on requirement. See Brief for De\u00ad fenders of Proper ty Rights et al. as Ami ci Curiae 9-12; Brief for Eliza\u00ad beth J. Neumont REMO HOTEL, L. P. v. CITY and COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO Rehnquist , C. J., concurr ing in judg ment There , we held that the principle of comity (reflec ted in the Tax Injunc tion Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1341) bars taxpayers from asser ting \u00a7 1983 claims against the validity of state tax sys\u00ad tems in federa l cour ts. 454 U. S., at 116. Our decisi on that such suits must be brought in state cour t was driven by the unique and sensitive interests at stake when federa l cour ts confront claims that States acted imper missibly in admi nis\u00ad tering their histor ically grounded, principle of a principle which predated the enac tment of \u00a7 1983 itself . Id., at 103, 107-114. We decided that those interests favored requir ing that taxpayers bring challenges to the validity of state tax systems in state cour t, despite the strong interests favor ing federa l cour t review of alleged constituti onal violati ons by state ofcia ls. Id., at 115-116. The Cour t today makes no claim that any such longst and\u00ad ing principle of comity toward state cour ts in handl ing fed\u00ad eral takings claims existed at the time Williamson County was decided, nor that one has since developed. The Cour t does remark, howe ver, that state cour ts are more fami liar with the issues involved in local land-use and zoning regula\u00ad tions, and it suggests that this makes it proper to relegate federa l takings claims to state cour t. Ante, at 347. But it is not apparent that any such exper tise matches the type of histor ically grounded, federa lism-based interests we found necessary to our decisi on in Fair Assessmen t. In any event, the Cour t has not explai ned why we shou ld hand author ity over federa l takings claims to state cour ts, based simply on their relative fami liarity with local land-use decisi ons and proceedi ngs, while allowing plaintiffs to proceed direc tly to federa l cour t in cases involv ing, for example , challenges to municipa l land-use regulations based on the First Amend\u00ad ment, see, e. g., Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., U. S. PGT: OPIN 351 Cite as: U. S. 323 (2005) Rehnquist , C. J., concurr ing in judg ment 41 (1986); Young v. Ame rican Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976), or the Equal Protec tion Clause , see, e. g., Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432 (1985); Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas , 416 U. S. 1 (1974). In shor t, the afrmative case for the state-l itigati on requirement has yet to be made . Finally, Williamson County's state-l itigati on fying . For example , our holdi ng today ensures that litigants who go to state cour t to seek compensati on will likely be unable later to asser t their federa l takings claims in federa l cour t. Ante, at 346-347. And, even if preclusi on law would not block a litigant' s claim, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine might, insofar as Williamson County can be read to charac terize the state cour ts' denia l of compensati on as a required element of the Fifth Amendment takings claim. See Exxo n Mobil Corp. v. Saud i Basi c Indu stries Corp., 544 U. S. 280 (2005). As the Cour t recog nizes, ante, at 346-347, Williamson County all but guarantees that claimants will be unable to utilize the federa l cour ts to enforce the Fifth Amendment' s just com\u00ad pensati on guarantee . The basic principle that state cour ts are competent to enforce federa l rights and to adjudicate fed\u00ad eral takings claims is sound, see ante, at 347, and would apply to any number of federa l claims. Cf. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 (prov iding for limited federa l habeas review of state-cour t adjudicati ons of alleged violati ons of the Constituti on). But that principle does not explai n why federa l takings claims in particular shou ld be singled out to be con ned to state cour t, in the absence of any asser ted justi cati on or congressi onal Indeed, States the cour ts themselves apply the state-l itigati on requirement from Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), refusi ng to enter\u00ad tain any federa l takings claim until the claimant receives a nal denia l of compensati on through all the available state procedures. See, e. g., Brene ric Assoc. v. City of Del Mar , 69 Cal. App. 4th 166, 188-189, 81 20:56:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN 352 SAN REMO HOTEL, L. P. v. CITY and COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO Rehnquist , C. J., concurr ing in judg ment * * * I joined the opinion of the Cour t in Williamson County. But further reflec tion and exper ience lead me to think that the justi cati ons for its state-l itigati on requirement are sus\u00ad pect, while its impac t on takings plaintiffs is dramatic. Here, no cour t below has addressed the correc tness of Wil\u00ad liamson County, neither party has asked us to reconsider it, and resolv ing the issue could not benet petiti oners. In an appropr iate case , I the Cour t shou ld reconsider whether plaintiffs asser ting a Fifth Amendment takings claim based on the nal decisi on of a state or local gover n\u00ad ment entity must rst seek compensati on 338-339 (1998); Melillo v. City of New Haven, 249 Conn. 138, 154, n. 28, 732 A. 2d 133, 143, n. 28 (1999). This precludes litigants from asser ting their federa l takings claim even in state cour t. The Cour t tries to avoid this anoma ly by asser ting that, for plaintiffs attempti ng to raise a federa l takings claim in state cour t as an alternative to their state claims, Williamson County does not command that the state cour ts them\u00ad selves impose the state-l itigati on requirement. Ante, at 346. But that is so only if Williamson County's state-l itigati on requirement is merely a prudentia l rule, and not a constituti onal mandate , a questi on that the open. 545US1 Unit:$U64 [03-27-08 15:23:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN 353 OCTOBER TERM, 2004 Syllabus DODD v.

The United States, on the other hand, argues that it runs from the date on which this Cour t initia lly recog\u00ad nized the right asser ted. We believe that the text of \u00b6 6(3) settles this dispute . It unequivoca lly identi es one, and only one, date from which the 1-year limitation period is measured: \"the date on which the right asser ted was initia lly recog nized by the Supreme Cour t.\" We \"must presume that [the] legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there .\" Connec ticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254 (1992). What Congress has said in \u00b6 6(3) is clear: An appl icant has one year from the date on which the right he asser ts was initia lly recog nized by this Cour t. Dodd urges us to adopt a different inter pret ation. He contends that the second clause in \u00b6 6(3) affec ts the appl fore the limitation period begins.\" Brief for Petitioner 8.

Because the Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit did not hold the right recog nized in Richard son v. United States, 526 U. S. 813 (1999), retroac tively appl icable until April 19, 2002, when it decided Ross , 289 F. 3d 677, Dodd contends that he had until April 19, 2003 \u2014one year from the date when all three prerequisites were satised\u2014 to le his \u00a7 2255 moti on. Dodd' s inter pret ation square with the only natu\u00ad ral readi ng of the text. Paragraph 6(3) identi es one date and one date only as the date from which the 1-year limita\u00ad tion period runs: \"the date on asser ted was lly recog t.\" on the second clause to identi fy the operative date is misplaced.

We recog nize that the statute of limitations in \u00b6 6(3) makes it difcu lt for appl icants ling second or successive \u00a7 2255 moti ons to obtain relief. The limitation l moti ons as second successive ones. Section 2255, \u00b6 8(2), narrowly restr icts an appl icant' s ability to le a second or successive moti on. An appl icant may le a second or successive moti on only in limited circumst ances, such as where he seeks to take advant age of \"a new rule of constituti onal law, made retroac\u00ad tive to cases on collatera l review by the Supreme Cour t, that was previously unavai lable .\" \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 8(2). Dodd points out that this Cour t rarely decides that a new rule is retroac\u00ad tively appl icable within one year of initia lly recog nizing that right. Thus, because of the inter play between \u00b6\u00b6 8(2) and 6(3), an appl icant who les a second or successive moti on seek ing to take advant age of a new rule of constituti onal law will be time barred except in the rare case in which this Cour t announces a new rule of constituti onal law and makes it retroac tive within one year . Although we recog nize the potentia l for harsh resu lts in some cases, we are not free to rewr ite the statute that Con\u00ad gress has enac ted. \"[W]hen the statute' s lang plain, the sole func tion of the cour ts\u2014at least where the dispositi on required by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it accordi ng to its terms.\" Hartford Underwriters Ins.

UNITED STATES Stevens, J., dissenti ng believes that the inter play of second or succes\u00ad sive moti ons. Justice Stevens would hold, contrary to the plain text, that the limitation period in \u00b6 6(3) begins to run when the right asser ted is made retroac tive, see post, at 369 (dissent\u00ad ing opinion), because he assumes that \"the most natura l readi ng of the statutory text would make it possible for the limitations period to expire before the cause of action ac\u00ad crues,\" post, at 361. Justice Stevens analogizes this case to Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, post, p. 409, see post this page and 361 (dissenti ng opinion), but Graham County is disti n\u00ad guishable . The text of the statute at issue in Graham County is ambig uous, justi fying the Cour t's partial reliance on \"the 'standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of ac\u00ad tion.' \" See Graham County, post, at 415-418, 419, n. 2. Here, there is no such ambig uity; \u00b6 6(3) clear ly speci es the date on which the limitation period begins to run. III Dodd' s \u00a7 2255 moti on sought to benet from our holdi ng in Richard son, supra, which was decided on June 1, 1999. Thus, he had one year from that date within which to le his moti on. Because he did not le his moti on until April 4, 2001, the moti on was untimely . We therefore afrm the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit. It is so ordered. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Jus\u00ad tice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join as to Part II, dissenti ng. Because the same anoma lous factor is present in both this case and in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, post, p. 409, and is deci\u00ad sive in my analysis of both cases, it S. 353 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng my views in a single opinion. In each case the most natura l readi ng of the statutory text would make it possible for the limitations period to expire before the cause of action ac\u00ad crues. Whether the source of this possible resu lt is merely the use of careless wordi ng or an incorrec t assumpti on by Congress concer ning the timing of two relevant events, I am convinced that Congress did not intend to author ize such a perverse resu lt in either case. Thus, while I agree with much of the reasoni ng in the Cour t's cogent opinion in Gra\u00ad ham County, I write separately because I would agree with the Cour t of Appea ls' readi ng of the text of 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1) were it not for this anoma ly. In this case , how\u00ad ever, because that same factor prov ides an even stronger reason for rejecting the inter pret ation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255, \u00b6 6(3), that the Cour t endorses, I would reverse the judg\u00ad ment of the Cour t of Appea ls. I In Graham County, the relator and the Gover nment argue (and the Cour t of Appea ls held) that the 6-year limitations period appl icable to a \"civil action under section 3730, \" 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1), appl to the retaliation action by \u00a7 3730( h). That argument is suppor ted by a litera l readi ng of the statutory text; for \u00a7 3730( h) plainly qualies as a \"civil under section 3730. \" Moreover , that readi ng derives strong suppor t from the interest in having a uniform federa l statute of limitations gover n the litigati on of federa l causes of action. Cf. Jones v. R. R. Donnell ey & Sons Co., 541 U. S. 369, 377-383 (2004). Nevertheless, I agree with the Cour t that another readi ng of the text is far more plausi\u00ad ble, and with its conclusi on that when choosi ng between two constr uctions of a statute of limitations, whene ver possible we shou ld prefer the constr uction that starts the time limit runni ng when the cause of action accrues.1 1 Contrary to the Cour t's comment in Graham County, post, at 419, n. 2, I do not suggest that a statute prov iding that the limitations period begins to run before the cause of action accrues is necessar ily ambig\u00ad545US1 Unit:$U64 [03-27-08 15:23:20] PAGES PGT: v. UNITED STATES Stevens, J., dissenti ng In Graham County that choice is compel led by the interac\u00ad tion between two relevant events: the \"violati on of \u00a7 3729\" and the 3731( b)(1) prov ides that a \"civil action under section 3730\" must be brought within six years of a \"violati on of section 3729. \" If this section were read to encompass retaliation claims under \u00a7 3730( h), as held by the Cour t of Appea ls, the statute of limitations would be triggered by the \"violati on of section 3729\"; that is, the limitations period would begin to run before the cause of action for retaliation accrues, and could potentia lly expire before an actionable retaliation claim even exists. See Graham County, post, at 421-422; United States ex rel. Wilson v. Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist., 367 F. 3d 245, 260-261 (CA4 2004) (Wilkinson, J., dissenti ng). Thus, the potentia lly prolonged time period between the two relevant events\u2014the violati on of \u00a7 3729 (trigger ing the limitations period) and the retalia\u00ad tion against the whistle-blower (giving rise to an actionable claim)\u2014could leave the well-intenti oned whistle-blower without any recourse under \u00a7 3730( h), the very statute de\u00ad signed to prov such protec tion. uous. Rather , as Justice Thomas' scholar ly footnote demonstrates, Gra\u00ad ham County, post, at 419-421, n. 3, it is so unlikely that a legislature would actually intend such an anoma lous desig n that I would presume that the anoma ly was the produc t of a draf ting error absent evidence in either the legislative history or elsewhere in the text that Congress speci cally intended such a resu lt. See Koons Buick Pontia c GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U. S. 50, 65-66 (2004) (Stevens, J., concurr ing). The litera l text of \u00a7 3731( b)(1), which uses an event that is not an ele\u00ad ment of the retaliation cause of action to start the limitations period run\u00ad ning, produces two anoma lies: (1) The statute may never begin to run, and (2) it may expire before the cause of action accrues. The Cour t argues that the rst anoma ly makes the statute ambig uous and that the second justi es resor t to a defau lt rule to resolve the ambig uity. In my judg\u00ad ment, the latter anoma ly prov ide a sufcient justi cati on for resor t to the defau lt rule whether or not some other feature of the statute would suppor t an argument that the text was S. 353 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng The Cour t rightly avoids that harsh and counter intuitive resu lt by adopti ng a constr uction of the statute that would genera lly start the runni ng of the limitations period from the date the cause of action accrues, i. e., when the act or acts of retaliation occur . As Justice Thomas explai ns, that is not only the prevailing rule appl ied throughout the coun\u00ad try to analogous state-law claims, Graham County, post, at 419-421, n. 3; it is also the background norm against which Congress legislates, Graham County, post, at 418-419. Be\u00ad cause Congress surely did not intend to create a cause of action for retaliation with one hand, and impose with the other a premature trigger date for the limitations period with the potentia l to bar retaliation claims altogether , I concur in the judg ment in Graham County. II The same potentia l for premature expirati on of a statute of limitations is the primary reason why I cannot join the Cour t's anoma lous constr uction of the statute in this case. The statute we are called upon to inter pret prov ides a 1-year period of limitation for a habeas petiti on that has as its basis a new rule of criminal law or criminal procedure that has retroac tive appl icati on. 6(3), pro\u00ad from . . . the date on which the right asser ted was initia lly recog nized by the Supreme Cour t, if that right has been newly recog nized by the Supreme Cour t and made appl icable to cases are two possible inter\u00ad pret ations of when the period shou ld start to run: from the date that this Cour t recog nizes the new right, or from the date that both conditi ons 2 in \u00b6 6(3) are met. 2 Section 2255, \u00b6 6(3), technica lly has three requirements: that a lly recog nized,\" that it be the rst two require\u00ad ments are one and the same . Hence , in this opinion I will refer only to the requirements (1) that a right be newly recog nized and (2) that STATES Stevens, J., dissenti ng If, as I believe Congress thought to be the case , this Cour t made a decisi retroac the recog nized the new right, the statu\u00ad tory scheme would make perfect sense: Petitioners, whether ling an initia l habeas petiti on or a second or successive pe\u00ad tition, would have one year from this Cour t's decisi on to le a petiti on for a writ taking advant age of that decisi on. Within a relatively shor t amount of time, those claims would be adjudicated, and the statute' s goals of nality would be duly served. In prac tice, howe ver, this Cour make retroac tivity judg at the time a new right is recog nized.3 See, e. g., Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002) (apply ing Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to deter minations of death pena lty eligibility); Schr iro v. Summe rlin, 542 U. 348 (2004) (concludi ng Ring was not retroac tive). Thus, as in Graham County, the statute impli\u00ad cates two relevant events: this Cour t's recog nition of a new right (which, accordi ng to the major ity, triggers the limita\u00ad tions period) and the declarati on that the right can be appl ied retroac tively (which allows a petiti oner to proceed with the claim). Because a signicant amount of time may elapse during the interva l between the trigger ing event and the point at which a petiti oner may actually be able to le an action seek ing relief under the statute , there is a real risk that the 1-year limitations period will expire before the cause of action accrues. In my judg ment, the probable explana\u00ad tion for statutory text that creates this risk is Congress' ap\u00ad parent assumpti on that our recog nition of the new right and our decisi on to apply it retroac tively would be made at the same time. Other wise it seems nonsensica l to assume that Congress deliberately enac ted a statute that recog nizes a cause of action, but wrote the limitations period in a way that 3 The retroac tivity issue is not normally argued in the same case that announces a new rule because the prisoner is only interested in the out\u00ad come of his own case. Moreover , in order to minimize the impac t of the new rule at issue , he actually has an incentive to minimize its consequences. 545US1 Unit:$U64 [03-27-08 15:23:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN 365 Cite (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng precludes an indiv idua l from ever taking advant age of the cause of action. We are thus faced with the same decisi on as in Graham County: Do we inter pret the statute in such a way as to allow prisoners such as Dodd to take advant age of the full year Congress prov ided for such claims, or do we inter pret the statute in such a way that the limitations period will begin to run before a prisoner may take advant age of \u00b6 6(3)? As an initia l matter , the text here certainly permits both readi ngs, just as it did in Graham County. Paragraph 6(3) requires that two prerequisites must be met before a habeas petiti oner can take advant age of that date as the starting point for the statute of limitations. Both requirements are in the past tense , and both must be satised before \u00b6 6(3) is appl icable . Further more , just as the clause \"if that right has been newly recog nized by the Supreme Cour t\" descr ibes the date indicated in the phrase \"the date on which the right asser ted was initia lly recog nized,\" it is possible to read the subordi nate clause \"if that descr iption date in the prov ision's main , rather than addi ng of \u00b6 6(3)\u2014requir ing that the statute of limitations begin to run when this Cour t recog\u00ad nizes a new rule\u2014may be the more natura l readi ng of the text, that advocated by petiti oner\u2014st arting the statute of limitations when the new rule is held to be retroac tive\u2014is by no means implausible .4 4 I shou ld note an additi onal point of disagreement with the major ity (and with petiti oner). In reach ing its resu lt, the Cour t relies on an as\u00ad sumpti on made by both parties and not challenged in this Cour t: namely , that the decisi on to make a new rule retroac tive for purposes of this sec\u00ad tion can be made by any lower cour t. Whil e I recog nize that every Cir\u00ad cuit to have addressed the issue has made the same assumpti on, I am satised that the Gover nment' l of this prov ision is the correc t one. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Tyler v. Cain, O. T. 2000, No. 00-5961, p. 16, n. 7. Under that inter pret ation, the requirement that the \"right has 15:23:20] PAGES Stevens, J., dissenti ng Moreover , the potentia l for claims to be premat urely barred by the statute of limitations is even greater than in Graham County. There , the possibi lity that the 6-year stat\u00ad ute of limitations period could run before the cause of action accrued, while plausible , was not particularly likely , since in preme Cour t and made on collatera l re\u00ad view\" is met only if the Supreme Court has made the right retroac tive. Cour ts that have reached the contrary conclusi on have principa lly relied on the fact that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( b)(2)(A) cont ains an phasis added.) See Ashley v. United States, 266 F. 3d 671, 674 (CA7 2001). Thus, the argument goes, the absence of \"by the Supreme Cour t\" after \"made retroac tive\" must have some meani ng. However, in that clause there is only one verb that the prepositi onal phrase \"by the Supreme Cour t\" can The more natura l ing of \u00b6 6(3) is that the lower cour ts, shou ld prov ide the nal answer to questi ons of inter pret ation arising under the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A). See, e. g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)(1) (requir ing that a state-cour t decisi on be contrary to \"clear ly established Federa l law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\" (emphasis added)). Additi onally, it avoids difcu lt questi ons of t can make a retroac tivity deter\u00ad mination, sets a uniform date by which lower cour ts can make deter mina\u00ad tions as to whether a petiti on is timely , and means that only those cases made retroac tive by this Cour t can form the basis for a petiti on that can gain the benet of tolling under \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3). Finally, it the only full effec t to \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 8(2), which allows prisoners who have already completed one round of federa l habeas review to seek additi onal relief on the basis of such a new rule. Ultimately , this readi ng has no direc t bear ing on the questi on presented in this case. Whil e my view that this Cour t must make the retroac tivity deter mination informs my belief that Congress had mist aken under\u00ad standi ng of how \u00b6 6(3) would prac tice, I would conclude that the 1-year limitations period begins to run when both requirements of \u00b6 6(3) are met regardless of which cour t makes the retroac tivity decisi on. Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer do not join this footnote . 545US1 Unit:$U64 [03-27-08 15:23:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN 367 U. S. 353 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng most cases the retaliatory conduc t that would form the basis of the cause of action under 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3730( h) would prob\u00ad ably occur within six years of the violati on of \u00a7 3729.5 In this case , owing to the subst antia lly shor ter 1-year statute of limitations period, both requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3), will often not be met before the statute of limitations period has expired if it is triggered by the decisi on of the Supreme Cour t announci ng a new rule. That resu lt is certainly true for Dodd himself . Richard\u00ad son v. United States, 526 U. S. 813, was decided on June 1, 1999. Under the major ity's inter pret ation, the statute of limitations thus expired on June 1, 2000, one year after we recog nized the new rule. The Eleventh Circuit, howe ver, did not decide whether Richard son was retroac tive until April 19, 2002.6 See Ross v. United States, 289 F. 3d 677 (CA11 2002) (per curiam). Thus, Dodd would not, under the major ity's inter pret ation, have been able to raise his claim at all, since the statute of limitations expired before he could have taken advant age of \u00b6 6(3)'s 1-year grace period.7 5 As the major ity in Graham County noted, howe ver, in almost every case the statute of limitations would begin to run before the cause of action actually accrued. See post, at 421. 6 This assumes that the Eleventh Circuit is the relevant \"cour t\" to decide the retroac tivity questi on, an issue the major ity fails to address. Even if a distr ict cour t, as opposed to the Cour t of Appea ls, could make that deter mination for purposes of \u00b6 6(3), the District Cour t for the Souther n District of Flor ida has not decided the issue in a publ ished opinion. 7 This would be true for prisoners in every Circuit except the Sixth Circuit, in which a prisoner would have had six months to le his petiti on. See Murr v. United States, 200 F. 3d 895 (Jan. 7, 2000). In the ve other Circuits besides the Eleventh to have decided the issue , all held Richard\u00ad son v. United States, 526 U. S. 813 (1999), to be retroac tive more than one year after Richard son was decided; in all of those Circuits, prisoners' claims under Richard son would be time barred before they were able to le under \u00b6 6(3). See Santana-Made ra v. United States, 260 F. 3d 133 (CA2, Aug. 3, 2001); United States v. Lopez, 248 F. 3d 427 (CA5, Apr. 16, 2001); Lanier v. United States, 220 F. 3d 833 (CA7, v. UNITED STATES Stevens, J., dissenti ng Even for those prisoners who are incarcerated in a jurisdic\u00ad tion in which the new rule is quickly held to be retroac tive, at least part of the 1-year period in which to le a claim taking advant age of the retroac tive rule will run before the petiti on raisi ng the claim can be led.8 Thus, the admoniti on in Graham County that \"Congress genera lly draf ts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues,\" post, at 418, appl ies with specia l force in this case. Paragraph 6(3) both recog nizes a basis for habeas relief by allowing an other wise barred claim to go forward if certain conditi ons are met, and also sets forth a 1-year statute of limitations for such claims. It would make no sense for Congress, in the same prov ision, both to recog nize a potentia l basis for habeas relief and also to make it highly probable that the statute of limitations would bar relief before the claim can be brought. Agai n, this is not simply a remote possibi lity: It is true for Dodd himself, and in six of the seven Circuits to have addressed whether Rich\u00ad ardson is retroac tive. See n. 7, supra. It is this absurd resu lt that convinces me that Congress could not have in- States v. Mont alvo, 331 F. 3d 1052 (CA9, June 9, 2003) (per curiam); United States v. Barajas-D iaz, 313 F. 3d 1242 (CA10, Dec. 3, 2002); Ross v. United States, 289 F. 3d 677 (CA11, Apr. 19, 2002) (per curiam). The Eighth Circuit appears to have assumed the retroac tive appl icati on of Richard son, but that too was decided more than a year after Richard son itself . See United States v. Scott, 218 F. 3d 835 (July 7, 2000). Of course , if any of the other four Circuits that have not yet decided the issue were to conclude Richard son was retroac tive, the statute of limitations would have long since expired, and prisoners would be similarly barred from taking advant age of any such decisi on. 8 In Tyler v. Cain, 533 U. S. 656 (2001), it appeared that a major ity of the Cour t recog nized that the Cour t could make a new rule retroac tive \"through multiple holdi ngs that logically dictate the retroac tivity of the new rule.\" Id., at 668 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing). In such a case , a pris\u00ad oner could le a petiti on under \u00b6 6(3) immediately . Since there was much disagreement over when that would be the case , howe ver, that potentia l excepti on holds small comfor t OPIN 369 (2005) J., dissenti ng tended that \u00b6 6(3) shou ld be read in this manner . Even if the text is as clear as the major ity claims (a propositi on I reject), we shou ld still inter pret the text in a manner that would avoid such an absurd resu lt. See, e. g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U. S. 417, 429 (1998); Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, 459 (1892). To avoid this resu lt, I would inter pret \u00b6 6(3) to begin to run only when the Supreme Cour t has initia lly recog nized the new right and when that right has been held to be ret\u00ad roac tive. Under this inter pret ation, the statute of limita\u00ad tions would not begin to run until the prisoner was actually able to le a petiti on under \u00b6 6(3), which is the only inter pre\u00ad tation Congress could have intended. Although in enac ting AEDP A Congress was clear ly concer ned with nality, see Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 179 (2001), \u00b6 6(3) is an ex\u00ad plicit excepti on to that genera l preference . Congress surely intended to allow habeas petiti oners to take advant age of the new rights that this Cour t deems retroac tive. Other wise, there would have been no reason to include that section in the statute . That is why, \"[a]bsent other indicati on, a stat\u00ad ute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff has the right to apply to the cour t for relief.\" Graham County, post, at 419 (quoti ng TRW Inc. v.

In Fleisch\u00ad mann Constr. Co. v. United States ex rel. Forsberg, 270 U. S. 349 (1926), the Cour t was faced with the inter pret ation of the Mater ialmen' s Act of 1894, as amended, which allowed a private creditor to bring suit against a party contrac ting with the United States, prov ided that the United States did not itself bring suit \"within six months from the completi on and nal settlement\" of the contrac t. 33 Stat. 812. Such a creditor had one year from the completi on of the contrac t and nal settlement to bring a suit, giving him a 6-month window within which to le his claims. If any other creditors wanted to bring suit, they had to join the action of the original 545US1 Unit:$U64 [03-27-08 15:23:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN 370 J., dissenti ng In additi on to creati ng the perverse resu lt that the statute of limitations will run before a prisoner can le an initia l habeas petiti on, pris\u00ad oners to le second icati ons based on a ret\u00ad roac tive rule.10 As the major ity recog nizes in what amounts to a dramatic pret successive \u00a7 2255 moti ons to obtain relief.\" Ante, at of the way \u00b6\u00b6 6(3) and 8(2) interac t, a prisoner can only le a second or successive petiti on based on a newly recog nized rule that has been made retroac tive if this Cour t has held creditor , but under the statute had only one year from \"the completi on of the work \" in which to do so. Ibid. As the Cour t in Fleischm ann recog\u00ad nized, if taken litera lly this last section would have meant that in a case in which the \"nal settlement\" of the contrac t occurred more than six months after work was completed on the contrac t\u2014as \"frequently\" hap\u00ad pened\u2014only the initia l creditor to le suit would have been able to meet the requirement of the statute of limitations; any subsequent creditor would have been barred under the second statute of limitations that did not reference the nal settlement as a start date , but rather only the completi on of work. 270 U. S., at 361. Rather than permit these \"unjust or absurd consequences, \" id., at 360, the Cour t inter preted \"within one year from the completi on of the work \" to mean \" 'within one year after the performance and nal settlement of the contrac t,' \" id., at 362. Fleischm ann thus presents the identica l situati on as in Graham County and Dodd: Because of the unforeseen possibi lity that two relevant events might occur far apar t in time, the most natura l readi ng of the statute would cause the statute of limitations to expire before the suit may be brought. As we did in Fleischm ann and in Graham County, we shou ld constr ue the statute of limitations in Dodd to avoid this unnatura l resu lt. 10 Our cases make clear that when inter preti ng a particular section of a statute , we look to the entire statutory scheme rather than simply exami n\u00ad ing the text at issue . See Koons, 543 U. S., at 60. \"A prov ision that may seem ambig uous is often claried by the remai nder of the statutory scheme \u2014because the same terminolog y is used elsewhere in a context that makes its meani ng clear , or becau se only one of the permissi\u00ad ble mean ings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.\" United Sav.

PAGES PGT: OPIN 371 S. 353 (2005) Ginsburg, J., dissenti ng the rule to be retroac tive within one year of recog nizing it. Unfortunately for such prisoners, howe ver, this Cour t has never done so since Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), was decided.11 Because of the need for percolati on, and the time it takes for cases to come to this Cour t from the cour ts below , it seems unlikely (to say the least) that we would ever do so. Therefore , the major a basic canon of statutory constr uction that we will not inter pret a congressi onal stat\u00ad ute in such a manner as to effec tively nullify an entire sec\u00ad tion. See, e. g., Duncan, 533 U. S., at 174 (\"[A] statute ought, upon the whole , to be so constr ued that, if it can be pre\u00ad vented, no clause , sentence , or word shall be super fluous, void, or insignicant\" (inter nal quot ation marks omitted)). It is a strange principle that requires strict adherence to the text of one prov ision while allowing another to have virtu\u00ad ally no real world appl icati on. It would seem far wiser to give both sections the meani ng that Congress obviously intended. Accordi ngly, while I concur in the judg ment in Graham County, I respec tfully dissent in Dodd. Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenti ng. Essentia lly for reasons stated by Justice Stevens, I conclude that 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3), is most sensibly read to start the time clock on the date a right is \"made retroac\u00ad tively appl icable to cases on collatera l review.\" I therefore join, in principa l part, Part II of Justice Stevens' dissent\u00ad ing opinion.* 11 Agai n, it is possible that a combi nation of our decisi ons has effec tively done this, see n. 8, supra, but we have never actually recog nized an in\u00ad stance in which that has occurred. *Petitioner and the Gover nment assume , for the purpose at hand, that a control ling decisi on whether a right operates retroac tively may be made by a cour t of appea ls. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-7, 20, 24, 41; Brief for Peti\u00ad tioner 13-14, and n. 2, 25, and n. 5, 26-28; Brief for United States 17-18, and n. 5, 23.

By contrast, as Justice Breyer explai ns in his dissenti ng opinion in Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, post, at 427-428, a deter mination that the False Claims Act's six-year statute of limitations, see 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1), gover ns civil suits for retaliation under the Act, see \u00a7 3730( h), ordinarily would work no claim depr ivati on. See ante, at 366-367 (Stevens, J., dissenti (In Graham County, \"the possibi lity that the 6-year statute of limitations period could run before the cause of action accrued, while plausible , was not particularly likely , since in most cases the retaliatory conduc t that would form the basis of the cause of action under 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3730( h) would probably occur within six years of the violati on of \u00a7 3729. [In cases like Dodd, on the other hand,] owing to the subst antia lly shor ter 1-year statute of limitations period, both requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3), will often not be met before the statute of limitations period has expired if it is triggered by the deci\u00ad sion of the Supreme Cour t announci ng a new rule.\" (foot\u00ad note omitted)). Nearly 20 years have passed since Congress amended 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1) to prov ide that \"[a] civil 3730 may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on which the violati on of section 3729 is committed. \" See Graham County, post, at 412-413. Yet petiti oner Gra\u00ad ham County District has been unable to cite a single instance in which a suit has been time barred because the alleged tion. I therefore do not subscr ibe to Justice Stevens' statements that only this Cour t has the prerogative to make the retroac tivity deter mina\u00ad tion. See ante, at 365-366, n. 4. I would await full adversar ial present a\u00ad tion before expressi dissenti ng retaliation proscr ibed by \u00a7 3730( h) fell outside the period triggered by submissi on of a false claim in violati on of \u00a7 3729. See Tr. of Oral No. No. 15-16; Brief as Amicus Curiae in No. 04-169, pp. 27-28; see also Graham County, post, at 427 (Breyer, J., dissenti ng). As Dodd' s case illustrates, howe ver, on the Cour t's readi ng, it is \"highly probable\" \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3), limitation \"wou ld bar relief before the claim can be brought. \" Ante, at 368- 369 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). Accordi ngly, I would not, as Justice Stevens does, bracket the instant case with Gra\u00ad ham County. True, the limitation period in Graham County, like the \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3), limitation, is triggered by an event that may precede the accrual date of a claim. But the resemblance ends there . The generous six-year span in 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1), in prac tical effec t, will give the plaintiff leeway to commence suit she likely will not have under the typically shor ter state limitation. See Graham County, post, at 427 (Breyer, J., dissenti ng). The opposite effec t would attend 28 U. C. \u00a7 2255, \u00b6 6(3). The one-year limitation speci ed there , if triggered by the date on which this Cour t \"initia lly recog nized\" the right asser ted, Dodd most \"new rule\" petiti oners from presenti ng their claims. It ex\u00ad alts form over reality to equate the two statutes and cases for time-bar purposes. 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN TERM, v.

Argued January 18, 2005 \u2014Decided June 20, 2005 Petitioner Rompi lla was convicted of murder and other crimes.

His new lawyers led for state postcon viction relief, claiming ineffec tive assist ance by his trial counsel in failing to present signicant mitigati ng evidence about Rom\u00ad pilla's childhood, ment al capacity and health, and alcohol ism. The state cour ts found that trial counsel had sufciently investigated the mitiga\u00ad tion possibi lities. Rompi lla then inadequate represent ation in a federa l habeas petiti on.

Held: Even when a capit al defendant and his fami ly members have sug\u00ad gested that no mitigati ng evidence is available , his lawyer is bound to make reasonable effor ts to obtain and review mater ial that counsel knows the prosecuti on will probably rely on as evidence of aggravati on at U.

The state cour t's resu lt must be not only incorrec t also tively unreasonable ng phase hindsight \"counsel' s perspec tive at the time\" investigative decisi ons were made and by giving deference to counsel' the lawyers were decient in failing to exami ne the cour t le on Rompi lla's prior rape and assau lt conviction. They knew that the Commonwea lth intended to seek the death pena lty by prov ing that Rompi lla had a signicant history of felony convictions indicati ng the use or threat of violence , that it would attempt to establish this history by prov ing the prior conviction, and that it would emphasi ze his violent charac ter by introduci ng a ipt of the rape victim's trial testi mony . Although the prior conviction le was a publ ic record, readi ly available at the cour thouse where Rompi lla was to be tried, counsel looked at no part of it until warned by the prosecuti on a second time, and even then did not exami ne the entire le. With every effor t to view the facts as a defense lawyer would have at the time, it is difcu lt to see how counsel could have failed to realize that not exami ning the le would seriously compromise their oppor tunity to respond to an aggravati on case. Their duty to make all reasonable effor ts to learn what they could about the offense the prosecuti on was going to use certainly included obtaining the Commonwea lth's own readi ly available le to learn what it knew about the crime, to discover any mitigati ng evidence it would downplay , and to anticipate the details it would emphasi ze. The obligati on to ex\u00ad amine the le was particularly pressi ng here because the violent prior offense was similar to the crime charged and because Rompi lla's sen\u00ad tenci ng strateg y stressed residua l This obligati on is not just common sense , but is also descr ibed in the Amer ican Bar Associati on Standards for Criminal Justice , which are \" 'guides to deter mining what is reasonable ,'\" Wiggins, supra, at 524. The state cour t's counsel' s effor ts to nd mitigati ng evidence by other means were enough to free them from further enquiry fails to answer the con\u00ad siderati ons set out here , to the point of being objec tively unreasonable . No reasonable lawyer would forgo exami nation of the le thinking he could do as well by asking the defendant or fami ly relati ons what they reca lled. Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for school repor ts, juveni le records, and evidence of drinking 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES BEARD Syllabus oppor tunity to take a look at a le disclosi ng what the prosecutor knows and plans to read from in his case. Pp. 381-390. (c) Because the state cour ts found counsel' s represent ation adequate , they never reached the prejudice element of a Strickland claim, whether \"there is a reasonable probabi lity that, but for resu lt . . . would have been different, \" 466 U. S., at 694. A de novo exami nation of this element shows that counsel' s lapse was prejudicia l. Had they looked at the prior conviction le, they would have found a range of mitigati on leads that no other source had opened up. The imprisonment records cont ained in that le pictured Rompi lla's childhood and ment al health very differently from anyth ing they had seen or heard. The accumu lated entr ies\u2014e. g., that Rompi lla had a series of incarcerati ons, often related to alcohol; and test resu lts that would have pointed the defense' s ment al health exper ts to schizo\u00ad phrenia lla's upbr inging and ment al capacity counsel had formed from talking to ve fami ly members and from the ment al health exper ts' repor ts. Further effor t would presumably have unear thed much of the mater ial postcon viction counsel found. Aler ted to the school, medica l, and prison records that trial counsel never saw, postcon viction counsel found red flags pointing up a need for further testi ng, which revealed organic brain damage and childhood problems probably related to fetal alcohol syndrome . These ndings in turn wou ld probably have prompted a look at easily available school and juveni le records, which showed additi onal problems, includi ng evidence of a highly abusive home life. The evidence adds up to a mitigati on case bear ing no rela\u00ad tion to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury. The undiscovered \"mitigati ng evidence , taken as a whole , 'might well have influenced and the likelihood of a different resu lt had the evidence gone in is \"sufcient to under mine condence in the outcome\" actually reached at sentenci ng, Strickland, supra, at 694.

BEARD Opinion of the Cour t for the death pena lty. Two publ ic defenders were assig ned to the case. The jury at the guilt phase of trial found Rompi lla guilty on all counts, and during the ensui ng pena lty phase , the prosecutor sought to prove three aggravati ng factors to jus\u00ad tify a death sentence: that the murder was committed in the course of another felony; that the murder was committed by torture; and that Rompi lla had a signicant history of felony convictions indicati ng the use or threat of violence . See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9711( d)(6), (8), (9) (2002). The Common\u00ad wealth presented evidence on all three aggravators, and the jury found all proven. Rompi lla's evidence in mitigati on consisted of relatively brief testi mony: ve of his fami ly members argued in effec t for residua l doubt, and beseeched the jury for mercy , saying that they believed Rompi lla was innocent and a good man. Rompi lla's 14-year-old son testi\u00ad ed that he loved his father and would visit him in prison. The jury acknowledged this evidence to the point of nding, as two factors in mitigati on, that Rompi lla's son had testi ed on beha lf and that rehabi litation was possible . But the jurors assig ned the greater weight to the aggravati ng fac\u00ad tors, and sentenced Rompi lla to death. The Supreme Cour t of Pennsylvania afr med both conviction and sent ence.

The cour t found that in pre\u00ad paring the mitigati on case the defense lawyers had failed to investigate \"pretty obvious signs\" that Rompi lla had a troubled childhood and suffered from ment al illness and alco\u00ad holism, and instead had relied unjusti v.

The major ity found noth ing un\u00ad reasonable in the state cour t's appl icati on of Strickland, given defense effor iewing Rompi lla certain fam\u00ad ily members, as well as consu ltation with three ment al health exper ts. Although the major ity noted that the law\u00ad yers did not unear th the \"usefu be found in Rompi lla's \"school, medica l, police, and prison records, \" it thought the lawyers were justi ed in failing to hunt through these records when their other effor ts gave no reason to be\u00ad lieve the search would yield anyth ing helpfu l. 355 F. 3d, at 252.

None of the sources proved particu\u00ad larly helpfu lla's own contr ibuti ons to any mitigati on case were minimal.

The state postcon viction cour t found that counsel spoke to the relatives in a \"det ailed manner ,\" attempti ng to unear th mitigati ng informati on, id., at 264, although the weight of this nding is qualied by of the t lawyers' concessi on that \"the over whelmi ng response from the fami ly was that they didn' t really feel as though they knew him all that well since he had spent the major ity of his adult years and some of his childhood years in custody ,\" id., at 495; see also id., at 669.

Id., at 473- 474, 476. But their repor ts , id., at 1358, and the lawyers consequently did not go to any other histor ical source that might have cast light on Rompi lla's ment al conditi on. When new counsel entered the case to raise Rompi lla's postcon viction claims, howe ver, they identi ed a number of likely avenues the trial lawyers could fruitfu lly have fol\u00ad lowed in building a mitigati on case. School records are one example , which trial counsel never exami ned in spite of the professed unfami liarity of the severa l fami ly members with Rompi lla's childhood, and despite counsel' s knowledge that Rompi lla left school after the ninth grade . Id., at 677. Other examples are records of Rompi lla's juveni le and adult incarcerati ons, which counsel did not consu lt, although they were aware of their client' s criminal record. And while counsel knew from police repor ts prov ided in pretr ial discov\u00ad ery that Rompi lla had been drinking heav ily at the time of his offense , Lodg ing to App. 111-120 (herei nafter Lodg ing), and although one of the al health exper ts repor ted that Rompi further investiga\u00ad tion, App. 723-724, counsel did not look for evidence of a history of dependence on alcohol that might have extenuat\u00ad ing signicance .

Counsel knew that the Commonwea lth intended to seek the death pena lty by prov ing Rompi lla had a signicant history of felony convictions indicati ng the use or threat of violence , an aggravator under state law. Coun\u00ad sel further knew that the Commonwea lth would attempt to establish this history by prov ing Rompi lla's prior conviction for rape and assau lt, and would emphasi ze his violent charac\u00ad ter by introduci ng a transcr ipt of the rape victim's testi mony given in that earlier trial. App. 665-666. There is no ques\u00ad tion that defense counsel were on notice , since they acknowl\u00ad edge that a \"plea letter ,\" written by one of them four Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: of the Cour t prior to trial, menti oned the prosecutor 's plans. Ibid. It is also undisputed that the prior conviction le was a publ ic document, readi ly available for the asking at the very cour t\u00ad house where Rompi lla was to be tried. It is clear , howe ver, that defense counsel did not look at any part of that le, includi ng the transcr ipt, until warned by the prosecuti on a second time. In a colloquy the day be\u00ad fore the evidentiary sentenci ng phase began, the prosecutor again said he would present the transcr ipt of the victim's testi mony to establish the prior conviction. \"[DEFENSE ]: I would also like to review whate ver he's going to read from. \"[PROSECUTOR ]: Well, I told you that I was going to do this a long time ago.

The prosecuti on was going to use the dramatic facts of a similar prior offense , and Rompi lla's counsel had a duty to make all reasonable effor ts to learn what they could about the offense . Reasonable effor ts certainly included obtaining the Com\u00ad monwea lth's own readi ly available le on the prior conviction to learn what the Commonwea lth knew about the crime, to discover any mitigati ng evidence the Commonwea lth would downplay , and to anticipate the details of the aggravati ng 3 Defense counsel also stated at the postcon viction hear ing that she be\u00ad lieved at some point she had looked at some les regardi ng that prior conviction and that she was fami liar with the particulars of the case. But she could not reca ll what the les were or how she obtained them. Id., at 507-508. In additi on, counsel apparently obtained Rompi lla's rap sheet, which showed that he had prior convictions, includi ng the one for rape . Id., at 664. At oral argument, the United States, arguing as an amicus in suppor t of Pennsylvania, maintained that counsel had fullled their obligati ons to investigate the prior conviction by obtaining the rap sheet. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-45. But this cannot be so. The rap sheet would reveal only the charges and dispositi ons, being no reasonable substi\u00ad tute for the prior conviction le. The dissent nonetheless concludes on this evidence that counsel knew all they needed to know about the prior conviction. Post, at 401 (opinion of Kennedy , J.).

Post, at 402; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. Counsel' s obligati on to rebut aggravati ng evidence extended beyond arguing it ought to be kept out. As noted above , supra this page , counsel had no way of know ing the context of the transcr ipt and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the le as a whole . Counsel could not effec tively rebut the aggravati on case or build their own case in mitigati on. Nor is there any merit to the United States' s contenti on that further enquiry into the prior conviction le would have been fruitless because the sole reason the transcr ipt was being introduced was to establish the aggravator that Rompi lla had committed prior violent felonies. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30. The Gover nment maintains that because the transcr ipt would incontrover tibly establish the fact that Rom\u00ad pilla had committed a violent felony , the defense could not have expec ted to rebut that aggravator through further investigati on of the le. That analysis ignores the fact that the sentenci ng jury was required to weigh aggravati ng factors against mitigati ng factors. We may reasonably as\u00ad sume that the jury could give more relative weight to a prior violent fel\u00ad ony aggravator where defense counsel missed an oppor tunity to argue that circumst ances of the prior less damni ng than the prosecuti on's PGT: OPIN 387 Cite U. S. 374 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The notion that defense counsel must obtain informati on that the State has and will use against the defendant is not simply a matter of common sense .

Common Pleas, Aug. 23, 1996), App. 263-264, 272-273. We think this conclusi on of the state cour t fails to answer the considerati ons we have set out, to the point of being an objec tively unreasonable conclusi on. It flouts prudence to deny that a defense lawyer shou ld try to look at a le he knows the prosecuti on will cull for aggravati ng evidence , let alone when the le is sitting in the trial cour thouse , open for the asking. No reasonable lawyer would forgo exami nation of the le thinking he could do as well by asking the defend\u00ad ant or fami ly relati ons whether they reca lled anyth ing prior victim's testi mony . Nor would a reasonable lawyer compare possible searches for school re\u00ad ports, juveni le records, and evidence of drinking habits to the oppor tunity to take a look at a le disclosi ng what the prosecutor knows and even plans to read from in his case. Questi oning a few more fami ly members and search ing for old records can promise less than looking for a needle in a hayst ack, when a lawyer truly has reason to doubt there is any needle there . E. g., Strickland, supra, at 699. But looking at a le the prosecuti on says it will use is a sure bet: whate ver may be in that le is going to tell defense counsel someth ing about what the prosecuti on can produce . The dissent thinks this analysis creates a \"rigid, per se\" rule that requires defense counsel to do a complete review of the le on any prior conviction introduced, post, at 404 (opinion of Kennedy , J.), but that is a mist ake. Counsel fell shor t here because they failed to make reasonable effor ts to review the prior conviction le, despite know ing that the prosecuti on intended to introduce Rompi lla's prior conviction not merely by enter ing a notice of conviction into evidence but by quoti ng damag ing testi mony of the rape victim in that case. The unreasonableness of attempti ng no more than they did was heightened by the easy availability of the le 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN 390 ROMPIL LA v. BEARD Opinion of the Cour t at the trial cour thouse , and the great risk that testi mony about a similar violent crime would hamstr ing counsel' s cho\u00ad sen defense of residua l doubt. It is owing to these circum\u00ad stances that the state cour ts were objec tively unreasonable in concludi ng that counsel could reasonably decline to make any effor t to review the le. Other situati ons, where a de\u00ad fense lawyer is not charged with knowledge that the prosecu\u00ad tor intends to use a prior conviction in this way, might well warrant a different assessment. C Since counsel' s failure to look at the le fell below the line of reasonable prac tice, there is a further questi on about prej\u00ad udice , that is, whether \"there is a lity that, but for counsel' s unprofessi onal errors, the resu lt of the proceedi ng would have been different. \" 466 U. S., at 694. Because the state cour ts found the represent ation adequate , they never reached the issue of prejudice , App. 265, 272-273, and so we exami ne this element of the Strickland claim de novo, Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S., at 534, and agree with the dissent in the Cour t of Appea ls. We think Rompi lla has shown beyond any doubt that counsel' s lapse was prejudicia l; Pennsylvania, indeed, does not even contest the claim of prejudice . If the defense lawyers had looked in the le on Rompi lla's prior conviction, it is uncontested they would have found a range of mitigati on leads that no other source had opened up. In the same le with the transcr ipt of the prior trial were the records of Rompi lla's imprisonment on the earlier conviction, App. 508, 571, 631, which defense counsel testi ed she had never seen, id., at 508. The prison les pictured Rompi lla's childhood and ment al health very differently from anyth ing defense counsel had seen or heard. An evaluati on by a correc tions counselor states that Rompi lla was \"reared in the slum environment of Allentown, Pa. vicinity. He early came to [the] attenti on of juveni U. S. 374 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t school at 16, [and] started a series of incarcerati ons in and out Penna. often of assau ltive nature and commonly related to over-i ndulgence in alcohol ic beverages. \" Lodg ing 40.

Further effor t would presumably have unear thed much of the mater ial postcon iter summar ized this evidence: \"Rompi lla's parents severe alcohol ics who drank const antly .

But once counsel had an obligati on to exam\u00ad ine the le, counsel had to make reasonable effor ts to learn its contents; and once having done so, they could not reasonably have ignored mitiga\u00ad tion evidence or red flags simply because they were unexpec ted. The dissent, howe ver, assumes that counsel could reasonably decline even to read what was in the le, see post, at 406 (if counsel had reviewed the case le for mitigati ng evidence , \"[t]here would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document\"). Whil e that could well have been true if counsel had been faced with a large amount of possible evidence , see n. 4, supra, there is no indicati on that exami ning the case le in questi on here would have required signicant labor . In\u00ad deed, Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompi lla's claim that because the informati on was located in the prior conviction le, rea\u00ad sonable effor ts would have [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: LA BEARD Opinion of the Cour t nancy with Rompi lla, and he and his brothers eventua lly developed serious drinking problems.

When they tested, they found that Rompi lla \"suffers from organic brain dam\u00ad age, an extreme ment al disturbance signicantly impair ing severa l of his cognitive func tions.\" Ibid. They also said that \"Rompi lla's problems relate back to his childhood, and were likely caused by fetal alcohol syndrome [and that] Rom\u00ad pilla's capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduc t or to confor m his conduc t to the law was subst antia lly im\u00ad paired at the time of the offense .\" Id., at 280 (Slov 545 U.

This evidence adds up to a mitigati on case that bears no relati on to the few naked pleas for mercy actually put before the jury, and although we suppose it is possible that a jury could have heard it all and still have decided on the death pena lty, that is not the test. It goes without saying that the undiscovered \"mitigati ng evidence , taken as a whole , 'might well have influenced liams v. Taylor, 529 U.

Justice O'Connor, concurr ing. I write separately to put to rest one concer n. The dissent worr ies that the Cour t's opinion \"imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the 'case le' of any prior conviction that the prosecuti on might rely on at trial.\" Post, at 396 (opinion of Ken\u00ad nedy , J.). But the Cour t's opinion imposes no such rule. See ante, at 389-390. Rather , today' ROMPIL concurr ing plies our longst andi ng case-by-case approach to ney's performance was unconstituti onally decient under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Trial counsel' s performance in Rompi lla's case falls shor t under that standard, because the attor neys' behav ior was not \"reasonable consider ing all the circumst ances. \" Id., at 688. In particular, there were three circumst ances which made the attor neys knew that their client' s prior conviction would be at the very hear t of the prosecu tion's case. The prior conviction went not to a collatera l matter , but rather to one of the aggravati ng circumst ances mak ing Rompi lla eligible for the death pena lty. The prosecutors in\u00ad tended not merely to menti on the fact of prior conviction, but to read testi mony about the details of the crime. That crime, besides being quite violent in its own right, was very similar to the murder for which Rompi lla was on trial, and Rompi lla had committed the murder at issue a mere three months after his release from prison on the earlier convic\u00ad tion. In other words, the prosecutor clear ly planned to use details of the prior crime as power ful evidence that Rompi lla was a dangerous man for whom the death pena lty would be both appropr iate punishment and a necessary means of inca\u00ad App. 165-166 (prosecutor 's pena gument). This was evidence the defense shou ld have been prepared to meet: A reasonable defense lawyer would have attached a high impor tance to obtaining the record of the prior trial, in order to anticipate and nd ways of deflec ting the prosecutor 's aggravati on argument. Second, the prosecutor 's planned use of the prior convic\u00ad tion threatened to eviscerate one of the defense's primary mitigati on arguments. Rompi lla was convicted on the basis of strong circumst antia l evidence . His lawyers structured the entire mitigati on argument around the hope of convinc\u00ad ing the jury that residua l doubt about 395 Cite as: 545 U. S. 374 (2005) O'Connor, J., concurr ing it inappropr iate to impose the death pena lty. In announci intenti on to mony about would be ineffec tive and counter produc tive. The similarities be\u00ad tween the two crimes, combi ned with the timing and the already strong circumst antia l evidence , raised a strong likeli\u00ad hood that the jury would reject Rompi lla's residua l doubt damag ing their credibi lity. Such a scenar io called for further investigati on, to deter mine whether circumst ances of the prior case gave any hope of saving the residua l doubt argument, or whether the best strateg y instead would be to jettison that argument so as to focus on other , more promisi ng issues. Cf. Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 7 (2003) (per curiam); Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 700 (2002) (noting that sound tactical judg ment may someti mes call for omitti ng certain defense evidence or arguments). Third, the attor neys' decisi on not to obtain Rompi lla's prior conviction le was not the resu lt of an informed tactical decisi on about how the lawyers' time would best be spent. Although Rompi lla's attor neys had ample warning that the details of Rompi lla's prior conviction would be critica l to their case , their failure to obtain that le would not necessar\u00ad ily have been decient if it had resu lted from the lawyers' carefu l exercise of judg ment about how best to marsha l their time and serve their client. But Rompi lla's attor neys did not ignore the prior case le in order to spend their time on other crucial leads. They did not deter mine that the le was so inaccessible or so large that exami ning it would necessar\u00ad ily diver t them from other trial-preparati on tasks they thought more promisi ng. They did not learn at the 11th hour about the prosecuti on's intent to use the prior convic\u00ad tion, when it was too late for them to change plans. Rather , their failure to obtain the crucial le \"was the lt ng attenti on, not reasoned strateg ic judg ment. \" Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534 (2003). As a resu lt, their conduc t fell below constituti onally required standards.

Because t's opinion is consistent with the \" 'case-by-case exami nation of the evidence' \" called for under our cases, Williams v. Tay\u00ad lor, 529 U. S. 362, 391 (2000), I join the opinion.

To reach this resu lt, the major ity imposes on defense counsel a rigid requirement to review all documents in what it calls the \"case le\" of any prior convic\u00ad tion that the prosecuti on might rely on at trial. The Cour t's holdi ng, a mist ake under any standard of review, is all the more troubl ing because this case arises under the Antiter\u00ad rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In order to grant Rompi lla habeas relief the Cour t must say, and in\u00ad deed does say, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Cour t was objec tively unreasonable in failing to anticipate today' s new le rule. 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN 397 Cite S. 374 (2005) , J., dissenti ng In my respec tful submissi on it is this Cour t, not the state cour t, which is unreasonable .

Finally, even if the Cour t could justi fy its distor tion of Strickland, Rompi lla still would not be entitled to relief. The Cour t is able to conclude oth\u00ad erwise only by ignoring the established principle that it is the defendant, not the State, who has the burden of dem\u00ad onstrati ng that he was prejudiced by any deciency in his attor neys' performance . These are the reasons for my dissent. I Under any standard of review the investigati on performed by Rompi lla's counsel in preparati on for sentenci ng was lla's attor neys tive mitigati on case was crucial to helpi ng their client avoid the death pena lty. App. 516, 576. Rom\u00ad pilla stood accused of a brutal crime. In January 1988, James Scanlon was murdered while he was closi ng the Cozy Corner Cafe , a bar he owned in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Scanlon' s body was discovered later the next morning, lying in a pool of blood. Scanlon had been stabbed multiple times, includi ng 16 wounds around the neck and head. Scanlon also had been beaten with a blunt objec t, and his face had been gashed, possibly with shards from broken liquor and beer bottles found at the scene of the crime. After Scanlon was stabbed to death his body had been set on re. Subst antia l evidence linked Rompi lla to the crime. See genera lly Commo A. 2d 626, 629-630 (1995). He was at the Cozy Corner Cafe near closi ng time on the night of the murder and was observed going to the bathroom approxi mately J., dissenti ng ing a 1-hour period. A window in that bathroom, the police later deter mined, was the probable point of entry used by Scanlon' s assai lant. A pair of Rompi lla's sneakers seized by the police matched a bloody footpr int found near the victim's body , and blood on the sneakers matched the victim's blood type. Rompi lla's nger print was found on one of the two knives used to commit the murder . Someti me after leaving the bar on the night of the murder , Rompi lla checked into a nearby motel under a false name . Although he told the po\u00ad lice he left the bar with only two dollars, Rompi lla had paid cash for the room and flashed a large amount of money to the desk clerks. The victim's wallet was discovered in the bushes just outside of Rompi lla's motel room. When the police questi oned Rompi lla about the murder , his ver\u00ad sion of events was inconsistent with the testi mony of other witnesses. Rompi lla was represented at trial by Fredr ick Char les, the chief publ ic defender for Lehigh County at the time, and Maria Dantos, an assist ant publ ic defender . Char les and Dantos were assisted by John Whispel l, an investigator in the publ ic defender 's ofce . Rompi lla's defense team sought to develop mitigati evidence from various sources. First, they questi oned Rompi lla extensively about his upbr inging and 668-669. To produc tive they circumst ances recog nized by Pennsylvania 657. Cf. Strickland, supra, at 691 (\"[W]hen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursu\u00ad ing certain investigati ons would be fruitless or even harm\u00ad ful, counsel' s failure to pursue those investigati ons may not later be challenged as unreasonable\"). Second, Char les and Dantos arranged for Rompi lla to be exami ned by Char forensic psych iatrist around here , [an\u00ad other ] tremendous a (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng tioned his fami ly extensively in search of any informati on that might help spare Rompi lla the death pena lty. Id., at 493-494, Rompi lla's \"const ant source of informati on.\" Id., at 557, 729. Indeed, after trial Rompi lla's wife sent Dantos a letter expressi ng her gratitude . Id., at 733. The letter referred to Char les and Dantos as \"superb human beings\" who did.\" at\u00ad torneys in preparati nonethe\u00ad less. \"[T]he lawyers were decient, \" the Cour t says, \"in failing to exami ne the cour t le on Rompi lla's prior convic\u00ad tion.\" Ante, at 383. The prior conviction the Cour t refers to is Rompi lla's 1974 conviction for rape , burg lary, and theft. See Commo n\u00ad wealth v. 250 Pa. Super . 139, 378 A. 2d 865 (1977). Before the sentenci ng phase of the wealth informed Rompi lla's attor neys that it intended to use these prior crimes to prove one of the statutory aggravati ng circumst ances\u2014namely , that Rompi his\u00ad tory of felony convictions involv ing the use or threat of vio\u00ad lence to the person. \" 42 Pa. 9711( d)(9) (2002). Rompi the Commonwea lth's plans, and from this the Cour t concludes that effec tive assist\u00ad ance of counsel required a review of the prior conviction case le. A per se rule requir ing counsel in every case to review the records of prior convictions used by the State as aggravati on evidence is a radica l depar ture from Strickland and its prog\u00ad eny. We have warned in the past against the creati on of \"speci c guidel ines\" judicia l evaluati on of attor ney performance .\" 466 U. S., at 688. See also Wig\u00ad gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 521 (2003); Roe v. Flores-O rtega, 528 U. S. 470, 477 (2000). \"No particular set of detailed rules for counsel' s conduc t can satisfac J., dissenti ng the variety of circumst ances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisi ons regardi ng how best to repre\u00ad sent a criminal defendant. Any such set of rules would in\u00ad terfere with the constituti onally protec ted independence of counsel and restr ict the wide latitude counsel must have in mak ing tactical decisi ons. Indeed, the existence of detailed guidel ines for represent ation could distrac t counsel from the overr iding missi on of vigorous advocacy of the defendant' s cause .\" Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688-689 (citations omit\u00ad ted). For this reason, while we have referred to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as a usefu l point of reference , we have been carefu l to say these standards \"are only guides\" and do not establish the constituti onal basel ine for effec tive assist ance of The major ity, by parsi ng the guidel ines as if they were binding statutory text, ignores this admoniti on. The major ity's analysis contains barely a mention of Strickland and makes little effor t to square today' s holdi ng with our traditi onal reluc tance to impose rigid requirements on defense counsel. While the Cour t disclai ms any intenti on to create a bright-l ine rule, ante, at 389-390; see also ante, at 393-394 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing), this affords little com\u00ad fort. The Cour t's opinion makes clear it has imposed on counsel a broad obligati on to review prior conviction case les where those priors are used in aggravati on\u2014and to re\u00ad view every document in those les if not every single page of every document, regardless of the prosecuti on's proposed use for the prior conviction. Infra, at 403, 407-408. One Member of the major ity tries to limit the Cour t's new rule by arguing that counsel' s decisi on here was \"not the resu lt of an informed tactical decisi on,\" ante, at 395 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing), but the record gives no suppor t for this notion. The Cour t also protests the doubt re\u00ad quired them to review the prior conviction le, ante, at 389- 390; ante, at 394-395 (O'Connor, J., PAGES PGT: OPIN 401 Cite 374 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng residua l doubt was fy at sentenci ng that they thought he was innocent, but Dantos tried to draw at\u00ad tenti on away from this point and instead use the fami ly's testi mony to humani ze Rompi lla and ask for mercy . App. 123-149. The major ity also disregards the sound strateg ic calcula\u00ad tion suppor convictions. Id., at 507. postcon viction hear ing, Dantos also indi\u00ad cated that she had reviewed documents relati ng to the prior conviction. Ibid. Based on this informati on, as well as their numerous conversati ons with Rompi lla and his fami ly, Char les and Dantos reasonably could conclude that re\u00ad viewing the full prior conviction case le was not the best allocati on of resources. The major ity concludes other wise only by ignoring Strick\u00ad land's command that \"[j]udicia l scrutiny of counsel' s per\u00ad formance must be deferentia l.\" S., 689. Accordi ng to the Cour t, the Constituti on required noth ing less than a full review of the prior conviction case le by Rompi lla's attor neys. Even with the benet of hindsight the Cour t struggles to explai n how the le would have proved helpfu l, offer ing only the vague specu lation ] victim.\" Ante, at 386. What the Cour t means by \"circumst ances\" is a mystery . If the Cour t is referr ing to details on Rompi neys were more likely to discover such informati on through the sources they consu lted: Rompi lla, his fami ly, and the three ment al health exper ts that exami ned him. Perhaps the circumst ances to which the major ity refers are the details of Rompi lla's 1974 crimes. Char les and Dantos, howe ver, had enough informati on about , J., dissenti ng convictions to deter mine that reviewing the case le was not the most effec tive use of their time. Rompi lla had been con\u00ad victed of break ing into the residence of Joseph ine Macrenna, who lived in an apar tment above the bar she owned. App. 56-89. After Macrenna gave him the bar's receipts for the night, Rompi lla demanded that she disrobe . When she ini\u00ad tially resisted, Rompi lla slashed her left breast with a knife. Rompi lla then held Macrenna at knifepoi nt while he raped her for over an hour . Char les and Dantos were aware of these circumst ances of the prior conviction and the brutality of the crime. Id., at 507. It did not take a review of the case le to know that quibbl ing with the Commonwea lth's versi on of events was a dubi ous trial strateg y. At sentenc\u00ad ing Dantos fought vigorously to prevent the Commonwea lth from introduci ng the details of the 1974 crimes, id., at 16-40, but once the transcr ipt was admitted there was noth ing that could be done . Rompi lla was unlikely to endear himself to the jury by arguing that his prior conviction for burg lary, theft, and rape really was not as bad as the Commonwea lth was mak ing it out to be. Recog nizing this, Rompi lla's at\u00ad torneys instead devoted time and resources to developi ng a mitigati on case. That those effor ts turned up little usefu l evidence does not make the ex ante strateg calculation of Rompi lla's attor neys One of reasons this Cour t has rejected a checkl ist approach to effec tive assist ance of counsel is that each new requirement risks distrac ting attor neys from the real objec tive of prov iding vigorous advocacy as dictated by the facts and circumst ances in the particular case. The Cour t's rigid requirement that counsel always review the case les of convictions the prosecuti on seeks to use at trial will be just such a distrac tion. Capit al defendants often have a history of crime. For example , as of 2003, 64 percent of inmates on death row had prior felony convictions. U. S. Dept. of Justice , Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Bonczar & T. Snel l, Capit al Punishment, 2003, p. 8 (Nov. 2004), available 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN 403 Cite J., dissenti ng at http://www .ojp.usdoj.gov/ bjs/pub/pdf /cp03.pdf (as visited June 16, 2005, and available in Clerk of Cour t's case le). If the prosecuti on relies on these convictions as aggravators, the Cour t has now obligated defense attor neys to review the boxes of documents that come with them. In imposi ng this new rule, the Cour t states that counsel in this case could review the \"entire le\" with \"ease .\" Ante, at 386, n. 4. There is simply no suppor t in the record for this assumpti on. Case les often compr ise numerous boxes. The le may cont ain, among other things, witness state\u00ad ments, forensic evidence arrest repor moti ons, and presentence repor ts. Full review of even a single prior conviction case le could be time consumi ng, and many of the documents in a le are dupl icative or irrele vant. The Cour t, recog nizing the flaw in its analysis, suggests that cases involv ing \"warehouses of records\" \"will call for greater subtlety .\" Ibid. Yet for all we know , this is such a case. As to the time component, the Cour t tells us noth ing as to the number of hours counsel had available to prepare for sen\u00ad tenci ng or why the decisi ons they made in allocati ng their time were so flawed as to constitute decient performance under Strickland. Today' s decisi on will not increase the resources committed to capit al defense . (At the time of Rompi lla's trial, the Le\u00ad high County Publ ic Defender 's Ofce had two investigators for 2,000 cases. App. 662.) If defense attor neys dutifully comply with the Cour t's new rule, they will have to diver t resources from other tasks. The net effec t of today' s hold\u00ad ing in many cases\u2014i nstances where trial counsel reasonably can conclude that reviewing old case les is not an effec tive use of time\u2014will be to diminish the quality of represent a\u00ad tion. We have \"consistently declined to impose mechanica l rules on counsel\u2014 even when those rules might lead to better represent ation,\" Roe v. Flores-O rtega, 528 U. S., 17:19:10] J., dissenti ng no occasi on to depar t from this approach in order to impose a requirement that might well lead to worse represent ation. It is quite possible defense attor effec tive advocacy , will simply ignore the Cour t's new requirement and conti nue to exercise their best judg ment about how to allocate time and resources in preparati on for trial. While this decisi on would be underst andable \u2014and might even be required by state ethical rules, cf. Pa. Rules of Professi onal Conduc t, Preamble , and Rule 1.1 (2005)\u2014it leaves open the possibi lity that a defendant will seek to over turn his conviction based on someth ing in a prior conviction case le that went unre\u00ad viewed. This elevation of needle-i n-a-hayst ack claims to the status of constituti onal violati ons will benet undeserv ing defendants and saddle States with the considerable costs of retrial and/or resentenci ng. Today' s decisi on is wrong under any standard, but the Cour t's error is compounded by the fact that this case arises on federa l habeas. The Pennsylvania lla's ineffec tive-assist ance-of-counsel claim on the means 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d)'s deferentia l standard of review appl ies. Rompi lla must show that the Pennsylvania Supreme Cour t decisi on was not just \"incor\u00ad rect or erroneous, \" but \"objec tively unreasonable .\" Lock\u00ad yer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 75 (2003) (citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410, 412 (2000)). He cannot do so. The Cour t pays lipserv ice to the Williams standard, but it proceeds to adopt a rigid, per se obligati on that binds coun\u00ad sel in every case and nds little suppor t in our precedents. Indeed, Strickland, the case the Cour t purports to apply , is direc contrary: \"Most tiveness of counsel, a cour t shou ld keep in mind that the principles we have stated do not establish mechanica l rules.\" 466 U. S., at 696. The Pennsylvania Su\u00ad preme t gave carefu l considerati on to Rompi lla's Sixth Amendment [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN S. 374 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng relied upon their discussi ons with [Rompi lla] and upon their exper ts to deter mine the records needed to evaluate his ment al health and other potentia l mitigati ng circumst 786, 790 (1998). This decisi far from unreasonable . The Pennsylvania cour ts can hardly be faulted for failing to anticipate today' s abrupt depar ture from Strickland. We have remi nded federa l cour ts often of the need to show the requisite level of deference to state-cour t judg ments under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d). Holland v. Jackso n, 542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam); Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U. S. 433 (2004) (per curiam); Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1 (2003) (per curiam); Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U. S. 12 (2003) (per curiam); Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3 (2002) (per curiam); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19 (2002) (per curiam). By ignoring our own admoniti on today , the Cour t adopts a do\u00ad as-we-say , not-as-we-do to l accepti ng the Cour t's misg uided ation by Rompi lla's trial counsel, Rompi lla is still not entitled to habeas relief. Strickland assig ns the defendant the burden of demonstrati ng prejudice , 466 U. S., at 692. Rompi lla cannot satisfy this standard, and only through a remarkable leap can the Cour t conclude other wise. The Cour t's theory of prejudice rests on serendipity . Nothing in the old case le diminishes the aggravati ng na\u00ad ture of the prior conviction. The only lla's at\u00ad torneys could have minimized the aggravati ng force of the earlier rape conviction was through Dantos' forcefu l, but ultimately unsuccessfu l, ght to exclude the transcr ipt at sentenci ng. The Cour t, recog nizing this problem, through chance . If Rompi lla's attor neys had reviewed the case of prior rape and burg lary convic\u00ad tion, the Cour t says, they would have stumbled across \"a range of mitigati on leads. \" Ante, at Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: Kennedy , J., dissenti ng The range of leads to which the Cour t refers is in fact a handfu l of notations within a single 10-page document. The document, an \"Initia l Transfer Petition,\" appears to have been prepared by the Pennsylvania Depar tment of Correc\u00ad tions after of the Commonwea prisons. Lodg ing to App. 31-40. Rompi lla cannot demonstrate prejudice because noth ing in the record indicates that Rompi lla's trial attor neys would have discovered the transfer petiti on, or the clues cont ained in it, if they had reviewed the old le. The major ity faults Rompi lla's attor neys for failing to \"learn what the details of the aggravati ng evidence the Commonwea lth would Yet if Rompi lla's at\u00ad torneys had reviewed the case le with these purposes in mind, they almost surely would have attributed no signi\u00ad cance to the transfer petiti on following only a cursory review. The petiti on, after all, was prepared by the Depar tment of Correc tions after Rompi lla's initia l of convic\u00ad tion. Reviewing the prior conviction le for informati on to counter the Commonwea lth, counsel would have looked rst at the transcr ipt of the trial testi mony , and perhaps then to probative exhibits or forensic evidence . There would have been no reason for counsel to read, or even to skim, this obscure document. The Cour t claims that the transfer petiti on would have been discovered because it was in the \"same le\" with the transcr ipt, ante, at 391, but this charac terization is mislead\u00ad ing and the conclusi on the Cour t draws from it is accordi ngly fallacious. The record indicates only that the transfer peti\u00ad tion was a part of the same case le, but Rompi lla prov ides no indicati on of the size of the le, which for all we know 545US1 Unit:$U65 [03-26-08 17:19:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN 407 Cite , J., dissenti ng originally compr ised severa l boxes of documents. App. 508, 571, 631. By the time of Rompi lla's state postcon viction hear ing, moreover , the transfer petiti on was not stored in any \"le\" at all\u2014it had been transferred to micro lm. Id., at 461. The Cour t implies in a footnote that prejudice can be presumed because \"Pennsylvania has conspicuously failed to contest Rompi lla's\" inevitable-discovery argument. Ante, at 391, strateg y is unsur\u00ad prising given that discussi on of the prior conviction case le takes up only one paragraph of Rompi lla's argument, Brief for Petitioner 35-36, but it is irrele vant. It is well es\u00ad tablished that Rompi lla, not the Commonwea lth, has the bur\u00ad den of establishing prejudice . Strickland, supra, at 694. The major ity thus nds itself in a bind. If counsel' s al\u00ad leged deciency lies in the failure to review the le for the purposes the major ity has identi ed, then there is no preju\u00ad dice: for there is no reasonable probabi lity that review of the le for those purposes would have led counsel to accord the transfer petiti on enough attenti on to discover the leads the major ity cites. Prejudice could only be demonstrated if the deciency in counsel' s performance were to be descr ibed not as the failure to perform a purposive review of the le, but instead as the failure to accord intense scrutiny to every single page of every single document in that le, regardless of the purpose motivati ng the review. At times, the Cour t hints that its new obligati on on counsel sweeps this broadly . See ante, at 386, n. 4 (\"[t]he ease with which counsel could exami ne the entire le...\" ); ante, at 386, n. 5 (\"[C]ounsel had no way of know ing the context of the transcr ipt and the details of the prior conviction without looking at the le as a whole\"). Surely , howe ver, the Cour t would not require defense counsel to look at every document, no matter how tangentia l, included in the prior conviction le on the off chance that some notation therei n might prov ide a lead, which in turn might resu lt in the discovery of usefu l informa\u00ad tion. The Constituti on does [03-26-08 17:19:11] PAGES PGT: , J., dissenti ng neys perform busy work. This rigid requirement would di\u00ad vert counsel' s limited time and energ y away from more impor tant tasks. In this way, it would ultimately disserve the rationale under lying the Cour t's new rule, which is to ensure that defense counsel counter the State's aggravati on case effec tively . If the Cour t does intend to impose on counsel a constitu\u00ad tional obligati on to review every page of every document included in the case le of a prior conviction, then today' s holdi ng is even more misg uided than I imag ined. * * tempt ation \"to second-g uess counsel' s and cauti oned that \"[a] fair assessment of attor ney perform\u00ad ance requires that every effor t be to the dis\u00ad torting of counsel' s challenged conduc t, and to evaluate the conduc t from counsel' s perspec tive at the time.\" 466 U. S., at 689. Today , the Cour t succumbs to the very tempt ation that Strickland warned against. In the process, the major ity imposes on defense attor neys a rigid requirement that nds no suppor t in our cases or common sense .

Section 3731( b) prov ides that \"[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brough t... more than 6 years after the date on which the violati on of section 3729 is committed. \" In 2001, relator Wilson brought an FCA qui tam action against petiti oners, along with an FCA retaliation claim. Petitioner Graham County Soil and Water Conservati on District em\u00ad ployed Wilson as a secret ary. Wilson alleged that petiti oner county ofcia ls retaliated against her for alerting federa l ofcia ls to the pur\u00ad ict. Petitioners suc\u00ad cessfu lly moved to dismiss the retaliation claim as untimely , on the ground that North Carol ina's 3-year statute of limitations gover ned Wil\u00ad son's FCA action and barred it.

UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON Syllabus tions period runni ng on \"the date on which the violati on of section 3729 is committed, \" that is, on the date the false claim was actually sub\u00ad mitted. That lang uage casts doubt on whether \u00a7 3731( b)(1) speci es a limitations period for retaliation actions. For even a well-pleaded re\u00ad taliation complai nt need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if \u00a7 3731( b)(1) is appl icable . By lly appl ies to well-pleaded \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. Those actions require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim and therefore nec\u00ad essar ily speci fy when \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s time limit begins. At minimum this ly shows that \u00a7 3731( b)(1) whether \"ac\u00ad tion under section 3730\" means all actions arising under that section. Pp. 415-417. (c) Two considerati ons show that the better way to resolve this ambi\u00ad guity is to read the 6-year period to gover n only \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. First, the very next subsec tion, \u00a7 3730( c), uses the similarly unqua lied phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" to refer only to \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. Second, readi ng \u00a7 3731( b)(1) to apply only to those actions is in keepi ng with the defau lt rule that Congress genera lly draf ts statutes of limitations to begin when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action. Where , as here , there are two plausible constr uctions, this Cour t shou ld adopt the constr uction that starts the time limit runni ng when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues. resolves genera lly start the limitations period runni ng when the cause of action accrues, for the likely analogous state statutes virtually all start when the retaliatory action occurs. However, under the readi ng favored by Wilson and the Gover nment, the limitations period would begin at best on the date an actual or suspec ted FCA violati on occurred, which would precede the retaliatory conduc t.

Ibid. The 1986 amendments also revised the lang uage of the 6\u00ad year statute of limitations appl icable to FCA actions.

Petition\u00ad ers Graham County Soil and Water Conservati on District and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservati on District are specia l-pur pose local gover nment the are various local and federa l ofcia ls. Graham County District employed Wilson as a secret ary. Wilson al\u00ad leged that petiti oners made numerous false claims for pay\u00ad ment to the United States in connec tion with a federa l disas\u00ad ter relief program, the Emergency Watershed Protec tion Program, App. 17-20, and in connec tion with agricultura l programs admi nistered by North Carol ina but funded by the Federa l Gover nment, id., at 17-24. Wilson contended, in additi on, that Graham County Dis\u00ad trict ofcia ls retaliated against her for aiding federa l ofcia ls in their investigati on of these false claims. Id., at 25-30. Wilson alerted federa l ofcia ls to petiti oners' suspec ted fraudu lent activities in December 1995 and cooperated with the ensui ng investigati on. Id., at 26-27. Because of her co\u00ad operati on, the complai nt alleged, Graham County District of\u00ad cials repeatedly harassed her from 1996 to 1997, eventua lly induci ng her to resig n in March 1997.

WILSON Opinion of the Cour t retaliation action. Absent an appl icable federa l limitations period, they asked the District Cour t to borrow North Caro\u00ad lina's 3-year statute of limitations for retaliatory-discharge actions. The District Cour t agreed and dismissed the retal\u00ad iation claim, since Wilson led it more than three years after her March 1997 discharge . App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a-70a. The cour t certied that ruling a divided panel of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Fourth Circuit reversed. In the major\u00ad ity's view, the plain lang suppl ies a limita\u00ad tions period for retaliation actions, mak ing it unnecessary to borrow one from North Carol ina law. The cour t reasoned that \u00a7 3731( b)(1) gover cause it appl ies its 6-year limitations period to \" '[a] civil ac\u00ad tion under section 3730.

II To deter mine the appl icable statute of limitations for a cause of action created by a federa l statute , we rst ask whether the statute expressly suppl ies a limitations period. If it does not, we genera lly \"borrow\" the most closely analo\u00ad gous state limitations period. See North Star Steel Co. v. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 33-34 (1995); Reed v.

S. 143, 157-165 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurr ing in judg ment) (traci ng history of bor\u00ad rowing state limitations periods). In the rare case , we have even borrowed analogous federa l limitations periods in the absence of an expressly appl icable one, see, e. g., id., at 150- 157, but no party points to a reason why we shou ld do so here , and we can think of none . The only arguably appl ica\u00ad ble express statute of limitations is the 6-year limit set forth in \u00a7 3731( b)(1). then, is whether \u00a7 3731( b)(1) appl ies by its terms to retaliation actions under \u00a7 3730( h); if it does not, our cases dictate that the most closely analogous state limitations period appl ies. Under \u00a7 3731( b)(1), \"[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brough t... more than 6 years after the date on which the violati on of section 3729 is committed. \" Following the Cour t of Appea ls' lead and suppor ted by the United States appear ing as amicus curiae, Wilson argues that this lan\u00ad guage unambig uously appl ies to that \u00a7 3731( b)(1) appl ies a 6-year limitations period to \"a civil action under section 3730, \" and that \u00a7 3730( h) actions arise under \u00a7 3730; hence claims, the 6-year period gover \u00a7 3730( h) actions. See Neal, supra, at 865-866 (arguing same). We think the statute is more com\u00ad plex than this argument supposes. Statutory lang uage has meani ng only in context, see, e. g., Leoca l v. Ashcro ft, 543 U. S. 1, 9 (2004), and \u00a7 3731( b)(1), read in its proper context, does not gover n \u00a7 3730( h) actions for retaliation. Section 3731( b)(1) is ambig uous, rather than clear , about whether a \u00a7 3730( h) retaliation action is \"a civil action under section 3730. \" Another reasonable readi ng is that it appl ies only to actions arising under \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b), not to \u00a7 3730( h) retaliation actions. That readi ng is suggested by the lang uage in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) tying the start of the time limit to \"the date on which the violati on of section 3729 is com\u00ad mitted. \" In other words, the time limit begins to run on the date the defendant submitted a false claim for payment. 545US1 Unit:$U66 [03-26-08 17:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN & WATER CONSER VATION DIST . v. UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON Opinion of the Cour t See supra, at 412-413. This lang uage casts doubt on whether \u00a7 3731( b)(1) speci es a limitations period for retalia\u00ad tion actions. For even a well-pleaded retaliation complai nt need not allege that the defendant submitted a false claim, leaving the limitations period without a starting point if \u00a7 3731( b)(1) is appl icable . A retaliation plaintiff, instead, need prove only that the defendant retaliated against him for engag ing in \"lawfu l acts done...i nfurtherance that protec ts an employee' s conduc t even if the target of an in\u00ad vestigati on or action to be led was innocent.1 Apply ing \u00a7 3731( b)(1) to FCA lang that section 3730\" to which it is appl icable include a \"violati on of section 3729\" certain from which to start the time runni ng. Section 3731( b)(1), by contrast, natura lly ap\u00ad plies to well-pleaded \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. They re\u00ad quire the plaintiff to plead that the defendant submitted a false claim for payment, and therefore necessar ily speci fy when \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s time limit begins. This textua l anoma ly, at a minimum, shows that \u00a7 3731( b)(1) is ambig uous about whether all actions under \u00a7 3730, or only \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. 1 See United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-W akeeld Hospital, 360 F. 3d ng that protec ted conduc t is \"conduc t that reasonably could lead to a viable FCA action\"); United States ex rel. Ye\u00ad sudian v.

We endorse none of these formulations; we note only that all of them have proper ly recog nized that prov ing a violati on of \u00a7 3729 is not an element of a \u00a7 3730( of action. PGT: OPIN 417 Cite as: 545 U. S. 409 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Wilson and the United States dispute that the statute con\u00ad tains this anoma ly, and instead urge that it clear ly appl ies by its terms to all \u00a7 3730 actions. They point out that every \u00a7 3730( h) action requires the plaintiff to prove that he en\u00ad gaged in protec ted conduc t related to at least a suspected violati on of \u00a7 3729, and argue that \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s limitations period simply begins to run on the date of the suspec ted violati on. have element a suspec ted violati on of \u00a7 3729, their inter pret ation indeed removes the anoma ly, but only at the cost of readi ng into the statute the word \"sus\u00ad pected\" before the phrase \"violati on of of \"violati on[s] of section 3729\"\u2014 actual, not suspected, ones. Wilson and the United States answer that this argument proves too much, because even \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions involve only \"suspec ons of stage of litigati on; but this response misses the point. Every \u00a7 3730( a) or (b) plaintiff who states or proves a valid claim for relief must allege or prove an actual violati on of \u00a7 3729; retaliation plaintiffs need only al\u00ad lege or prove a suspec ted violati on of \u00a7 3729 (or so we are willing to assume). The point is that \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s lang uage appl ies natura lly to all successfu lly pleaded or proved retali\u00ad ation actions only if one reads \"suspec ted\" into its terms, as the dissent essentia lly concedes. See post, at 425-426 (opin\u00ad ion of Breyer, J.). Section 3731( b)(1)'s litera l text, then, is ambig uous. Wil\u00ad son and the Gover nment ask us to read it as if it said \"the [suspec ted or actual] violati on of section 3729. \" Petitioners ask us to read \u00a7 3731( b) as if it said \"civil action under section 3730[( a) or (b)].\" Two considerati ons convince us that the better way to re\u00ad solve this ambig uity is to read the 6-year period to gover n only \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions, and not \u00a7 3730( h) retaliation actions. First, the very next subsec tion of the statute , \u00a7 3731( c), Unit:$U66 [03-26-08 17:23:36] & WATER CONSER VATION DIST . v. UNITED STATES ex rel.

Section 3731( c) prov ides that \"[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be re\u00ad quired to prove all essentia l elements of the cause of action, includi ng damages, by a preponderance of the evidence .\" As Wilson and the United States concede , the context of this prov ision implies that the phrase \"any action brought under section 3730\" is limited to \u00a7 3730( a) actions brought by the United States and \u00a7 3730( b) actions in which the United States intervenes as a party, as those are the types of \u00a7 3730 actions in which the United States necessar ily participates. Other wise, the United States would be \"required to prove all essentia l elements of the cause of action,\" \u00a7 3731( c), in all \u00a7 3730 actions, regardless of whether it participated in the action (a consequence the dissent implicitly embraces by claiming that \"any action brought under section 3730\" in \u00a7 3731( c) means all \u00a7 3730 actions, see post, at 423-424 (opin\u00ad ion of Breyer, J.)). This implicit limitation of the phrase \"action under section 3730\" shows that Congress used the term \"action under section 3730\" imprecisely in \u00a7 3731 and, in particular, that Congress someti mes used the term to refer only to a subset of \u00a7 3730 actions. It is reasonable to read the same lang uage in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) b)(1) to apply only to a) and (b) actions is in keepi ng with the defau lt rule that Congress genera lly draf ts statutes of limitations to begin when the cause of action accrues.

Therefore , where , as the case is here , there are two plausible constr uctions of a statute of limitations, we shou ld adopt the constr uction that starts the time limit runni ng when the cause of action (here retaliation) accrues.2 approach resolves 3731( b)(1) to exclude retaliation start the limita\u00ad tions period runni ng when the cause of action accrues. If \u00a7 3731( b)(1) excludes retaliation actions, then no express time limit appl ies to \u00a7 3730( h) actions, and we borrow the most closely analogous state time limit absent an expressly appl i\u00ad cable one. See supra, at 414-415. The likely analogous state statutes of limitations virtually all start to run when the cause of action accrues\u2014i n retaliation actions, when the retaliatory action occurs.3 2 Justice Stevens, we believe, misappl ies this inter pretive rule. Post, p. 422 (opinion concurr ing in judg ment). He argues 3731( b)(1) does not gover n \u00a7 3730( h) actions because \"it is so unlikely that a legislature would actually intend\" to start the statute of limitations runni ng before the cause of action accrues that he \"wou ld presume that the anoma ly was the produc t of a draf ting error \" regardless of whether the text is ambig u\u00ad ous. Dodd v. United States, ante, at 362, n. 1 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). This is not the proper analysis. Section 3731( b)(1) is ambig uous because its text, litera lly read, admits of two plausible inter pret ations. Supra, at 415-417.

UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON Stevens, J., concurr ing in judg ment have as an element a \"violati on of section 3729, \" that is, \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b) actions. Granted, other textua l evidence cuts against this readi ng of \u00a7 3731( b)(1). In particular, Congress used the phrase \"brought under subsec tion (a) or (b) of section 3730\" in \u00a7 3731( d); this, it is argued, shows that Congress could have been similarly precise in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) if it wished. In the context of this statute , howe ver, that argument proves too much, since the same could be said of \u00a7 3731( c), which all agree uses the phrase \"action under section 3730\" in more limited, and less precise , fashion. See supra, at 417-418. We do not doubt that Congress could have draf ted \u00a7 3731( b)(1) with more precisi on than it did, but the presence of the same inexac t wordi ng in \u00a7 3731( c) means that the more precise lang uage in \u00a7 3731( d) casts little doubt on our readi ng of the statute . * * * For the reasons we have discussed, the FCA 's express lim\u00ad itations period does not apply to \u00a7 3730( h) actions. The most closely analogous state statute of limitations therefore ap\u00ad plies. Judge Wilkinson, in his dissenti ng opinion below , con\u00ad cluded that the most closely analogous state statute of limi\u00ad tations in this case is North Carol ina's 3-year statute of limitations gover ning wrong ful-discharge claims. See 367 F. 3d, at 261-262. The appropr iate state statute of limita\u00ad tions to borrow , howe ver, is not within the scope of the ques\u00ad tion we granted certiorar i to decide , and the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals did not pass on the point. We therefore leave that issue for remand. The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedi ngs consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Stevens, concurr ing in the judg ment. For the reasons stated in my dissenti ng opinion in Dodd v. United States, ante, p. 360, I concur in the judg ment. OPIN 423 U. S. 409 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenti ng. As the Cour t points out, it is unusua l to nd a statute of limitations keyed not to the time of the plaintiff's injury, but to other related events. Still, I believe that Congress has written such a statute here , and we shou ld respec t its decisi on. The lang uage of the statute , 31 U. S. C. \u00a7 3731( b)(1), is rea\u00ad sonably clear . It says that \"[a] civil action unde r section 3730 may not be brought . . . more than 6 years after the date on which the violati on\" of federa l false claims law \"is committed. \" (Emphasis added.) Section 3730 lists three kinds of civil actions, includi ng a retaliation action under \u00a7 3730( h). Thus, a retaliation action is a \"civil action under section 3730, \" and \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s 6-year limitations period appl ies. The Cour t tries to overcome the force of this syllogism with the help of two textua l arguments. First, it points to the subsec tion that follows \u00a7 3731( b)\u2014\u00a7 3731( c)\u2014wh ich that \" '[i]n any action brought under section 3730, the United States shall be required to prove all essentia l elements of the cause of action, includi ng damages, by a preponderance of the evidence .' \" See ante, at 418. The Cour t then rea\u00ad sons that, read in context, the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" could not refer to all the civil actions listed under \u00a7 3730, for the United States is not ordinarily a party to private retaliation suits brought under \u00a7 3730( h). Ibid. Rather , the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" must refer only to the false claims actions listed in \u00a7\u00a7 3730( a) and (b). Ibid. Thus, accordi ng to the Cour t, if in \u00a7 3731( c), the phrase \"action brought under section 3730\" refers only to a subse t of the actions listed under \u00a7 3730, one can read the similar phrase in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) to cont ain a similar limitation. Ibid. The problem with this argument lies in its conclusi on. The reason that \u00a7 3731( c) may apply to Unit:$U66 [03-26-08 17:23:36] & WATER CONSER VATION DIST . v. UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON Breyer, J., dissenti ng (b) actions has noth ing to do with the phrase \"action brought under section 3730. \" Rather , any limitation on \u00a7 3731( c)'s icati on comes from different words, namely , \"the United States. \" These latter words make clear not that the phrase \"under section 3730\" has a different mean ing than in (b), but that (c) comes into play only in cases in which the United States is a party (and only in such cases, cf. ibid.). Because it is these words\u2014the subjec t of the subsec tion, \"the United States\"\u2014that deter mines whether (c) has appl icati on in any given case , there is noth ing in \u00a7 3731( c) that would make it \"reasonable ,\" ibid., to read the phrase \"action under section 3730\" in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) to apply , as the Cour t concludes, to only \"two out of three actions under section 3730. \" The subsec tions extratextua l limitation on tion under section 3730. \" In \u00a7 3731( a), Congress apparently used the phrase \"under section 3730\" to mean all three \u00a7 3730 actions. \u00a7 3731( a) (a \"subpoena requir ing the attendance of a witness at a trial or hear ing conduc ted under section 3730 of this title may be served at any place in the United States\"). And in \u00a7 3731( d), Congress used the very words that the Cour t seeks to nd in \u00a7 3731( b), but that do not there exist \u2014namely , the words \"under subsec tion (a) or (b) tion 3730\"\u2014when it meant to narrow a prov ision's compass to two out of the three \u00a7 3730 causes of action. \u00a7 3731( d) (\"[A] nal judg ment rendered in favor of the United States in any criminal proceedi ng charg ing estop the defendant from deny ing the essen\u00ad tial elements of the offense in any action which involves the same transac tion as in the criminal proceedi ng and which is brought under subsec tion (a) or (b) of section 3730\"); see also ante, at 421-422. The statutory context therefore shows that Congress did not intend for the phrase \"[a] civil action under section 3730\" to mean anyth ing other than what it says. Unit:$U66 [03-26-08 17:23:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN 425 Cite U. S. 409 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng Second, the Cour t points to lang uage in \u00a7 3731( b)(1) that speci es when the limitations period begins to run: \"the date on which the violati claims prov ision, \u00a7 3729, \"is committed. \" See ante, at 415-416. It then points out that a retaliation action does not necessar ily involve an ac\u00ad tual false claims violati on, because (it assumes) a retaliation plaintiff need only show \"a suspected violati on.\" Ante, at 417 (emphasis in original). Thus, adopti relator 's and the Gover nment' Cour t ng some words into \u00a7 3731( b)(1)\u2014so actual] violati on'\"\u2014wh ich would distor the statute more than readi ng some other , different words into the statute \u2014so that it would say \" '[a] civil action under section 3730[( a) or (b)].' \" Ibid. The difcu lty with the Cour t's choice of the latter linguis\u00ad tic additi on is that the two sets of textua l inser tions\u2014on the one hand \"suspec ted or actual,\" on the other hand \"(a) or (b)\"\u2014are not equiva lent. Statutes of limitations, when re\u00ad ferring to starting points, genera lly refer not to actual events, but to alleged events. Thus, a plaintiff's tort action is timely if he les it within, say, three years of the alleged negligently caused injury; a plaintiff's breach-of-contrac t ac\u00ad tion is timely if led within, say, one year of the alleged breach. And a plaintiff who loses such an action because the defendant shows, say, that there was no such injury or no such breach, has not, for that reason, brought the action outside the limitations period. Rather , the suit is still timely even though the violati on remai ns noth ing more than \"alleged\" after trial. Such a plaintiff has simply lost a timely led action on the merits. The prov ision before us is no different. Section 3731( b)(1)'s 6-year time clock begins to run on \"the date on which the violati on\" of federa l false claims law, committed. \" Thus, any \u00a7 3730 plaintiff\u2014even one bringing a false claims action & WATER CONSER VATION DIST . v. UNITED STATES ex rel. WILSON Breyer, J., dissenti ng years from the moment of a suspec ted\u2014that is, an un\u00ad proven\u2014v Act's i\u00ad sion. Thus, as natura lly inter preted, the words \"the date on which the violati on... is committed\" refer to the date on which the suspec ted violati on occurs. I recog nize that there is a relevant disti nction in this case. In the typical case (say, the tort or contrac t case) the plaintiff must ultimately prove all the relevant allegati ons. Here, the retaliation victim need not prove that her employer did in fact violate federa l false claims law, but only that she be\u00ad lieved that there was such a violati on. See ibid. But that disti nction does not make the difference . Given the clear link between claimed violati ons of federa l false claims law and retaliation actions (the latter depend on the former) and given that trigger ing events in statutes of limitations implic\u00ad itly mean alleged trigger ing events, \u00a7 3731( b)(1) remai ns most natura lly read as implicitly referr ing to alleged or sus\u00ad pected violati ons of federa l false claims law. And at the very least, readi ng the statute in this way, especia lly in light of the other statutory indicators, see supra, at 423-424, does far less violence to \u00a7 3731( b)(1)'s text than does the Cour t's additi on of \"(a) or (b).\" The Cour t's far stronger argument is not textua l. It con\u00ad cerns the limitations prov ision's That purpose , after all, includes prov iding victims of retaliation a reason\u00ad able time within which they can le an action to vindicate their rights. Cf. S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 34 (1986) (additi on of a retaliation cause of action intended \"to halt companies . . . from using the threat of economic retaliation to silence 'whistleblowers' \" and to \"assure those who may be consider\u00ad ing exposi ng fraud that they are legally protec ted from retal\u00ad iatory acts\"). How can we reconci le that purpose with a readi ng of the statute that, as a matter of logic, could allow the limitations period to begin to run, perhaps even to ter\u00ad minate , before the forbidden OPIN 427 U. S. 409 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng The answer , in my view, is that Congress could have had a particular qui tam-related purpose in mind. That is, it could have intended to prov ide a fairly leng thy limitations period, namely , six years from the time the false claims con\u00ad duct occurs, appl icable to all related actions, and then to put an end to all such litigati on. This makes particular sense given the reasonable assumpti on that false claims and retali\u00ad ation actions are likely to be litigated together . See, e. g., App. 11-35 (relator 's complai nt pursui ng both qui tam and retaliation claims in same suit); United States ex rel. Lujan v. Hugh es Aircra ft Co., 162 F. 3d 1027, 1030 (CA9 1998) (same). Of course , as the exac possible injury to an indiv idua l who suffers retaliation that comes late in the day. But ap\u00ad parently there is no such indiv idua l. Neither the Cour t nor petiti oners have been able to nd any actual example . See, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 6; see also Brief for United States as Ami cus Curiae 27-28 (United States is unaware of any such example). Nor have I. By contrast, the Cour t's readi ng of the statute exac ts a different, but certain, price. It substitutes for a fairly leng thy\u2014and uniform\u20146-year limitations term, a crazy quilt of limitations periods stitched together from the laws of 51 jurisdic tions which, in some instances, might require a plaintiff to bring a retaliation claim within 90 days, six months, or one year after the retaliation takes place . See, e. g., Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61.103(2) 2004) (90-day a) (2003) (180-day limitations es Aircra ft Co., supra, at 1035 (California's 1-year limitations period for wrong ful termination in violati on of publ ic policy appl ies to \u00a7 3730( h) action).

Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 478.2(1), claiming that it discr iminates against interst ate carriers and imposes an unconstitu\u00ad tional burden on interst ate trade because trucks carry ing both inter\u00ad state and intrast ate loads engage in less intrast ate business than trucks carry ing only intrast ate loads. The State Cour t of Claims rejected the claim, holdi ng that, because the fee is regulatory and intended for the Mich igan Motor Carr ier Act's admi nistrati on, it is not amenable to ap\u00ad portionment; that it is an appropr iate exercise of the State's police power; and that it does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrast ate commerce .

It appl ies evenhandedly to all carriers mak ing domestic journeys and does not reflec t an effor t to tax activity taking place outside of the State. Nothing in this Cour t's case law suggests that such a neutra l, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause . That is not surprising, since States impose numerous flat fees on local business and serv ice prov iders, e. g., insurers and auctioneers. The Constituti on neither displaces States' author ity to shelter their people from health and safety menaces nor undu ly curtails their power to lay taxes to suppor t state gover nment.

Because the costs the fee seeks to defray , e. g., those of regulating vehicular size and weight, would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than per mile traveled, a per\u00ad truck, rather than a per-mi le, assessment is likely fair. And petiti oners prov ide no details of their preferred alternative miles-traveled system or point to evidence of its prac ticality.

Hence , because Mich igan' s fee is flat, it discr iminates against interst ate carriers and imposes an unconstituti onal burden upon interst ate trade . The Mich igan Cour t of Claims rejected the carriers' claim for three reasons.

Such a fee \"is not amenable to a fee structure based on appor tionment by usage rates. \" Ibid. Second, the fee ts a \"legitimate expressi on of the [S]tate's concer n that the welfare of its citizens be protec ted,\" and hence an ap\u00ad propr iate exercise of the State's police power . Ibid. Third, the fee does not implicate the Commerce Clause because it falls only on intrast ate, not interst ate, commerce . Id., at 45a. The Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls afrmed.

Nonetheless, the cour t rejected the truck\u00ad ers' claim because the statute \"reg ulates evenhandedly at 621, 662 N.

To begin with, Mich igan imposes the flat $100 fee only upon intrast ate transac tions\u2014that is, upon activities taking place exclusively within the State's borders. Section 478.2(1) does not facia lly discr iminate against interst ate or out-of-st ate activities or enter prises. The statute appl ies evenhandedly to all carri\u00ad ers that make domestic journeys. It does not reflec t an ef\u00ad fort to tax activity that takes place , in whole or in part, out\u00ad side the State. Nothing in our case law suggests that such a neutra l, locally focused fee or tax is inconsistent with the dormant Commerce Clause . This legal vacuum is not surprising. States impose nu\u00ad merous flat fees upon local businesses and serv ice prov iders, includi ng, for example , upon insurers, auctioneers, ambu\u00ad lance operators, and hosts of others. See, e. g., Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 33-36-104 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. \u00a7 38-7-10 (West 2002). Although we have \"long since rejected any sugges\u00ad tion that a state tax . . . affec ting interst ate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a 'local' or intrast ate activity,\" Commo nwealth Edi\u00ad son Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 615 (1981), we have also made clear that the Constituti on neither displaces States' au\u00ad thor ity \"to shelter [their ] people from menaces to their health or safety ,\" D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 29 (1988) (inter nal quot ation marks omitted), nor \"undu ly cur\u00ad tail[s]\" States' power \"to lay taxes state gover nment, \" McGoldrick v. Berwind-W hite Coal Mining Co., 309 U. S. 33, 48 (1940). The record, moreover , shows no specia l circumst ance sug\u00ad tice as anyth ing other than an unobjec tionable exercise of the State's police power . To the contrary , as the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls pointed out, the record cont ains little, if any, evidence that the $100 fee imposes any signicant prac tical burden upon interst ate trade . See at 435 Cite as: 545 U. S. 429 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t 2d, at 803-804. The record does show , for example , that some interst ate trucks \"top off\" some interst ate hauls with intrast ate deliveries. See ng lants it of James C. Crozier \u00b6 7 (licensi ng and fuel manager of TNT Holland Motor Express, Inc., descr ibing this prac tice). But it does not tell us the answers to such questi ons as: How often does \"toppi ng off\" occur across the industry? Does the $100 make a difference by sig\u00ad nicantly discourag ing ate carriers the possibi obtaining a intrast ate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem? See \u00a7 478.2(3); see also Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3 (4,928 tempo\u00ad rary permits were issued in 2004). If the fees ($100 and $10) discourage \"toppi ng off,\" does that l effec t make a signicant interstate difference? Would a variable fee (of the kind the truckers advocate) eliminate such differ\u00ad ence? The minimal facts in the record tell us little about these matters. Compare App. 60-61, Supplement al Afda\u00ad vit of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 (ofcia the Mich ice Commissi on stating that toppi ng off is rare for most interst ate carriers because it disrupts schedu les and shipping patter ns), with Reply Brief Interveni ng Plaintiffs-Appel lants in Nos. Exh. A, Supplement al Afdav it of James C. Crozier \u00b6 6 (TNT Holland frequently tops off interst ate loads). And at oral argument, ATA conceded the absence of record facts that empir ically could show that the $100 fee signicantly deters interst ate trade . Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. Neither does the record show that the flat assessment un\u00ad fairly discr iminates against interst ate truckers. The fee seeks to defray costs such as those of regulating \"veh icular size and weight, \" of admi nister ing \"insurance requirements, \" and of apply ing \"safety standards. \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. The bulk of such costs would seem more likely to vary per truck or per carrier than to vary per mile traveled. See 545US1 Unit:$U67 [06-13-06 11:23:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN . v. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V. COMM'N Opinion of the Cour t 255 Mich. App., at 612-617, 662 N. W. 2d, at 799-801. And that fact means that a per-tr uck, rather than a per-mi le, as\u00ad sessment is likely fair. Cf. Jefferson Lines, 514 U. S., at 199 (rejecting taxpayer 's discr imination claim in part because \"miles traveled within the State simply are not a relevant proxy for the benet conferred upon the parties to a sales transac tion\"). Nothing in the record suggests the contrary . Nor would an effor t to switch the manner of fee assess\u00ad ment \u2014from lump sum to, for example , miles traveled\u2014be burden free. The record cont ains an afdav it, swor n by Publ ic Serv ice Commissi on ofcia l, that states that to obtain the same revenue (about $3.5 million) through a per-mi le fee would require the State to create a \"dat a accu\u00ad mulation system\" capable of separati ng out intrast ate hauls and deter mining their leng th, and to develop related liability, billing, and auditi ng mechanisms. App. 64, Second Supple\u00ad ment al Afdav it of Thomas R. Lonergan \u00b6 2. This afdav it, on its face, suggests that the game is unlikely to be worth the candle . While petiti oners argue the contrary , they do not prov ide the details of their preferred alternative ad\u00ad ministrative system nor point to record evidence show ing its prac ticality. See Jefferson Lines, supra, at 195 (State is not required to use a particular appor tionment formula just because it may be \"possible\" to do so). Petitioners insist that they do not need empir ically to dem\u00ad onstrate the existence of a burdensome or discr iminatory impac t upon interst ate trucking, or (presumably) the un\u00ad fairness of the assessment in relati on to defrayed costs, or (presumably) the admi nistrative prac ticality of the alterna\u00ad tives. They say that our earlier case , Ame rican Trucking Assn s., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987), requires invali\u00ad dation of the $100 flat fee, even in the absence of such proof . We disagree . In Scheiner, this Cour t invalidated flat $25 \"marker fee\" and a flat \"axle tax\" that Pennsylvania levied upon all trucks (interst ate and intrast ate) that used 545 U. S. 429 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t trucks that merely crossed Pennsylvania' s borders to trans\u00ad port, say, Ohio goods to New Jersey customers. See id., at 273-275. Data showed that the fees imposed a cost per mile on interst ate trucks that was approxi mately \"ve times as heavy as the cost per mile borne by local trucks. \" Id., at 286. The assessments largely helped to raise revenue \"to improve and maintain [the State's] highways and bridges, \" id., at 270, thereby helpi ng to cover costs likely to vary sig\u00ad nicantly with truck-mi les traveled, see ibid. And the as\u00ad sessments did \"not even purport to approxi mate fairly the cost or value of the use of Pennsylvania' s roads. \" Id., at 290. In light of these considerati ons, Pennsylvania' s lump-sum taxes \"threaten[ ed] the free movement of commerce by plac\u00ad ing a nancia l barr ier around the State of Pennsylvania. \" Id., at 284. We concluded that \"[i]f each State imposed flat taxes for the privilege of mak ing commercia l entrances into its territory , there [was] no conceivable doubt that commerce among the States would be deterred. \" Ibid. The present fee, as we have said, taxes purely local activ\u00ad ity; it does not tax an interst ate truck's entry into the State nor does it tax transac tions spanni ng multiple States. See 255 Mich. App., at 592-594, 662 N. W. 2d, at 789. We lack convincing evidence show ing that the tax deters, or for that matter discr iminates against, interstate activities. See supra, at 434-435. Nor is the tax one that, on its face, would seem to call for an assessment measured per mile rather than per truck. See supra, at 435-436. Conse\u00ad quently , we lack any reason to infer that Mich igan' s lump\u00ad sum levy roadblock. Petitioners add s fee fails the \"inter nal consistency\" test\u2014a test that we have typically used where taxati on of interst ate transac tions is at issue . Genera lly speak ing, that test asks, \"What would happen if all States did the same?\" See, e. g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 261 (1989); Jefferson Lines, supra, at 185 (test looks to the 545US1 Unit:$U67 [06-13-06 PAGES PGT: OPIN . v. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V. COMM'N Opinion of the Cour t structure of the tax to see whether its identica l appl icati on by every State \"wou ld place interst ate commerce at a disad\u00ad vant age as compared with commerce intrast ate\"). We must concede that here , as petiti oners argue, if all States did the same , an interst ate truck would have to pay fees totaling severa l hundred dollars, or even severa l thousand dollars, were it to \"top off\" its business by carry ing local loads in many (or even all) other States. But it would have to do so only because it engages in local business in all those States. An interst ate rm with local outlets normally expec ts to pay local fees that are uniformly assessed upon all those who engage in local business, interst ate and domestic rms alike. See, e. g., Commo nwealth Edison, 453 U. S., at 623-624 (dor\u00ad mant Commerce Clause does not seek \"to relieve those en\u00ad gaged in interst ate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing busi\u00ad ness\" (inter nal quot ation marks omitted)); cf. Jefferson Lines, supra, at 187-188 (in context of sales tax, \"the Com\u00ad merce Clause does not forbid the actual assessment of a suc\u00ad cessi on of taxes by different States on disti nct events as the same tangible objec t flows along \"). A motor carrier is not specia l in this respec t. In sum, petiti oners have failed to show that Mich igan' s fee, which does not seek to tax a share of interst ate transac tions, which focuses upon local activity, and which is assessed even\u00ad handedly , either burdens or discr iminates against interst ate commerce , or violates the Commerce Clause in any other rel\u00ad evant way. See Complete Auto Tran sit, Inc. v. Brady , 430 U. S. 274, 279 (1977) (noting that a tax will be sustained where it is appl ied to an activity with a \"subst antia l nexus\" to the taxing State; where , if appl ied to interst ate activity, it is \"fair ly appor tioned\"; where it does not discr iminate; and where it is \"fair ly related to the serv ices prov ided\"). For these reasons, the judg ment of the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls is afrmed. 11:23:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN 439 Cite as: 545 U.

The 1965 versi on of the law author ized States to require proof that a truck operator had such a permit. By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof, requir ing a $10 per truck registrati on fee (State Registrati on) and giving each trucker a stamp to afx to a multistate \"bingo card\" carried in the vehicle. Finding this scheme inefcient and burdensome , Congress created the current Single State Registrati on System (SSRS), which allows a trucking company to ll out one set of forms in one State (base State), thereby register ing its Federa l Permit in every partici\u00ad pating State through which its trucks travel. 49 U.

(a) Reference to text, histor ical context, and purpose disclose that the words \"State registrati on requirement\" in \u00a7 14504( b)'s second sentence only to those state requirements concer ning SSRS registrati on.

Finally, noth ing in the statute' s basic purposes card\" sys\u00ad simplifying a uniform for prov iding States with certain vital informati on\u2014 either requires a broader readi ng of the term or impliedly pre-empts non-SSRS-related state rules. Pp. 446-451. (b) Section 478.2(2)' requirements do not concer n the SSRS' s subjec t matter . First, the Mich igan statute makes no reference to evidence of a Federa l Permit, an insurance requirement, or an agent for receiv ing serv ice of process. Nor do any state rules related to the fee appear to require the ling of informati on on these matters. In additi on, because Mich igan imposed its separate fee before the SSRS existed and before it began to participate in the \"bingo card\" system, the fee does not represent an effor t to circumvent the limitations imposed in connec tion with federa l laws gover ning Federa l Permits. Fi\u00ad nally, petiti oners have failed to show that Mich igan rules do not allow a Mich igan-plated interst ate truck choosi ng Mich igan as its base State to comply with the SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with \u00a7 478.2(2). The fact that Mich igan appears to forgive the State's $10 SSRS fee for trucks that comply with \u00a7 478.2(2) can be seen as an effor t to prov ide a modest, admi nistratively efcient recompense to those motor carriers that choose Mich igan as their base State, but such a sub\u00ad sidiary connec tion cannot transfor m the requirement concer ning SSRS statute' s subjec t matter . 451-453.

S. 440 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t see genera lly Yellow Tran sp., Inc. v. Michigan, 537 U. S. 36, 39 (2002). By 1991, 39 States demanded such proof by re\u00ad quiring some form of what we shall call State Registrati on (of the Federa l Permit). Those States typically would re\u00ad quire truckers to le with a state agency evidence that each interst ate truck was covered by a Federa l Permit. They would require the trucker to pay a State Registrati on fee of up to $10 per truck. And they would issue a State Registra\u00ad tion stamp that the trucker would afx to a multistate \"bingo card\" carried within the vehicle. See 49 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1023.32, 1023.33 (1990); Yellow Tran sp., 537 U. S., at 39. In 1991, Congress focused upon the fact that the \"bingo card\" system required a trucking company to obtain a sepa\u00ad rate stamp from each State through which an interst ate truck traveled. It found this scheme inefcient and burden\u00ad some . See id., at 39-40. And it enac ted a statute setti ng forth a new system, the Single State Registrati on System (SSRS), which remai ns in effec . Inter l Surface Transpor tation Efciency Act of (ISTEA), 49 U. S.

The SSRS allows a trucking company to ll out one set of forms in one State (the base State), and by doing so to register its Federa l Permit in every participati ng State through which its trucks will travel. \u00a7 c); 49 CFR \u00a7 367.4( b) (2004). The SSRS statute says that the base State can demand: (1) proof of the trucking company' s possessi on of a Fed\u00ad eral Permit, (2) proof of insurance , (3) the name of an agent desig nated to receive \"serv ice of process, \" and (4) a total fee (charged for the ling of the proof of insurance) equa l to the sum of the indiv idua l state fees. 49 U. idua l state fee, it adds, cannot exceed the amount the State charged under the \"bingo card\" system, and in no event can it exceed $10 per truck. 49 U.

The base State distr ibutes to each participati ng State its share of the total registrati on fee. \u00a7 367.6( a). The SSRS statute speci es that a State may not impose any additi onal \"reg istrati on requirement. \" It states spe\u00ad cically, in the statutory sentence at issue here , that when a State Registrati on requirement imposes further obligati ons, \"the part in excess is an unreasonable burden. \" 49 U.

And it provides that the \"charg ing or collection of any fee under this section that is not in accordance with the fee system established [in this prov ision] shall be deemed to be a burden on interst ate commerce .\" \u00a7 14504( c)(2)( C). At the same time, the statute makes clear that a State that compl ies with the SSRS system need not fear Commerce Clause attack, for it says that a state requirement that an interst ate truck \"must register with the State\" is \"not unreasonable transpor\u00ad that \"the State registrati with the SSRS statute . \u00a7 14504( b).

II A The rst legal questi on before us concer ns the meani ng of the federa l statutory words \"State registrati on require\u00ad ment. \" They appear in a subsec tion that reads in relevant part as follows: \"The requirement of a State that a motor carrier, pro\u00ad viding [interst ate transpor tation] in that State, must register with the State is not an unreasonable burden on transpor tation . . . when the State registrati on is completed under standards of the Secret ary [of Trans\u00ad portation] under subsec tion tion requiremen t imposes obligati ons in excess of the standards of the Secret ary, the part in excess is an un\u00ad reasonable burden. \" 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) (emphasis added). What is the scope of the italicized words? Petitioners ask us to give these words a inter pret a\u00ad tion, sweepi ng within their ambit of lized registrati on that af\u00ad fects carrier. Brief for Petitioners 15 (federa l statute' s limits apply \"to all interst ate motor carri\u00ad ers compel led to register their operati ons with any State regulatory commissi on under any State law\" (emphasis in original)). The United States argues for a somewhat nar\u00ad rower inter pret ation, submitti ng that the words apply to \"state registrati on requirements that are imposed on inter\u00ad state carriers by reaso n of their operati on in interst ate com\u00ad merce .\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-20 (emphasis in original). In our view, howe ver, the lang uage , read in context, is yet U. S. 440 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Reference to text, histor ical context, and purpose discloses that the words \"State registrati on requirement\" do not apply to every State Registrati on requirement that happens to cover interst ate carriers, nor to every such requirement spe\u00ad cically focused on a trucking operati on's interst ate charac\u00ad ter. Rather , they apply only to those state requirements that concer n SSRS registra tion\u2014that is, registrati on with a State of evidence that a carrier possesses a Federa l Permit, registrati on of proof of insurance , or registrati on of the name of an agent \"for serv ice of process. \" state re\u00ad quirements that (1) concer n the subjec t matter of the SSRS and (2) are \"in excess\" of the requirements that the SSRS imposes in respec t to that subjec t matter . See \u00a7 14504( b). To begin with, statutory lang uage makes clear that the federa l prov ision reaches no further. Section 14504( b)'s rst sentence says that a state \"requirement\" that an interst ate motor carrier must \"reg ister with the State is not an unrea\u00ad sonable burden . . . when the State registrati on is completed under standards of the Secret ary under subsec tion (c).\" Ibid. It is clear from the text as a whole that \"State regis\u00ad trati on\" cannot cover all registrati on requirements, but only some . Cf. post, at 464-465 (Kennedy , J., dissenti ng). The rst sentence' s reference to the \"standards of the Secret ary\" (as well as the focus of the entire statute) tells us which. Those \"standards, \" set forth in subsec tion (c)\u2014wh ich is titled \"Single State Registrati on exclusively relate to State Registrati of of\" a Federa l Permit, \"proof insurance the \"name of a local agent for serv ice of process, \" and state fees \"for the ling of proof of insurance .\" \u00a7\u00a7 14504( c)(2)(A)( i)-(iv); \u00a7 14504( c)(2)(B )(iv). And the rest of the statute similarly deals exclusively with SSRS matters. See \u00a714504( a) (\"standards\" mean \"the speci cati on of forms and procedures required\" to prove that a motor carrier is in compl iance with federa l requirements). Thus, the v. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V. COMM'N Opinion of the Cour t tence refer only to state systems that seek evidence that a trucker has compl ied with speci c, federa lly enumerated, SSRS obligati S. d) (\u00a7 14504' s fees relate speci cally to state effor ts to obtain b)(2)-(3) (indicati ng that \u00a7 14504 refers to state requirements having this purpose). How could the same words in the second sentence refer to someth ing totally different? We have found no lang uage here or elsewhere in the statute (which we reproduce in the Appendix, infra) suggesti ng that the term \"State registra\u00ad sentence two refers to all State Regis\u00ad trati on requirements \"imposed on interst ate carriers by rea\u00ad son of their operati on in interst ate commerce .\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (emphasis in original). Indeed, to read the words \"by reason of . . . \" into \u00a7 14504, a linguistic stretch, would be whol ly inconsistent with the statute' s basic purposes, because it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of speci c SSRS limita\u00ad tions as long as it did not single out interst ate carriers (say, a neutra l rule that all truckers must pay $50, or $500, per truck for proof of insurance , or must desig nate multiple agents for serv ice of process). See post, at 463 (Kennedy , J., dissenti ng). To avoid this severely incongr uous resu lt, the dissent (which adopts the Gover s view) must resor rst tion (b) to say that a neutra l base state requirement, despite being \"in ex\u00ad cess\" of SSRS standards, is not an on\" commerce , it then reads subsec tion (c) to say that such a requirement, becau se it is \"in excess\" of SSRS standards, is nonetheless proh ibited by the statute (in effec t, an unreason\u00ad able burden on commerce). Post, at 466-468. Aside from imposi ng signicant complexities on the statute where other\u00ad wise this readi ng stretches subsec tion (c)'s func tion beyond Cite U. S. 440 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Similarly, we see no lang uage elsewhere in the statute sug\u00ad gesti \"State registrati to any kind of Registrati on whatsoe ver that might affec t interst ate carriers. And even the areas of state regulation\"\u2014are beyond the pre\u00ad emptive reach of the statute . Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19. Finally, the implementi ng regulations do not these et con\u00ad text. 14504 the old \"bingo card\" system. See Yellow Tran sp., 537 U. S., at 39-40. Under the \"bingo card\" scheme , each State could independ\u00ad ently demand the same separate lings (evidence of a Fed\u00ad eral Permit, proof of insurance , and a serv ice-of-process agent) as well as separate fees. 49 U. C. \u00a7 302(b)(2) ning that scheme placed no express constrai nts on any state lings or fees other than those concer ning Federa l Permit and insurance require\u00ad ments. Indeed, speci ed \"affec t\" the \"collection or [the] method of collection of taxes or fees by a State\" from interst ate truckers \"for the operati on of vehicles within\" \"borders. \" \u00a7 1023.104. And they further prov ided that the statute did not \"affec t\" state requirements \"as to the exter\u00ad nal identi cati on of vehicles to indicate the payment of a State tax or fee imposed for revenue purposes or for any other purpose\" not gover ned by the \"bingo card\" system. \u00a7 1023.42. When Congress created the new SSRS, it did not indicate (in the text, structure , or divinable purpose of the new prov i\u00ad sion) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old. See ISTEA, 105 Stat. 1914. The relevant differences between the SSRS and the 545US1 Unit:$U68 [03-26-08 . v. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V. COMM'N Opinion of the Cour t \"bingo card\" regime were that: (1) one State, rather than many , would collect the relevant lings; (2) one State, rather than many , would collect the relevant fees; and (3) these fees, limited to the same amount as before , would relate to ling of proof of insurance rather than to ling of the Federa l Permit. Compare 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 11506 (1988 ed.) with \u00a7 14504 IV). These modi merely sought more efcient, not greater , federa l regulation. See Yellow Tran sp., supra; see also 49 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 13908( a), (d) (author izing the Secret ary to replace the SSRS with a yet more streaml ined system and pre-empti ng only those State \"insurance ling requirements or fees that are for the same purposes as lings or fees the Secret ary requires under the new system\" (emphasis added)). And while the new regula\u00ad tions the SSRS do not un\u00ad related state requirements from the statute' s pre-emptive reach, neither they nor the rulemak ing that produced them suggest any change to pre-existi ng prac tice in (Sub- No. 6), 1993 WL 17833 1993) (proposi ng regulations, prov iding justi cati ons, and soliciting further comments). Finally, we have found noth ing in the statute' s basic pur\u00ad poses or tives\u2014i mprov ing the efciency of the \"bingo card\" system and simplifying a uniform scheme for prov iding States with certain vital informati on\u2014that either requires a broader readi ng of the statutory term, or that impliedly pre-empts other , non-SSRS-related state rules. Cf. Geier v. Ame rican Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 881 (2000) (fed\u00ad eral statutes by implicati on pre-empt state law that stands \"as an obst acle to the Cite U. S. 440 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t That is, we can nd no indicati on that Congress sought to use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or regis\u00ad trati on obligati ons that have noth ing to basic SSRS (or earlier \"bingo objec tives\u2014say , for requirement related to compl iance by interst ate carriers with rules gover ning the introduc tion of foreig n pests into the jurisdic tion, or with a State's versi on of the Amber Aler t system, or with size, weight, and safety stand\u00ad ards. The Constituti on's Commerce Clause may (or may not) forbid some such rules. But this statute \u2014wh ich identi\u00ad es and regulates very speci c items\u2014says noth ing about them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished to resolve that kind of Commerce Clause issue in this prov i\u00ad sion. Cf. 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 13908 (indicati ng that the SSRS may well be only a temporary system and similarly focusi ng on limited, federa lly enumerated requirements without discuss\u00ad ing broad pre-empti on). We conclude , as we have said, that the term \"State regis\u00ad trati on requirement, \" as used in the second sentence of the SSRS statute , covers only those State Registrati on require\u00ad ments that concer n the subjec t matter of that statutory pro\u00ad vision, namely , the registrati on of a Federa l Permit, proof of insurance , and the name of an agent for serv ice of process. See supra, at 446-447. It neither expl icitly nor implicitly reaches unrelated matters. B The second legal questi on involves the Mich igan statute imposi ng the $100 fee on Mich in interst ate commerce . MCL \u00a7478.2(2) (West 2002). Do the requirements set forth in that statute concer n the SSRS statute' s subjec t matter? We think that they do not. For one thing, the Mich igan statute imposi ng the $100 fee makes no reference to evidence of a Federa l Permit, to any insurance requirement, or to an agent for receiv . v. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V. COMM'N Opinion of the Cour t of process. Nor, as far as we can tell, do any state rules related to the $100 fee require the ling of informati on about these matters. See Equipment List Form P-344-T (requir\u00ad ing informati on about truck make , type, year , unit number , and serial number). For another thing, Mich igan law imposed a separate fee on interst ate motor carriers with trucks license plated in Mich i\u00ad gan before the SSRS existed and before Mich igan began to participate in the \"bingo card\" system. See App. 24-25; Plaintiffs' Second Moti on for Partial Summary Dispositi on 95-15628 etc. (Mich. 5; on App.), pp. 5-6; MCL \u00a7 478.7(4) (West 2002). Hence such a fee does not represent an effor t somehow to circumvent the limitations imposed in connec tion with federa l laws gover n\u00ad ing State Registrati on of Federa l Permits. Finally, Mich igan rules prov ide that a Mich igan-plated in\u00ad truck choosi ng Mich igan as its SSRS base State can apparently comply with Mich igan' s SSRS requirements even if it does not comply with Mich igan' s $100 fee requirement. The owner of that truck can ll out Mich igan form RS-1, thereby prov iding Mich igan with evidence that it has a Fed\u00ad eral Permit. App. 65-66. It can also ll out form RS- 2, on which it indicates the total SSRS fees it owes to all partici\u00ad pating States whose borders the truck will cross. Id., at 67. Upon submissi on of the two forms and payment of the fees, Mich igan apparently will give the owner form RS- 3, an SSRS receipt, a copy of which the owner can place in the vehicle of the truck, thereby comply ing with Mich igan' s (and all other participati ng States') SSRS-related \"State registra\u00ad tion requirements. \" owner fails to pay Mich igan' s $100 fee for that truck, the owner will not receive a state fee deca l. But that owner will have violated only Mich igan' s $100 fee statute here at issue 2002). Petitioners have 17:32:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN 453 Cite as: 545 U. S. 440 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t owner will have violated any other prov ision of Mich igan law. See \u00a7 478.7(4). And they have not demonstrated that Mich i\u00ad gan law in prac tice holds host age a truck owner 's SSRS com\u00ad pliance until the owner pays \u00a7 478.2(2)' s $100 fee. On the other hand, we recog nize that Mich igan form RS- 2, the form that lists all SSRS-par ticipati ng States together with their SSRS-related fees, places an aster isk next to Mich igan and states that \"[v]ehicles base-plated in Mich igan need not\" pay any SSRS fee but \"are required to have a $100.00\" Mich igan deca l. App. 67. Mich igan thereby for\u00ad gives Mich igan-plated interst ate trucks (which must pay Mich igan $100) payment of the $10 Mich igan SSRS fee that would other wise be due. And to that extent, there is a con\u00ad nection between the $100 fee and the SSRS. Mich igan appears to forgive its $10 SSRS fee, howe ver, only for the Mich igan-plated interst ate trucks of a carrier that has chosen Mich igan as its SSRS \"base\" State. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 14-15, n. 8. Mich igan-plated trucks operati ng out of a different SSRS base State, say, Ohio, must pay the fee, which is remitted back to Mich igan. Thus, the $10 reduc tion can be seen simply as an effor t to prov ide modest, admi nistratively efcient (because Mich igan itself is handl ing both fees) recompense to those motor carri\u00ad ers that operate Mich igan-plated trucks and choose Mich igan as their SSRS base State. That subsidiary connec tion can\u00ad not transfor m Mich igan' s $100 fee, which exclusively involves non-SSRS subjec t matter (and was created for non-SSRS\u00ad related reasons), into a requirement that concer ns the sub\u00ad ject matter of the SSRS statute . * * * For these reasons, we conclude that 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) does not pre-empt Mich igan' s $100 fee. The judg ment of the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls is afrmed. MICHIGAN PUB . SER V.

S. C. \u00a7 14504( b). The Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls said the answer is no because MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not a registrati on requirement at all. The Cour t also says the answer is no, but for a different reason. It concludes that, even though \u00a7 478.2(2) is a registrati on re\u00ad quirement, the term on requirement\" in 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) includes only the subset of registrati on require\u00ad ments that concer n the same subjec t matter as the SSRS. Neither the Cour t's reason, nor the different reason given by the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls, is persuasive . A The Mich igan Cour of Appea ls adopted a categor ical rule: \"If the purpose of a fee is to regulate an industry or serv ice, it can be proper ly classi ed as a regulatory fee,\" not a regis\u00ad trati on fee. 255 Mich. App., at 605, 662 N. W. 2d, at 795. Proceedi ng to apply the rule so announced, the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals held that the $100 fee imposed by MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) on Mich igan-plated interst ate carriers is a regulatory fee rather than a registrati on fee because the fee is \"imposed for the admi nistrati on of the [Mich igan Motor Carr larly cover enforci v. MICHIGAN . SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , J., dissenti ng The ity afrms the judg ment below , but \"for other reasons. \" Ante, at 446. The Cour t's reluc tance to adopt the Mich state rules and regulations re\u00ad quire a motor carrier that wants to operate Mich igan-plated vehicles in interst ate commerce in Mich igan to ll out a form prov iding detailed identi fying informati on for each vehicle and to pay a $100-per-veh icle fee. In retur n, the State pro\u00ad vides the carrier with deca ls that it must place on its trucks. See ante, at 444-445. If this is not a \"State registrati on requirement\" in the genera l and ordinary sense of the term, it is hard to conceive of what is. The Cour t of Appea ls' holdi ng would allow the State to convert any registrati on fee into a regulatory fee simply by declar ing a regulatory purpose or spendi ng some portion of the money collected on regulation or admi nistrati on. The logic of this approach excludes from the coverage of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) almost all state requirements, includi ng those dealing with similar subjec t matter as the SSRS. The purpose of SSRS requirements, after all, is to regulate the interst ate motor carrier industry; and the fees collected are used to admi nister the system. The Cour t's disapprova l igan Cour t Appea reasoni ng the Cour t's decisi on to afrm on a different ground. Ante, at 446. Yet the Cour t's afrmance of the Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on, coupled with the Cour t's failure to make its appar\u00ad ent disagreement with the reasoni ng expl icit, will work additi onal misch ief in future cases, a most undesirable resu lt in this area, where fees and regulatory requirements are so pervasive . B 1 Although the Cour t appears to agree that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) imposes a state registrati on requirement on interst ate motor carriers, it holds, nonetheless, that the prov ision is not pre\u00ad empted by 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( Cite 440 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng Cour t, is require\u00ad ment\" in \u00a7 state registrati on require\u00ad ments genera lly, but only to those state registrati on require\u00ad ments that concer n the same subjec t matter as the SSRS: registrati on of a federa l permit, proof of insurance , and des\u00ad ignation of an agent for serv ice of process. Ante, at 451. Section 14504( b) simply cannot bear the narrow ing constr uc\u00ad tion the Cour t seeks to impose upon it. The rst sentence of \u00a7 14504( b) author izes States to impose registrati on requirements on interst ate motor carriers if the registrati on \"is completed under standards of the Secret ary under [\u00a7 14504( c)],\" i. e., under the \"obligati ons in excess\" of the SSRS. There ought to be no questi on that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is a state registrati on requirement. The Cour t seems to agree , at least when the phrase \"State registrati on requirement\" is used in its ordinary and genera l sense . It shou ld also be apparent that the obligati ons imposed by \u00a7 478.2(2) are in excess of those author ized by the standards of the Secret ary under 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( c). The plain text of \u00a7 14504( b), then, would appear to pre-empt MCL \u00a7 478.2(2), at least when \u00a7 478.2(2) is considered isolati on. The Cour t, howe ver, depar ts from the text of the statute . Title 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b), by its terms, saves from pre\u00ad empti on only one class of state registrati on requirements im\u00ad posed on interst ate motor carriers: those completed under standards of the Secret ary under \u00a7 14504( c), i. e., those that are author ized under the SSRS. To this subset the Cour t adds a second class of state registrati on requirements saved from pre-empti on: those that concer n subjec t matters not covered under \u00a7 14504( c). The problem, of course , is that the statute simply does not prov ide for the exempti on the Cour t invents. There is no basis in the statutory text or structure for addi ng this limitation, and the Cour t cannot carry its heavy burden to show why the lang uage Congress used in \u00a7 14504( b) shou ld v. MICHIGAN . SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , J., dissenti ng 2 The Cour t makes only one textua l argument for the limita\u00ad tion it super imposes on \u00a7 14504( b)'s second sentence . The second sentence , the Cour t reasons, refers to the same set of state registrati on requirements discussed in the rst sen\u00ad tence . It must follow, the Cour t says, that because the rst sentence of \u00a7 14504( b) refers to SSRS registrati on, the phrase \"State registrati on requirement\" in the second sentence refers only to state registrati on requirements that concer n the same subjec t matter as the SSRS. Ante, at 447-448. The Cour t's premise is faulty. The two terms in the rst sentence \u2014\"requirement of a State that [an interst ate motor carrier] must register \" and \"reg istrati on requirement\"\u2014are not, when taken by themselves, limited to state registrati on requirements concer ning the same \"subjec t matter \" as the SSRS. These terms, like the term \"State registrati on re\u00ad quirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504( b), refer gen\u00ad erally to any state requirement that an interst ate motor carrier register with the State. No narrower readi ng is nec\u00ad essary to make perfect of \u00a7 14504( b)'s two sen\u00ad tences and of how they operate together . The rst sentence of \u00a7 14504( b) declares that the subset of state requirements consisti ng of author\u00ad ized under the SSRS\u2014i. e., requirements \"completed under standards of the Secret ary under [\u00a7 14504( c)]\"\u2014are not pre\u00ad empted. The second sentence of \u00a7 14504( b) says that all other state registrati on requirements for interst ate motor carriers are pre-empted. It is difcu lt to underst and the Cour t's mighty struggle to resist this simple , direc t readi ng of the statutory lang uage . The Cour t also observes that there is no lang uage else\u00ad where in the statute or in b) refers to all types of state registrati on requirements imposed on interst ate motor carriers, and the Cour t 440 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng the United States concedes that certain registrati on obliga\u00ad tions in traditi onal areas of state regulation are beyond the statute' s pre-emptive reach. Ante, at 449. The rst claim is irrele vant and the second is wrong . Section 14504( b) itself makes clear its pre-emptive scope , and conr mati on by other regulations is unnec\u00ad essary . while the United States did say that \u00a7 14504( b) was not \"intended to preempt state laws and fees in tradi\u00ad tional areas of state regulation,\" the reason the United States believes this is so is because \u00a7 14504( b) does not pre\u00ad empt genera l registrati on requirements that do not apply speci cally to interst ate motor carriers. Brief as Amicus Curiae 19-20. 3 Perhaps sensi ng the weakness of its textua l argument, the Cour t turns to statutory history . The Cour t is correc t to say that, before the enac tment of \u00a7 14504( b) and the SSRS, federa l law did not pre-empt state lings or fees other than those concer ning federa l permit and insurance requirements. Ante, at 449. Pre-SSRS federa l regulations, further more , speci ed that the federa l statute did not affec t the power of States to collect other fees from interst ate motor carriers or to require deca ls indicati ng payment of these fees. Ibid. This is beside the point, howe ver. The extent of pre\u00ad empti on before enac tment of little about \u00a7 14504( b)'s pre-emptive effec t. Similarly, the fact that pre- SSRS federa l regulations preserved other state registrati on requirements is of minimal signicance when, as the Cour t admits, the new regulations cont ain no such prov isions. Ante, at 450. If anyth ing, the failure to repromu lgate regu\u00ad lations saving other state registrati on fees from pre-empti on suggests that the federa l agency charged with implementi ng the SSRS did think that \u00a7 14504( b) expanded the scope of federa l pre-empti on. The Cour t's meani ng is therefore obscure when it declares that Congress \"did not indicate (in the text, structure , [03-26-08 v. MICHIGAN SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , dissenti ng divinable purpose of the new prov ision) that the pre-emptive scope of the new scheme would be any broader than that of the old.\" Ante, at 449. Congress did indicate an expansi on of federa on in by replaci a narrow pre-empti on clause with a broad pre-empti on clause . Congress is not required to say, \"We really mean it.\" Cf. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC , Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U. S. 50, 73 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng) (\"I hardly think it to alter [the meani ng of a statute ] that Congress amended the text of the statute\" (emphasis in original)). Perhaps the Cour t means to suggest that what appears to be the plain meani ng of \u00a7 14504( b) is put in doubt by the fact that the predecessor statute' s pre-emptive scope was much more limited. Compar ison with predecessor statutes, how\u00ad ever, is permissible only to resolve statutory ambig uity that exists independent of the compar ison with the predecessor statute; compar ison with predecessor statutes cannot be used to create ambig uity about the meani ng of an other wise clear statute . Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 533-535 (2004); see also Koons Buick Pontiac GMC , Inc., 543 U. S., at 66-67 (Kennedy , J., concurr ing); id., at 67 (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment); id., at 73 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). 4 The Cour t's nal reason for its narrow ing con\u00ad struction on \u00a7 14504( b) is that the Cour t has found \"noth ing in the statute' purposes . requires a broader readi ng of the statutory term... .\" Ante, at 450. In the Cour t's view the only purpose of \u00a7 14504 is to make minor improvements in the efciency of the old bingo card system. Ante, at 449-450. The Cour t makes no convincing argu\u00ad ment that \u00a7 14504( b)'s purpose was so limited. The Cour t, further more , does not explai n why the statute' s basic pur\u00ad poses require the Cour (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng facia lly broad statutory command. The most the Cour t is willing to say is that it \"can nd no indicati on,\" ante, at 451, that when Congress said \"State registrati on requirement, \" it meant \"State registrati on requirement. \" So it says Con\u00ad gress must have meant \"State registrati on requirement con\u00ad cerning the same subjec t matter as the SSRS. \" The text of \u00a7 14504( b), howe ver, does not admit of the qualicati ons the Cour t adds to it. The Cour t's argument from statutory pur\u00ad pose has no basis. The Cour t suggests that if Congress intended \u00a7 14504( b) to have the broad pre-emptive effec t required by the text, Congress would have more clear ly indicated that intenti on. Ibid. (\"[W]e can nd no indicati on that Congress sought\" to pre-empt requirements not related to SSRS subjec t matter). It is not entirely clear what sort of additi onal indicati on of congressi onal purpose the Cour t is looking for. The text, as noted above , does prov ide an indicati on of Congress' intent. Perhaps the Cour t is troubled by the absence of statements in the legislative history endorsi ng \u00a7 14504( b)'s expansi lack of conr matory legislative history , howe ver, is not a legitimate reason for imposi ng an articial narrow ing constr uction on broad but clear statutory text. \"[I]t would be a strange canon of statutory constr uc\u00ad tion that would require Congress to state in committee re\u00ad ports or elsewhere in its deliberati ons that which is obvious on the face of a statute .\" Harrison v. PPG Indu stries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 592 (1980). See also Morales v. Tran s World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 385, n. 2 (1992) (\"[L]egislative history need not conr m the details of changes in the law effec ted by statutory lang uage before we will inter pret that lang uage accordi to its natura l meani ng\"); Chisom v. Roe\u00ad mer, 501 U. S. 380, 406 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng) (\"We are here to apply the statute , not legislative history , and cer\u00ad tainly v. MICHIGAN . SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , J., dissenti ng II A In registrati on require\u00ad ment\" in \u00a7 14504( b) cannot be read as limited to state regis\u00ad trati on requirements that concer n one particular subjec t matter . It shou ld be noted, howe ver, that this phrase is am\u00ad biguous in a different respec t. Section 14504( b) might be read, on the one hand, to exempt interst ate motor carriers from any non-SSRS state registrati on requirement, includ\u00ad ing genera l requirements that apply to all motor carriers or to some other set of entities. On the other hand, \u00a7 14504( b) might be read to pre-empt only those non-SSRS registrati on requirements that apply speci cally motor car\u00ad riers. That is, \u00a7 14504( b) might come into play only if being an interst ate motor carrier is a necessary or sufcient condi\u00ad tion for impositi on of a state registrati on requirement. The United States takes the latter view of the statute , Brief as Amicus Curiae 17-22, and I am of the same opinion. Though the phrase \"State registrati on requirement\" in the second sentence of \u00a7 14504( b) is not qualied, it is clear from context that this term refers to a \"requirement of a State that a motor carrier, prov iding [interst ate transpor tation,] must register with the State,\" the more speci c term that appears in \u00a7 14509( b)'s rst sentence . It is grammatica lly possible to read the statutory command as exempti ng inter\u00ad state motor carriers from all registrati on requirements other than the SSRS, but that readi ng would lead to absurd re\u00ad sults. It would suggest, for example , that interst ate motor carriers with a principa l place of business in Mich igan do not have to register their presence for purposes of state tax collection. In context, the more natura l and sensible read\u00ad ing of the phrase \"requirement of a State that motor car\u00ad rier, prov [interst ate transpor those requirements that 17:32:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN 465 Cite S. 440 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng are triggered speci cally by the fact that the entity in ques\u00ad tion is an interst ate motor carrier. b) pre-empts state registrati on require\u00ad ments that single out interst ate carriers, but not genera l state registrati on requirements that apply to interst ate carriers only incident ally, my analysis of \u00a7 14504( b) does not necessar ily mean the Cour t's ultimate conclusi on in this case is incorrec t. Respondents contend that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) ap\u00ad plies only to trucks with Mich igan license plates, and that \u00a7 478.2(2) shou ld be considered together with \u00a7 478.2(1), which imposes a $100 fee on every truck doing intrast ate business within Mich igan. Accordi ng to respondents, then, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) does not come into play because inter\u00ad state carriers are not singled out; Mich igan imposes the same $100 fee on all for-h ire motor vehicles license plated in Mich i\u00ad gan. Brief for Respondents 44-45. Petitioners and the United States take issue with this argument. Reply Brief for Petitioners 10-14; Brief for United States as Amicus Cu\u00ad riae 24-29. In my view it is not necessary to reach this questi on. The Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls resolved the case on the incorrec t theory that a fee is not a registrati on fee if its purpose is to regulate the industry . Given its erroneous view of the stat\u00ad ute, the proper course shou ld be to vacate the Cour t of Appea ls' proceedi ngs. the allow ts to con\u00ad sider the competi ng arguments light of the correc t legal inter pret ation of 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b). Respondents would, at that stage, be able to advance their arguments that MCL \u00a7 478.2(2) is not pre-empted when it is considered in conjunc\u00ad tion with \u00a7 478.2(1) or any other aspec t of the statutory scheme that bears on whether Mich igan imposes registrati on requirements speci cally on interst ate v. MICHIGAN . SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , J., dissenti ng B The Cour t insists that to read \"requirement that a motor carrier prov iding [interst ate must register with the includi ng only those requirements that apply speci cally to interst ate motor carriers would be \"whol ly inconsistent with the statute' s basic purposes, be\u00ad cause it would leave a State free to implement a regulation in excess of speci c SSRS limitations as long as it did not single out interst ate carriers . . . .\" Ante, at 448. The Cour t is correc t that, under my inter pret ation, 49 U. S. C. \u00a7 14504( b) would not pre-empt genera l, neutra l requirements, even if they dealt with subjec t matter similar to that covered by the SSRS. The Cour t is wrong , howe ver, to suggest this therefore means an SSRS could collect from interst ate motor carriers a $500 fee for proof of insurance or require desig na\u00ad tion of multiple agents for serv ice of process, as long as the requirement in questi on appl ied evenhandedly to all motor carriers. The Cour t errs because it fails to give adequate considerati on to the restr ictions imposed by \u00a7 14504( c). Section 14504( c)(2)(A) declares that \"only a State acting in its capacity as [a] registrati on State under [the SSRS ] may require a motor carrier registered by the Secret ary under [the SSRS ]\" to le proof of federa l registrati on and proof of insurance , to collect fees for ling proof of insurance , and to maintain a local agent for serv ice of process. Section the SSRS registrati on State can impose on interst ate motor carriers. These sections cont ain an am\u00ad biguity similar to that which affec ts \u00a7 14504( b). Context, howe ver, suggests uity shou ld be resolved c), in my sub\u00ad missi is that no State participati ng in the SSRS other desig nated SSRS registra\u00ad tion State the sort listed in \u00a7 14504( c)(2)(A) on that carrier, even if Unit:$U68 [03-26-08 17:32:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN 467 Cite 440 (2005) Kennedy , J., dissenti ng genera l and appl ies to all motor carriers. The SSRS regis\u00ad trati on State, further more , may only impose on registered interst ate motor carriers requirements related to those listed in \u00a7\u00a7 14504( c)(2)(A)( i)-(iv) if the in the on SSRS registrati on States in \u00a7 14504( c) establish a rational regulatory scheme . Whether or not a State participates in the SSRS, it cannot impose a registrati on requirement that singles out interst ate motor carriers unless that requirement is author ized under the SSRS. States that participate in the SSRS may impose genera l, neutra l registrati on requirements that happen to af\u00ad fect interst ate motor carriers unless those requirements are inconsistent with the speci c mandates of the SSRS related to proof of insurance , proof of federa l permit, fees, and serv\u00ad ice of process. Non-SSRS States may impose any genera l, neutra l registrati on requirement, even if they require inter\u00ad state motor carriers, among others, to le proof of insurance or maintain a local agent for serv ice of process. The Cour t's inter pret ation leads to a less sensible scheme . Accordi ng to the Cour t, that statute permits States to im\u00ad pose on interst ate carriers any number of onerous require\u00ad ments so long as these requirements are not expl icitly linked to the subjec ts covered by the The Cour t's inter pre\u00ad tation, further more , means that those States which cluded from the SSRS under \u00a7 apply genera l state registrati on requirements to interst ate motor carriers if the requirements concer n proof of insurance or registrati on of an agent for serv ice of process. Under the Cour t's inter pret ation, the statute does not pre-empt state regulations that single out interst ate carriers for specia l bur\u00ad dens well beyond what the SSRS allows, but it does prevent non-SSRS States from apply ing a number of modest, even\u00ad handed registrati on requirements to SER V. COMM'N Kennedy , J., dissenti ng though the SSRS is not available to these States. That im\u00ad plausible resu lt is not demanded by the statute' s basic purposes. * * * Instead of heedi ng what Congress actually said, the Cour t relies on flawed textua l analysis and dubi ous inferences from legislative silence to impose the Cour t's view of what it thinks Congress probably wanted to say. In my view, this is a mist ake. Other arguments, not considered by the Mich i\u00ad gan Cour t of Appea ls or by our Cour t, might suppor t the ultimate outcome in this case. These arguments, howe ver, ought to be addressed on remand. 545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 469 OCTOBER TERM, 2004 Syllabus KELO et al. v. CITY OF NEW LONDON et al. certiorari to the supreme court of connecticut No. 04-108. Argued February 22, 2005 \u2014Decided June 23, 2005 After approv ing an integrated development plan desig ned to revitalize its ailing economy , respondent city, through its development agent, pur\u00ad chased most of the proper ty earmarked for the projec t from willing sellers, but initiated condemnati on proceedi ngs when petiti oners, the owners of the rest of the proper ty, refused to sell. Petitioners brought this state-cour t action claiming, inter alia, that the taking of their prop\u00ad erties would violate the \"publ ic use\" restr the Fifth Amend\u00ad ment' s Takings Clause . The trial cour t granted a permanent restrai n\u00ad ing order proh ibiting the taking of some of the proper ties, but deny ing relief as to others. Rely ing on cases such as Hawaii Housing Author\u00ad ity v. Mid kiff, 467 U. S. 229, and Berman v. Parke r, 348 U. S. 26, the Connec ticut Supreme Cour t afrmed in part and reversed in part, up\u00ad holdi ng all of the proposed takings. Held: The proposed dispositi on of petiti oners' proper a \"publ ic use\" meani ng of the Takings Clause . Pp. 477-490. (a) Though the city could not take petiti oners' land simply to confer a private benet on a particular private party, see, e. g., Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 245, the takings at issue here would be executed pursuant to a carefu lly considered development plan, which was not adopted \"to bene\u00ad t a particular class of identi able indiv idua ls,\" ibid. Moreover , while the is not planni ng to open the condemned land\u2014at least not in its entirety\u2014to use by the genera l publ ic, this \"Cour t long ago rejected any litera l requirement that condemned proper ty be put into use for the . . . publ ic.\" Id., at 244. Rather , it has embraced the broader and more natura l inter pret ation of publ ic use as \"publ ic purpose .\" See, e. g., Fall\u00ad brook Irrigation Dist. v. Brad ley, 164 U. S. 112, 158-164. Without ex\u00ad cepti on, the Cour t has , reflec ting its long\u00ad standi ng policy of deference to legislative judg ments as to what publ ic needs justi fy the use of the takings power . Berman, 348 U. S. 26; Mid \u00ad kiff, 467 U. S. 229; Ruckel shau s v. Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986. Pp. 477-483. (b) The city's deter mination that the area at issue was sufciently distressed to justi fy a program of economic rejuvenati on is entitled to deference . The city has carefu lly formulated a development plan that it believes will prov ide appreciable benets v. NEW LONDON Syllabus but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue . As with other exercises in urban planni ng and development, the city is trying to coor\u00ad dinate a variety of commercia l, residentia l, and recreati onal land uses, with the hope that they will form a whole greater than the sum of its parts. To effec tuate this plan, the city has invoked a state statute that speci cally author izes the use of eminent domai n to promote economic development. Given the plan' s comprehensive charac ter, the thorough deliberati on that preceded its adopti on, and the limited scope of this Cour t's review in such cases, it is appropr iate here , as it was in Berman, to resolve the challenges of the indiv idua l owners, not on a piecemea l basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unques\u00ad tionably serves a publ ic purpose , the takings challenged here satisfy the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 483-484. (c) Petitioners' proposa l that the Cour t adopt a new bright-l ine rule that economic development does not qualify as a publ ic use is suppor ted by neither precedent nor logic. Promoti ng economic development is nment al func is no principled way of disti nguishing it from the other publ ic purposes the Cour t has recog nized. See, e. g., Berman, 348 U. S., at 33. Also re\u00ad jected is petiti oners' argument that for takings of this kind the Cour t shou ld require a \"reasonable certainty\" that the expec ted publ ic benets will actually accrue. Such a rule would represent an even greater de\u00ad parture from the Cour t's precedent. E. g., Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 242. The disadvant ages of a heightened form of review are especia lly pro\u00ad nounced in this type of case , where order ly implement ation of a compre\u00ad hensive plan requires all interested parties' legal rights to estab\u00ad lished before new constr t declines to second-g uess the wisdom of the means the city has selec ted to effec tuate its plan.

Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 1990 to desig nate the City a \"distressed municipa lity.\" Federa l Gover nment closed the Nava l Undersea Warfare Center , which had been located in the Fort Trumbu ll area of the City and had employed over 1,500 people . In 1998, the City' s unemployment rate was near ly double that of the State, and its popu lation of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920. These conditi ons prompted state and local ofcia ls to tar\u00ad get New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbu ll area, for economic revitalization. To this end, respondent New London Development Corporati on (NLDC), a private non\u00ad prot entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planni ng economic development, was reac tivated. In Jan\u00ad uary 1998, the State author ized a $5.35 million bond issue to suppor t the NLDC' s planni ng activities and a $10 million bond issue toward the creati on of a Fort Trumbu ll State Park. In February , the phar maceutica l company Pzer Inc. announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately adjacent to Fort Trumbu ll; local plan\u00ad ners hoped that Pzer would draw new business to the area, thereby serv ing as a catalyst to the area' s rejuvenati on. After receiv ing initia l approva l from the city counci l, the NLDC conti nued its planni ng activities and held a series of neighborhood meeti ngs to educate the publ ic about the proc\u00ad ess. In May, the city counci l author ized the NLDC to for\u00ad mally submit its plans to the relevant state agencies for review.2 Upon obtaining state-le vel approva l, the NLDC 2 Various state agencies studied the projec t's economic, environment al, and socia l rami cati ons. As part of this process, a team of consu ltants evaluated six alternative development proposa ls for the area, which varied in extensiveness and emphasis.

The Fort Trumbu ll area is situated on a peni nsula that juts into the Thames River . The area compr ises approxi mately 115 privately owned proper ties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly occupied by the nava l facility (Trumbu ll State Park now occupies 18 of those 32 acres). The development plan encompasses seven parcels. Parcel 1 is desig nated for a water front conference hotel at the center of a \"sma ll urban village\" that will include restaurants and shoppi ng. This parcel will also have marinas for both recreati onal and com\u00ad mercia l uses. A pedestr ian \"riverwalk\" will originate here and conti nue down the coast, connec ting the water front areas of the development. Parcel 2 will be the site of ap\u00ad proxi mately 80 new residences organi zed into an urban neighborhood and linked by publ ic walkway to the remai nder of the development, includi ng the state park. This parcel also includes space reserved for a new U. S. Coast Guard Museum. Parcel 3, which is located immediately north of the Pzer facility, will cont ain at least 90,000 square feet of research and development ofce space . Parcel 4A is a 2.4\u00ad acre site that will be used either to suppor t the adjacent state park, by prov iding park ing or retail serv ices for visi\u00ad tors, or to suppor t the nearby marina. Parcel 4B will in\u00ad clude a renovated marina, as well as the nal stretch of the riverwalk. Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will prov ide land for ofce and retail space , park ing, and water-dependent commercia l uses. App. 109-113. The NLDC intended the development plan to capit alize on the arrival of the Pzer facility and the new commerce it was expec ted to attrac t. In additi on to \"build momentum for the revital\u00ad ization of downtown New London, \" id., at 92, the plan was also desig ned to make the City more attrac tive and to create that the projec t was consistent with relevant state and municipa l develop\u00ad ment policies.

The city counci l approved the plan in January 2000, and desig nated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of implement ation. See Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8-188 (2005). The city counci l also author ized the NLDC to purchase proper ty or to acquire proper ty by exercisi ng eminent domai n in \u00a7 8-193. The NLDC successfu lly negotiated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre area, but its negotiati ons with petiti oners failed. As a conse\u00ad quence , in November 2000, the NLDC initiated the condem\u00ad nation proceedi ngs that gave rise to this case.3 II Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbu ll area since 1997. She has made extensive improvements to her house , which she prizes for its water view. Petitioner Wilhelmi na Dery was born in her Fort Trumbu ll house in 1918 and has lived there her entire life. Her husband Char les (also a petiti oner) has lived in the house since they marr ied some 60 years ago. In all, the nine petiti oners own 15 proper ties in Fort Trumbu ll\u20144 in parcel 3 of the develop\u00ad ment plan and 11 in parcel 4A. Ten of the parcels are occu\u00ad pied by the owner or a fami ly member; the other ve are held as investment proper ties. There is no allegati on that any of these proper ties is blighted or other wise in poor con\u00ad dition; rather , they were condemned only because they hap\u00ad pen to be located in the development area. In December 2000, petiti oners brought this action in the New London Super ior Cour t. They claimed, among other things, that the taking of their proper ties would violate the \"publ ic use\" restr iction in the Fifth Amendment. After a 7-day bench trial, the Super ior Cour t granted a permanent restrai ning order proh ibiting the taking of the proper ties lo\u00ad 3 In the remai nder of the opinion we will differentiate between the City and the NLDC only where necessary Opinion of the Cour t cated in parcel 4A (park or marina suppor t).

App. to Pet. for Cert. 343-350.4 After the Super ior Cour t ruled, both sides took appea ls to the Supreme Cour t of Connec ticut. That cour t held, over a dissent, that all of the City' s proposed takings were valid. It began by upholdi ng the lower cour t's deter mination that the takings were author ized by chapter 132, the State's mu\u00ad nicipa l development statute . See Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8-186 et seq. (2005). That statute expresses a legislative deter mi\u00ad nation that the taking of land, even developed land, as part of an economic development projec t is a \"publ ic use\" and in the \"publ ic interest. \" 268 Conn., at 18-28, 843 A. 2d, at 515- 521. Next, relying on cases such as Hawaii Housing Au\u00ad thority v. Mid kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984), and Berman v. Par\u00ad ker, 348 U. S. 26 (1954), the cour t held that such economic development qualied as a valid publ ic use under both the Federa l and State Constituti ons. 268 Conn., at 40, 843 A. 2d, at 527. Finally, adher ing to its precedents, the cour t went on to deter mine, rst, whether the takings of the particular prop\u00ad erties at issue were \"reasonably necessary\" to achieving the City' s intended publ ic use, id., at 82-84, 843 A. 2d, at 552- 553, and, second, whether the takings were for \"reasonably foreseeable needs, \" id., at 93-94, 843 A. 2d, at 558-559. The cour t upheld the trial cour t's factual ndings as to parcel 3, but reversed the trial cour t as to parcel 4A, agreei ng with the City that the intended use of this land was sufciently 4 Whil e this litigati on was pendi ng before the Super ior Cour t, the NLDC announced that it would lease some of the parcels to private devel\u00ad opers in exchange for their agreement to develop the land accordi ng to the terms of the development plan. Speci cally, the NLDC was negotiati ng a 99-year ground lease with Corcoran Jennison, a developer selec ted from a group of appl icants. The negotiati ons contemplated a nomi nal rent of $1 per year , but no agreement had yet been signed. See 268 Conn. 1, 9, 61, 843 A. 2d 500, 509-510, 540 (2004). OPIN 477 Cite as: 545 U.

The three dissenti ng justices would have imposed a \"heightened\" standard of judicia l review for takings justi ed by economic development. Although they agreed that the plan was intended to serve a valid publ ic use, they would have found all the takings unconstituti onal because the City had failed to adduce \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the economic benets of the plan would in fact come to pass. Id., at 144, 146, 843 A. 2d, at 587, 588 (Zarel la, J., joined by Sullivan, C. J., and Katz, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part). We granted certiorar i to deter mine whether a city's deci\u00ad sion to take proper ty for the purpose of economic develop\u00ad ment satises the \"publ ic use\" requirement of the Fifth Amendment. 542 U. S. 965 (2004). III Two polar propositi ons are perfectly clear . On the one hand, it has long been accepted that the sovereig n may not take the proper ty of A for the sole purpose of transferr ing it to another private party B, even though A is paid just compensati on. On the other hand, it is equa lly clear that a State may transfer proper ty from one private party to an\u00ad other if future \"use by the publ ic\" is the purpose of the tak\u00ad ing; the condemnati on of land for a railroad with common\u00ad carrier duties is a fami liar example . Neither of these propositi ons, howe ver, deter mines the dispositi on of this case. As for the rst propositi on, the City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petiti oners' land for the purpose of conferr ing a private benet on a particular private party. See Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 245 (\"A purely private taking could not withst and the scrutiny of the publ ic use requirement; it would serve no legitimate purpose of gover nment and would thus be void\"); Missouri Pacic PAGES PGT: OPIN 478 KELO v. NEW LONDON Opinion of the Cour t 164 U. S. 403 (1896).5 Nor would the City be allowed to take proper ty under the mere pretext of a publ ic purpose , when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benet. The tak\u00ad ings before us, howe ver, would be executed pursuant to a \"carefu lly considered\" development plan. 268 Conn., at 54, 843 A. 2d, at 536. The trial judge and all the members of the Supreme Cour t of Connec ticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case.6 Therefore , as was true of the statute challenged in Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 245, the City' s development plan was not adopted \"to ben\u00ad et a particular class of identi able indiv idua ls.\" On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is planni ng to open the condemned land\u2014at least not in its entirety\u2014to use by the genera l publ ic. Nor will the private lessees of the land in any sense be required to operate like common carriers, mak ing their serv ices available to all com\u00ad 5 See also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (\"An act of the Legisla\u00ad ture (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great rst principles of the socia l compac t, cannot be considered a rightfu l exercise of legislative author ity. . . .

[A] law that takes proper ty from A. and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice , for a people to entr ust a Legislature with such powers; and, therefore , it cannot be presumed that they have done it.

And while the City intends to transfer certain of the parcels to a private developer in a long-ter m lease \u2014wh ich devel\u00ad oper , in turn, is expec ted to lease the ofce space and so forth to other private tenants\u2014the identities of those private parties were not known when the plan was adopted. It is, of course , difcu lt to accuse the gover n\u00ad ment of having taken A's proper ty to benet the private interests of B when the identity of B was unknown. 545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 479 Cite as: 545 U. S. 469 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ers. But although such a projec ted use would be sufcient to satisfy the publ ic use requirement, this \"Cour t long ago rejected any litera l requirement that condemned proper ty be put into use for the genera l publ ic.\" Id., at 244. Indeed, while many state cour ts in the mid-19th century endorsed \"use by the publ ic\" as the proper denition of publ ic use, that narrow view steadi ly eroded over time. Not only was the \"use by the publ ic\" test difcu lt to (e. g., what propor tion of the publ ic need have access to the proper ty? at what price?),7 but it proved to be imprac tical given the diverse and always evolv ing needs of society .8 Accordi ngly, 7 See, e. g., Day ton Gold & Silver Mining Co. v. Seaw ell, 11 Nev. 394, enjoyment of the objec t for which land is to be condemned furnishes the only and true test for the right of eminent domai n, then the legislature would certainly have the constituti onal author ity to condemn the lands of any private citizen for the purpose of building hotels and theaters. Why not? A hotel is used by the publ ic as much as a railroad. The publ ic have the same right, upon payment of a xed compensati on, to seek rest and refreshment at a publ ic inn as they have to travel upon a railroad\"). 8 From upholdi ng the Mill pendent on power-produci ng dams to flood upstream lands in exchange for just compensati on), to approv ing takings necessary for the economic development of the West through mining and irrigati on, many state cour ts either circumvented the \"use the publ when necessary or aban\u00ad doned it completely . See Nichols, The Meani ng of Publ ic Use in the Law of Emi nent Domai n, 20 B. U. L. Rev. 615, 619-624 (1940) (traci ng this de\u00ad velopment and collecting cases). For example , in rejecting the \"use by the publ ic\" test as over ly restr ictive, the Nevada Supreme Cour t stressed that \"[m]ining is the greatest of the industr ial pursuits in this state. All other interests are subserv ient to it. Our mount ains are almost barren of timber , and our valleys could never be made prot able for agricultura l purposes except for the fact of a home market having been created by the mining developments in different sections of the state. The mining and milling interests give employment to many men, and the benets derived from this business are distr ibuted as much, and someti mes more , among the labor ing classes than with the owners of the mines and mills. . . . The present prosper ity of the state is entirely due to the mining developments already made , and the entire people of the state are direc tly interested in having the future developments unobstr ucted the KELO v. LONDON Opinion of the Cour t when this Cour t began apply ing the Fifth Amendment to the States at the close of the 19th century , it embraced the broader and more natura l inter pret ation of publ ic use as \"publ ic purpose .\" See, e. g., Fallbro ok Irrigation Dist. v. Brad ley, 164 U. S. 112, 158-164 (1896). Thus, in a case up\u00ad holdi ng a mining company' s use of an aerial bucket line to transpor t ore over proper ty it did not own, Justice Holmes' opinion for the Cour t stressed \"the inadequacy of use by the genera l publ ic as a universa l test. \" Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527, 531 (1906).9 We have repeatedly and consistently rejected that narrow test ever since.10 The dispositi on of this case therefore turns on the questi on whether the City' s development plan serves a \"publ ic pur\u00ad pose .\" Without excepti on, our cases have dened reflec ting of deference to legislative judg ments in this eld. In Berman v. Parke r, 348 U. S. 26 (1954), this Cour t upheld a rede velopment plan targeti ng a blighted area of Washing\u00ad ton, D. C., in which most of the housi ng for the area' s 5,000 inhabit ants was beyond repair . Under the plan, the area would be condemned and part of it utilized for the constr uc\u00ad tion of streets, schools, and other publ ic facilities. The re\u00ad mainder of the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of rede velopment, includi idua ls.\" Day ton Gold & Silver Mining Co., 11 Nev., at 409-410, 1876 WL, at *11. 9 See also Clark v.

In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Mid kiff, 467 U.

Reafr ming Berman's deferentia l approach to legislative judg ments in this eld, we concluded that the State's purpose of eliminat\u00ad ing the \"socia l and economic evils of a land oligopoly\" quali\u00ad ed as a valid publ ic use. 467 U. S., at 241-242. Our opin\u00ad ion also rejected the contenti on that the mere fact that the State immediately transferred the proper ties to private indi\u00ad vidua ls upon condemnati on somehow diminished the publ ic charac ter of the taking. \"[I]t is only the taking's purpose , and not its mechanics, \" we explai ned, that matters in deter\u00ad mining publ ic use. Id., at 244. In that same Term we decided another publ ic use case that arose in a purely economic context. In Ruckel shau s v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.

We acknowledged that the \"most direc t beneciar ies\" appl i\u00ad cants, id., at 1014, but we nevertheless upheld the statute under Berman and Mid kiff.

Viewed as a whole , our jurisprudence has recog nized that the needs of society have varied between different parts of the Nati on, just as they have evolved over time in response to changed circumst ances.

Given the comprehensive charac ter of the plan, the thorough deliberati on that preceded its adop\u00ad tion, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropr iate for us, as it was in Berman, to resolve the challenges of the indiv idua l owners, not on a piecemea l basis, but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unquesti onably serves a publ ic purpose , the takings challenged here satisfy the publ ic use requirement of the Fifth Amendment. To avoid this resu lt, petiti oners urge us to adopt a new bright-l ine rule that economic development does not qualify as a publ ic use. Putti ng aside the unpersuasive suggesti on that the City' s plan will prov ide only purely economic bene\u00ad of gover , no principled way of disti nguishing economic development from the other publ ic purposes that we have recog nized.

It would be incongr uous to hold that the City' s interest in the economic benets to be derived from the development of the Fort Trumbu ll area has less of a publ ic charac ter than any of those other interests. Clear ly, there is no basis for exempti ng economic develop\u00ad ment imper missibly blurs be\u00ad tween ic and private takings. Agai n, our cases fore\u00ad close this objec tion. Quite simply , the gover nment' s pursuit a publ ic purpose will often benet indiv idua l private parties. For example , in Mid kiff, the forced transfer of proper ty conferred a direc t and signicant benet on those lessees who were previously unable to purchase their homes. In Mons anto, we recog nized pesticide appl icants, beneti essary to promoti ng competiti on in the pesticide market. 467 U.

Had the publ ic use in Berman been dened more narrowly , it would have been difcu lt to justi fy the taking of the blighted depar tment store . 14 Any number of cases illustrate that the achievement of a publ ic good often coincides with the immediate beneti ng of private parties. See, e. g., National Railroad Passenge r Corporation v. Bost on & Maine Corp., 503 U.

It is worth noting that in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Mid \u00ad kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984), Monsanto, and Bost on & Maine Corp., the prop\u00ad erty in questi on retained the same use even after the change of ownersh ip. 15 Notably, as in the instant case , the private developers in Berman were required by contrac t to use the proper ty to carry out the rede velopment plan. See 348 U. S., at 30. 16 Nor do our cases suppor t Justice O'C onnor 's novel theory that the gover nment may only take proper ty and transfer it to private parties when the initia l taking eliminates some \"harmful proper ty use.\" Post, at 501 (dissenti ng opinion). There was noth ing \"harmful\" about the non\u00ad blighted depar tment store at issue in Berman, 348 U. S. 26; see also n. 13, supra; noth ing \"harmful\" about the lands at issue in the mining and agri\u00ad culture cases, see, e. g., Strickley, 200 U. S. 527; see also nn. 9, 11, supra; and certainly noth ing \"harmful\" about the trade secrets owned by the pesticide manufac turers in Monsanto, 467 U. S. 986. In each case , the publ ic purpose we upheld depended on a private party's future use of the concededly nonhar mful proper ty that was taken. By focusi ng on a proper ty's future use, as opposed to its past use, our cases are faith ful to the text of the Takings Clause . See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 (\"[N]or shall private proper ty be taken for publ ic use, without just compensati on\"). Justice O'C onnor 's intimati on that a \"publ ic purpose\" may not be achieved by the action of private parties, see post, at 500-501, confuses the purpose of a taking with its mechan ics, a mist ake we warned of in Mid kiff, 467 U.

Such a one-to-one transfer of proper ty, executed outside the con nes of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case. While such an unusua l exercise of gover nment power would certainly raise a suspici on that a private pur\u00ad pose was afoot,17 the hypothetica l cases posited by petiti on\u00ad ers can be confronted if and when they arise.18 They do not warrant the crafting of an articial restr iction on the ic use.19 Alter natively , petiti oners maintain that for takings of this kind we shou ld require a \"reasonable certainty\" that the ex\u00ad pected publ ic benets will actually accrue.

The dis\u00ad advant ages of a heightened form of review are especia lly pronounced in this type of case.

The judg ment of the Supreme Cour t of Connec ticut is afrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Kennedy , concurr ing. I join the opinion for the Cour t and add these further observati ons. This Cour t has declared that a taking shou ld be upheld as consistent with the Publ ic Use Clause , U. S.

Parke r, 348 U.S. 26 (1954). This deferentia l standard of review echoes the rational-basis test used to review economic regulation under the Due Process and Equal Protec tion Clauses, see, e. g., FCC v. Beach Commun ications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313-314 (1993); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). The deter mination that a rational-basis standard of review is appropr iate does not, howe ver, alter the fact that transfers intended to confer benets on particular, favored private entities, and with only incident al or pretextua l publ ic benets, are forbidden by the Publ ic Use Clause . projec ts.

As the trial cour t in this case was correc t to observe: \"Where the purpose [of a taking] is economic development and that development is to be carried out by private parties or private parties will be beneted, the cour t must decide if the stated publ ic purpose \u2014economic advant age to a city sorely in need of it\u2014is only incident al to the benets that will be con ned on private parties of a development plan. \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 263.

Here, the trial cour t conduc ted carefu l and exten\u00ad sive inquiry into \"whether , in fact, the development plan is of primary benet to . . . the developer [i. e., Corcoran Jenni\u00ad son], and private businesses which may eventua lly locate in the plan area [e. g., Pzer], and in that regard, only of inciden\u00ad tal benet to the city.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 261. The trial cour t considered testi mony from nment ofcia ls and corporate ofcers, id., at 266-271; document ary evidence of communicati ons between these parties, ibid.; respondents' awareness of New London' s depressed economic conditi on and evidence corroborati ng the validity of this concer n, id., at 272-273, 278-279; the Kennedy , J., concurr ing funds by the State to the development projec t before most of the private beneciar ies were known, id., at 276; evidence that respondents reviewed a variety of development plans and chose a private developer from a group of appl icants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand, id., at 273, 278; and the fact that the other private beneciar\u00ad ies of the projec t are still unknown because the ofce space proposed to be built has not yet been rented, id., at 278. The trial cour t concluded, based on these ndings, that beneti ng Pzer was not \"the primary motivati or t of this development plan\"; instead, \"the primary motivati on for [respondents ] was to take advant age of Pzer's pres\u00ad ence .\" Id., at 276. Likew ise, the trial cour t concluded that \"[t]here is noth ing in the record to indicate that...[ respond\u00ad ents] were motivated by a desire to aid [other ] particular private entities. \" Id., at 278. See also ante, at 478. Even the dissenti ng justices on the Connec ticut Supreme Cour t agreed that respondents' development plan was intended to revitalize the local economy , not to serve the interests of Pzer, Corcoran Jennison, or any other private party. 268 Conn. 1, 159, 843 A. 2d 500, 595 (2004) (Zarel la, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part). , then, surv ives the meani ngful rational-basis review that in my view is required under the Publ ic Use Clause . Petitioners and their amici argue that any taking justi ed by the promoti on of economic development must be treated by the cour ts as per se invalid, or at least presumptively invalid. Petitioners overst ate the need for such a rule, how\u00ad ever, by mak ing the incorrec t assumpti on that review under Berman and Midkiff imposes no meani ngful judicia l limits on the gover nment' s power to condemn any proper ty it likes. A broad per se rule or a strong presumpti on of invalidity , further more , would proh ibit a large number of gover nment takings that have the purpose and expec ted effec t of confer\u00ad ring subst antia l benets on the publ ic at large and so do not offend the Publ ic Use Clause . OPIN U. S. 469 (2005) Kennedy , J., concurr ing My agreement with the Cour t that a presumpti on of inva\u00ad lidity is not warranted for economic development takings in genera l, or for the particular takings at issue in this case , does not foreclose the possibi lity that a more stringent standard of review than that announced in Berman and Mid \u00ad kiff might be appropr iate for a more narrowly drawn cate\u00ad gory of takings. There may be private transfers in which the risk of undetec ted imper missible favor itism of private parties is so acute that a presumpti on (rebutt able or other\u00ad wise) of invalidity is warranted under the Publ ic Use Clause . Cf. Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 549-550 (1998) (Kennedy , J., concurr ing in judg ment and dissent\u00ad ing in part) (heightened scrutiny for retroac tive legislati on under the Due Process Clause). This demandi ng level of scrutiny, howe ver, is not required simply because the pur\u00ad pose of the taking is economic development. This is not the occasi on for conjecture as to what sort of cases might justi fy a more demandi ng standard, but it is appropr iate to underscore aspec ts of the instant case that convince me no depar ture from Berman and Midkiff is ap\u00ad propr iate here . This taking occurred in the context of a comprehensive development plan meant to address a serious cityw ide depressi on, and the projec ted economic benets of the projec t cannot be charac terized as de minimis . The identities of most of the private beneciar ies were unknown at the time the city formulated its plans. The city compl ied with elaborate procedura l requirements that facilitate re\u00ad view of the record and inquiry into the city's purposes. In sum, while there may be categor ies of cases in which the transfers are so suspici ous, or the procedures employed so prone to abuse , or the purported benets are so trivial or implausible that cour shou ld presume purpose , no such circumst ances are present in this case. * * * For the foregoi ng reasons, I join in the O'Connor, J., dissenti ng Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice, Jus\u00ad tice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenti ng. Over two centur ies ago, just after the Bill of Rights was ratied, Justice Chase wrote: \"An act of the Legislature (for I cannot call it a law) contrary to the great rst principles of the socia l com\u00ad pact, cannot be considered a rightfu l exercise of legisla\u00ad tive author ity....Af ew instances will sufce to explai n what I mean ....[ A] law that takes proper ty from A. and gives it to B: It is against all reason and justice , for a people to entr ust a Legislature with such powers; and, therefore , it cannot be presumed that they have done it.\" Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (emphasis deleted). Today the Cour t abandons this long-held, basic limitation on gover nment power . Under the banner of economic develop\u00ad ment, all private proper ty is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner , so long as it might be upgraded\u2014 i. e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more benecia l to the publ ic\u2014in the process. To reason, as the Cour t does, that the inciden\u00ad tal publ ic benets resu lting from the subsequent ordinary use of private proper ty render economic development tak\u00ad ings \"for publ ic use\" is to wash out any disti nction between private and publ ic use of proper ty\u2014and thereby effec tively to delete the words \"for publ ic use\" from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

In February 1998, Pzer Inc., the phar maceutica ls manu\u00ad facturer , announced that it would build a global research fa\u00ad cility near the Fort Trumbu ll neighborhood. Two months later , New London' s city counci l gave initia l approva l for the New London Development Corporati on (NLDC) to prepare the development plan at issue here .

Theirs is an objec tion in principle: They claim that the NLDC' s pro\u00ad posed use for their conscated proper ty is not a \"publ ic\" one for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. While the gover n\u00ad ment may take their homes to build a road or a railroad or to eliminate a proper ty use that harms the publ ic, say peti\u00ad tioners, it cannot take their proper ty for the private use of other owners simply because the new owners may make more produc tive use of the proper ty. II The Fifth Amendment to the Constituti on, made appl ica\u00ad ble to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, prov ides that \"private proper ty [shall not] be taken for publ ic use, without on.\" When inter preti ng the Consti\u00ad tution, we begin with the unremarkable presumpti on that every word in the document has independent meani ng, \"that no word was unnecessar ily used, or needlessly added. \" Wright v. United States, 302 U. S. 583, 588 (1938). In keep\u00ad ing with that presumpti on, we have read the Fifth Amend\u00ad ment' s lang uage to impose two disti nct on the ex\u00ad ercise of eminent domai n: \"[T]he taking 'publ ic use' and 'just compensati on' must be paid to the owner .\" Brown v. Legal Founda tion of Wash., 538 U. S. 216, 231- 232 (2003). These two limitations serve to protec t \"the secur ity of Proper ty,\" which descr ibed to the Phil\u00ad adelph ia Conventi the \"great obj[ects] of Gov[ ern\u00ad ment ].\" 1 Records of the Federa l Conventi on of 1787, p. 302 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Together they ensure stable prop\u00ad erty table, the gover nment' s eminent do\u00ad main power\u2014par ticularly against those owners who, for whate ver reasons, may be unable to protec t themselves in the politica l process against the S. 469 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng While the Takings Clause presupposes that gover nment can take private proper ty without the owner 's consent, the just compensati on requirement spreads the cost of condem\u00ad nations and thus \"pre vents the publ ic from loadi ng upon one indiv idua l more than his just share of the burdens of gover n\u00ad ment. \" Monongah ela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 325 (1893); see also Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960). The publ ic use requirement, in turn, im\u00ad poses a more basic limitation, circumscr ibing the very scope of the eminent domai n power: Gover nment may compel an indiv idua l to forfeit her proper ty for the publ ic's use, but not for the benet of another private person. This requirement promotes fairness as well as secur ity. Cf. Tahoe-Si erra Prese rvat ion Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency , 535 U. S. 302, 336 (2002) (\"The concepts of 'fairness and justice '... under lie the Takings Clause\"). Where is the line between \"publ ic\" and \"private\" proper ty use? We give to legislatures' deter\u00ad minations about what gover nment al activities will advant age the publ ic. But were the politica l branches the sole of the publ ic-pr ivate disti nction, the Publ ic Use Clause would amount to little more than hortatory fluff. An exter\u00ad nal, judicia l check on how the publ ic use requirement is inter\u00ad preted, howe ver limited, is necessary if this constrai nt on gover nment power is to ng. See Cinc in\u00ad nati v. Vester, 281 U. S. 439, 446 (1930) (\"It is well established that... the questi on [of] what is a publ ic use is a judicia l one\"). Our cases have genera lly identi ed three categor ies of tak\u00ad ings that comply with the publ ic use requirement, though it is in the nature of things that the boundar ies between these categor ies are not always rm. Two are relatively straight\u00ad forward and uncontroversia l. First, the sovereig n may transfer private proper ty to publ ic ownersh ip\u2014such as for a road, a hospit al, or a military base . See, e. g., Old Dominion 545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: LONDON O'Connor, J., dissenti ng Land Co. v. United States, 269 U. S. 55 (1925); Rind ge Co. v. County of Los Angel es, 262 U. S. 700 (1923). Second, the sovereig n may transfer private proper ty to private parties, often common carriers, who make the proper ty available for the publ ic's use\u2014such as with a railroad, a publ ic utility, or a stadium. See, e. g., National Railroad Passenge r Corpo\u00ad ration v. Bost on & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407 (1992); Mt. Vernon-Woodbe rry Cotton Duck Co. v. Alabam a Interstate Power Co., 240 U. S. 30 (1916). But \"publ ic ownersh ways to dene the scope of the Publ ic Use Clause . Thus we have allowed that, in certain circumst ances and to meet certain exigencies, takings that serve a publ ic purpose also satisfy the Constituti on even if the proper ty is desti ned for subsequent private use. See, e. g., Berman v. Parke r, 348 U. S. 26 (1954); Hawaii Housing Authority v. Mid kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984). This case retur ns us for the rst time in over 20 years to the hard questi on of when a purportedly \"publ ic purpose\" taking meets the publ ic use requirement. It presents an issue of rst impressi on: Are economic development takings constituti onal? I would hold that they are not. We are guided by two precedents about the taking of real proper ty by eminent domai n. In Berman, we upheld takings within a blighted neighborhood of Washington, D. C. The neigh\u00ad borhood had so deter iorated that, for example , 64.3% of its dwel lings were beyond repair . 348 U. S., at 30. It had be\u00ad come burdened with \"overcrowdi ng of dwellings,\" \"lack of adequate streets and alleys, \" and \"lack of light and air.\" Id., at 34. Congress had deter mined that the neighborhood had become \"injurious to the publ ic health, safety , mora ls, and welfare\" and that it was necessary to \"eliminat[e] all such injurious conditi ons by employ ing all means necessary and appropr iate for the purpose ,\" includi ng eminent domai n. Id., at 28 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted).

Id., at 34-35; see also Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 244 (\"[I]t is only the taking's purpose , and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny\"). In Mid kiff, we upheld a land condemnati on scheme in Hawai i whereby title in real proper ty was taken from lessors and transferred to lessees. At that time, the State and Fed\u00ad eral Gover nments owned near ly 49% of the State's land, and another 47% was in the hands of only 72 private landowners. Concentrati on of land ownersh ip was so dramatic that on the State's most urbani zed island, Oahu, 22 landowners owned 72.5% of the fee simple titles. Id., at 232. The Hawai i Leg\u00ad islature had concluded that the oligopoly in land ownersh ip was \"skew ing the State's residentia l fee simple market, in\u00ad flating land prices, and injuring the publ ic tranqui lity and welfare ,\" and therefore enac ted a condemnati on scheme for redistr ibuti ng title. Ibid. impor of defer\u00ad purpose . Be\u00ad cause cour are ill equipped to evaluate the efcacy of pro\u00ad posed legislative initiatives, we rejected as unworkable the idea of cour ts' \" 'decidi ng on what is and tal func tion and... invalidati ng legislati on on the basis of their view on that questi on at the moment of decisi on, a prac\u00ad tice which has proved imprac ticable other elds. ' \" Id., at 240-241 (quoti ng United States ex rel. TVA v. Welch, 327 U. S. 546, 552 (1946)); see Berman, supra, at 32 (\"[T]he legis\u00ad lature , not the judiciary , is the main guardian of the publ ic needs to be served by socia l legislati on\"); see also Lingle v. Chevro n U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528 (2005). Likew ise, we recog nized our inabi lity to evaluate whether , in a given case , eminent domai n is a necessary means by which to pursue the legislature' s ends. Midkiff, supra, LONDON O'Connor, J., dissenti ng Yet for all the emphasis on deference , Berman and Mid \u00ad kiff hewed to a bedrock principle without which our publ ic use jurisprudence would collapse: \"A purely private taking could not withst and the scrutiny of the publ ic use require\u00ad ment; it would serve no legitimate purpose of gover nment and would thus be void. \" Mid kiff, 467 U. S., at 245; id., at 241 (\"[T]he Cour t's cases have repeatedly stated that 'one person' s proper ty may not be taken for the benet of another private person without a justi fying publ ic purpose , n v. Con\u00ad solidated Gas Util. Corp., 300 U. S. 55, 80 (1937))); see also Missouri Pacic R. Co. v. Nebraska, 164 U. S. 403, 417 (1896). To protec t that principle , those decisi ons reserved \"a role for cour ts to play in reviewing a legislature' s judg ment of what constitutes a publ ic use . . . [though ] the Cour t in Berman made clear that it is 'an extremely narrow' one.\" Mid kiff, supra, at 240 at 32). The Cour t's holdi ngs in Berman and Midkiff were true to the principle under lying the Publ ic Use Clause . In both those cases, the extraordi nary , precondemnati on use of the targeted proper ty inflicted afrmative harm on society\u2014i n Berman through blight resu lting and in Midkiff through oligopoly resu lting from extreme wealth. And in both cases, the relevant legislative body had found that eliminating the existi ng proper ty use was necessary to remedy the harm. Berman, supra, at 28-29; Mid kiff, supra, at 232. Thus a publ ic purpose was realized when the harmful use was eliminated. Because each taking directly achieved a publ ic benet, it did not matter that the proper ty was turned over to private use. Here, in contrast, New London does not claim that Susette Kelo' s and Wilhelmi na Dery's well-mai ntained homes are the source of any socia l harm. Indeed, it could not so claim without adopti ng the absurd argument that any single-fami ly home that might be razed to make way for an apar tment building, or any church PGT: OPIN 501 Cite U. S. 469 (2005) O'Connor, J., dissenti ng that might be replaced with a retail store , or any small busi\u00ad ness that might be more lucrative if it were instead part of a national franch ise, is inherently harmful to society and thus within the gover nment' s power to condemn. In mov ing away from our decisi ons sanc tioning the con\u00ad demnati on of harmful proper ty use, the Cour t today signi\u00ad cantly expands the meani ng of publ ic use. It holds that the sovereig n may take private proper ty currently put to ordi\u00ad nary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predic ted to generate some secondary benet for the publ ic\u2014such as increased tax reve\u00ad nue, more jobs, maybe even esthetic pleasure . But near ly any lawfu l use of real private proper ty can be said to gener\u00ad ate some incident al benet to the publ ic. Thus, if predic ted (or even guaranteed) positive side effec ts are enough to ren\u00ad der transfer from one private party to another constituti onal, then the words \"for publ ic use\" do not realistica lly exclude any takings, and thus do not exer t any constrai nt on the eminent domai n power . There is a sense in which this troubl ing resu lt follows from errant lang uage in Berman and Mid kiff. In discussi ng whether takings within a blighted neighborhood were for a publ ic use, Berman began by observ ing: \"We deal, in other words, with what traditi onally has been known as the police power .\" 348 U. S., at 32. From there it declared that \"[o]nce the objec t is within the author ity of Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domai n is clear .\" Id., at 33. Following up, we said in Midkiff that \"[t]he 'publ ic use' requirement is coter minous with the scope of a sovereig n's police powers. \" 467 U. S., at 240. This lan\u00ad guage was unnecessary to the speci c holdi ngs of those deci\u00ad sions. Berman and Midkiff simply did not put such lan\u00ad guage to the constituti onal test, because the takings in those cases were within the police power but also for \"publ ic use\" for the reasons I have descr ibed. The case before us now demonstrates why, when decidi ng if a dissenti constituti onal, the police power and \"publ ic use\" cannot al\u00ad ways be equated. The Cour t protests that it does not sanc tion the bare transfer from A to B for B's benet. It suggests two limita\u00ad tions on what can be taken after today' s decisi on. First, it maintains a role for cour ts in ferreti ng out takings whose sole purpose is to bestow a benet on the private trans\u00ad feree \u2014without com\u00ad plicated inquiry . Ante, at 477-478. For his part, Justice Kennedy suggests that cour ts may divine illicit purpose by a carefu l review of the record and the process by which a legislature arrived at the decisi on to take\u2014without speci fy\u00ad ing what cour ts shou ld look for in a case with different facts, how they will know if they have found it, and what to do if they do not. Ante, at 491-492 (concurr ing opinion). What\u00ad ever the details of Justice Kennedy 's as-yet-undisclosed test, it is difcu lt to envision anyone but the \"stupid staff[er]\" failing it. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coasta l Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1025 -1026, n. 12 (1992). The trouble with economic development takings is that private benet and incident al publ ic benet are, by denition, merged and mutua lly reinforci ng. In this case , for example , any boon for Pzer or the plan' s developer is difcu lt to disaggregate from the promised publ ic gains in taxes and jobs. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 275-277. Even if there were a prac tical way to isolate the motives behind a given taking, the gesture toward a purpose test is theoretica lly flawed. If it is true that incident al publ ic ben\u00ad ets from new private use are enough to ensure the \"publ ic purpose\" in a taking, why shou ld it matter , as far as the Fifth Amendment is concer ned, what inspired the taking in the rst place? How much the gover nment does or does not desire to benet a favored private party has no bear ing on whether an economic development taking will or will not generate secondary benet for the publ ic. And whate ver the reason for a given condemnati on, the effec t is OPIN 503 the constituti onal perspec tive \u2014pr ty is forcibly relinquished to new private ownersh ip. A second proposed limitation is implicit in the Cour t's opinion. The logic of today' s decisi on is that eminent do\u00ad main may only be used to upgrade \u2014not downgrade \u2014prop\u00ad erty. At best this makes the Publ ic Use Clause redundant with the Due Process Clause , which already proh ibits irra\u00ad tional gover S. 528. The Cour t rightfu lly admits, howe ver, that the judiciary cannot get bogged down in predic tive judg ments about whether the publ ic will actually be better off after a proper ty transfer . In any event, this constrai nt has no realistic impor t. For who among us can say she already makes the most produc\u00ad tive or attrac tive possible use of her proper ty? The spec ter of condemnati on hangs over all proper ty. Nothing is to pre\u00ad vent the State from replaci ng any Motel 6 with a Ritz- Carlton, any home with a shoppi ng mall, or any farm with a factory. Cf. Bugr yn v. Bristol, 63 Conn. App. 98, 774 A. 2d 1042 (2001) (taking the homes and farm of four owners in their 70's and 80's and giving it to an \"industr ial park \"); 99 Cents Only Stores v. Lancaste r Redev Agency , 237 F.

Berliner, ic Power , Private Gain: A Five-Y ear, State-by-St ate Re\u00ad port Exami ning Abuse of Emi nent Domai n (2003) (col\u00ad lecting accounts of economic development takings). The Cour t also puts specia l emphasis on facts pecu liar to this case: The NLDC' s plan is the produc t of a relatively carefu l deliberative process; it proposes to use [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: O'Connor, J., dissenti ng main for a multipar t, integrated plan rather than for isolated proper ty transfer; it promises an array of incident al benets (even esthetic ones), not just increased tax revenue; it comes on the heels of a legislative deter mination that New London is a depressed municipa lity. See, e. g., ante, at 487 (\"[A] one-to-one transfer of proper ty, executed outside the con nes of an integrated development plan, is not presented in this case\"). Justice Kennedy , too, takes great comfor t in these facts. Ante, at 493 (concurr ing opinion). But none has legal signicance to blunt the force of today' s holdi ng. If legislative prog nosticati ons about the secondary publ ic bene\u00ad ts of a new use can legitimate a taking, there is noth ing in the Cour t's rule or in Justice Kennedy 's gloss on that rule to proh ibit proper ty transfers generated with less care , that are less comprehensive , that happen to resu lt from less elab\u00ad orate process, whose only projec ted advant age is the inci\u00ad dence of higher taxes, or that hope to transfor m an already prosperous city into an even more prosperous one. Finally, in a coda, the Cour t suggests that proper ty own\u00ad ers shou ld turn to the States, who may or may not choose to impose appropr iate limits on economic development takings. Ante, at 489. This is an abdicati on of our responsibi lity. States play many impor tant func tions system of dual sovereig nty, but compensati ng for our refusa l to enforce proper ly the Federa l Constituti on (and a prov ision meant to curtail state action, no less) is not among them. * * * It was possible after Berman and Midkiff to imag ine un\u00ad constituti onal transfers en\u00ad dorsed gover nment interventi on when private proper ty use had veered to such an extreme that the publ ic was suffer ing as a consequence . Today near ly all real proper ty is suscep\u00ad tible to condemnati on on the Cour t's theory . In the pre\u00ad scient words of a dissenter from the infamous decisi on in Poletown , \"[n]ow 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 505 Cite U. S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng bodies to decide that a different commercia l or industr ial use of proper ty will produce greater publ ic benets than its pres\u00ad ent use, no homeowner 's, merchant' s or manufac turer 's prop\u00ad erty, howe ver produc tive or valuable to its owner , is immune from condemnati on for the benet of other private interests that will put it to a 'higher ' use.\" 410 Mich., at 644-645, 304 N. W. 2d, at 464 (opinion of Fitzgera ld, J.). This is why economic development takings \"seriously jeopardi z[e] the se\u00ad curity of all private proper ty ownersh ip.\" Id., at 645, 304 N. W. 2d, at 465 (Ryan, J., dissenti ng). Any proper ty may now be taken for the benet of another private party, but the fallout from this decisi on will not be random. The beneciar ies are likely to be those citizens with dispropor tionate influence and power in the politica l process, includi ng large corporati ons and development rms. As for the victims, the gover nment now has license to trans\u00ad fer proper ty from those with fewer resources to those with more . The Founders cannot have intended this perverse re\u00ad sult. \"[T]hat alone is a just gover nment, \" wrote James Madison, \"which impar tially secures to every man, whate ver is his own .\" For the Nati onal Gazette , Proper ty (Mar . 27, 1792), repr inted in 14 Papers of James Madison 266 (R. Rut\u00ad land et al. eds. 1983). I would hold that the takings in both Parcel 3 and Parcel 4A are unconstituti onal, reverse the judg of Connec proceedi ngs. Justice Thomas, dissenti ng. Long ago, William Blackstone wrote that \"the law the land . . . postpone[ s] even publ ic necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private proper ty.\" 1 Comment aries on the Laws of England 134-135 (1765) (herei nafter Black\u00ad stone). The Framers embodied in the Consti\u00ad tution, allowing the gover nment to take proper ty not for \"publ ic necessity ,\" but instead for \"publ Defying this underst andi ng, the Cour t replaces the Publ ic Use Clause with a \" '[P]ublic [P]urpose' \" Clause , ante, at 479-480 (or perhaps the \"Diverse and Always Evolv ing Needs of Society\" Clause , ante, at 479 (capit alization added)), iction that is satised, the Cour t instructs, so long as the purpose is \"legitimate\" and the means \"not irrati onal,\" ante, at 488 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). This defer\u00ad entia l shift in phraseolog y enables the Cour t to hold, against all common sense , that a costly urban-renewa l projec t whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue , but which is also suspici ously agreeable to the Pzer Corporati on, is for a \"publ ic use.\" I cannot agree . If such \"economic development\" takings are for a \"publ ic use,\" any taking is, and the Cour t has erased the Publ ic Use Clause from our Constituti on, as Justice O'Connor power fully argues in dissent. Ante, at 494, 501- 505. I do not believe that this Cour t can eliminate liberties expressly enumerated in the Constituti on and therefore join her dissenti ng opinion. Regrett ably, howe ver, the Cour t's error runs deeper than this. Today' s decisi on is simply the latest in a string of our cases constr uing the Publ ic Use Clause to be a virtual nullity, without the slightest nod to its original meani ng. In my view, the Publ ic Use Clause , originally understood, is a meani ngful limit on the gover n\u00ad ment' s eminent domai n power . Our have strayed from the Clause' s original meani ng, and I would reconsider them. I The Fifth Amendment prov ides: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capit al, or oth\u00ad erwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or in\u00ad dictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or nava l forces, or in the Militia, when in actual serv ice in time of War or publ ic danger; nor shall any person be subjec t for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb, nor shall be compel led in any 545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 507 Cite U. S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be de\u00ad prived of life, liberty, or proper ty, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for publ ic use, without just compen sation.\" (Emphasis added.) It is the last of these liberties, the Takings Clause , that is at issue in this case. In my view, it is \"imperative that the Cour t maintain absolute del ity to\" the Clause' s express limit on the power of the gover nment over the indiv idua l, no less than with every other liberty expressly enumerated in the Fifth Amendment or the Bill of Rights more genera lly. Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 28 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment) (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Though one component of the protec tion prov ided by the Takings Clause is that the gover nment can take private proper ty only if it prov ides \"just compensati on\" for the also proh ibits the gover nment from taking proper ty except \"for publ ic use.\" Were it other wise, the Takings Clause would either be meani ngless or empty . If the Publ ic Use Clause served no func tion other than to state that the gover nment may take proper ty through its eminent domai n power\u2014for publ ic or private uses\u2014then it would be surplusage . See ante, at 496 (O'Connor, J., dis\u00ad senti ng); see also Marb ury v. Mad ison, 1 Cranch 137, 174 (1803) (\"It cannot be presumed that any clause in the consti\u00ad tution is intended to be without effec t\"); Mye rs v. United States, 272 U. S. 52, 151 (1926). Alter natively , the Clause could disti nguish those takings that require compensati on from those that do not. That inter pret ation, howe ver, \"wou ld permit private proper ty to be taken or appropr iated for private use without any compensati on whate ver.\" Cole v. La Grange, 113 U. S. 1, 8 (1885) (inter preti ng same lan\u00ad guage in the Missour i Publ ic Use Clause). In other words, the Clause would require the gover nment to compensate for takings done \"for publ ic use,\" leaving it free to take proper ty for purely private uses without the payment of compensa\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: J., dissenti ng tion. This would contradic t a bedrock principle well estab\u00ad lished by the time of the foundi ng: that all takings required the payment of compensati on. 1 Blackstone 135; 2 J. Kent, Comment aries on Amer ican ty (Mar . 27, 1792), in 14 Papers of James Madison 266, 267 (R. Rutland et al. eds. 1983) (arguing that no proper ty \"sha ll be taken directly even for publ ic use without indemni cati on to the owner \").1 The Publ ic Use Clause , like the Just Compensati on Clause , is therefore an express limit on the gover nment' s power of emi\u00ad nent domai n. The most natura l readi ng of the Clause is that it allows the gover nment to take proper ty only if the gover nment owns, or the publ ic has a legal right to use, the proper ty, as opposed to taking it for any publ ic purpose or necessity whatsoe ver. At the time of the foundi ng, pri\u00ad marily dened the noun \"use\" as \"[t]he act of employ ing any thing to any purpose .\" 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Lang uage 2194 (4th ed. 1773) (herei nafter Johnson). moreover , from the Lati n utor , which means 'to use, make use of, avail one's self of, employ , apply , enjoy, etc.\" J. Lew is, Law of Emi nent Domai n \u00a7 165, p. 224, n. 4 (1888) (herei nafter Lew is). When the gover nment takes proper ty and gives it to a private indiv idua l, and the publ ic has no right to use the proper ty, it strai ns lang uage to say that the publ ic is \"employ ing\" the proper ty, regardless of the incident al benets that might accrue to the publ ic from the private use. The term \"publ ic use,\" then, means that either the gover nment or its citizens as a whole must actu\u00ad 1 Some state constituti ons at the time of the foundi ng lacked just com\u00ad pensati on clauses and took proper ty even without prov iding compensati on. See Lucas v. South Carolina Coasta l Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1056 -1057 (1992) (Blackmun, J., dissenti ng). The Framers of the Fifth Amendment apparently disagreed, for they expressly proh ibited uncompensated tak\u00ad ings, and the Fifth Amendment was not incor porated against the States until much later . See id., at 1028, n. 15. PAGES PGT: OPIN 509 Cite S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng ally \"employ\" the taken proper ty. See id., at 223 (reviewing foundi ng-era dictionar ies). Granted, another sense of the word was broader in meani ng, \"help, \" or \"[q]ua li\u00ad ties that make a thing proper for any purpose .\" 2 Johnson 2194. Nevertheless, read in context, the term \"publ ic use\" possesses the narrower meani ng. Elsewhere , the Constitu\u00ad tion twice employs the word \"use ,\" its nar\u00ad rower sense . Claeys, Publ ic-Use Limitations and Natura l Proper ty Rights, 2004 Mich. St. L. Rev. 877, 897 (herei nafter Publ ic Use Limitations). Article I, \u00a710, prov ides that \"the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Impor ts or Expor ts, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States, \" meani ng the Treasury itself will control the taxes, not use it to any benecia l end. And Article I, \u00a7 8, grants Congress power \"[t]o raise and suppor t Armies, but no Appropr iation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years. \" Here again, \"use\" means \"employed to raise and suppor t Armies, \" not anyth ing di\u00ad rected to achieving any military end. The same word in the Publ ic Use Clause shou ld be inter preted to have the same meani ng. Tellingly, the phrase \"publ ic use\" contrasts with the very different phrase \"genera l Welfare\" used elsewhere in the Constituti on. See (\"Congress shall have Power To . . . prov ide for the common Defence and genera l Welfare of the United States\"); preamble (Constituti on established \"to promote the genera l Welfare\"). The Framers would have used some such broader term if they had meant the Publ ic Use Clause to have a similarly sweepi ng scope . Other foundi ng-era documents made the contrast between these two usages still more expl icit. See Sales, Classica l s \"Publ Use\" 49 Duke L. J. 339, 367-368 (1999) (herei nafter Sales) (noting contrast between, on the one hand, the term \"publ ic use\" used by 6 of the rst 13 States and, on the other , 545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES J., dissenti ng the terms \"publ ic exigencies\" employed in the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and the Northwest Ordi nance , and the term \"publ ic necessity\" used the Vermont Constituti on of 1786). The Constituti on's text, in shor t, suggests that the Takings Clause author izes the taking of proper ty only if the publ ic has a right to employ it, not if the publ ic realizes any conceiv\u00ad able benet from the taking. The Constituti on's common-law background reinforces this understanding. The common law provided an express method of eliminating uses of land that adversely impac ted the publ ic welfare: nuisance law. Blackstone and Kent, for instance , both carefu lly disti nguished the law of nuisance from the power of eminent domai n. Compare 1 Blackstone 135 (noting gover nment' s power to take private proper ty with compensati on) with 3 id., at 216 (noting action to rem\u00ad edy \"publ ic . . . nuisances, which affec t the publ ic, are an annoyance to all the king's subjec ts\"); see also 2 Kent 274-276 (disti nguishing the two). Blackstone rejected the idea that private proper ty could be taken solely for purposes of any publ ic benet. \"So grea t...i sthe regard of for private proper ty,\" he explai ned, \"that it will not author\u00ad ize the least violati on of it; no, not even for the genera l good of the whole community .\" 1 Blackstone 135. He conti nued: \"Ifan ew road... were to be made through the grounds of a private person, it might perhaps be extensively benecia l to the publ ic; but the law permits no man, or set of men, to do this without the consent of the owner of the land. \" Ibid. Only \"by giving [the landowner ] full indemni cati on\" could the gover nment take proper ty, and even then \"[t]he publ ic [was] now considered as treati ng with an indi\u00ad vidua l for an exchange .\" Ibid. When the publ ic took prop\u00ad erty, in other words, it took it as an indiv idua l buying prop\u00ad erty from another typically would: for one's own use. The Publ ic Use Clause , in shor t, embodied the Framers' under\u00ad standi ng that proper ty is a al right, pro\u00ad hibiting the gover PAGES PGT: OPIN 511 Cite S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng giv[ing] it to B.\" Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798); see also Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627, 658 (1829); Vanho rne's Lessee v. 2 Dall. 304, 311 Pa. 1795). The publ ic purpose inter pret ation of the Publ ic Use Clause also unnecessar ily dupl icates a similar inquiry required by the Necessary and Proper Clause . The Takings Clause is a proh ibition, not a grant of power: The Constituti on does not expressly grant the Federa l Gover nment the power to take proper ty for any publ ic purpose whatsoe ver. Instead, the Gover nment may take proper ty only when necessary and proper to the exercise of an expressly enumerated power . See Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S. 367, 371-372 (1876) (not\u00ad ing Federa l Gover nment' s power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to take proper ty \"needed for forts, armories, and arsena ls, cour t-houses, and for other publ ic uses\"). For a law to be within the Necessary and Proper Clause , as I have elsewhere explai ned, it must bear an \"obv i\u00ad ous, simple , and direc t an exercise of Congress' enumerated powers, Sabr i v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 613 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment), and it must not \"subver basic constituti onal desig n, 65 (Thomas, J., dissenti ng). In other words, a taking is permissible under the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it serves a valid publ ic purpose . In\u00ad terpreti ng the Publ Clause likew ise to limit the gov\u00ad ernment to take proper ty only for sufciently publ ic pur\u00ad poses replicates this inquiry . If this is all the Clause means, it is, once again, surplusage . See supra, at 507. The Clause is thus most natura lly read to concer n whether the proper ty is used by the publ ic or the gover nment, not whether the purpose of the taking is legitimately publ ic. II Early Amer ican eminent domai n prac tice largely bears out this andi Thomas, J., dissenti ng concer ns state limits on eminent domai n power , not the Fifth Amendment, since it was not until the late 19th century that the Federa l Gover nment began to use the power of eminent domai n, and since the Takings Clause did not even arguably limit state power until after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Note, The Publ ic Use Limitation on Emi\u00ad nent Domai n: An Advance Requiem, 58 599, 599- 600, and nn. 3-4 (1949); Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayo r of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 250-251 (1833) (holdi ng the Takings Clause inappl icable States of its own force). Never\u00ad theless, severa l early state constituti ons at the time of the foundi ng likew ise limited the power of eminent domai n to \"publ ic uses. \" See Sales 367-369, and n. 137 (emphasis de\u00ad leted). Their prac tices therefore shed light on the original meani ng of the same words cont ained in the Publ ic Use Clause . States employed the eminent domai n power to prov ide quintessentia lly publ ic goods, such as publ ic roads, toll roads, ferries, cana ls, railroads, and publ ic parks. Lew is \u00a7\u00a7 166, 168-171, 175, at 227-228, 234-241, 243. Though use of the eminent domai n power was sparse at the time of the found\u00ad ing, many States did have so-ca lled Mill Acts, which author\u00ad ized the owners of grist mills operated by water power to flood upstream lands with the payment of compensati on to the upstream landowner . See, e. g., id., \u00a7 178, at 245-246; Head v. Amoskeag Mfg. Co., 113 U. S. 9, 16-19, and n. (1885). Those early grist mills \"were regulated by law and com\u00ad pelled to serve the publ ic for a stipu lated toll and in regular order ,\" and therefore were actually used by the publ ic. Lew is \u00a7 178, at 246, and n. 3; see also Head, supra, at 18-19. They were common carriers\u2014 quasi-publ ic entities. These were \"publ ic uses\" in the fullest sense of the word, because the publ ic could legally use and benet from them equa lly. See Publ ic Use Limitations 903 (common-carr ier status tra\u00ad ditionally afforded to PGT: OPIN 513 Cite S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng chise or another form of state monopoly , or to companies that operated in conditi ons of natura l monopoly\"). To be sure , some early state legislatures tested the limits of their state-law eminent domai n power . Some States enac ted statutes allowing the taking of proper ty for the pur\u00ad pose of building private roads. See Lew is \u00a7 167, at 230. These statutes were mixed; some required the private land\u00ad owner to keep the road open to the publ ic, and others did not. See id., \u00a7 167, at 230-234. Later in the 19th century , moreover , the Mill Acts were employed to grant rights to private manufac turing plants, in additi on to grist mills that had common-carr ier duties. See, e. g., M. Horwitz, The Transfor mati on of Amer ican Law 1780 -1860, pp. 51-52 (1977). These early uses of the eminent domai n power are often cited as evidence for the broad \"publ ic purpose\" inter pret a\u00ad tion of the Publ ic Use Clause , see, e. g., ante, at 479-480, n. 8 (major ity opinion); Brief for Respondents 30; Brief for Amer ican Planni ng Assn. et al. as Ami ci Curiae 6-7, but in fact the constituti onality of these exercises of eminent do\u00ad main power under state publ ic use restr ictions was a hotly contested questi on in state cour ts throughout the 19th and into the 20th century . Some cour ts constr ued those clauses to author ize takings for publ ic purposes, but others adhered to the natura l meani ng of \"publ ic use.\" 2 As noted above , 2 Compare ante, at 479, and n. 8 (major ity opinion) (noting that some state cour ts upheld the validity of apply ing the Mill Acts to private pur\u00ad poses and arguing that the \" 'use by the publ ic' test\" \"eroded over time\"), with, \"that the statute shou ld re\u00ad quire the use to be publ ic in fact; in other words, that it shou ld cont ain isions entitl accommodati ons\"); Gaylord v.

Langham, 34 Ala. 311, 332-334 (1859) (striking down taking for purely private road and grist mill); Varner v. Mar tin, 21 W. Va. 534, 546-548, 556-557, 566-567 (1883) (grist mill and private road had to be open to publ ic for them J., dissenti ng the earliest Mill Acts were appl ied to entities with duties to remai n open to the publ ic, and their later extensi on is not deeply probative of whether that subsequent prac tice is con\u00ad sistent with the original meani ng of the Publ ic Use Clause . See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334, 370 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment). At the time of the foundi ng, \"[b]usiness corporati ons were only beginning to upset the old corporate model, in which the raison d'etre of char tered associati ons was their to the publ ic,\" Horwitz, supra, at 49-50, so it was natura l to those who framed the rst Publ ic Use Clauses to think of mills as inher\u00ad ently publ ic entities. The disagreement among state cour ts, and state legislatures' attempts to circumvent publ ic use lim\u00ad its on their eminent domai n power , cannot obscure that the Publ ic Use Clause is most natura lly read to author ize tak\u00ad ings for publ ic use only if the gover nment or the publ ic actu\u00ad ally uses the taken proper ty. III Our current Publ ic Use Clause jurisprudence , as the Cour t notes, has rejected this natura l readi ng of the Clause . Ante, at 479-483. The Cour t adopted its moder n readi ng blindly, with little discussi on of the Clause' s history and original meani ng, in two disti nct lines of cases: rst, adopti ng the \"publ ic pret ation Clause , ing to ments ng .

Rev. 285, 286, and n. 11 (1946) (calling the actual publ ic use standard the \"major ity view\" and cases). PAGES PGT: OPIN 515 Cite S. 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng concepti on of \"publ ic use\" adopted by this Cour t in Berman v. Parke r, 348 U. S. 26 (1954), and Hawaii Housing Author\u00ad ity v. Mid kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984), cases that take center stage in the Cour t's opinion. See ante, at 480-482. The weakness of those two lines of cases, and consequently Ber\u00ad man and Mid kiff, fatally under mines the doctrinal founda\u00ad tions of appl ica\u00ad of cases is further proof that the \"publ ic purpose\" standard is not susceptible of principled appl icati on. This Cour t's reliance by rote on this standard is ill advised and shou ld be reconsidered. A As the Cour t notes, the \"publ ic purpose\" inter pret ation of the Publ ic Use Clause stems from Fallbro ok Irrigation Dist. v. Brad ley, 164 U. S. 112, 161-162 (1896). Ante, at 479-480. The issue in Brad ley was whether a condemnati on for pur\u00ad poses of constr ucting an irrigati on ditch was for a publ ic use. 164 U. S., at 161. This was a publ ic use, Justice Peckham declared for the Cour t, because \"[t]o irrigate and thus to bring into possible cultivati on these large masses of other\u00ad wise worthless lands would seem to be a publ ic purpose and a matter of publ ic interest, not con ned to landowners, or even to any one section of the State.\" Ibid. That broad statement was dictum, for the law under review also pro\u00ad vided that \"[a]ll landowners in the distr ict have the right to a propor tionate share of the water .\" Id., at 162. Thus, the \"publ ic\" did have the right to use the irrigati on ditch because all similarly situated members of the publ ic\u2014those who owned lands irrigated by the ditch\u2014had a right to use it. The Cour t cited no author ity for its dictum, and did not dis\u00ad cuss either the Publ ic Use Clause' s original meani ng or the numerous author ities that had adopted the \"actual use\" test (though it at least acknowledged the confl ict of author ity in state cour ts, see id., at 158; supra, at 513-514, and n. 2). Instead, the Cour t reasoned that \"[t]he use must be regarded as a publ ic use, or else it would seem to follow that no gen\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: J., dissenti ng eral scheme of irrigati on can be formed or carried into ef\u00ad fect.\" Brad ley, supra, at 160-161. This is no statement of constituti onal Whate ver the utility of irrigati on distr icts or the merits of the Cour t's view that another rule would be \"imprac tical given the diverse and always evolv ing needs of society ,\" ante, at 479, the Constituti on does not em\u00ad body those policy preferences any more than it \"enac t[s] Mr. Herber t Spencer 's Socia l Statics, \" Lochne r v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenti ng); but see id., at 58-62 (Peckham, J., for the Cour t). This Cour t's cases followed Brad ley's test with little analy\u00ad sis. In Clark v. Nash, 198 U. S. 361 (1905) (Peckham, J., for the Cour t), this Cour t relied on little more than a citation to Brad ley in upholdi ng another condemnati on for the purpose of laying an irrigati on ditch. 198 U. S., at 369-370. As in Brad ley, use of the \"publ ic purpose\" test was unnecessary to the resu lt the Cour t reached. The gover nment condemned the irrigati on ditch for the purpose of ensur ing access to water in which \"[o]ther land owners adjoi ning the defendant in error . . . might share ,\" 198 U. S., at 370, and therefore Clark also involved a condemnati on for the purpose of ensur\u00ad ing access to a resource to which similarly situated members of the publ ic had a legal right of access. Likew ise, in Strick\u00ad ley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527 (1906), the Cour t upheld a condemnati on establishing an aerial right-of-way for a bucket line operated by a mining company , relying on little more than Clark, see Strickley, supra, at 531. This case , too, could have been disposed of on the nar\u00ad rower ground that \"the plaintiff [was] a carrier for itself and others, \" 200 U. S., at 531-532, and therefore that the bucket line was legally open to the publ ic. Instead, the Cour t un\u00ad necessar ily rested its decisi on on the \"inadequacy of use by the genera l publ ic as a universa l test. \" Id., at 531. This Cour t's cases quickly incor porated the publ ic purpose stand\u00ad ard set forth in Clark and Strickley by barren citation.

B A second line of this Cour t's cases also deviated from the Publ ic Use Clause' s original meani ng by allowing legisla\u00ad tures to dene the scope of valid \"publ ic uses. \" United States v. Gettysburg Electric R. Co., 160 U. S. 668 (1896), involved the questi on whether Congress' decisi on to con\u00ad demn certain private land for the purpose of building battle\u00ad eld memor ials at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania, was for a publ ic use. Id., at 679-680. Since the Federa l Gover nment was to use the lands in questi on, id., at 682, there is no doubt that it was a publ ic use under any reasonable standard. Nonetheless, the Cour t, speak ing through Justice Peckham, declared that \"when the legislature has declared the use or purpose to be a publ ic one, its judg ment will be respec ted by the cour ts, unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundati on.\" Id., at 680. As it had with the \"publ ic pur\u00ad pose\" dictum in Brad ley, the Cour t quickly incor porated this dictum into its Publ ic Use Clause cases with little discussi on. See, e. g., United States ex rel. TVA v. Welch, 327 U. S. 546, 552 (1946); Old Dominion Land Co. v. United States, 269 U. S. 55, 66 (1925). There is no justi cati on, howe ver, for affordi ng almost in\u00ad surmount able deference to legislative conclusi ons that a use serves a \"publ ic use.\" To begin with, a cour t owes no defer\u00ad ence to a legislature' ment concer ning tially legal questi on of whether the gover nment owns, or the publ ic has a legal right to use, the taken proper ty. Even under the \"publ ic purpose\" inter pret ation, moreover , it is most implausible that the Framers intended to defer to legis\u00ad latures as to what satises the dissenti ng among all the express prov isions of the Bill of Rights. We would not defer to a legislature' s deter mination of the vari\u00ad ous circumst ances that establish, for example , when a search of a home would be reasonable , see, e. g., Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 589-590 (1980), or when a convicted double-murderer may be a sentenci ng Mis\u00ad souri, 544 U. S. 622 (2005), or when state law creates a prop\u00ad erty interest protec ted by the Due Process Clause , see, e. g., Castle Rock v. Gonzales, post, at 756-758; Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 576 (1972); Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U. S. 254, 262-263 (1970). Still worse , it is backwards to adopt a search ing standard of constituti onal review for nontraditi onal proper ty inter\u00ad ests, such as welfare benets, see, e. g., Goldberg, supra, while deferr ing to the legislature' s deter mination as to what constitutes a publ ic use when it exercises the power of emi\u00ad nent domai n, and thereby invades indiv idua onal rights in real elsewhere recog\u00ad for the sanc tity of the home that has been embedded in our traditi ons since the origins of the Republ ic,\" Payton, supra, at 601, when the issue is only whether the gover nment may search a home . Yet today the Cour t tells us that we are not to \"second-g uess the City' s considered judg ments, \" ante, at 488, when the issue is, instead, whether the gover nment may take the innitely more intrusive step of tearing down petiti oners' homes. Someth ing has gone seriously awry with this Cour t's inter\u00ad pret ation of the Constituti on. Though citizens are safe from the gover nment in their homes, the homes themselves are not. Once one accepts, as the Cour t at least nomi nally does, ante, at 477, that the Publ ic Use Clause is a limit on the eminent domai n power of the Federa l Gover nment and the States, there is no justi cati on for the almost complete defer\u00ad ence it grants to legislatures as to Unit:$U69 [03-26-08 18:23:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN 519 U.

S. 229 (1984). Rely ing on those lines of cases, the Cour t in Berman and Midkiff upheld con\u00ad demnati ons for the purposes of slum re\u00ad distr ibuti med, \"when the legislature has spoken, the publ ic interest has been declared in terms well\u00ad nigh conclusive . In such cases the legislature , not the judi\u00ad ciary , is the main guardian of the publ ic needs to be served by socia l legislati on.\" 348 U. S., at 32. That reasoni ng was questi on begg ing, since the questi on to be decided was whether the \"speci c constituti onal limitation\" of the Publ ic Use Clause prevented the taking of the appel s (conced\u00ad edly \"nonbl at 31, 34. Ber\u00ad man also appeared to reason that any exercise by Congress of an enumerated power (in this case , its plenary power over the District of Columbia) was per se a \"publ ic use\" under the Fifth Amendment. Id., at 33. But the very point of the Publ ic Use Clause is to limit that power . See supra, at 508. More fundament ally, Berman and Midkiff erred by equat\u00ad ing the eminent domai n power with the police power of States. See Midkiff, supra, at police powers\"); Berman, supra, at 32. Traditi onal uses of that regulatory power , such as the power to abate a nuisance , required no compensati on whatsoe ver, see Mugl er v. Kan sas, 123 U. S. 623, 668-669 (1887), in shar p contrast to the takings power , which has always required compensati on, see supra, at 508, and n. 1. The questi on whether the State can take proper ty using the power of eminent domai n is therefore dis\u00ad tinct from the questi on whether it can regulate proper ty pur\u00ad suant to the police power . See, e. g., Lucas v. South Caro\u00ad lina Coasta l Council, J., dissenti ng supra, at 668-669. In Berman, for example , if the slums at issue were truly \"blighted, \" then state nuisance law, see, e. g., supra, at 510; Lucas , supra, at 1029, not the power of eminent domai n, would prov ide the appropr iate remedy . To constr ue the Publ ic Use Clause to over lap with the States' police power conflates these two categor ies.3 The \"publ ic purpose\" test appl ied by Berman and Midkiff also cannot be appl ied in principled manner . \"When we de\u00ad part from the natura l impor t of the term 'publ ic use,' and substitute for the simple idea of a publ ic possessi on and occu\u00ad pation, that of publ utility, publ ic interest, genera l advant age or convenience . . . we are afloat without any certain principle to guide us.\" Bloodgood v. Mohawk & Hud son R. Co., 18 Wend. 9, 60-61 (NY 1837) (opinion of Tracy , Sen.). Once one permits takings for publ ic purposes in additi on to publ ic uses, no coherent principle limits what could constitute a valid publ ic use\u2014at least, none beyond Justice O'C onnor 's (entirely proper) appea l to the text of the Constituti on itself . See ante, at 494, 501-505 (dissenti ng opinion). I share the Cour t's skepticism about a publ ic use standard that requires cour ts to second-g uess the policy wis\u00ad ts. Ante, at 486-489. The \"pub\u00ad lic purpose\" standard this Cour t has adopted, howe ver, de\u00ad mands the use of such judg ment, for the Cour t concedes that the Publ ic Use Clause would forbid a purely private taking. 3 Some States also promoted the alienabi lity of proper ty by abolishing the feuda l \"quit rent\" system, i. e., long-ter m leases under which the pro\u00ad prietor reserved to himself the right to perpetua l payment of rents from his tenant. See Vance , The Quest for Tenure in the United States, 33 Yale L. J. 248, 256-257, 260-263 (1923). In Hawaii Housing Authority v. Mid kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984), the Cour t cited those state policies favor ing the alienabi lity of land as evidence that the gover nment' s eminent domai n power was similarly expansive , see id., at 241-242, and n. 5. But they were uses of the States' regulatory power , not the takings power , and therefore were irrele vant to the issue in Mid kiff. This mismatch under\u00ad scores the error of conflati ng a State's regulatory with 469 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Ante, at 477-478. It is difcu lt to imag ine how a cour t could nd that a taking was purely private except by deter mining that the taking did not, in fact, rationally advance the publ ic interest. Cf. ante, at 502-503 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng) (noting the compl icated inquiry the Cour t's test requires). The Cour t is therefore wrong to criticize the \"actual use\" test as \"difcu lt to admi nister .\" Ante, at 479. It is far eas\u00ad ier to analyze whether the gover nment owns or the publ ic has a legal right to use the taken proper ty than to ask whether the taking has a \"purely private purpose\"\u2014unless the Cour t means to eliminate publ ic use scrutiny of takings entirely . on, of course , guarantees that it will not be misappl ied. For all these reasons, I would revisit our Publ ic Use Clause cases and consider retur ning to the original meani ng of the Publ ic Use Clause: that the gover nment may take proper ty only if it actually uses or gives the publ ic a legal right to use the proper ty. IV The consequences of today' s decisi on are not difcu lt to predic t, and to newa for the proper\u00ad ties they take, but no compensati on is possible for the subjec\u00ad tive value of these lands to the indiv idua ls displaced and the indig nity inflicted by uprooti ng them from their homes. Allowing the gover nment to take proper ty solely for publ ic purposes is bad enough, but extendi ng the concept of publ ic purpose to encompass any economica lly benecia l goal guar\u00ad antees that these losses will fall dispropor tionately on poor communities. Those communities are not only systemati\u00ad cally less likely to put their lands to the highest and best socia l use, but are also the least politica lly power ful. If ever there were justi cati on for intrusive judicia LONDON Thomas, J., dissenti ng 144, 152, n. 4 (1938), surely that principle would apply with great force to the power less groups and indiv idua ls the Pub\u00ad lic Use Clause protec ts. The deferentia l standard this Cour t has adopted for the Publ ic Use Clause is therefore deeply perverse . It encourages \"those citizens with dispro\u00ad portionate influence and power in the politica l process, in\u00ad cludi ng large corporati ons and development rms,\" to vic\u00ad timize the weak. Ante, at 505 (O'Connor, J., dissenti ng). Those incentives have made the legacy of this Cour t's \"publ ic purpose\" test an unhappy one.

After petiti oner abandoned his attempt to seek review of the District Cour t's decisi on, this Cour t decided that a state postcon viction relief petiti on can toll the federa l statute of limitations even if, like petiti oner 's, the petiti on is ultimately dismissed as procedur\u00ad ally barred. Artuz v. Benne tt, 531 U. S. 4. Petitioner led a Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) moti on for relief from the judg ment, which the District Cour t denied. The Eleventh Circuit afrmed the denia l, holdi ng that the Rule 60(b) moti on was in subst ance a second or successive habeas petiti on, which under the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A), 28 U.

Because petiti oner 's Rule 60(b) moti on challenged only the District Cour t's previous ruling on AEDP A's statute of limitations, it is not the equiva lent of a successive habeas petiti on and can be ruled upon by the District Cour t without precer ticati on by the Eleventh Circuit. 528-536. 60(b) appl ies ngs only is] not inconsistent icable federa l 11. Because \u00a7 2244( b) appl ies only where a cour t acts pursuant to a prisoner 's \"habeas corpus appl icati on,\" the questi on here is whether a Rule 60(b) moti on is such an appl icati on. The text of \u00a7 2244( b) shows that, for these purposes, a habeas appl icati on is a ling cont aining one or more \"clai ms.\" Other federa l habeas statutes and this Cour t's decisi ons also make clear that a \"clai m\" is an asser ted fed\u00ad eral basis for relief from a state-cour conviction. If a Rule 60(b) mo\u00ad one or more a \"habeas corpus appl icati on,\" at least enough that to sub\u00ad ject it to AEDP A's restr ictions on successive petiti ons would \"inconsistent with\" the statute .

Upon the State's moti on, Cour t dismissed peti\u00ad tioner 's habeas petiti on as barred by AEDP A's statute of limitations, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( d). Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, petiti oner 's ling deadl ine, absent tolling, was April 23, 1997, one year after AEDP A's statute of limitations took effec t. Wilcox v. Florida Dept. of Corrections, 158 F. 3d 1209, 1211 Cour t con\u00ad cluded that the limitations period was not tolled during the 163-day period while petiti oner 's second moti on was pendi ng. Section 2244( d)(2) tolls the statute of the pendency of \"proper ly led\" appl icati ons only, District Cour t thought peti\u00ad tioner 's moti on was not \"proper ly led\" because it was both untimely and successive . Without tolling, petiti oner 's fed\u00ad eral habeas petiti on was two months late, so the District Cour t dismissed it as time barred. A judge of the Elev\u00ad enth Circuit denied a certicate of appea lability (COA) on April 6, 2000, and petiti oner did not le for rehear ing or re\u00ad view of that decisi on. On November 7, 2000, we held in Artuz v. Benne tt, 531 U. S. 4, that an appl icati on for state postcon viction relief can be \"proper ly led\" even if the state cour ts dismiss it as pro\u00ad cedura lly barred. See id., at 8-9.

The full cour t vacated that order and reheard the case en banc. It granted petiti oner a COA but held, by a vote of 7 to 4, that the District Cour t was correc t to deny his Rule 60(b) moti on.

The mere recit ation of these prov isions shows why we give little weight to respond\u00ad ent's appea l to the virtues of consider\u00ad ation, standi ng alone, ation of a prov ision whose whole purpose is to make an excepti on to nality. The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) itself, or of some other prov ision of law, limits its appl icati on in a manner relevant to the case before us. AEDP A did not expressly circumscr ibe the operati on of Rule 60(b). (By contrast, AEDP A direc tly amended other prov isions of the Federa l Rules. See, e. g., AEDP A, \u00a7 103, 110 Stat. 1218 (amendi ng Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22).) The new habeas restr ictions introduced by AEDP A are made in\u00ad direc tly relevant, howe ver, by the fact that Rule 60(b), like the rest of the Rules of Civil Procedure , appl ies in habeas corpus proceedi ngs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 3 only \"to the that [it with\" appl icable federa l statutory isions U.

Y Opinion of the Cour t been adjudicated in a previous petiti on must be dismissed. \u00a7 2244( b)(1). Second, any claim that has not already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroac tive rule of constituti onal law or new facts show ing a high probabi lity of actual innocence . \u00a7 2244( b)(2). Third, before the distr ict cour t may accept a successive peti\u00ad tion for ling, the cour t of appea ls must deter mine that it presents a claim not previously raised that is sufcient to meet sions limit the appl icati on of Rule 60(b) to the present case. A \"As a textua l matter , \u00a7 2244( b) appl ies only where the cour t acts pursuant to a prisoner 's 'appl icati on' \" for a writ of habeas corpus. Calderon v. Thompso n, 523 U. S. 538, 554 (1998). We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b) mo\u00ad tion led by a \"habeas corpus appl ica\u00ad tion\" as the statute uses that term. Under \u00a7 2244( b), the rst step of analysis is to deter mine whether a \"clai m presented in a second or successive habeas corpus appl icati on\" was also \"presented in a prior appl ica\u00ad tion.\" If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the analysis proceeds to whether the claim satises one of two narrow excepti ons. In either event, it is clear that for purposes of \u00a7 2244( b) an \"appl icati on\" for habeas relief is a ling that con\u00ad tains one or more \"clai ms.\" That denition is consistent with the use of the term \"appl icati on\" in the other habeas statutes in chapter 153 of title 28. See, e. g., Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202, 207 (2003) (for purposes of \u00a7 2254( d), an appl icati on for habeas corpus relief is a ling that seeks \"an adjudicati on on the merits of the petiti oner 's claims\"). These statutes, and our own decisi ons, make clear that a \"clai m\" as used in \u00a7 2244( b) is an asser ted federa l basis for relief from a state cour t's judg ment of conviction. In some instances, a Rule 60(b) moti on will cont ain one or more S. 524 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t asser t that owing to \"excusable neglect,\" Civ. Proc. 60(b)(1), the movant' s petiti on had omitted a claim of constituti onal error , and seek leave to present that claim. Cf. Harris v. United States, 367 F. 3d 74, 80-81 (CA2 2004) (petiti oner 's Rule 60(b) moti on sought relief from judg\u00ad ment because habeas counsel had failed to raise a Sixth Amendment claim). Similarly, a moti on might seek leave to present \"newly discovered evidence ,\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(2), in suppor t of a claim previously denied. E. g., Rod\u00ad well v. Pepe, 324 F. 3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003). Or a moti on might contend that a subsequent change in subst antive law is Proc. 60(b)(6), from previous denia l of a claim. E. g., Dunlap v. Litscher, 301 F. 3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002). Virtually every Cour t of Appea ls to consider the questi on has held that such a pleadi ng, al\u00ad though labeled a Rule subst ance a suc\u00ad on 876. We correc t. A habeas petiti on\u00ad er's ling that seeks vindicati on of such a claim is, if not in subst ance a \"habeas corpus appl icati on,\" at least similar enough that failing to subjec t it to the same requirements would be \"inconsistent with\" the statute . 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254 Rule 11. Using Rule 60(b) to present new claims for relief from a state cour t's judg ment of conviction\u2014 even claims couched in the lang uage of a true Rule 60(b) moti on\u2014 circum\u00ad vents AEDP A's requirement that a new claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of constituti onal law or newly discovered facts. \u00a7 2244( b)(2). The same is true of a Rule 60(b)(2) moti on presenti ng new evidence in suppor t of a claim already litigated: Even assumi ng that reliance on a new factual predicate causes moti on to escape \u00a7 2244( 2244( b)(2)(B ) requires a factual show ing than does Rule 60(b). Likew ise, a Rule 60(b) mo\u00ad tion based change in the subst antive law gov\u00ad erning the claim could v. CROSB Y Opinion of the Cour t dictate that the only new law on which a successive petiti on may rely is \"a new rule of constituti onal law, made retroac\u00ad tive to cases on collatera l review by the Supreme Cour t, that was previously unavai lable .\" In additi on to the subst antive confl ict with AEDP A standards, in each of these three exam\u00ad ples use of Rule 60(b) would imper missibly circumvent the requirement that a successive habeas petiti on be precer tied by the cour t of appea ls as falling within an excepti on to the successive-petiti on bar. \u00a7 2244( b)(3). In most cases, deter mining whether a Rule 60(b) moti on advances one or more \"clai ms\" will be relatively simple . A moti on that seeks to add a new ground for relief, as in Harris, supra, will of course qualify. A moti on can also be said to bring a \"clai m\" if it attacks the federa l cour t's previ\u00ad ous resoluti on of a claim on the merits,4 since alleging that the cour t erred in deny ing habeas relief on the merits is ef\u00ad fectively indisti nguishable from alleging the subst antive prov isions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief. That is not the case , howe ver, when a Rule 60(b) moti on attacks, not the subst ance of the federa l cour t's resoluti on of a claim on the merits, but some defec t in the integr ity of the federa l habeas proceedi ngs.5 4 The term \"on the merits\" has multiple usages. See, e. g., Sem tek Int'l Inc. v. Lockh eed Mar tin Corp., 531 U. S. 497, 501-503 (2001). We refer here to a deter mination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitl ing a petiti oner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254( a) and (d). When a movant asser ts one of those grounds (or asser ts that a previous ruling regardi ng one of those grounds was in error) he is mak ing a habeas corpus claim. He is not doing so when he merely asser ts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits deter mination was in error\u2014for example , a denia l for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedura l defau lt, or statute-of-l imitations bar. 5 Fraud on the federa l habeas cour t is one example of such a defec t. See genera lly Rodr iguez v. Mitchell, 252 F. 3d 191, 199 (CA2 2001) (a witness' s allegedly fraudu lent basis for refusi ng to appear at a federa l habeas hear ing \"relate[ d] to the integr ity of the federa l habeas proceedi ng, not to the integr ity of the state criminal trial\"). We note that an attack based on the movant' s own conduc t, or his habeas counsel' Cite U. S. 524 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t B When no \"clai m\" is presented, there is no basis for con\u00ad tendi ng that the Rule 60(b) moti on shou ld be treated like a habeas corpus appl icati on. If neither the moti on itself nor the federa l judg ment from which it seeks relief subst antively addresses federa l grounds for setti ng aside the movant' s state conviction, allowing the moti on to proceed as denomi\u00ad nated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules. Petitioner 's moti on in the present case , which alleges that the federa l cour ts misappl ied the federa in d), iption.6 Like the Cour t of Appea ls, respondent relies heav ily on our decisi on in Calderon v. Thompso n, 523 U. S. 538 (1998). In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit' s decisi on to reca ll its mandate and reconsider the denia l of Thompson' s rst federa l habeas petiti on; the reca ll was, we held, an abuse of discreti on because of its inconsistency with the policies embodied in AEDP A. Id., at 554-559. Analogizing an ap\u00ad pellate cour t's reca ll of its mandate to a distr ict cour t's grant of relief from judg ment, the Eleventh Circuit thought that Calderon's dispositi on appl ied to Rule 60(b). 366 F. 3d, at 1272 -1277. We think other wise. To begin with, as the opinion said, compl iance with the actual text of AEDP A's e. g., supra, at 530-531, ordinarily does not go to the integr ity of the pro\u00ad ceedi ngs, but in effec t asks for a second chance to have the merits deter\u00ad mined favorably . 6 Petitioner notes that we held in Slack v. McDan iel, 529 U. S. 473 (2000), that when a petiti on is dismissed without prejudice as unexhausted, the reled petiti on is not \"successive .\" He argues that, by parity of rea\u00ad soning, his Rule 60(b) moti on challeng ing the District Cour t dismissa l of his petiti on on statute-of-l imitations grounds is not \"successive .\" If this argument is correc t, petiti oner would be able to le not just a Rule 60(b) moti on, but a full-blown habeas ng afou l of \u00a7 2244( b). But see, e. g., Mur ray v. Greiner, 394 F. 3d 78, 81 (CA2 2005). We need not consider this contenti on, howe ver, because we conclude that petiti on\u00ad er's Rule 60(b) moti on is of the Cour t successive-petiti on prov ision was not at issue in Calderon\u2014 because the Cour t of Appea ls considered only the claims and evidence presented in Thompson' s rst federa l habeas peti\u00ad tion. 523 U. S., at 554. Calderon did state, howe ver, that \"a prisoner 's moti on to reca ll the mandate on the basis of the merits of the under lying decisi on can be regarded as a sec\u00ad ond or successive appl icati on.\" Id., at 553 (emphasis added). But that is entirely consonant with the propositi on that a Rule 60(b) moti on that seeks to revisit the federa l cour t's denia l on the merits of a claim for relief shou ld be treated as a successive habeas petiti on. The problem for respondent is that this case does not present a revisitation of the merits. The moti on here , like some other Rule 60(b) moti ons in \u00a7 2254 cases, con nes itself not only to the rst federa l habeas peti\u00ad tion, but to a nonmer its aspec t of the rst federa l habeas proceedi ng. Nothing in Calderon suggests that enter tain\u00ad ing such a ling is \"inconsistent with\" AEDP A. Rule 60(b) has an unquesti onably valid role to play in ha\u00ad beas cases. The Rule is often used to relieve parties from the effec t of a defau lt judg ment mist akenly entered against them, e. g., Klapprott, 335 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Black, J.), a func tion as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mi ne civil cases. The Rule also preserves parties' oppor tunity to obtain vacatur of a judg ment that is void for lack of subjec t\u00ad matter jurisdic tion\u2014a considerati on just as valid in habeas cases as in any other , since absence of jurisdic tion altogether depr ives a federa l cour t of the power to adjudicate the rights of the parties.

Although we do not decide in this case whether this constr uction of \u00a7 2253 cuit granted petiti oner a COA), the COA requirement appears to be a more plausible and effec tive screeni ng requirement, with sounder basis in the statute , than the near-absolute bar imposed here by the Cour Opinion of the Cour t petiti on. The Eleventh Circuit therefore erred in holdi ng that petiti oner did not qualify even to seek Rule 60(b) relief. III Although the Eleventh Circuit' s reasoni ng is inconsistent with our holdi ng nonetheless afrm oner 's Rule for reopeni ng the judg ment deny\u00ad ing his rst federa l habeas petiti on is that our decisi on in Artuz showed the error of the District Cour t's statute-of\u00ad limitations ruling.

Although the District Cour t relied on Eleventh Circuit precedent holdi ng that a state postcon viction appl icati it is procedura lly defau lted, and although that precedent was at odds with the rule in severa l other Circuits, petiti oner nei\u00ad ther raised that issue in his appl icati on for a COA, nor led a petiti on for rehear ing of the Eleventh Circuit' s denia l of a COA, nor sought certiorar i review of that denia l.10 This lack of diligence conr ms that not an extraordi nary circumst in petiti on\u00ad er's case.

Whether or not petiti oner was aware that the issue was pendi ng before us, see post, at 544-545, n. 7 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng), it is indisput able that had he but led a petiti on raisi ng the statute-of-l imitations argument he now advances, we would surely have granted him the reconsiderati on in light of Artuz v. Benne tt, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), that he later sought in his Rule 60(b) moti on. See, e. g., Brown v. Moore, 532 U.

Acke rmann, 340 U. S., at 195. Some years later , the petiti oner sought Rule 60(b) relief, which the District Cour t denied. We afrmed the denia l of Rule 60(b) relief, noting that the movant' s decisi on not to appea l had been free and volunt ary, although the favorable ruling in the compani on case made it appear mist aken in hindsight. See id., at 198. Under the Rule 60(b) standards that proper ly gover n peti\u00ad tioner 's moti on, the District Cour t was correc t to deny relief. * * * We hold that a Rule 60(b)(6) moti on in a \u00a7 2254 case is not to be treated as a successive habeas petiti on if it does not asser t, or reasser t, claims of error in the movant' s state con\u00ad viction. A moti on that, like petiti oner 's, challenges only the District Cour t's failure to reach the merits does not warrant such treatment, and can therefore be ruled upon by the Dis\u00ad trict Cour t without precer ticati on by of Appea ls pursuant to \u00a7 2244( b)(3).

The most signicant aspec t of on is the Cour t's unani mous rejection of the view that all post judg\u00ad ment moti ons under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) except those alleging fraud under Rule 60(b)(3) shou ld be treated as second or successive habeas corpus petiti ons. Not only do I agree with that holdi ng, I believe that we shou ld have more promptly made clear that the Antiterror\u00ad ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A) and Rule 60(b) can coexist in harmony . See Abdur'Rahm an v. Bell, 537 U. S. 88, 90 (2002) (Stevens, J., dissenti ng from dismissa l of certiorar i granted). As Cour t recog nizes, whether a Rule 60(b) moti on may proceed in the habeas context depends on the nature of the relief the moti on seeks. See ante, at 533.1 Given the sub\u00ad stance of petiti oner 's moti on, I agree with the Cour t that this was a \"true\" Rule 60(b) moti on and that the District Cour t and the Cour t of Appea ls therefore erred in treati ng it as a successive habeas petiti on. And while I also agree with much of the Cour t's reasoni ng in Parts I and II of its opinion, I believe the Cour t goes too far in commenti ng on 1 Under the First Circuit' s usefu l formulation, which was invoked by Judge Tjoflat' s dissenti ng deals primarily with the constituti onality of the under lying state conviction or sentence , then the moti on shou ld be treated as a second or successive habeas petiti on. This situati on shou ld be disti nguished from one in which the moti on's factual predicate deals primarily with some ir\u00ad regularity or procedura l defec t in the procurement of the judg ment deny\u00ad ing relief. That is the classic func tion of a Rule 60(b) moti on, and such a moti on shou ld be treated within the usua l con nes of Rule 60(b).\" Rod\u00ad well v.

See, e. g., ante, at 530-532 (discussi ng various Cour t of Appea ls cases). My main disagreement, howe ver, pertains to Part III of the Cour t's opinion. The Cour t reaches beyond the questi on on which we granted certiorar i (whether petiti oner 's Rule 60(b) moti on shou ld be treated as a successive habeas petiti on) and adjudi\u00ad cates the merits of that moti on. In my judg ment, howe ver, \"correc t procedure requires that the merits of the Rule 60(b) moti on be addressed in the rst instance by the District Cour t.\" Abdur'Rahm an, 537 U.S., at 97 (Stevens, J., dis\u00ad senti ng). A distr ict cour t consider ing a Rule 60(b) moti on will often take into account a variety of factors in additi on to the speci c ground given for reopeni ng the judg ment. These factors include the diligence of the movant, the prob\u00ad able merit of the movant' s under lying claims, the oppos\u00ad ing party's reliance interests in the nality of the judg ment, and other equit able considerati ons. See 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane , Federa l Prac tice that appel late will reverse a distr ict cour t's decisi on only for an abuse of discreti on); Plaut v. Spend thrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. 211, 233-234 (1995) (Rule 60(b) \"reflec ts foundati on of our Republ ic,' to set aside a judg ment whose enforcement would work inequity\"). In light of the equit able, often fact\u00ad intensive nature of the Rule 60(b) inquiry , it is inappropr iate for an appel late cour t to under take it in the rst instance . This is especia lly so in this case , in which both the brieng and the record before us are insufcient with regard to the merits issue . Order ly procedure aside , the Cour t's truncated analysis is unsatisfac tory. At least in some circumst ances, a superven\u00ad ing change in AEDP A procedura l law can be the kind of \"ex\u00ad traordi OPIN 541 Cite U. S. 524 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng 340 U. S. 193, 199 (1950), that constitutes a \"reason justi fying relief from the operati on of the judg ment\" within the mean\u00ad ing of Rule 60(b)(6). In this case , the District Cour t dis\u00ad missed petiti oner 's petiti on as time barred after con\u00ad cludi ng that his second moti on for state postcon viction relief did not toll AEDP A's statute of limitations. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( d). After that judg ment became nal, howe ver, we decided Artuz v. Benne tt, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), which made clear that the District Cour t's ruling on tolling was errone\u00ad ous and that the habeas petiti on shou ld therefore not have been dismissed.2 Unfortunately , the Cour t underesti mates the the fact that petiti oner effec out of federa l cour t\u2014without any adjudicati on of the merits of his claims\u2014 because of a procedura l ruling that was later shown to be flatly mist aken. As we have stressed, \"[d]ismissa l of a rst federa l habeas petiti on is a particularly serious matter , for that dismissa l denies the petiti oner the protec tions of the Great Writ entirely , risking injury to an impor tant interest in human liberty.\" Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S. 314, 324 (1996); see also Slack v. McDan iel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000) (\"The writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protec ting constituti onal rights\"). When a habeas petiti on has been dismissed on a clear ly defec tive procedura l ground, the State can hardly claim a legitimate interest in the nality of that judg ment. Indeed, the State has exper ienced a windfa ll, while the state prisoner has depr ived\u2014 contrary to con\u00ad gressi onal intent \u2014of his valuable right to one full round of federa l habeas review. While this type of superveni ng change in procedura l law may not alone warrant the reopeni ng of a habeas judg ment, there may be specia l factors that allow a prisoner to satisfy 2 Although the State contests this point in a footnote , see Brief for Re\u00ad spondent 40-41, n. 33, the Cour t rightly assumes that the District Cour t's decisi on was incorrec t. See ante, at 536, and n. 8. If any doubt remai ns, it shou ld be resolved by the District Cour t in the instance . 545US2 PAGES Y Stevens, J., dissenti ng the high standard of Rule 60(b)(6). For instance , when a prisoner has shown reasonable diligence in seek ing relief based on a change in procedura l law, and when that prisoner can show that there is probable merit to his under lying claims, it would be well in keepi ng with a distr ict cour t's discreti on under Rule 60(b)(6) for that cour t to reopen the habeas judg ment and give the prisoner the one fair shot at habeas review that Congress intended that he have . After all, we have consistently recog nized that \"pro\u00ad vides cour ts them to vacate judg ments whene ver such action is appropr iate to ac\u00ad compl ish justice .' \" Liljeberg v. Health Services Acqu isi\u00ad tion Corp., 486 U. S. 847, 864 (1988) (quoti ng Klapprott v. United States, 335 U. S. 601, 614-615 (1949)). Here, peti\u00ad tioner , who is serv ing a 99-year term in Flor ida prison, led his Rule 60(b) moti on approxi mately eight months after this decisi on in Artuz. A distr ict cour t could reasonably conclude that this period reveals no lack of diligence on the part of an incarcerated pro se litigant.3 And while we have received scant brieng on the probable merit of his petiti on, his allegati on\u2014that his guilty plea was not know ing and vol\u00ad untary because it was based on grossly inaccurate advice about the actual time he would serve in prison\u2014at least states a colorable claim of a constituti onal violati on. See Finch v. Vaughn, 67 F. 3d 909 (CA11 1995); see also Mabr y v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 504 (1984).4 The Cour t relies on petiti oner 's supposed lack of diligence in pursui ng review of the District Cour t's Whil e Rule 60(b)(6) cont ains no speci c time limitation on ling, it is worth noting that petiti oner led his moti on within the strict 1-year limi\u00ad tation that appl ies to moti ons under Rules 60(b)(1)-(3). 4 It is also worth noting that Artuz v. Benne tt, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), was decided only seven months after petiti oner 's habeas judg ment became nal. In cases where signicant time has elapsed between a habeas judg\u00ad ment and the relevant change in procedura l law, it would be within a distr ict cour t's discreti on to leave U. S. 524 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng limitations ruling. See ante, at 537. In fact, petiti oner did appea l the District Cour t's ruling, which the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals correc tly inter preted as a request for certicate of appea lability (COA).5 As for petiti oner 's failure to seek re\u00ad hear ing or certiorar i, he alleged in his Rule 60(b) moti on, App. 16, and again in his reply brief, that he led a timely petiti on for rehear ing on April 18, 2000, but that the clerk of the Cour t of Appea ls retur ned the moti \"explai n\u00ad ing, erroneously , that his appea l was dismissed and closed on October 28, 1999. \" Reply Brief for Petitioner 13 (emphasis deleted). of a cour t decisi on and was enough to convince a pro se litigant (and some lawyers) that the 90-day window for ling a certiorar i petiti on expired, as well.\" Ibid. The State, howe ver, represents that petiti oner erro\u00ad neously led the petiti on for rehear ing under the case num\u00ad ber of an earlier, dismissed appea l. Brief for Respondent 4. 5 See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 22(b)(2) (\"If no express request for a certi\u00ad cate is led, the notice of [appea l shall be deemed to constitute ] a request addressed to the judges of the cour t of appea ls\"). The procedura l route that petiti oner more compl icated. After the Mag\u00ad istrate Judge initia lly recommended dismissa l of the petiti on as time barred, petiti oner led an objec tion that raised a Third Circuit case , Lovasz v. Vaughn, 134 F. 3d 146 (1998), which was among the circuit cases that were later endorsed by Artuz, 531 U. S., at 8. The Mag istrate' s nal repor t noted that the Eleventh Circuit had not addressed the relevant issue of tolling, and then proceeded to rely (oddly) on Lovasz to deny petiti oner 's claim. In my view, the citation to Lovasz and the Mag is\u00ad trate' s acknowledg ment that there was no Eleventh Circuit precedent on point prov ided a reasonable basis for the granti ng of a COA. In fact, on September 23, 1998, petiti oner led an appl icati on for a COA, and this appl icati on was granted by the District Cour t. The Cour t of Appea ls, howe ver, dismissed petiti oner 's appea l on October 28, 1999, and remanded the COA for a deter mination of which speci c issues merited permissi on to petiti oner led a new appl icati on for a COA, but this time the District Cour t denied the request. Petitioner then led a timely appea l, and the District Cour t granted his moti on to proceed in forma paupe ris on appea l. The Cour t of Appea ls then de\u00ad clined to issue a COA and dismissed the appea l on April 6, 2000. 545US2 Unit:$U70 [03-26-08 18:24:57] PAGES PGT: Y Stevens, J., dissenti ng I do not know how to resolve these allegati ons, but this only highlights the propr iety of a remand. Even on the State's versi on of events, petiti oner 's attempt at ling for rehear ing is proof of diligence on his part. Putti ng these allegati ons aside parsi moni ous. While petiti oner could have shown even greater diligence by seek ing rehear ing for a second time and then ling for certiorar i, we have never held pro se prisoners to the standards of counseled litigants. See, e. g., Haines v. Kerner, 404 U. S. 519 (1972) (per curiam). Indeed, petiti on\u00ad er's situati on contrasts dramatica lly with that of the movant in the case the Cour t relies on, Acke rmann v. United States, 340 U. S. 193 (1950). See ante, at 537-538. In upholdi ng the denia l of Rule 60(b)(6) relief in Acke rmann, the Cour t put great emphasis on the fact that the movant had the bene\u00ad t of paid counsel and that, for much of the relevant period, he was not detained, but rather enjoyed \"freedom of move\u00ad ment and action,\" 340 U. S., at 201.6 In any event, I believe that our rules gover ning prisoner litigati on shou ld favor a policy of repose rather than a policy that encourages multiple lings with a low probabi lity of success.7 6 Acke rmann is further disti nguishable in that it did not involve the sort of plain error of law that has been identi ed in this case. But even if Acke rmann were not disti nguishable , I would nd the views expressed by Justices Black, Frankfur ter, and Doug las in dissent, see 340 U. S., at 202 (opinion of Black, J.), more persuasive than those expressed by Jus\u00ad tice Minton. 7 A petiti on for certiorar i seek ing review of a denia l of a COA has an objec tively low chance of being granted. Such a decisi on is not thought to present a good vehicle for resolv ing legal issues, and error correc tion is a disfavored basis for granti ng review, particularly in noncapit al cases. See genera lly this Cour t's Rule 10. As for the fact that this Cour t granted certiorar i in Artuz eight days after the Eleventh Circuit denied petiti oner a COA, it would be unrea listic to fault petiti oner for failing and coun\u00ad seled litigants are often not aware of our grants of certiorar i on issues that may be relevant to their current business.

In No. 04-79, a girl and her fami ly sought damages from Star-Kist Foods, Inc., in a diversity action. The District Cour t granted Star-Kist summary judg ment, nding that none of the plaintiffs had met the amount-i n-controversy requirement. The First Circuit ruled that the girl, but not her fami ly, had alleged the requisite amount, and then held that supplement al jurisdic tion over the fami ly's claims was improper because original jurisdic tion is lacking in a diversity case if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-i n-controversy requirement. Held: Where the other elements of jurisdic tion are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satises \u00a7 al jurisdic tion over the claims of other plaintiffs in the same Article III case or contro\u00ad versy , even if those claims are for less than the requisite amount. Pp. 552-572. (a) Although distr ict cour ts may not exercise jurisdic tion absent a statutory basis, once a cour t has original jurisdic tion over some claims in an action, it may exercise supplement al jurisdic tion over additi onal claims arising from the same case or controversy .

To deter mine \u00a7 1367' s scope requires exami nation of the statute' s text in light of context, structure , and related statutory prov isions. Section 1367( a) is a broad grant of supplement al jurisdic tion over other claims within the same case or con\u00ad troversy , as long as the action is one in which distr ict cour ts would have original jurisdic tion. Its last sentence makes clear that this grant extends to claims involv ing joinder or interventi on of additi onal parties. The questi on here is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some , but not all, plaintiffs satisfy the amount-i n-controversy require\u00ad ment qualies as a \"civil action Pp. The answer must be yes. When a well-pleaded complai nt has at least one claim satisfy ing the amount-i n-controversy requirement, and there are no other relevant has original jurisdic tion over that claim. A cour t with original jurisdic tion over a single claim in the complai nt has origi\u00ad nal jurisdic tion over a \"civil a), even if that action compr ises fewer claims than were included in the complai nt. Once a cour t has original jurisdic tion over the action, it can then decide whether it has a constituti onal and statutory basis for exercisi ng supple\u00ad ment al jurisdic tion over other claims the action. Section 1367( which cont ains excepti ons to \u00a7 1367( broad rule, does not withdraw supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of the additi onal parties here . In fact, its excepti t this Cour t's conclusi on. Pp. 559-560. (d) The Cour t cannot accept the alternative view, or its suppor ting theor ies, that a distr ict cour t lacks original jurisdic tion over a civil ac\u00ad tion unless it has original jurisdic tion over every claim in the complai nt. The \"indiv isibility theory\"\u2014that all claims must stand or fall as a single, indiv isible action\u2014is inconsistent with the whole notion of supplement al jurisdic tion and is belied by this Cour t's prac offendi instead of the entire action. And the statute' s broad and genera l lan\u00ad guage does not permit the theory to apply in diversity cases when it does not apply in federa l-questi on cases. The \"cont amination theory\"\u2014 that inclusi on of a claim or party falling outside the distr ict . Syllabus nal aminates every other claim in the complai nt\u2014makes sense with respec t to the complete diversity requirement because a non\u00ad diverse party's presence eliminates the justi cati on for a federa l forum. But it makes little sense with regard to the amount-i n-controversy re\u00ad quirement, which is meant to ensure that dispute is sufciently impor\u00ad tant to warrant federa l-cour t attenti on. It is fallacious to suppose , sim\u00ad ply from the propositi on that \u00a7 1332 imposes both requirements, that the cont amination theory germane to the former also appl ies to the latter . This Cour t has already considered and rejected a virtually identica l ar\u00ad gument in the See Chi\u00ad cago v. International of Surgeo ns, 522 U. S. 156. Pp. 560-566. (e) In light of the statute' s text and structure , \u00a7 1367' s only plausible readi ng is that a cour t has original jurisdic tion over a civil action com\u00ad prising the claims for which there is no jurisdic tional defec t. Though a single nondiverse party can cont aminate every other claim in a law\u00ad suit, cont amination does not occur with respec t a)'s threshold requirement is satised in cases, such as these , where some but not all of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufcient amount in controversy . Section 1367 by its plain text over\u00ad ruled Clark and Zahn and author ized supplement al jurisdic tion over all claims by diverse parties arising out of the same case or controversy , subjec t only to ambig uous, this Cour t need ne pret ative tools, includi ng legislative history . Even were it appropr iate to do so, the Cour t would not give the legislative history signicant weight. Pp. 567-571. (g) The Class Action Fairness Act has no impac t on the analysis of these cases.

These consol idated cases present the questi on whether a federa l cour t in a diversity action may exercise supplement al jurisdic tion over additi onal plaintiffs whose claims do not satisfy the minimum amount-i n-controversy requirement, prov ided the claims are part of the same case or controversy as the claims of plaintiffs who do allege a sufcient amount in controversy . Our decisi on turns on the correc t inter pre\u00ad tation of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1367. The questi on has divided the Cour ts of Appea ls, and we granted certiorar i to resolve the confl ict. 543 U. S. 924 (2004). We hold that, where the other elements of jurisdic tion are present and at least one named plaintiff in the action satises the amount-i n-controversy requirement, \u00a7 1367 does author\u00ad ize tion over the claims of other plain\u00ad tiffs in the same Article III case or controversy , even if those claims are for less than the jurisdic tional amount speci ed in the statute setti ng forth the requirements for diversity jurisdic tion.

I In 1991, about 10,000 Exxon dealers led a class-ac tion suit against the Exxon Corporati on in the United States District Cour t for the Norther n District of Flor ida. The dealers al\u00ad leged an intenti onal and systematic scheme by Exxon under which they were overcharged for fuel purchased from Exxon. The plaintiffs invoked the District Cour t's \u00a7 1332( a) diversity jurisdic tion. After a unani mous jury verdic t in favor of the plaintiffs, the District Cour t certied the case for inter locu\u00ad tory review, asking whether it had proper ly exercised \u00a7 1367 supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of class members who did not meet the jurisdic tional minimum amount in controversy . The Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the District Cour t's extensi on of supplement al jurisdic tion to these class members. Allapattah Services, Inc. v. Exxo n Corp., 333 F. 3d 1248 (2003). \"[W]e nd,\" the cour cour ts with ity in diversity class actions to exer\u00ad cise supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of class mem\u00ad bers who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy as long as the distr ict cour t has original jurisdic tion over the claims of at least one of the class represent atives. \" Id., at 1256. This decisi on accords with the views of the Cour ts of Appea ls for the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits. See Rosme r v. Pzer, Inc., 263 F. 3d 110 (CA4 2001); Olden v. LaFarge Corp., 383 F. 3d 495 (CA6 2004); Stro mberg Metal Works, Inc. v.

The Cour ts of Appea ls for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits, adopti ng a similar analysis of the statute , have held that in a diversity class action the unnamed class members need not meet the amount-i n\u00ad controversy requirement, prov ided PGT: OPIN 551 Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t do. These decisi ons, howe ver, are unclear on whether all the named plaintiffs must satisfy this requirement. In re Abbo tt Labs., 51 F. 3d 524 (CA5 1995); Gibson v. Chrysler Corp., 261 F. 3d 927 (CA9 2001). In the other case now before us the Cour t of Appea ls for the First Circuit took a different positi on on the meani ng of \u00a7 1367( a). 370 F. 3d 124 (2004). In that case , a 9-year-old girl sued Star-Kist in a diversity action in the United States District Cour t for the District of Puer to Rico , seek ing dam\u00ad ages for unusua lly severe injuries she received when she sliced her nger on a tuna can. Her fami ly joined in the suit, seek ing damages for emoti onal distress and certain medica l expenses. The District Cour t granted summary judg ment to Star-Kist, nding that none of the plaintiffs met the mini\u00ad mum amount-i n-controve rsy requirement. The Court of Appea ls for the First Circuit, howe ver, ruled that the injured girl, but not her fami ly members, had made allegati ons of damages in the requisite amount. The Cour t of Appea ls then addressed whether , in light of the fact that one plaintiff met the requirements for original jurisdic tion, supplement al jurisdic tion over the remai claims was proper \u00a7 1367. The cour t that \u00a7 1367 al jurisdic tion only distr ict cour t has original jurisdic tion over the action, and that in a diversity case original jurisdic tion is lacking if one plaintiff fails to satisfy the amount-i n-controversy re\u00ad quirement. Although the Cour t of Appea ls claimed to \"ex\u00ad press no view\" on whether the resu lt would be the same in a class action, id., at 143, n. 19, its analysis is inconsistent with that of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit. The Cour t of Appea ls for the First Circuit' s view of \u00a7 1367 is, howe ver, shared by the Cour ts of Appea ls for the Third, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, and the latter two Cour ts of Ap\u00ad peals have expressly appl ied this rule to class actions. See Meritcare, Inc. v. St. Paul Mercur y Ins. Co., 166 F. 3d 214 (CA3 1999); Trimbl e v. Asarco, ATTAH INC . Opinion of the Cour t 2000); Leonhard t v. Western Sugar Co., 160 F. 3d 631 (CA10 1998). II A The distr ict cour ts of the United States, as we have said many times, are \"cour ts of limited jurisdic tion. They pos\u00ad sess Constituti on and stat\u00ad ute,\" Kokko nen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Ame rica, 511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994). In order to prov ide a federa l forum for plaintiffs who seek to vindicate federa l rights, Congress has conferred on the distr ict ts original jurisdic tion in federa cases\u2014 civil actions that arise under the Constituti on, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1331. In order to prov ide a neutra l forum for what have come to be known as diversity cases, Congress also has granted distr ict cour ts original jurisdic tion in civil actions between citizens of different States, between U. S. citizens and foreig n citizens, or by foreig n states against U. S. citi\u00ad zens. \u00a7 1332. To ensure that diversity not flood the federa l minor disputes, \u00a7 1332( a) re\u00ad quires that the matter in controversy in a diversity case ex\u00ad ceed a speci ed amount, currently $75,000. Although ict cour ts may not exercise jurisdic tion absent a statutory basis, it is well established\u2014i n certain classes of cases\u2014that, once a cour t has original jurisdic tion over some claims in the action, it may exercise supplement al jurisdic tion over additi onal claims that are part of the same case or controversy . The leadi ng moder n case for this prin\u00ad ciple is Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U. S. 715 (1966). In Gibbs, the plaintiff alleged the defendant' s conduc t violated both federa l and state law. The District Cour t, Gibbs held, had original jurisdic tion over the action based on the federa l claims. Gibbs conr med that the District Cour t had the ad\u00ad ditional power (though not the obligati on) to exercise supple\u00ad ment al jurisdic tion over related state claims [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) 553 Opinion of the Cour t the same Article III case or controversy . Id., at 725 (\"The federa l claim must have ance sufcient there is power in federa l cour ts to hear the whole\"). As we later noted, the decisi on allowing jurisdic tion over pendent state claims in Gibbs did not menti on, let alone come to grips with, the text of the jurisdic tional statutes and the bedrock principle that federa l cour ts have no jurisdic tion without statutory author ization. Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 548 (1989). In Finley, we nonetheless reaf\u00ad rmed and rationalized Gibbs and its progeny by inferr ing from it the inter pretive principle that, in cases involv ing sup\u00ad plement al jurisdic tion over additi between ly in federa l cour t, the jurisdic tional statutes shou ld be read broadly , on the assumpti on that in this context Con\u00ad gress intended to author ize cour ts to exercise their full Arti\u00ad cle III power to dispose of an \" 'entire action before the cour t [which] compr ises but one constituti onal S., at 549 (quoti ng Gibbs, supra, at 725). We have not, howe ver, appl ied Gibbs' expansive inter pre\u00ad tive approach to other ts of the jurisdic tional statutes. For instance \u00a7 1332 as re\u00ad quiring complete diversity: In a case with multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, the presence in the action of a sin\u00ad gle plaintiff from the same State as a single defendant de\u00ad prives the distr ict cour t of original diversity tion over the entire action. Strawbr idge v. 267 & Erec tion Co. v. Kroge r, 437 U. S. 365, 375 (1978). The complete diversity requirement is not mandated by the Constituti on, State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967), or by the plain text of \u00a7 1332( a). The Cour t, nonetheless, has adhered to the complete diversity rule in light of the purpose of the diversity requirement, which is to prov ide a federa l forum for impor tant disputes where state v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t perceived as favor ing, home-st ate litigants. The presence of parties from the same State on both sides of a case dispels this concer n, eliminating a principa l reason for conferr ing \u00a7 1332 jurisdic tion over any of the claims in the action. See Wisco nsin Dept. of Corrections v. Schach t, 524 U. S. 381, 389 (1998); Newman-G reen, Inc. v. Alfonzo-L arrain, 490 U. S. 826, 829 (1989). The speci c purpose of the complete diver\u00ad sity rule explai ns both why we have not adopted Gibbs' expansive inter pretive approach to this aspec t of the juris\u00ad dictional statute and why Gibbs does not under mine the com\u00ad plete diversity rule. In order for a federa l cour t to invoke supplement al jurisdic tion under Gibbs, it must rst have original jurisdic tion over at least one claim in the action. Incomplete diversity destroys original jurisdic tion with re\u00ad spec t to all claims, so there is noth ing to which supplement al jurisdic tion can adhere . In contrast to the diversity requirement, most of the other statutory prerequisites for federa l jurisdic amount-i n-controversy requirements, can be analyzed claim by claim. True, it does not follow by necessity from this that a distr ict cour t has author ity to ex\u00ad ercise supplement al jurisdic tion over all claims prov ided there is original jurisdic tion over just the en\u00ad actment of \u00a7 1367, the Cour t declined in contexts other than the pendent-clai m instance to follow Gibbs' expansive ap\u00ad proach to pret ation of the The Cour t took a more restr ictive view of the proper inter pret a\u00ad tion these statutes in so-ca involv\u00ad ing lack original jurisdic tion over claims by each of the parties standi ng alone. Thus, with respec tional re\u00ad quirements, the Cour t held in Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939), that every plaintiff must separately satisfy the amount-i n-controversy requirement. Though Clark PGT: OPIN Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) 555 Opinion of the Cour t a federa l-questi on case , at that federa l-questi on juris\u00ad diction had an amount-i n-controversy requirement analogous to the amount-i n-controversy requirement for diversity cases. \"Proper prac tice,\" Clark held, \"requires that where each of severa l plaintiffs is bound to establish the jurisdic\u00ad tional amount with respec t to his own claim, the suit shou ld be dismissed as to those who fail to show that the requisite amount is involved. \" Id., at 590. The Cour t reafr med this rule, in the context of a class action brought invoking \u00a7 1332( a) diversity jurisdic tion, in Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973). It follows \"inescapably\" from Clark, the Cour t held in Zahn, that \"any plaintiff with\u00ad out the jurisdic tional amount must be dismissed from the case , even though others allege jurisdic tionally sufcient claims.\" 414 U. S., at 300. The Cour t took a similar approach with respec t to supple\u00ad ment al jurisdic tion over claims against additi onal defendants that distr ict cour ts' original jurisdic tion. In Aldinge r v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976), the plaintiff brought a Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, action against county ofcia ls in District Cour t pursuant to the statutory grant of jurisdic tion in 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1343(3) (1976 ed.). The plaintiff further alleged the cour t had supplement al jurisdic tion over her related state-law claims against the county , even though the county was not suable under \u00a7 1983 and so was not sub\u00ad \u00a7 1343(3)' s original jurisdic t held that supplement al jurisdic tion could not be exercised because Congress, in enac ting \u00a7 1343(3), had declined (albeit implic\u00ad itly) to extend federa l jurisdic tion over any party who could not be sued under the federa l civil rights statutes. 427 U. S., at 16-19. \"Before it can be federa l cour t must satisfy itself not only that Art[icle ] III permits it, but that Congress in the statutes conferr ing jurisdic tion has not expressly or by implicati on negated its existence .\" Id., at 18. 545US2 Unit:$U71 [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t In Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989), we con\u00ad fronted a similar issue in a different statutory context. The plaintiff in Finley brought a Federa l Tort Claims Act neg\u00ad ligence suit against the Federa l Aviation Administrati on in District Cour t, which had original jurisdic tion under \u00a7 1346( b). The plaintiff tried to add related claims against other defendants, invoking the District Cour t's supplement al jurisdic tion over so-ca lled pendent parties. We held that the District Cour t lacked a sufcient statutory basis for ex\u00ad ercisi ng supplement al jurisdic tion over these claims. Rely\u00ad ing primarily on Zahn, Aldinge r, and Kroge r, we held in Fin\u00ad ley that \"a grant of jurisdic tion over claims involv ing particular parties does not itself confer jurisdic tion over ad\u00ad ditional claims by or against different parties. \" 490 U. S., at 556. While Finley did not \"limit or impair \" Gibbs' libera l approach to inter preti ng the jurisdic tional statutes in the context al jurisdic tion over additi onal claims involv ing the same parties, 490 U. S., at 556, Finley never\u00ad theless declined to extend that inter pretive assumpti on to claims involv ing additi onal parties. Finley held that in the context of parties, in contrast to claims, \"we will not assume that the full constituti onal power has been congressi onally author ized, and will not read jurisdic tional statutes broadly .\" Id., at 549. As the jurisdic tional statutes existed in 1989, then, here is how matters stood: First, the diversity requirement in \u00a7 1332( a) required complete diversity; absent complete diver\u00ad distr ict cour t lacked original jurisdic tion over all of the claims in the action. Strawbr idge, 3 Cranch, at 267-268; Kroge r, 437 U. S., at 373-374. Second, if the distr ict cour t had original jurisdic tion over at least one claim, the jurisdic\u00ad tional statutes implicitly author ized supplement al jurisdic\u00ad tion over all other claims between the same parties arising out of the same Article III case or controversy . Gibbs, 383 U. S., at 725. Third, even when the distr ict cour Cite U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t nal jurisdic tion over one or more claims between particular parties, the jurisdic tional statutes did not author ize supple\u00ad ment al jurisdic tion over additi onal claims involv ing other parties. 306 U. S., at 590; Zahn, supra, at 300-301; Finley, supra, at 556. B In Finley we emphasi zed that \"[w]hate ver we say regard\u00ad ing the scope of jurisdic tion conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by Congress. \" 490 U. S., at 556. In 1990, Congress accepted the invitation. It passed the Judicia l Improvements Act, 104 Stat. 5089, which enac ted \u00a7 1367, the tions (b) and (c) or as expressly prov ided other wise by Federa l statute , in any civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original jurisdic tion, shall have supplement al jurisdic tion over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdic tion that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constituti on. Such supplement al jurisdic tion shall include claims that in\u00ad volve interventi on of additi onal parties. \"(b) In any civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original jurisdic tion founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the distr ict cour ts have supplemen\u00ad tal tion (a) over claims by plain\u00ad tiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federa l Rules of Civil Procedure , or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seek ing to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercisi ng supplement al jurisdic tion over such claims would be in\u00ad consistent with v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t All parties to this litigati on and all cour ts to consider the questi on agree that \u00a7 1367 over turned the resu lt in Finley. There is no warrant, howe ver, for assumi ng that \u00a7 1367 did no more than to overr ule Finley and other wise to codify the existi ng state of the law of supplement al jurisdic tion. We must not give jurisdic tional statutes a more expansive inter\u00ad pret ation than their text warrants, 490 U. S., at 549, 556; but it is just as impor tant not to adopt an articial constr uction that is narrower than what the text prov ides. No sound canon of inter pret ation requires Congress to speak with ex\u00ad traordi nary clarity in order to modi fy statutory constr uction apply . In order to deter mine the scope of supplement al jurisdic tion author ized by \u00a7 1367, then, we must exami ne the statute' s text in light of context, structure , and related statutory prov isions. Section 1367( a) is a broad grant of supplement al jurisdic\u00ad tion over other claims within the same case or controversy , as long as the action is one in which the distr ict cour ts would have original jurisdic tion. The last sentence of \u00a7 1367( a) makes it clear that the grant of supplement al jurisdic tion extends to claims involv ing joinder or interventi on of addi\u00ad tional parties. The single questi on before us, therefore , is whether a diversity case in which the claims of some plain\u00ad tiffs satisfy the amount-i n-controversy requirement, but the claims of other plaintiffs do not, presents a \"civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original jurisdic tion.\" If the answer is yes, \u00a7 1367( a) confers supplement al jurisdic tion over all claims, includi ng those that do not independently satisfy the amount-i n-controversy requirement, if the claims are part of the same Article III case or controversy . If the answer is no, \u00a7 1367( a) is inappl icable and, in light of our hold\u00ad ings in Clark and Zahn, the distr ict cour t has no statutory basis for exercisi ng supplement Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t We now conclude the answer must be yes. When the well-pleaded complai nt cont ains at least one claim that satis\u00ad es the amount-i n-controversy requirement, and there are no relevant jurisdic tional defec ts, the distr ict questi on, has original jurisdic tion over that claim. The presence of other claims in the complai nt, over which the distr ict cour t may lack original jurisdic tion, is of no mo\u00ad ment. If the cour t has original jurisdic tion over a single claim in the complai nt, it has original jurisdic tion over within the meani ng of \u00a7 1367( a), even if the civil action over which it has jurisdic tion compr ises fewer claims than were included in the complai nt. Once the cour t deter\u00ad mines it has original jurisdic tion over the civil action, it can turn to the questi on whether it has a constituti onal and basis for exercisi ng supplement al jurisdic tion over the other claims in the action. Section 1367( a) commences with the direc tion that \u00a7\u00a7 1367( b) and (c), or other relevant statutes, may prov ide speci c excepti ons, but other wise \u00a7 1367( a) is a broad juris\u00ad dictional grant, with no disti nction drawn between pendent\u00ad claim and pendent-par ty cases. In fact, the last sentence of \u00a7 1367( a) makes clear that the prov ision grants supplement al jurisdic tion over joinder or interventi additi onal parties. The terms of \u00a7 has recog nized that the doctrines are \"two species of the same gener ic problem, \" Kroge r, 437 U. S., at 370. Nothing in \u00a7 1367 indicates a con\u00ad gressi onal labeled pendent and ancillary. If \u00a7 1367( a) were the sum total of the relevant statutory lang uage , our holdi ng would 21:06:40] v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t The statute , of course , instructs us to exami ne \u00a7 1367( b) to deter mine if any of its excepti ons apply , so we proceed to that section. While \u00a7 1367( b) qualies the broad rule of \u00a7 1367( a), it does not withdraw supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of the additi onal parties at issue here . The \u00a7 1367( a) confers supplement al jurisdic tion over these claims. Section 1367( b), which appl ies only to diversity cases, with\u00ad holds supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of plaintiffs proposed to be joined as indispensable parties under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 19, or who seek to intervene pursu\u00ad ant to Rule 24. Nothing in the text of \u00a7 1367( b), howe ver, withholds supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of plain\u00ad tiffs permissively joined under Rule 20 (like the additi No. 04-79) or certied as class-ac bers pursuant to 23 (like the additi onal plaintiffs in No. 04-70). The natura l, indeed the necessary , inference is that \u00a7 1367 confers supplement al jurisdic tion over claims by Rule 20 and Rule 23 plaintiffs. This inference , at least with respec t to Rule 20 plaintiffs, is streng thened by the fact that \u00a7 1367( b) expl icitly excludes supplement al jurisdic tion over claims against defendants joined under Rule 20. We cannot accept the view, urged by some of the parties, comment ators, and Cour ts of Appea ls, that a distr ict cour t lacks original jurisdic tion over a civil action unless the cour t has original jurisdic tion over every claim in the complai nt. As we underst and this positi on, it requires assumi ng either that all claims in the complai nt must stand or fall as a single, indiv isible \"civil action\" as a matter of denitional will refer to as the \"indiv isibility theory\"\u2014or else that the inclusi on of a claim or party falling outside the distr ict cour t's original jurisdic tion somehow cont in the depr iving the cour t of original jurisdic tion over any of these claims\u2014what we will refer to as the \"cont Cite U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The indiv isibility theory is easily dismissed, as it is incon\u00ad sistent with the whole notion of supplement al jurisdic tion. If a distr ict cour t must have original jurisdic tion over every claim in the complai nt in order to have \"original jurisdic tion\" over a \"civil action,\" then in Gibbs there was no civil action of which the distr ict cour t could assume original jurisdic tion under \u00a7 1331, and so ng supplement al ju\u00ad risdic tion over any of the claims. The indiv isibility theory is further belied by our prac tice\u2014in both federa l-questi on and dismissi ng the entire action. Clark, for example , makes clear that claims that are jurisdic tionally defec tive as to amount in controversy do not destroy original jurisdic tion over other claims. 306 U. S., at 590 (dismissi ng parties who failed to meet the amount-i n-controversy requirement but retaining jurisdic tion over the remai ning party). If the presence of jurisdic tionally problematic claims in the com\u00ad plaint meant the distr ict cour t was without original jurisdic\u00ad tion over the single, indiv isible civil action before it, then the distr ict cour t would have to dismiss the whole action rather than particular parties. We also nd it uncon vincing to say that the denitional indiv isibility theory appl ies in the context of diversity cases but not in the context of federa l-questi on cases. The broad and genera l lang uage of the statute does not permit this re\u00ad sult. The contenti on is premised on the notion that the phrase \"original jurisdic tion of all civil actions\" means differ\u00ad ent in \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332. It is implausible , howe ver, to say that the identica l phrase means one thing (original jurisdic tion in all actions where at least one claim in the com\u00ad plaint meets the following requirements) in \u00a7 1331 and some\u00ad thing else (original jurisdic tion in all actions where every claim in the complai nt meets the following requirements) v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t The cont amination theory , as we have noted, can make some sense in the specia l context of the complete diversity requirement because the presence of nondiverse parties on both sides of a lawsuit eliminates the justi cati on for prov id\u00ad ing a federa l forum. The theory , howe ver, makes little sense with respec t to the amount-i n-controversy require\u00ad ment, which is meant to ensure that a dispute is sufciently impor tant to warrant federa l-cour t attenti on. The presence of a single nondiverse party may eliminate the fear of bias with respec t to all claims, but the presence of a claim that falls shor t of the minimum amount in controversy does noth\u00ad ing to reduce the impor tance of the claims that do meet this requirement. It is fallacious to suppose , simply from the propositi on that \u00a7 1332 imposes both the diversity requirement and the amount-i n-controversy requirement, that the cont amination theory germane to the former is also relevant to the latter . There is no inherent logical connec tion between in-controversy once had an amount-i n-controversy requirement as well. If such a re\u00ad quirement were revived under \u00a7 1331, it is per\u00ad adventure l-questi on cases where some , but not all, of the federa l-law claims involve a sufcient amount in controversy the hold\u00ad ing and the resu lt in Clark. If that is so, howe ver, it would be quite extraordi nary to say that \u00a7 1367 did not also over\u00ad rule Zahn, a case that was premised in subst antia l part on the holdi ng in Clark. In additi on to the theoretica l difcu lties with the argu\u00ad ment that a distr ict cour t has original jurisdic tion over a civil action only if it has original jurisdic tion over each indi\u00ad vidua l claim in the complai nt, we have already considered and rejected a virtually identica l argument in the closely analogous context of remova l jurisdic tion. OPIN 563 Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ternational College of Surgeo ns, 522 U. S. 156 (1997), the plaintiff brought federa l-and state-law claims in state cour t. The defendant removed to federa l cour t. The plaintiff ob\u00ad jected to remova l, citing the text of the remova l statute , \u00a7 1441( a).

Once the case was re\u00ad moved, the District Cour t had original jurisdic tion over the federa and supplement tion under \u00a7 1367( a) over the state-law claims. Id., at 165. The dissent in College of Surgeo ns argued that because the plaintiff sought on-the-record review of a local admi nis\u00ad trative agency decisi on, the review it sought was outside the scope of the District Cour t's jurisdic tion. Id., at 177 (opin\u00ad ion of Ginsburg, J.). We rejected both the suggesti on that state-law claims involv ing admi nistrative appea ls are scope \u00a7 1367 supplement al jurisdic tion, id., at 168-172 (opinion of the Cour t), and the claim that the admi nistrative review posture of the case depr ived the District Cour t of original jurisdic tion over the federa l-law claims in the case , id., at 163-168. More impor tantly for present purposes, College of Surgeo ns stressed that a distr ict cour t has origi\u00ad nal jurisdic tion of a civil action for purposes of \u00a7 1441( a) as long as it has original jurisdic tion over a subset of the claims constituti ng the action. Even the ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t sent, which took issue with the Cour t's inter pret ation of \u00a7 1367, did not appear to contest this view of \u00a7 1441( a). Although College of Surgeo ns involved additi onal claims between the same parties, its inter pret ation of \u00a7 1441( a) involv ing additi onal parties whose claims fall shor t of the jurisdic tional amount. If we were to adopt the contrary view that the presence of additi onal par\u00ad ties means there is no those cases simply would not be removable . To our knowledge , no cour t has issued a reasoned opinion adopti ng this view of the remova l statute . It is settled, of course , that absent complete diver\u00ad sity a case is not removable because the distr ict cour t would lack original jurisdic tion. Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 73 (1996). This, howe ver, is altogether consist\u00ad ent with our view of \u00a7 1441( a). A failure of complete diver\u00ad sity, unlike the failure of some claims to meet the requi\u00ad site amount in controversy , cont aminates every claim in the action. We also reject the argument, similar to the attempted dis\u00ad tinction of College of Surgeo ns discussed above , that while the presence of additi onal claims over which the distr ict cour t lacks jurisdic tion does not mean the civil action is out\u00ad side the purv iew of \u00a7 1367( a), the presence of additi onal par\u00ad ties does. The basis for this disti nction is not altogether clear , and it is in considerable tensi on with statutory text. Section 1367( a) appl ies by its terms to any civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original jurisdic tion, and the last sentence of \u00a7 1367( a) expressly contemplates that the cour t may have supplement al jurisdic tion over additi onal parties. So it cannot be the case that the presence of those parties destroys the cour t's original jurisdic tion, within the meani ng of \u00a7 1367( a), over a civil action other wise proper ly before it. Also , \u00a7 1367( b) expressly withholds supplement al jurisdic tion in diversity cases over claims by plaintiffs joined as indispensable parties under Rule 19. If joinder of such Cite U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t parties were sufcient to depr ive the distr ict cour t of origi\u00ad nal jurisdic tion over civil action within the meani ng of \u00a7 1367( a), this speci supplement al jurisdic tion in \u00a7 1367( b) would be super fluous. The argument that the presence of additi onal parties removes the civil action from the scope of \u00a7 1367( a) also would mean that \u00a7 1367 left the Finley resu lt undisturbed. Finley, after all, involved a Fed\u00ad eral Tort Claims Act suit against a federa l defendant and state-law claims against additi onal defendants not other wise subjec t to federa l jurisdic tion. Yet all concede that one pur\u00ad pose of \u00a7 1367 was to change the resu lt reached in Finley. Finally, it is suggested that our inter pret ation of \u00a7 1367( a) creates an ons listed in \u00a7 1367( b): It is not immediately obvious why Congress would withhold supplement al jurisdic tion over plaintiffs joined as parties \"needed for just adjudicati on\" under Rule 19 but would allow supplement al jurisdic tion over plaintiffs permis\u00ad sively joined under Rule 20. The omissi on of Rule 20 plain\u00ad tiffs from the list of excepti ons in \u00a7 1367( b) may have been an \"unintenti onal draf ting gap, \" Meritcare, 166 F. 3d, at 221, and n. 6. If that is the case , it is up to Congress rather than the cour ts to x it. The omissi on may seem odd, but it is not absurd. An alternative explanati on for the different treatment of Rules 19 and 20 is that Congress was concer ned that extendi ng supplement al jurisdic tion to Rule 19 plaintiffs would allow circumventi on of the complete diversity rule: A nondiverse plaintiff might be omitted intenti onally from the original action, but joined later under Rule 19 as a necessary party. See Stro mberg Metal Works, 77 F. 3d, at 932. The theory descr means this ruse would fail, but Congress may have wanted to make assurance double sure . More genera lly, Congress may have concluded that federa l jurisdic tion is only appropr iate if ict cour t would have original jurisdic tion over the claims of all those plaintiffs who are so essentia l to the action that they could be joined under Rule 19. 545US2 Unit:$U71 [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t To the extent that the omissi on of Rule 20 plaintiffs from the list of \u00a7 1367( b) excepti ons is anoma lous, moreover is no more anoma lous than the inclusi on of Rule 19 plaintiffs in that list would be if the alternative view of \u00a7 1367( a) were to prevail. If the distr ict cour t lacks original jurisdic tion over a civil diversity action where any plaintiff's claims fail to comply with all the requirements of \u00a7 1332, there is no need for a specia l \u00a7 1367( b) excepti on for Rule 19 plaintiffs who do not meet these requirements. Though the omissi on of Rule 20 plaintiffs from \u00a7 1367( b) presents someth ing of a puzzle on our view of the statute , the inclusi on of Rule 19 plaintiffs in this section is at least as difcu lt to explai n under the alternative view. And so we circle back to the original questi on. When the well-pleaded complai nt in distr ict cour t includes multiple claims, all part of the same case or controversy , and some , but not all, of the claims are within the cour t's original juris\u00ad diction, does the cour t have before it \"any civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original jurisdic tion\"? It the cour t original jurisdic tion over the civil action compr ising the claims for which there is no jurisdic defec t. No other readi ng of \u00a7 1367 is plausible in light of the text and structure of the jurisdic tional statute . Though the specia l nature and purpose of the diversity re\u00ad quirement mean that a single nondiverse party can cont ami\u00ad nate every other claim in the lawsuit, the cont amination does not occur with respec t to jurisdic tance of indiv idua l claims. It follows from this conclusi on that the threshold require\u00ad ment of \u00a7 1367( a) is satised in cases, like those now before us, where some , but not all, of the plaintiffs in a diversity action allege a sufcient amount in controversy . We hold that \u00a7 1367 by its plain text overr uled Clark and Zahn and author ized supplement al jurisdic tion over all claims by di\u00ad verse parties arising out of the same Article III case or con\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U71 [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN 567 Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t troversy , subjec t only to enumerated excepti ons not appl ica\u00ad ble in the cases now before us. C The proponents of the alternative view of \u00a7 1367 insist that the statute is at least ambig uous and that we shou ld look to other inter pretive tools, includi ng the legislative history of \u00a7 1367, which supposedly demonstrate Congress did not in\u00ad tend \u00a7 1367 to overr ule Zahn. We can reject this argument at the very outset simply because \u00a7 1367 is not ambig uous. For inter 1367 to fore\u00ad close supplement al jurisdic tion over plaintiffs in diversity cases who do not meet the minimum amount in controversy is inconsistent with the text, read in light of other statutory prov isions and our established jurisprudence . Even if we were to stipu late, howe ver, that the readi ng these propo\u00ad nents urge upon us is textua lly plausible , the legislative his\u00ad tory cited to suppor t it would not alter our view as to the best inter pret ation of \u00a7 1367. Those who urge that the legislative history refutes our inter pret ation rely primarily on the House Judiciary Com\u00ad mittee Repor t on the Judicia l Improvements Act. H. R. Rep. No. 101-734 (1990) (House Repor t or Repor t). This Repor \u00a7 1367 would \"author ize jurisdic tion in a case like Finley, as well as essentia lly restore the pre- Finley underst andi ngs of the author ization for and limits on other forms of supplement al jurisdic tion.\" Id., at 28. The Repor t stated that a) \"genera lly t to exercise jurisdic tion over a supplement al claim whene ver it forms part of the same constituti onal case or controversy as the claim or claims that prov ide the basis of the distr ict cour t's original jurisdic tion,\" and in so doing cod\u00ad ies Gibbs and lls the statutory gap recog nized in Finley. House Repor t, at 28-29, and n. 15. The Repor t then remarked that \u00a7 1367( b) \"is not intended to affec ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t actions, as those requirements were inter preted prior to Finley,\" citing, without further elaborati on, Zahn and Su\u00ad preme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Caubl e, 255 U. S. 356 (1921). House Repor t, at 29, and n. 17. The Repor t noted that the \"net effec t\" of \u00a7 b) l ra\u00ad tionale\" of Kroge r, House Repor t, at 29, and n. 16, effec ting only \"one small change\" in would exclude \"Rule 23(a) plaintiff-intervenors to the same extent as those sought to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19.\" House Repor t, at 29. (It is evident that the repor t here meant to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23.) As we have repeatedly held, the author itative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history or any other extr insic mater ial. Extrinsic mater ials have a role in statu\u00ad tory inter pret ation only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enac ting Legislature' s underst andi insic mater ials are reli\u00ad able sources of insight into legislative underst andi ngs, how\u00ad ever, and legislative history in particular is vulnerable to two serious criticisms. First, legislative history is itself often murky , ambig uous, and contradic tory. Judicia l investigati on of legislative history has a tendency to become , to borrow Judge Leventha l's memorable phrase , an exercise in \" 'look\u00ad ing over a crowd and picking out your friends. ' \" See Wald, Some Observati ons on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Cour t Term, 68 Iowa L. Rev. 195, 214 (1983). Second, judicia l reliance on legislative mater ials like commit\u00ad tee repor ts, which are not themselves subjec t to the require\u00ad ments of Article I, may give unrepresent ative committee members\u2014or , worse yet, unelec ted staffers and lobby ists\u2014 both the power and the incentive to attempt strateg ic manip\u00ad ulations of legislative history to secure resu lts they were un\u00ad able to achieve through the statutory text. We need not comment here on whether these problems are sufciently prevalent to render legislative history 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t in all circumst ances, a point on which Members of this Cour t have disagreed. It is clear , howe ver, that in this instance both criticisms are right on the mark. First of all, the legislative history of \u00a7 1367 is far murk ier than selec the text of \u00a7 1367 based on l cont ained in a Federa l Cour t Study Committee work ing paper , which was draf ted by a Subcommittee chaired by Judge Posner . Repor t of the Subcommittee on the Role of the Federa l Cour ts and Their Relati onsh ip States (Mar . 12, 1990), repr inted in 1 Judicia l Conference of the Federa l Cour ts Study Com\u00ad mittee , Working Papers and Subcommittee Repor ts (July 1, 1990) (Subcommittee Working Paper). See also Judicia l Conference of the United States, Repor t of the Federa l Cour ts Study mittee Repor ng, brief summary form, the Subcom\u00ad mittee Working Paper proposa l and noting mittee Working Paper ains at 27 (\"[Sec tion recommendati on of the Federa l Cour ts Study Committee found on pages 47 and 48 of its Repor t\"). While the Sub\u00ad committee explai ned, in lang uage echoed by the House Re\u00ad port, that its proposa l \"basica lly restores the law as it ex\u00ad isted prior to Finley,\" Subcommittee Working Paper , at 561, it observed in a footnote that its proposa l would overr ule Zahn and that this would be a good idea, Subcommittee Working Paper , at 561, n. 33. Although the Federa l Cour ts Study Committee did not expressly adopt the Subcommit\u00ad tee's speci c reference to Zahn, it neither expl icitly dis\u00ad agreed with the Subcommittee' s conclusi on that this was the best readi ng of the proposed text nor subst antia lly modi ed the proposa l to avoid this resu lt. Study Committee Repor t, at 47-48. Therefore , even if the House Repor t could fairly be read to reflec t an underst andi ng that the text of \u00a7 1367 did not overr ule Zahn, the Subcommittee on 545US2 Unit:$U71 [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES v. ALLAP ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Opinion of the Cour t which \u00a7 1367 was based reflec ted the opposite underst andi ng. The House Repor t is no more author itative than the Subcom\u00ad mittee Working Paper . The utility of either can extend no further than the light it sheds on how the enac ting Legisla\u00ad ture understood the statutory text. Trying to gure out how to square the Subcommittee Working Paper 's under\u00ad standi ng with the House Repor ng of the enac ting legisla\u00ad tors, is a hopeless task. Second, the worst fears of critics who argue legislative his\u00ad tory will be used to circumvent the Article I process were realized in this case. The telltale evidence is the statement, by three law professors who participated in draf ting \u00a7 1367, see House Repor t, at over claims of class members that do not satisfy section 1332' s jurisdic tional amount re\u00ad claimer of intent to accompl ish this resu lt in the legislative history .... It would have been better had the statute dealt expl icitly with this problem, and the legislative history was an attempt to correc t the oversight. \" Rowe , Burbank, & Meng ler, Compoundi ng or on About Supple\u00ad ment al Jurisdic tion? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991). The professors were frank to concede that if one refuses to consider the legislative history , one has no choice but to \"conclude that section 1367 has wiped Zahn off the books. \" Ibid. So there exists an ac\u00ad knowledg ment, by parties who have detailed, speci c knowl\u00ad edge of the statute and the draf ting process, both that the plain text of \u00a7 1367 overr uled Zahn and that lang uage to the contrary in the House Repor t was a post hoc attempt to alter that resu lt. One need not subscr ibe to the wholesa le con\u00ad demnati on of legislative history to refuse to give any effec t to such a deliberate effor t to amend a statute through a Cite as: 545 U. S. 546 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t In sum, even if we believed resor t to legislative history were appropr iate in these cases\u2014a point we do not con\u00ad cede \u2014we would not give signicant weight to the House Re\u00ad port. The disti nguished jurists who draf ted the Subcommit\u00ad tee Working Paper , along with three of the participants in the draf ting of \u00a7 1367, agree that this prov ision, on its face, overr ules Zahn. This accords with the best readi ng of the statute' s text, and noth ing in the legislative history indicates direc tly and expl icitly that Congress understood the phrase \"civil action of which the distr ict cour ts have original ju\u00ad risdic tion\" to exclude cases in which some but not all of the diversity plaintiffs meet the amount-i n-co ntroversy requirement. No credence , moreover , can be given to the claim that, if Congress understood \u00a7 1367 to overr ule Zahn, the proposa l would have been more controversia l. We have little sense whether any Member of Congress would have been particu\u00ad larly upset by this resu lt. This is not a case where one can plausibly say that concer ned legislators might not have real\u00ad ized the possible effec t of the text they were adopti ng. Cer\u00ad tainly, any competent legislative aide who studied the matter would have flagged this issue if it were a matter of impor\u00ad tance to his or her boss, especia lly in light of the Subcommit\u00ad tee Working Paper . There are any number of reasons why legislators did not spend more time arguing over \u00a7 1367, none of which are relevant to our inter pret ation of what the words of the statute mean. D Finally, we note that the Class Action Fairness Act (CAF A), Pub. L. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4, enac ted this year , has no bear ing on our analysis of these cases. Subjec t to certain limitations, the CAF A confers federa l diversity jurisdic tion over class actions where the aggregate amount in contro\u00ad versy exceeds $5 million. It abrogates the rule against ng a Cour t recog nized in Ben-Hur and reafr med in Zahn. The CAF A, howe ver, is not retro\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U71 [03-26-08 21:06:40] PAGES ATTAH SER VICES, INC .

The CAF A, moreover , does not moot the signicance of our inter pret ation of \u00a7 1367, as many proposed exercises of supplement al jurisdic tion, even in the class-ac tion context, might not fall within the CAF A's ambit. The CAF A, then, has no impac t, one way or the other , on our inter pret ation of \u00a7 1367. * * * The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Eleventh Circuit is afrmed.

Because ambi\u00ad guity is apparently in the eye of the beholder , I remai n con\u00ad vinced that it is unw ise to treat the ambig uity vel non of a statute as deter minative of whether legislative history is consu lted.

In accord with case law, proh ibits the joinder or interventi on of persons or plaintiffs if addi ng them is inconsistent with section 1332' s requirements. The section is not intended to af\u00ad fect the jurisdic tional requirements of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332 in diversity-only class actions, as those requirements were inter preted prior to Finley. [Footnote 17: 'See Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Caubl e, 255 U. S. 356 (1921); Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973)'. ] \"Subsec tion (b) makes prac tice.

No. 101-734, pp. 28-29 (1990) (footnote (herei n\u00ad after House Repor t or Repor t).1 Not only does the House Repor t speci cally say that \u00a7 1367 was not intended to upset Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973), but its entire explanati on of the statute demonstrates that Congress had in mind a very speci c and relatively modest task\u2014undoi ng this Cour t's 5-to-4 decisi on in Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545 (1989). In additi on to over turning that unfor underst andi ngs of the author ization 1 The last quoted paragraph was intended to refer to Rule 24, not Rule 23. See ante, at 568. 2 As I pointed out in my dissent in Finley, the major ity's decisi on was \"not faith ful to our precedents, \" 490 U. S., at 558, and casua lly dismissed the accumu lated wisdom of judges such as Henry Friendly , who had \"spe\u00ad cial learning and exper tise 575 U. S. 546 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng for and limits on other forms of supplement al jurisdic tion,\" House Repor t, at 28, with the excepti on of mak ing \"one small change in pre-Finley prac tice,\" id., at 29, is not rele\u00ad here . The sweepi ng purpose that the Cour t's decisi on imputes to Congress bears no resemblance to the House Repor t's de\u00ad scription of the statute . But this does not seem to trouble the Cour t, for its decisi on today treats statutory inter pret a\u00ad tion as a pedantic exercise , at\u00ad tempt at ascer taining congressi onal intent. Of course , there are situati ons in which we do not honor Congress' apparent intent unless that intent is made \"clear \" in the text of a stat\u00ad ute\u2014in this way, we can be certain that Congress considered the issue and intended a disfavored outcome , see, e. g., Land\u00ad graf v. USI Film Produc ts, 511 U. S. 244 (1994) (requir ing clear statement for retroac tive civil legislati on). But that principle prov ides no basis for discounti ng the House Repor t, given that our cases have never recog nized a presumpti on in favor of expansive diversity jurisdic tion. The Cour t's reasons for ignoring this virtual billboard of congressi onal intent are unpersuasive . That a subcommit\u00ad tee of the Federa l Cour ts Study Committee believed that an earlier, subst antia lly similar versi on of the statute overr uled Zahn, see ante, at 569, only highlights the fact that the stat\u00ad ute is ambig uous. What is deter minative is that the House Repor t expl icitly rejected that broad readi ng of the statu\u00ad tory text. Such a repor t has specia l signicance as an indi\u00ad cator of legislative intent. In Congress, committee repor ts are normally considered the author itative expl icati on of a statute' s text and purposes, and busy legislators and their assist ants rely on that expl icati on in casti ng their votes. Cf. Garc ia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70, 76 (1984) (\"In sur\u00ad veying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the author itative source for nding the Legislature' s intent lies in the Committee Repor ts on the bill, which 'represen[ t] the ATTAH SER VICES, INC . Stevens, J., dissenti ng men involved in draf ting study ing proposed legislati on' \" (quoti ng Zube r v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168, 186 (1969); brackets in original)). The Cour t's second reason\u2014its comment on the three law professors who participated in draf ting \u00a7 1367, see ante, at 570\u2014is similarly off the mark. In the law review article that the Cour t refers to, the professors were merely saying that the text of the statute was susceptible to an over ly broad (and simplistic) readi ng, and that claricati on in the House Repor t was therefore appropr iate. See Rowe , Confusi on About Supplement al Jurisdic tion? A Reply to Professor Freer, 40 Emory L. J. 943, 960, n. 90 (1991).3 Signicantly , the reference to Zahn in the House Repor t does not at all appear to be tacked on or out of place; indeed, it is whol ly consistent with the Repor t's broader explanati on of Con\u00ad gress' goal of overr uling Finley and preserv ing pre-Finley law. To suggest that these professors participated in a \"de\u00ad liberate effor t to amend a statute through a committee re\u00ad port,\" ante, at 570, reveals an unrea listic view of the legis\u00ad lative process, not to menti on disrespec t for three law professors who acted in the role of publ ic servants. To be sure , legislative history can be manipu lated. But, in the sit\u00ad 3 The professors' account of the challenges they faced in draf ting \u00a7 1367 gives some sense , I think, of why that statute has proved difcu lt to inter\u00ad pret: \"More broadly , codifying a complex area like supplement al jurisdic\u00ad tion\u2014as Professor Freer 's discussi on illustrates\u2014is itself complex busi\u00ad ness. A danger is that the resu lt of the effor t to deal with all the foreseeables will be a statute too prolix and baroque for everyday use and appl icati and prov ide without overdoi ng it. The statute is concededly not perfect. What it accompl ishes, howe ver, is to change the direc tion taken by the Supreme Cour t in Finley, to prov ide basic guidance (in par\u00ad ticular the legislative history' s genera l approva l of pre-Finley case law, which has treated some speci c issues Professor Freer raises), and then to trust the federa l cour ts under the changed direc tion to inter pret the statute sensibl y.... \" 40 Emory L.

After near ly 20 pages of compl icated analysis, which ex\u00ad plores subtle doctrinal nuances and coins various neolog isms, the Cour t announces that \u00a7 1367 could not reasonably be read another way. See ante, at 567. That conclusi on is difcu lt to accept. Given Justice Ginsburg' s persuasive account of the statutory text and its jurisprudentia l backdrop, and given the uncommonly clear legislative history , I am con\u00ad dent that the major ity's inter 1367 is mist aken.

S. 39, 40 (1911)), and Zahn v. International Paper Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973). Clark held that, when federa l-cour t jurisdic tion is predicated on a speci ed amount in contro\u00ad versy , each plaintiff joined in the litigati on must independ\u00ad ently meet the jurisdic tional amount requirement. Zahn conr med that in class actions gover ned by Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), [class member ]... must sat\u00ad isfy the jurisdic tional amount, and any [class member ] who does not must be dismissed from the case.\" 414 U.

She alleged that the Federa l Aviation Administra\u00ad tion's negligence contr ibuted to the fatal accident. She later amended her complai nt to add state-law tort claims against two other defendants, a municipa lity and a utility company . 490 U. S., at 546-547. No independent basis for federa l subjec t-matter jurisdic tion existed over the state-law claims. The plaintiff could not have brought her entire action in state cour t, because federa l embrac\u00ad ing the state-law claims, she would be obliged to pursue two discrete actions, one in federa l cour t, the other in state cour t. This Cour t held, nevertheless, that the District Cour t lacked jurisdic tion over the \"pendent-par In so holdi ng, the Cour t stressed that Congress held the control rein. Id., at 547-549. Congress could re\u00ad verse the resu lt in Finley, and permit pendent jurisdic tion over state-law claims against additi onal defendants, if it so chose . Id., at 556. Congress did so in \u00a7 1367. What more \u00a7 1367 wrought is an issue on which cour ts of appea ls have shar ply divided. Compare Stro mberg Metal Works, Inc. v. Press Mechan ical, Inc., 77 F. 3d 928, 930 (CA7 1996) \"supersedes Clark when the additi less than [the jurisdic tional minimum ]\"), and In re Abbo tt F. 3d 524, 529 (CA5 1995) (\"[U]nder \u00a7 1367 a can exercise supplement al jurisdic tion over members of a class, although they did not meet the amount-i n-controversy requirement, as did the class represent atives. \"), with Merit\u00ad care Inc. v.

S. 546 (2005) dissenti ng claims, includi ng Zahn's on in actions\"). The Cour t today holds that \u00a7 1367, although prompted by Finley, a case in which original access to federa l cour t was predicated on a federa l questi on, notably enlarges federa t reads \u00a7 1367 to overr ule Clark and Zahn, thereby allowing access to federa l cour t by coplai ntiffs or class members who do not meet the now in excess of $75,000 amount-i n-controversy re\u00ad quirement, so long as at least coplai ntiff, or the named class represent ative , has a jurisdic tionally sufcient claim. Ante, at 549. The Cour t adopts a plausibly broad readi ng of \u00a7 1367, a measure that is hardly a model of the carefu l draf ter's art. There is another plausible readi ng, howe ver, one less disrup\u00ad tive of our jurisprudence regardi ng supplement al If one reads \u00a7 1367( a) to instruct, as the statute' s text suggests, that the distr ict cour t must rst have \"original ju\u00ad over a \"civil action\" before supplement al juris\u00ad diction can attach, then Clark and Zahn are preserved, and supplement al jurisdic tion does not open the way for joinder of plaintiffs, or inclusi on of class members, who do not in\u00ad dependently meet the amount-i n-controversy requirement. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that this narrower constr uction is the better readi parties, or others whose rights might be adversely affec ted if they could not air their claims in an ongoi ng federa l-cour t action. Given VICES, INC . Ginsburg, J., dissenti ng ters deemed ancillary regardless of the citizensh ip of the par\u00ad ties or the amount in controversy . Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.

The plain\u00ad tiff stated a federa l claim under the Taft-Hartley Act, and an allied state-law claim of unlawfu l conspiracy to inter fere with his employment contrac t. This Cour t upheld the join\u00ad der of federa l and state claims. \"[T]here is power in federa l cour ts to hear the whole ,\" the Cour t said, when the state and federa l claims \"der ive from a common nucleus of opera\u00ad tive fact\" and are so linked that the plaintiff \"wou ld ordi\u00ad narily be expec ted to try them all in one judicia l proceedi ng.\" Id., at 725.

S. 365 (1978), the Cour t addressed the permissible scope of the doctrine in relati on to the libera l prov isions of the Federa l Rules of Civil Procedure for joinder of parties and claims. Kroge r commenced as a suit between a citizen of Iowa and a Nebraska corporati on. When the Nebraska defendant im\u00ad pleaded an Iowa corporati on as a third-par ty defendant under Rule 14(a), the plaintiff asser ted state-law claims against the impleaded party. No independent basis of fed\u00ad eral jurisdic tion existed over the newly asser ted claims, for both plaintiff and impleaded defendant were citizens of Iowa. 437 U. S., at 370.

S., at 374. Although pendent jurisdic tion and ancillary jurisdic t has recog nized that they are \"two species of the same gener ic problem: Under what cir\u00ad cumst ances may a federa l cour t hear and decide a state-law claim arising between citizens of the same State?\" Id., at 370.

This Cour t has read that prov i\u00ad sion to demand no more than \"minimal diversity ,\" i. e., so long as one party on the plaintiffs' side and one party on the defendants' side are of diverse citizensh ip, Congress may author ize federa l cour ts to exercise diversity jurisdic tion. See State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530-531 (1967). Further, the Constituti on includes no amount-i n-controversy limitation on the exercise of federa l jurisdic tion. But from the start, Congress, as its measures have been constr ued by this Cour t, has limited federa l-cour t exercise of diversity jurisdic tion in two principa l ways. First, unless Congress speci es other wise, diversity must be \"complete ,\" i. e., all parties on plaintiffs' side must be diverse from all parties on defendants' side. Strawbr idge v. Curtiss, 3 PAGES PGT: OPIN 585 Cite U. S. 546 (2005) Ginsburg, J., dissenti ng 1984). Second, each plaintiff's stake amount-i n-controversy speci cati on: \"When two or more plaintiffs, having separate and disti nct demands, unite for convenience and economy in a single suit, it is essentia l that the demand of each be of the requisite jurisdic tional amount. \" Troy Bank, 222 U. S., at 40. The statute today gover ning federa l-cour t diversity-of-citi zensh ip cases ] where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum . . . of $75,000. \" \u00a7 1332( a). t has long held that, in de\u00ad termining whether the amount-i n-controversy requirement has been satised, a single plaintiff may aggregate two or more claims against a single defendant, even if the claims are unrelated. See, e. g., Edwards v. Bates County, 163 U. S. 269, 273 (1896). But in multipar ty cases, includi ng class ac\u00ad tions, we have unyieldi ngly adhered to the nonaggregati on 5 Endeavor ing to preserve the \"complete diversity\" rule rst stated in Strawbr idge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806), the Cour t's opinion drives a wedge between the two components of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1332, treati ng the diversity-of-citi zensh ip requirement as essential, the amount-in\u00ad controversy requirement as more readi ly disposable . See ante, at 553, 562. Section 1332 itself, howe ver, does not rank order the two require\u00ad ments. What \"[o]rdinary principl[ e] canon inter pret ation,\" ante, at 558, allows the Cour t to slice up \u00a7 1332 this way? In partial explanati on, asser ts that amount in con\u00ad troversy can be analyzed claim by claim, but the diversity requirement cannot. See ante, at 554. It is not altogether clear why that shou ld be so. The cure for improper joinder of a nondiverse party is the same as the cure for improper joinder of a plaintiff who does not satisfy the juris\u00ad dictional amount. In both cases, original jurisdic tion can be preserved by dismissi ng the nonqua lifying party. See Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U. S. 61, 64 (1996) (diversity); Newman-G reen, Inc. v.

See National Arch ives and Reco rds Admin. v. Favish, 541 U. S. 157, 169 (2004). Here, that background is the statutory grant of diversity jurisdic\u00ad tion, the amount-i n-controversy conditi on that Congress, from the start, has tied to the grant, and the nonaggregati on rule this Cour t has long appl ied to the deter mination of the \"matter in controversy .\" Section prov ided or as expressly prov ided other wise by Federa l statute , in any civil action of which the distr ict cour ts al ju\u00ad risdic tion over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdic tion that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constituti on.

In contrast to the Cour uction of \u00a7 1367, which draws a shar p line between the diversity and amount-i n-controversy components of \u00a7 1332, see ante, at 554; supra, at 585, n. 5, the inter pret ation presented here does not sever the two jurisdic tional requirements. The more restrai ned readi ng of \u00a7 1367 just outlined would yield afrmance of the First Circuit' s judg ment in Ortega, and reversa l of the Eleventh Circuit' s judg ment in Exxo n. It would not discard entirely , as the Cour t does, the judicia lly developed doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdic tion as they existed when Finley decided.10 Instead, it would recog nize \u00a7 1367 placi ng al jurisdic tion, once the distr ict cour t has original jurisdic tion, would now include \"clai ms that involve the joinder or interventi on appl ied only in federa l-questi on cases and allowed 9 On this readi ng of \u00a7 1367( a), it is immater ial 1367( b) \"does not withdraw supplement al jurisdic tion over the claims of the additi onal par\u00ad ties at issue here .\" Ante, at 560. Because those claims would not come within \u00a7 1367( a) in the rst place , Congress would have had no reason to list them in \u00a7 1367( b).

The less disruptive view I take of \u00a7 1367 also accounts for the omissi on of Rule 20 plaintiffs and Rule 23 class actions in \u00a7 1367( b)'s text. If one reads \u00a7 1367( a) as a plenary grant of supplement al jurisdic tion to federa l cour ts sitting in diver\u00ad would indeed look for excepti ons in \u00a7 1367( b). Finding none for permissive joinder of parties or class ac\u00ad tions, one would conclude if unintenti onally, But if one rec\u00ad ognizes that the nonaggregati on rule delineated in Clark and Zahn forms part of the deter mination whether \"original ju\u00ad risdic tion\" exists in a diversity case , see supra, at 590, then plaintiffs who do not meet the amount-i n-controversy re\u00ad quirement would fail at the \u00a7 1367( a) threshold. Congress would have no reason to resor t to a \u00a7 1367( b) excepti on to turn such plaintiffs away from federa l cour t, given that their claims, from the start, would fall outside the cour t's \u00a7 1332 jurisdic tion. See Pfander more moderate assig n different meani diversity and federa l\u00ad questi on cases. See ante, at 561.

What is the utility of \u00a7 1367( b) readi ng of \u00a7 1367( a)? Section 1367( a) allows parties other than the plaintiff to asser t reactive claims once enter tained under ju\u00ad risdic tional requirements by using another 's claim as a hook to add a claim that the plaintiff could not have brought in the rst instance . Kroge r is the paradig m case. See supra, at 581-582. There , the Cour t held that ancillary jurisdic tion did not extend to a plaintiff's claim against a nondiverse party who had been impleaded by the defendant under Rule 14. Section 1367( b), then, is corroborative of \u00a7 1367( a)'s ides excep\u00ad tions to ensure that accommodati on of claims would not fundament ally alter \"the jurisdic tional requirements of section 1332. \" See Pfander Pa. \u00a7 1367' 8,13 the precedent-preservative readi ng, I am persuaded, better accords with the histor ical and legal context of Congress' see supra, at 582-584, 587, and the established limits on pendent and ancillary jurisdic tion, see supra, at 580-582. It does not attribute to Congress a juris\u00ad dictional enlargement broader than the one to which the leg\u00ad islators adver ted, cf. Finley, 490 U.

In 1993, Westlands and other water dis\u00ad tricts sued the Bureau for reduci ng their water supply . Petitioners, though not parties to the 1963 contrac t, intervened as plaintiffs. After negotiati ons, all parties except petiti oners nt. Petitioners pressed forward with, as relevant here , the claim that the United States had breached the contrac t. They contended that they were third-par ty beneciar ies entitled to enforce the contrac t and that the United States had waived its sovereig n immu\u00ad nity from breach of contrac t suits in a prov ision of the Reclamati on Refor m Act of 1982, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 390uu. The District Cour t ultimately held that petiti oners were neither contrac ting parties nor intended third-par ty beneciar ies of the contrac t and therefore could not benet from \u00a7 390uu' s waiver . The Ninth Circuit afrmed in relevant part. Held: Section 390uu does not waive the United States' sovereig n immunity from petiti oners' suit. The prov ision grants consent \"to join the United States as a necessar y party defendan t in any suit to adjudicate\" certain rights under a federa l reclamati on contrac t. (Emphasis added.) A waiver of sovereig n immunity must be strictly constr ued in favor of the sovereig n. See, e. g., Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U. S. 255, 261. In light of this principle , \u00a7 390uu is best inter preted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties when the action requires constr uction of a reclamati on contrac t and join\u00ad der of the United States is necessary . It does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone. This inter pret ation draws suppor t from \u00a7 390uu' s use of the words \"necessary party,\" a term of art whose meani ng calls to mind Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a)'s requirements for joinder of parties. The inter pret ation also draws suppor t from the contrast between \u00a7 390uu' s lang uage , which speaks in terms of joinder , and the broader phrasi ng of other statutes, e. g., the Tucker Act, that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone.

The District Cour t dismissed some of them and granted summary judg ment for the Gover nment on others, see 358 F. 3d, at 1142, leaving only the claim at issue here: that the United States had breached the 1963 contrac t by reduci ng the deliv\u00ad ery of water and was liable for money damages. Petitioners contended that the United States had waived its sovereig n immunity from their suit in the Reclamati on Refor m Act, 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 390uu. The District Cour t initia lly held that petiti oners were intended third-par ty beneciar ies and that the lang uage of \u00a7 390uu was broad enough to allow their suit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, but on reconsiderati on changed its view. It held that, in light of interveni ng Circuit author ity, Klamath Water Users Protective Assn. v. Patterson, 204 F. 3d 1206 (CA9 1999), petiti oners were neither contrac ting parties nor intended third-par ty beneciar ies of the 1963 contrac t, and therefore could not benet from \u00a7 390uu' s waiver . App. to Pet. for Cert. U. S. 596 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The Cour t of Appea ls afrmed in relevant part. It agreed with the District Cour t's readi ng of the 1963 contrac t and \u00a7 390uu light of Klamath. 358 3d, at 1144 -1147. The Cour t of Appea ls noted that its decisi on might be at odds with H. F. Allen Orchard s v. United States, 749 F. 2d 1571 (CA Fed. 1984), which had reached the opposite conclusi on with respec t to farmers who belonged to an irrigati on dis\u00ad trict in Washington. 358 F. 3d, at 1147, n. 5. We granted certiorar i. 543 U. S. 924 (2004). II This dispute centers on \u00a7 390uu, which waives the United States' sovereig n immunity for certain purposes. Section 390uu prov ides: \"Consent is given to join the United States as a neces\u00ad sary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate , conr m, validate , or decree the contrac tual rights of a contrac t\u00ad ing entity and the United States regardi ng any contrac t executed pursuant to Federa l reclamati on law. The United States, when a party to any suit, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereig nty, and shall be subjec t to judg ments, orders, and decrees of the cour t having jurisdic tion, and may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private indiv idua l under like circumst ances. Any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States distr ict cour t in the State in which the land involved is situated. \" Petitioners contend that they are intended third-par ty beneciar ies of the 1963 contrac t and therefore entitled to enforce the contrac t. Hence , they claim, their suit is one \"to adjudicat e...t he contrac tual rights of a contrac entity and the United States\" within the meani ng of \u00a7 390uu. This argument founders on the principle that a waiver of sover\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U72 [03-26-08 18:41:16] PAGES PGT: OPIN 602 STATES Opinion of the Cour t eign immunity must be strictly constr ued in favor of the sov\u00ad ereig n. See, e. g., Department of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U. S. 255, 261 (1999); Lane v. Pen a, 518 U. S. 187, 192 (1996). Constr uing \u00a7 390uu in light of this principle , nd it insufcient to waive sovereig n immunity . Section 390uu grants consent \"to join the United States as a necessar y party defendan t in any suit to adjudicate\" certain rights under a federa l reclamati on contrac t. (Em\u00ad phasis added.) This lang uage is best inter preted to grant consent to join the United States in an action between other parties\u2014for example , two water distr icts, or a water distr ict and its members\u2014when the action requires constr uction of a reclamati on contrac t and joinder of the United States is necessary . It does not permit a plaintiff to sue the United States alone. Section 390uu' s use of the words \"necessary party\" sup\u00ad ports this inter term \"neces\u00ad sary\" descr ibed the class of parties now called \"Persons to be Joined if Feasible\" under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a). See Provident Tradesmen s Bank & Trust Co. v. Pat\u00ad terson, 390 U. S. 102, 116-118, and n. 12 (1968) (recounti ng terminolog y change). Rule 19(a) requires a cour t to order joinder of a party if \"(1) in the person' s absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relati ng to the subjec t of the action and is so situated that the dispositi on of the action in the person' s absence may (i) as a prac tical matter impair or impede the person' s ability to protec t that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subjec t to a subst antia l risk of incurr ing double , multiple , or other\u00ad wise inconsistent obligati ons by reason of the claimed interest. \" Though the Rule no longer descr ibes such parties as \"neces\u00ad sary,\" \"necessary (2005) Opinion of the Cour t allels Rule 19(a)'s requirements. See Black 's Law Diction\u00ad ary 928 (5th ed. 1979) (dening \"necessary parties\" as \"those persons who must be joined in an action because , inter alia, complete relief cannot be given to those already parties with\u00ad out their joinder ,\" and citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)). The phrase \"join...a sa necessary party defendant\" in \u00a7 390uu thus calls to mind Rule 19(a)'s requirements. We need not decide here whether the phrase limits the waiver of sovereig n immunity to cases in which the United States could be joined under Rule 19(a). Regardless, the tradi\u00ad tional concept of 390uu to permit joinder the United States in an action rather than initiati on of a suit solely against it. Our conclusi on draws force from the contrast between \u00a7 390uu' s lang uage , which speaks in terms of joinder , and the broader phrasi ng of statutes that waive immunity from suits against the United States alone. For example , the Tucker Act grants the United States Cour t of Federa l Claims \"ju\u00ad risdic tion to render judg ment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon any express or implied contrac t with the United States. \" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1491( a)(1).2 The Little Tucker Act grants distr ts original jurisdic\u00ad tion, concurrent with t of Federa l Claims, over \"[a]ny...c ivil action or claim against the United States, not exceedi ng $10,000 in amount, founded . . . upon any express or implied contrac t with the United States. \" \u00a7 1346( a)(2). The contrast between 43 U. S. C. \u00a7 390uu and the broader lang uage of these statutes conr ms that our constr uction as\u00ad cribes necessary party defendant\" in Petitioners' suit cannot proceed under our inter pret 390uu. For purposes of that prov petiti oners sought to sue the United States alone: They named as de\u00ad 2 The District Cour t invited petiti oners severa l times to transfer their damages claims to the Cour t of Federa l Claims, but petiti oners did not accept those invitations. App. to Opinion of the Cour t fendants the United States itself, as well as various federa l entities and ofcia ls they viewed as responsible for the water delivery reduc tion (for example , the Bureau, the Fish and Wildlife Serv ice, and the Secret ary of the Inter ior). Peti\u00ad tioners' suit, brought solely against the United States and its agents, is not an attempt to \"join the United States as a necessary party defendant. \" \u00a7 390uu (emphasis added).3 * * * We hold that \u00a7 390uu does not waive immunity from peti\u00ad tioners' suit: The statute does not waive immunity from suits direc tly against the United States, as opposed to joinder of the United States as a necessary party defendant to permit a complete adjudicati on of rights under a reclamati on contrac t. We therefore afrm the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls. It is so ordered. 3 We need not reach the contenti ons, advanced by respondents, that \u00a7 390uu neither unequivoca lly grants consent to a money damages remedy , Brief for United States 23-25; Brief for Natura l Resources Defense Counci l et al. 20-21, nor unequivoca lly grants consent to suit by noncon\u00ad tracting entities, id., at 22-23, and n. 8; Brief for Westlands Water District explai , we nd \u00a7 390uu wise [03-28-08 TERM, 2004 Syllabus HALBER T v. MICHIGAN certiorari to the court of appeal s of michigan No. 03-10198. Argued April 25, 2005 \u2014Decided June 23, 2005 In Douglas v. California , 372 U. S. 353, this Cour t held that, in criminal proceedi ngs, a State must prov ide counsel for an indigent defendant in a rst appea l as of right. Two considerati ons were key: (1) An appea l \"of right\" yields an adjudicati on on the \"mer its,\" id., at 357, and (2) rst-tier review differs from subsequent appel late stages \"at which the claims have once been presented by a lawyer and passed upon by an appel late cour t,\" id., at 356. Later , in Ross v. Moftt, 417 U. S. 600, the Cour t held that a State need not appoi nt counsel to aid a poor person seek ing to pursue a second-tier discreti onary appea l to or, thereaf ter, certiorar i in this Cour t. Id., at 610- 612, 615-618. The Douglas rationale does not extend to second-tier discreti onary review, the Cour t explai ned, because , at that stage, error correc tion is not the reviewing cour t's prime func tion. 417 U. S., at 615. Principa l criteria for state high cour t review, Ross noted, include whether the issues presented are of signicant publ ic interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major signicance to the State's jurisprudence , and whether the decisi on below is in probable confl ict with the high cour t's precedent. Ibid. Further, a defendant who has received counsel' s aid in a rst-tier appea l as of right would be armed with a transcr ipt or other record of trial proceedi ngs, a brief in the appea ls cour t setti ng forth his claims, and, often, that cour t's opinion disposi ng of the case. Ibid. Mich igan has a two-tier appel late system. The State Supreme Cour t hears appea ls by leave only. The inter mediate Cour t of Appea ls adjudi\u00ad cates appea ls as of right from criminal convictions, except that a defend\u00ad ant convicted on a guilty or nolo contende re plea who seeks inter medi\u00ad ate appel late cour t review must apply for leave to appea l. Under Mich igan law, most indigent defendants convicted on a plea must pro\u00ad ceed pro se in seek ing leave to appea l to the inter mediate cour t. In People v. Bulger, the Mich igan Supreme Cour t held that the Fourteenth Amendment' s Equal Protec tion and Due Process Clauses do not secure a right to appoi nted counsel for plea-con victed defendants seek ing re\u00ad view in the inter mediate appel late cour t for these reasons: Such review is discreti onary; plea proceedi ngs are shor ter, simpler , and more routi ne than trials; and a defendant enter ing a plea accedes to the State's funda\u00ad ment Petitioner Halbert pleaded nolo contende re to two counts of sexua l conduc t. During Halbert's plea colloquy , the trial cour t advised him of instances in which it \"must\" or \"may\" appoi nt appel late counsel, but failed to tell him that it could not appoi nt counsel in any other circumst ances, includi ng Halbert's own case. The day after his sen\u00ad tence was imposed, Halbert moved to withdraw his plea. Denying the moti on, the trial cour t stated that Halbert's proper remedy was to ap\u00ad peal to the State Cour t of Appea ls. Twice thereaf ter, Halbert asked the trial cour t to appoi nt counsel to help him prepare an appl icati on for leave to appea l to the inter mediate cour t, stating that his sentence had been misscored, that he needed counsel to preserve the issue before under taking an appea l, that he had learning disabi lities and was men\u00ad tally impaired, and that he had been obliged to rely on fellow inmates in prepar ing his pro se lings. The cour t denied Halbert's moti on, citing Bulger. Halbert then led a pro se appl icati leave to ing, inter alia, remand for appoi ntment of appel late counsel. The Cour t of Appea ls denied leave \"for lack of merit in the grounds pre\u00ad sented. \" The Mich igan Supreme Cour t declined review. Held: The Due Process and Equal Protec tion Clauses require the appoi nt\u00ad ment of counsel for defendants, convicted on their pleas, who seek access to rst-tier review in the Mich igan Cour t of Appea Appea ls' process following plea-based convictions compel the conclusi on that Douglas, not Ross , controls here . First, in ruling on an appl icati on for leave to appea l, that cour t looks to the merits of the appel lant' s claims. Second, indigent defendants pursui ng rst-tier review in the Cour t of Appea ls are gener\u00ad ally ill equipped to represent themselves. A defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contende re in a Mich igan cour t, although he relinquishes access to an appea l as of right, is entitled to apply for leave to appea l, and that entitlement is ofcia lly conveyed to him. Of critica l impor\u00ad tance , the inter mediate appel late cour t, unlike the Mich igan Supreme Cour t, sits as an error-correc tion instance . A cour t Rule prov ides that the inter mediate cour t may respond to a leave appl icati on in a number of ways: It may grant or deny the appl icati on, enter a nal decisi on, grant other relief, request additi onal mater ial from the record, or re\u00ad quire a certied concise statement of proceedi ngs and facts from the lower cour t. The cour t's response to the leave appl icati on by any of these alternatives\u2014i ncludi ng denia l of leave \u2014necessar ily entails some evaluati on of the merits of the appl icant' s claims. Pp. 616-618. This Cour t rejects Mich igan' s argument that Ross is dispositive here because review in the inter mediate appel late cour t following a 607 Cite as: 605 (2005) Syllabus based conviction is discreti onary , given the necessity of ling an appl ica\u00ad tion for leave to appea cour t turn on consid\u00ad erati ons other than a lower cour t's commissi on of error , e. g., the involvement of a matter of \"signicant publ ic interest. \" 417 U. S., at 615. Mich igan' s Supreme Cour t, like the highest cour ts of other States, sits not to correc t errors in indiv idua l cases, but to decide matters of larger publ ic impor t. By contrast, the inter mediate cour t, as an error\u00ad correc tion instance , is to appea l appl i\u00ad cations by the merits of the particular defendant' s claims, not by the genera l impor tance of the questi ons Whether categor ized as the decisi on of an appea l or the dis\u00ad posa l of a leave appl icati on, the inter mediate appel late cour t's ruling on a plea-con victed defendant' s claims prov ides the rst, and likely the only, direc t review the defendant' s conviction and sentence will receive . Parties like Halbert, howe ver, are disar med in their endeavor to gain rst-tier review. Ross emphasi zed that a defendant seek ing State Su\u00ad preme Cour t review following a rst-tier appea l as of right earlier had the assist ance of appel late counsel, who will have reviewed the trial cour t record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflec ting that review and research. 417 U. S., at 615. Such a defendant may also be armed with an opinion of the inter mediate appel late cour t ad\u00ad dressi ng the issues counsel raised. Without such guides keyed to a cour t of review, a pro se appl icant' s entitlement to seek leave to appea l to Mich igan' s inter mediate cour t may be more formal than real. Cf. Swenson v. Bosl er, 386 U. S. 258 (per curiam). Persons in Halbert's situati on, many of whom have little educati on, learning disabi lities, and ment al impair ments, particu larly as self\u00ad represent atives. See Kowal ski v. Tesme r, 543 U. S. 125, 140 (Gins\u00ad burg, J., dissenti ng). Further, appea ls by defendants convicted on their pleas may be \"no less complex than other appea ls.\" Id., at 141. Mich igan' s complex procedures for seek ing leave to appea l after sen\u00ad tenci ng on a plea, moreover , may intimidate the uncounseled. See id., at 141-142. The State does have a legitimate interest in reduci ng its judiciary' s workload, but prov iding indigents with appel late counsel will yield appl icati ons easier to comprehend. Mich igan' s Cour t of Appea ls would still have recourse to summary denia ls of leave appl icati ons in cases not warranti ng further review. And when a defendant' cour t. Pp. 619-623. The Cour t disagrees with Mich igan' s contenti on that, even if Halbert had a constituti onally 608 HALBER T v. MICHIGAN Syllabus level appel late review, he waived that right by enter ing a nolo conten\u00ad dere plea. At the time he entered his plea, Halbert had no recog nized right to appoi nted appel late counsel he could elect to forgo . Moreover , the trial cour t did not tell Halbert, simply and direc tly, that in his case , there would be no access to appoi nted counsel. Cf. Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81. Pp. 623-624.

Petitioner Antoni o Dwayne Halbert, convicted on his plea of nolo contende re, sought the appoi ntment of counsel to as\u00ad sist him in apply ing for leave to appea l to the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls. The state trial cour t and the Cour t of Appea ls denied Halbert's requests for appoi nted counsel, and the Mich igan Supreme Cour t declined review.

Mich igan urges that appea l to the State Cour t of Appea ls is discreti onary and, for an appea l of that order , Ross v. Moftt, 417 U. S. 600 (1974), holds counsel need not be appoi nted. Earlier this Term, in Kowalski v.

MICHIGAN Opinion of the Cour t we reach the classi cati on questi on and conclude that Hal\u00ad bert's case is proper ly ranked with Douglas rather than Ross . Accordi ngly, we hold that the Due Process and Equal Protec tion Clauses require the appoi ntment of counsel for defendants, convicted on their pleas, who seek access to rst-tier review in the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls. I The Federa l Constituti on imposes on the States no obliga\u00ad tion to prov ide appel late review of criminal convictions. McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684, 687 (1894). Having pro\u00ad vided such an avenue , howe ver, a State may not \"bolt the door to equa l justice\" to indigent defendants. Grifn v. Illi\u00ad nois, 351 U. S. 12, 24 (1956) (Frankfur ter, J., concurr ing in judg ment); see id., at 23 (same) (\"[W]hen a State deems it wise and just that convictions be susceptible to review by an appel late cour t, it cannot by force of its exac tions draw a line which precludes convicted a State condi\u00ad tions an appea l from a conviction on the prov ision of a trial transcr ipt, the State must furnish free transcr ipts to indi\u00ad gent defendants who seek to appea l. Id., at 16-20 (plura lity opinion). Douglas relied on Grifn's reasoni ng to hold that, in rst appea ls as of right, States must appoi nt counsel to represent indigent defendants. 372 U. S., at 357. Ross held, howe ver, that a State need not appoi nt counsel to aid a poor person in discreti onary appea ls to the State's highest cour t, or in petiti oning for review in this Cour t. 417 U. S., at 610-612, 615-618. Cases on appea l barr iers encountered by persons unable to pay their own way, we have observed, \"cannot be resolved by resor t to easy slogans or pigeonhole analysis. \" M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102, 120 (1996) (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Our decisi ons in point reflec U. S. 605 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t appel lants based solely on their inabi lity to pay core costs, \" while \"[t]he due process concer n homes in on the essentia l fairness of the state-ordered proceedi ngs.\" Ibid.; Evitts v. U. S. 387, 405 (1985). Two considerati ons were key to our decisi on in Douglas that a State is required to appoi nt counsel for an indigent defendant' s rst-tier appea l as of right. First, such an ap\u00ad peal entails an adjudicati on on the \"mer its.\" 372 U. S., at 357. Second, rst-tier review differs from subsequent ap\u00ad pellate stages \"at which the claims have once been presented by [appel late counsel] and passed upon by an appel late cour t.\" Id., at 356. Under the California system at issue in Douglas, the rst-tier appel late cour t independently ex\u00ad amined the record to deter mine whether to appoi nt counsel. Id., at 355. When a defendant able to retain counsel pur\u00ad sued an appea l, the Douglas Cour t observed, \"the appel late cour t passe[ d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benet of written briefs and oral argument by coun\u00ad sel.\" Id., at 356. In contrast, when a poor person appea led, \"the appel late cour t [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even deter mine whether counsel shou ld be prov ided. \" Ibid. In Ross , we explai ned why the rationale of Douglas did not extend to the appoi ntment of counsel for an indigent seek ing to pursue a second-tier discreti onary appea l to the North Carol ina Supreme Cour t or, thereaf ter, certiorar i re\u00ad view in this Cour t. The North Carol ina Supreme Cour t, in common with this Cour t we perceived, does not sit as an error-correc tion instance . 417 U. S., at 615. Principa l criteria for state high cour t review, we noted, included \"whether the subjec t matter of the appea l has signicant publ ic interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major signicance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decisi on below is in probable confl ict\" with the cour t's precedent.

II A igan has a two-tier appel late system compr ising the State Supreme Cour t and the inter mediate Cour t of Appea ls. The Mich igan Supreme Cour t hears appea ls by leave only. Mich. Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 770.3(6) (West Supp . 2004). Prior 1994, the Cour t of Appea ls adjudicated appea ls as of right from all criminal convictions. Bulger, 462 Mich., at 503-504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106-107. To reduce the workload of the Cour t of Appea ls, a 1994 amendment to the Mich igan Consti\u00ad tution changed the process for appea ls following plea-based convictions. Id., at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106-107. As amended, the State Constituti on prov ides: \"In every criminal prosecuti on, the accused shall have the right . . . to have an appea l as a matter of right, except as prov ided by law an appea l by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the cour t.\" Mich. Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 20. A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls must now le an appl icati on for leave to appea l pursuant to Mich. Ct.

First, in deter mining how to dispose of an appl icati on for leave to appea l, Mich igan' s inter mediate appel late cour t looks to the merits of the claims made in the appl icati on. Second, indigent defendants pursui ng rst-tier the Cour t of Appea ls are genera lly ill equipped to represent themselves. A defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contende re in a Mich igan cour t does not thereby forfeit all oppor tunity for appel late review. Although he relinquishes access to an ap\u00ad peal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appea l, and that entitlement is ofcia lly conveyed to him. See supra, at 612; Mich. Ct.

It \"may grant or deny the appl icati on; enter decisi on; grant request additi onal mater ial from the record; or require a certied concise state\u00ad ment of proceedi ngs and facts from the cour t . . . whose order 3 Both the major ity and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103 (2000), descr ibed the State's inter mediate cour t's tion as error correc tion. Compare id., at 516-518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112-113 (in the major ity's view, the Cour t of Appea ls could perform its review func tion, despite the defendant' s lack of represent ation, because plea-con victed defendants have ample aid for preservati on of their claims in the trial cour t and ineffec tive assist ance of counsel shou ld be readi ly apparent to the Cour t of Appea ls from the record), with id., at 543, 614 N.

Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005). When the cour t denies leave using the stock phrase \"for lack of merit in the grounds presented, \" its dispositi on may not be equiva lent to a \"nal decisi on\" on the merits, i. e., the dispositi on may simply signal that the cour t found the mat\u00ad ters asser ted unwor thy of the expenditure of further judicia l resources. But the cour t's response to the leave appl icati on by any of the speci ed alternatives\u2014i ncludi ng denia l of leave \u2014necessar ily entails some evaluati on of the merits of the appl icant' s claims. Mich igan urges that review in the Cour t of Appea ls follow\u00ad ing a plea-based conviction is as \"discreti onary\" as review in the Mich igan Supreme Cour t because both require an appl i\u00ad cation for leave to appea l. See Bulger, 462 Mich., at 506- 508, 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 108, 113; Brief for Respondent 31-34.4 Therefore , Mich igan maintains, Ross is dispositive of this case. The Cour t in Ross , howe ver, recog nized that ng deter minations North Carol ina's Supreme Cour t turned on considerati ons other than the commissi on of error by a lower cour t, e. g., the involvement of a matter of \"signicant publ ic interest. \" See supra, at 611. Mich igan' s Supreme Cour t, too, sits not to correc t errors in indiv idua l cases, but to decide matters of larger publ ic impor t. See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B )(2)-(3) (2005) (criteria for granti ng leave to appea l to the Mich igan Supreme Cour t include whether a case presents [of] signicant publ ic in\u00ad terest\" major signicance to the state's jurisprudence\"); Great Lakes Realty Corp. v.

By contrast, the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls, because it is an error-correc tion instance , is guided in respondi ng to leave to appea l appl icati ons by the merits of the particular defend\u00ad ant's claims, not by the genera l impor tance of the questi ons presented. Whether formally categor ized as the decisi on of an appea l or the disposa l of a leave appl icati on, the Cour of Appea plea-con victed defendant' s claims prov ides the rst, and likely the only, direc t review the defendant' s convic\u00ad tion and sentence will receive . Parties like Halbert, how\u00ad ever, are disar med in their endeavor to gain rst-tier review. As the Cour t in Ross emphasi zed, a defendant seek ing State Supreme Cour t review following a rst-tier appea l as of right earlier had the assist ance of appel late counsel. The attor ney appoi nted to serve at the inter mediate appel late cour t level will have reviewed the trial cour t record, re\u00ad searched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflec ting that review and research. 417 U.

A rst-tier review appl icant, forced to act pro se, will face a record unre viewed by appel late counsel, and will be equipped with no attor ney's brief prepared for, or reasoned opinion by, a cour t of review. The Bulger cour t concluded that \"a pro se defendant seek\u00ad discreti onary review\" Cour t ls ade\u00ad quately armed because he \"will have the benet of a tran\u00ad script, trial counsel' s frami ng of the issues in [a] moti on to withdraw , and the trial cour t's ruling on the moti on.\" 462 Mich., at 518, 614 N.

S., at 259. Although Bosl er involved a post-tr ial rather than postplea appea l, the Cour t recog nized that a transcr ipt and moti on by trial counsel are not adequate stand-i ns for an appel late lawyer 's review of the record and legal research. Without guides keyed to a cour t of review, a pro se appl i\u00ad cant' s entitlement to seek leave to appea l to Mich igan' s inter\u00ad mediate cour t may be more formal than real. Persons in Halbert's situati on are particularly handicapped as self-represent atives. As recounted earlier this Term, \"[a]pproxi mately 70% of indigent defendants represented by appoi nted counsel plead guilty, and 70% of those convicted 5 This assumes that trial counsel will recog nize, in a for preservati on for appel late review.

It fails, howe ver, to ground its analysis in any particular pro\u00ad vision of the Constituti on or in this Cour t's precedents. It also ignores that, even if there is a right to counsel in the circumst ances at issue , the right is waivable and was validly waived here . I respec tfully dissent. I To underst and why the Cour t's holdi ng is an unwarranted extensi on of our precedents, it is necessary rst to under\u00ad stand the limits that Mich igan places on the prov ision of cour t-appoi nted counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest. Before 1994, Mich igan afforded all criminal de\u00ad fendants the right to appea l their convictions to the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls. By the early 1990' s, howe ver, the Mich i\u00ad gan Cour t of Appea ls had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiti ng decisi on, near ly a third of which were appea ls by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest. People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000). To reduce this backlog , Mich igan voters amended the Mich igan Constituti on in 1994 to prov ide that \"[i]n every criminal prosecuti on, the accused shall . . . have an appea l as a matter of right, except [that] an appea l by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the cour t.\" Mich. Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 20; Bulger, supra, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107. This constituti onal amendment created a two-track system for Mich igan defendants: The Mich igan Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals must hear the appea ls of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appea ls of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the subst antive crime. In 1999, the Mich igan Legislature enac ted the statute at issue here . It prov ides that, MICHIGAN Thomas, J., dissenti ng pleads guilty, guilty but ment ally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appel late counsel appoi nted for review of the de\u00ad fendant' s conviction or sentence .\" Mich. Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 770.3a(1) (West 2000). Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, howe ver, invariably lose the right to counsel on appea l; the statute cont ains excepti ons to the genera l rule. The trial cour t must appoi nt appel late counsel for plea-con victed defendants if the State seeks leave to appea l, the defendant' s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the appl i\u00ad cable minimum guidel ines range , or the defendant seeks leave to appea l a conditi onal plea. \u00a7 770.3a(2). Further, the trial cour t may appoi nt appel late counsel for plea-con victed defendants who seek leave er\u00ad Appea ls grants leave to appea l, \"the case proceeds as an appea l of right, \" Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D )(3) (2005), and the plea-con victed de\u00ad is entitled to Laws Ann. Thus, plea-con victed defendants lack ap\u00ad pellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seek ing leave to appea l. II The major ity nevertheless holds that Mich igan' s system is constituti onally inadequate . It nds that all plea-con victed indigent defendants have the right to appel late counsel when seek ing leave to appea l. The major ity does not say where in the Constituti on that right is located\u2014the Due Process Clause , the Equal Protec tion Clause , or some purported con\u00ad fluence of the two. Ante, at 610-611. Nor does the major\u00ad ity attempt to anchor its holdi ng in the history of those Clauses. M.L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S. 102, 131, 133, 138 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenti ng). Nor does the major ity even attempt to ground its holdi ng in the entirety of this Cour t's jurisprudence , which does not require paid appel late assist\u00ad ance for indigent criminal defendants. S. 605 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng major ity ignores the bulk of that jurisprudence and leaves those arguments unanswered. Instead, the major ity pins its hopes on a single case: Doug\u00ad las v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963). Douglas, howe ver, does not suppor t extendi ng the right to counsel to any form of discreti onary review, as Ross v. Moftt, 417 U. S. 600 (1974), and later cases make clear . Moreover , Mich igan has not engaged in the sort of invidious discr imination against indigent defendants that Douglas condemns. Mich igan has done no more than recog nize the undeniable difference be\u00ad tween defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence , in an attempt to diver t resources from largely frivolous appea ls to more meritorious ones. The ma\u00ad jority substitutes its own policy preference for that of Mich i\u00ad gan voters, and it does so based on an untenable readi ng of Douglas. A In Douglas, California granted an initia l appea l as of right to all convicted criminal defendants. 372 U. S., at 356. However, the California Cour t of Appea l appoi nted counsel for indigent defendants only after deter mining whether counsel would be usefu l to the defendant or the cour t. Ibid. Thus the California appel late cour t \"forced to prejudge the merits\" of indigent defendants' appea ls, while it judged the merits of other defendants' appea ls only after brieng and oral argument. Ibid. In previous cases, this Cour t had considered state-i mposed conditi ons like transcr ipt and ling fees that prevented indi\u00ad gent criminal defendants from obtaining any appel late re\u00ad view. Ross , supra, at 606-607 (discussi ng Grifn v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 (1956), and its progeny). By contrast, in Doug\u00ad las, California prov ided appel late review to all criminal de\u00ad fendants, but it did not prov ide a state subsidy for indigent defendants whose claims appeared unlikely to benet from counsel' s assist ance . This Cour t nevertheless held that when States prov ide a rst appea l as of right, they 545US2 Unit:$U73 [03-28-08 15:54:14] PAGES PGT: Thomas, J., dissenti ng supply indigent defendants with counsel. Ross , supra, at 607. In Ross , howe ver, this Cour t declined to extend Doug\u00ad las' right to counsel beyond initia l appea ls as of right. States need not appoi nt counsel for indigent defendants who seek discreti onary review in a State's highest cour t or Cour t. Ross , supra, at 616-618. Mich igan' s system bears some similarity to the state sys\u00ad tems at issue in both Douglas and Ross . Like the defendant in Douglas, Halbert requests appoi nted counsel for an initia l appea l before an inter mediate appel late cour t. But like the defendant in Ross , Halbert requests appoi nted counsel for an appea l that is discreti onary , not as of right. Crucially, howe ver, Douglas noted that its decisi on extended only to initia l appea ls as of right\u2014and later cases have repeatedly reafr med that underst andi ng.1 This Cour t has nt for discreti onary , supra, at 610; Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1989); see also Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987). And an appea l permitted only \"by leave of the cour t,\" Mich. Const., Art. 1, \u00a7 20, is discreti Mich igan Supreme Cour t has recog nized, Bulger, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113; id., at 542-543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenti ng). Neither Douglas nor any other decisi on of this Cour t warrants extendi ng the right to counsel to discreti onary review, even on a defendant' s ini\u00ad tial appea l. 1 Douglas, 372 U. S., at 357; Ross , 417 U. S., at 608 (\"[Douglas] extended only to initia l appea ls as of right\"); Evitts v. Lucey , 469 U. S. 387, 394 (1985) (Douglas \"is limited to the rst appea l as of right\"); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 555 (1987) (\"[T]he right to appoi nted counsel ex\u00ad tends to the rst appea l of right, and no further \"); Coleman v. Thompso n, 501 U. S. 722, 755 (1991) (\"[Douglas] establish[es] that an indigent criminal defendant has a right to appoi nted counsel in his rst appea l as of right in state cour t\"); see also Wainw right v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586, 587 (1982) (per curiam) (\"[Ross] held that a criminal defendant does not have a constitu\u00ad tional right to counsel to pursue discreti onary state appea ls or appl (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Just as impor tant, the rationale of Douglas does not sup\u00ad port extendi ng the right to counsel to this particular form of discreti onary review. Admittedly , the precise rationale for the Grifn/Douglas line of cases has never been made expl icit. Ross , supra, at 608-609. Those cases, howe ver, have a common theme . States may not impose nancia l bar\u00ad riers that preclude indigent defendants from secur ing appel\u00ad late review altogether 351 U. at 17-18 (plura lity opinion); 22 (Frankfur ter, J., concurr ing in judg ment); Burns v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 252, 258 (1959); Smith v. Benne tt, 365 U. S. 708, 713-714 (1961). Nor may States create \" 'un\u00ad reasoned disti nctions' \" among defendants, M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 111 (quoti ng Rinaldi v. Yeage r, 384 judg ment), that \"arbitrar ily cut off appea l rights for indigents while leaving open avenues of appea ls for more affluent persons, \" Ross , supra, at 607. Far from being disti nction, Mich igan' s differentiati on between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible . First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrong ful convictions is less signicant than in Douglas. In Douglas, California prelimi\u00ad narily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or con\u00ad ceded their guilt by plea. Here, Mich igan preliminarily de\u00ad nies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt. And because a defendant who pleads guilty \"may not thereaf ter raise independent claims relati ng to on of constituti onal rights that oc\u00ad curred prior to the entry of the guilty plea, \" Tollett v. Hen\u00ad derson, 411 U. S. 258, 267 (1973), the potentia l issues that can be raised on appea l are more limited, Bulger, 462 Mich., at 517, and n. 7, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112-113, and n. 7. Further, as the Mich igan Supreme Cour t has explai ned: \"Plea proceedi also ter, simpler , and more routi ne than trials; the record most often consists of 545US2 Unit:$U73 [03-28-08 15:54:14] PAGES PGT: J., dissenti 'factual basis' for the plea that is prov ided to the trial cour t. In contrast with trials, less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear , or the errors so hidden, that the defendant' s appea l will be reduced to a meani ngless ritual.\" Id., at 517, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112. When a defendant pleads in open cour t, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and rene claims to present to an appel late cour t. These are all \" '[r]easoned disti nc\u00ad tions' \" between defendants convicted by trial and those con\u00ad victed by their own plea. M. L. B., supra, at 111 (quoti ng Rinaldi, supra, at 310). The brief history of Mich igan' s system conr ms this. When Mich igan voters amended the State Constituti on to establish the current system, rough ly 13,000 civil and crimi\u00ad nal appea ls per year clogged the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls' docket. Of those , near ly a third were appea ls by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest. Even though at the time plea-con victed defendants were appoi nted paid appel late counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appea l. Simply put, Mich igan' s bar and bench were devoting a subst antia l portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little prac tical effec t. against crimi\u00ad nal defendants, indigent or other wise. Douglas, 372 U. S., at 356 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). It was an at\u00ad tempt to ensure \"that frivolous appea ls [were ] not subsidi zed and publ ic moneys not needlessly spent. \" Grifn, supra, at 24 (Frankfur ter, J., concurr ing in judg ment). Today' s decisi on will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Mich igan\u2014at least, indigent defendants with nonfr ivolous claims. While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attenti on, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less. Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-con victed defendants are entitled to counsel in prepar ing their leave appl icati ons if, for U. S. 605 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng pleas, Mich. Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 770.3a(2)( d) (West 2005), or their exceed the appl icable guidel ines ranges, \u00a7 770.3a(2)( victed defendant granted leave to appea l is entitled to appoi nted counsel. \u00a7 770.3a(2)( c). Holding Mich igan' s resources const ant (since we have no control over the State's bar or budget), the ma\u00ad jority's policy choice to redistr ibute the State's limited re\u00ad sources only harms those most likely to have worthwh ile claims\u2014to say noth ing of \"the cost of enabl ing cour ts and prosecutors to respond to the 'over-lawyer ing' of minor cases. \" Alabam a v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 681 (2002) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng); cf. Rompilla v. Beard, ante, at 403 (Kennedy , J., dissenti ng). Then, too, Mich igan is constituti obligati on to prov ide appea ls for plea\u00ad convicted defendants. Ante, at 610 (citing McKane v. Dur\u00ad ston, 153 U. S. 684 (1894)). Mich igan may decline to prov ide an appel late process altogether (since the Cour t's ruling in\u00ad creases the cost of having a system of appel late review). Surely plea-con victed defendants would prefer appea ls with limited access to counsel than no appea ls at all. B The major ity does not attempt to demonstrate that Mich i\u00ad gan's system is the sort of \"unreasoned\" discr imination against indigent defendants Douglas proh ibits. Instead, the major ity says that this case is earmarked by two considera\u00ad tions that were also key to this Cour t's decisi on in Douglas: First, when a plea-con victed defendant seeks leave to appea l, the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls adjudicates the leave appl ica\u00ad tion with reference to the merits. Ante, at 617. Second, the plea-con victed defendant who seeks leave to appea l is \"genera lly ill equipped to represent [himself ].\" Ibid. Nei\u00ad ther of these arguments is correc t. 1 The major ity reasons that in adjudicati ng an appl icati on for leave to appea dissenti ng guided . . . by the merits of the particular defendant' s claims.\" Ante, at 619. The disti nction that Douglas drew , howe ver, was not between appel late systems that involve \"some evaluati on of the merits of the appl icant' s claims\" and those that do not, ante, at 618, but instead between dis\u00ad creti onary and mandatory review. Supra, at 627-630. Of course the California inter mediate cour ts in Douglas evalu\u00ad ated cases on their merits: These cour ts were hear ing ap\u00ad peals as of right. The Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls probably does consider \"the of the s claims\" For instance , this Cour t would be unlikely to grant certiorar i in a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case' s dispositi on, or to correc t an error that had not affec ted the proceedi ngs below . This Cour t often considers whether errors are worth correc ting in both plenary and summary dispositi ons. None of this converts discreti on\u00ad ary, error-notici ng review into mandatory Likew ise, the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls is not required to hear particular cases or correc t particular errors. It may elect to hear cases when it nds the trial cour t's dispositi on questi onable or dubi ous. Or it may elect to hear cases when it nds the trial cour t's dispositi on impor tant or interesti ng. For all we know , it may (and probably does) consider both. Regardless, the Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on to grant review remai ns \"discreti onary ,\" because it does not depend on \"whether there has been 'a correc t adjudicati on in every indiv idua l case.\" Ross , 417 U. S., at 615. Like other cour ts of discreti onary review, the Cour t of Appea ls may opt to correc t errors, ante, at 617-619, and n. 3\u2014but it is not compel led to do so. The major ity appears to dispute that review before the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls is truly discreti onary , ante, at 618-619, and n. 4, but prov ides no suppor t for its spec\u00ad ulation. Unlike the California Cour of 633 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls has discreti on in decidi ng whether to grant leave appl icati ons. See Bulger, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (descr ibing the issue as \"whether a defendant is entitled under the federa l constituti on to ap\u00ad pointed counsel in a rst discre tionary appea l from a plea\u00ad based conviction\" (emphasis in original)); id., at 542-543, 614 W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenti ng) (\"Nothing in our cour t rules or statute preclude the Cour t of Appea ls from deny ing leave even though it may believe that the trial cour t's decisi on was incorrec t\"). So far as we can tell, the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on to grant or deny a leave appl icati on is not constrai ned by any state constituti onal pro\u00ad vision, statute , or cour t rule. The Mich igan Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all. The major ity's holdi ng suggests that Mich igan' s system would pass constituti onal muster if the Cour t of Appea ls cited \"lack of impor tance in the grounds presented\" as its ground for deny ing leave , ante, at 618-619, or if its decisi onal criteria were set forth in a statute , judicia l decisi on, or cour t rule, ibid. Yet the relevant inquiry under Douglas and Ross is whether the Cour t of Appea ls is obliged to review the case \u2014not whether the Cour t of Appea ls must or does offer a particular ground for declining review. 2 The major ity also asser ts that, without counsel, plea\u00ad convicted defendants who seek leave to appea l are \"genera lly ill equipped to represent themselves. \" Ante, at 617. This overgenera lizes Douglas' rationale. The Douglas Cour t was concer ned with the \"barren record\" that would follow a defendant on appea l. 372 U. S., at 356. For \"where the rec\u00ad ord [was] unclear or the errors [were ] hidden, \" the appel late cour t would have difcu lty detec ting errors without the as\u00ad sistance of counsel. Id., at 358. This is in part why this Cour t in Ross did not extend the right to counsel to discreti onary review before the Thomas, J., dissenti ng Carol ina Supreme Cour t. Before that cour t, a defendant apply ing for leave had \"a transcr ipt or other record of trial proceedi ngs, a brief on his beha lf in the Cour t of Appea ls setti ng forth his claims of error , and in many cases an opinion by the Cour t of Appea ls disposi ng of his case.\" 417 U. S., at 615. Coupled with whate ver the defendant might submit on his own, these mater ials prov ided the State Supreme Cour t \"with an adequate basis for its decisi on to grant or deny review.\" Ibid. The major ity does not argue that indigent plea-con victed defendants who le leave appl icati ons do so with a \"barren record, \" Douglas, supra, at 356, or that the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls lacks an \"adequate basis\" reviewing their leave appl icati ons, at 615. cour t rules require trial counsel to assist the defendant in organi zing and presenti ng to the trial cour t any potentia l appel late issues that warrant pres\u00ad ervati on. Accordi ngly, a pro se defendant seek ing dis\u00ad creti onary review will have the benet of a transcr ipt, trial counsel' s frami ng of the issues in the moti on to withdraw , and the trial cour t's ruling on the moti on.\" Bulger, supra, at 518, 614 N. 113; see also Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(H)(4) (2005). As in Ross , these mater ials aid both the plea-con victed and Appea ls in identi fying claims appropriate for plenary consideration. A plea\u00ad convicted defendant does not face a record unre viewed by counsel, and he does not lack any reasoned treatment of his claims. And, again, plea proceedi ngs tend to be more trans\u00ad parent than trials, supra, at 629-630; \"less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear , or the errors so hidden, \" Bulger, supra, at 517, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112, that the Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls will be unable to identi fy issues that deserve further exami nation on appea all, the 15:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN 635 Cite 605 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng Mich igan Cour t of Appea ls need know only enough to decide whether to grant further review. Shou ld it elect to do so, Mich igan law requires the appoi ntment of counsel to aid in the appea l. Mich. Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 770.3a(2)( c) (2005). The major ity's illingness to confront the disti nctions between Mich igan' s system and the California system at issue in Douglas is made clear by its reliance on Swenson v. Bosl er, 386 U. S. 258 (1967) (per curiam). Swenson consid\u00ad ered whether indigent defendants convicted at trial have a right to appoi nted counsel during their initia l appea l as of right, even if the State prov ides indigent defendants with a trial transcr ipt and a moti on for a new trial prepared by trial counsel. Id., at 258-259. But Douglas had already answered that questi on, as this Cour t summar ily declared: \"[Appoi nted counsel] may not be denied to a criminal defend\u00ad ant, solely because of his indigency , on the only appea l which the State affords him as a matter of right.\" 386 U. S., at 259 (emphasis added). Of course , Mich igan' s entire argu\u00ad ment is that there is a \"[r]easoned disti nctio[n]\" between defendants convicted following trials and pleas, as there is between appea ls as of right and discreti onary review. M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 111 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted); Brief for Respondent 28. This Cour t's brief, per curiam opinion in Swenson did not consider , much less address, these arguments. Lack ing suppor t in this Cour t's cases, the major ity effec ts a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discreti onary review to whether plea-con victed de\u00ad fendants are genera lly able to \"[n]aviga[te] the appel late process without a lawyer 's assist ance .\" Ante, at 621. This rationale lacks any stoppi ng point. Pro se may proceedi ngs, but this Cour t has never extended the right to counsel beyond rst appea ls as of right. Supra, at 627-628, and n. 1. The major ity does not demonstrate that pro se defendants have any more difcu lty ling the Mich igan cour ts than, ling petiti ons for certiorar i before this Cour t. In fact, this Cour t receives thousands of pro se petiti ons every year that list \"the date and nature of the judg ment or order appea led from, \" Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(B )(1) (2005); \"reci[ te] the appel lant' s allegati ons of error and the relief sought, \" ibid.; and \"se[t] forth a concise argumen t...i n suppor t of the appel lant' s positi on on each issue ,\" ibid. See this Cour t's Rule 14 (setti ng forth analogous requirements for petiti ons for writs certiorar i). vides a three-page form appl icati on accompanied by two pages of instructions for defendants seek ing leave to appea l after sentenci ng on a plea. It counsels defendants to \"state the issues and facts relevant to the appea l,\" and \"state the law that suppor ts your positi on and explai n how the law ap\u00ad plies to the facts of your case.\" Ante, at 622 (inter nal quot a\u00ad tion marks omitted). The major ity gives no clue as to how Mich igan could make its procedures for seek ing leave to ap\u00ad peal less intimidati ng to the uncounseled. Ibid. Regard\u00ad less, Mich igan' procedures are more than sufcient to enable discreti onary review. The major ity then attempts to soften the blow by saying that it is doing the State a favor , because \"prov iding indi\u00ad gents with appel late counsel will yield appl icati ons easier to comprehend. \" Ante, at 623. Even assumi ng the major i\u00ad ty's pater nalism is accurate is no that the Mich igan cour currently have difcu lty adjudicati ng leave appl icati ons. At the least, the major ity leaves unexplai ned why the Mich igan cour ts have greater difcu lty than do cour ts ing gan cour ts have difcu lty, it is unlikely any marg inal gains will offset the harms wrought by the major ity's pref\u00ad erence for redistr ibuti ng resources to a set of genera lly less meritorious claims. Whether or not one agrees with 545US2 Unit:$U73 [03-28-08 15:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN 637 Cite U. S. 605 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng the policy choice made by Mich igan voters, it is perfectly constituti onal. III Even assumi ng that there is a right to appoi nted appel late counsel in these circumst ances, the right, like the vast major\u00ad ity of other procedura l rights, is waivable , despite the major\u00ad ity's dictum to the s statutory proh ibition on appoi nted appel late counsel does not prevent defendants from waiv ing any constituti onal right to such counsel. And, in this case , Halbert's waiver was know ing and intelligent. A Lega l rights, even constituti onal ones, are presumptively waivable 513 U. S. 196, 200- 201 (1995); see also New York v. Hill, 528 U. S. 110, 114 (2000); Peretz v. United States, 501 U. S. 923, 936 (1991) (\"The most basic rights of criminal defendants are . . . subjec t to waiver \"). The presumpti on of waivabi lity holds true for the right to counsel. This Cour t has held repeatedly that a de\u00ad fendant may waive that right, both at trial and at the entry of a guilty plea, so long as the waiver is know ing and intelli\u00ad gent. Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 88 (2004); Faretta v. Cali\u00ad fornia, 422 U. S. 806, 835 (1975); Adam s v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 279 (1942); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464-465 (1938). Mich igan seeks a waiver no more extensive than those this Cour t has already sanc tioned at other stages of a criminal proceedi ng: It asks defendants con\u00ad victed by plea to waive the right to appoi nted counsel on appea l. There may be some nonwaivable rights: ones \"so funda\u00ad ment al to the reliability of the factnding process that they may never be waived without irreparably ng the federa l quot marks and brackets omitted). The right to appoi nted counsel on discreti onary appea l 15:54:14] PAGES Thomas, J., dissenti ng is not one of them. Even assumi ng that the assist ance of appel late counsel enhances the reliability of the factnding process by correc ting errors in that process, it cannot possi\u00ad bly be so fundament al to the process that its absence \"irrepa\u00ad rably discredit[ s]\" the federa l cour ts, particularly the Constituti on guarantees no right to an appea l at all, e. g., M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 110, 120. Further more , as I have ex\u00ad plained, the record of a plea proceedi ng is fully adequate to enable discreti onary review and, in turn, to permit the cor\u00ad rection of errors in the factnding process when necessary . Supra, at 634 (explai ning that a plea-con victed defendant does not face a record unre viewed by counsel, and does not lack any reasoned treatment of his claims). And, nally, even if the reliability of the appel late process rather than the trial process is the relevant considerati on here , the assist\u00ad ance of appel late counsel is not so fundament al to the ap\u00ad pellate process that its absence tion may be waived even if it benets society as well as criminal defendants). Petitioner emphasi zes the difcu lty of the choice to which Mich igan' s statute puts criminal defendants: proceed to trial and guarantee the appoi ntment of appel late counsel, or plead guilty and forgo that benet. But this Cour t has repeatedly recog nized that difcu lt choices are a necessary byproduc t of the criminal justice system, and of plea bargai ning in par\u00ad ticular. See, e. g., Mezzan atto, supra, at 210; Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 750 (1970). Mich igan' s waiver requires a choice no more demandi ng than others criminal defendants regularly face. B The major ity maintains, rst, that Halbert could not waive the right to appoi nted appel late counsel because Mich igan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the 545US2 Unit:$U73 [03-28-08 15:54:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN 639 Cite U. S. 605 (2005) Thomas, J., dissenti ng right can be waived, Halbert did not know ingly and intelli\u00ad gently waive it here . The Cour t is wrong in each respec t. 1 The major ity claims that \"[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recog nized right to appoi nted appel late counsel he could elect to forgo .\" Ante, at 623. This asser tion ap\u00ad parently refers to the Mich Mich. Comp . Laws Ann. \u00a7 770.3a (West 2000). At the time of Halbert's plea, the statute prov ided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he genera lly could not receive appoi nted appel late counsel. The major ity's reasoni ng is flawed for at least three reasons. First, the statement that \"Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recog nized right to appoi nted appel late counsel, \" ante, at 623, is either incor\u00ad rect or irrele vant. If we view (as we must) the waiver deci\u00ad sion from the perspec tive of Halbert and other defendants before entering a plea, the statement is wrong as a matter of Mich igan law. The Mich igan Cour t Rules appl plea expl ided that he was entitled to appoi nted appel late counsel if convicted following a trial. Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)( b) (Lexis 2001) (\"In a case involv ing a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the cour t must enter an order appoi nting a lawyer if the request is led within 42 days after sentenci ng or within the time for ling an appea l of right\"). Mich igan law thus gave Halbert, before enter ing a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appoi nted appel late counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appoi nted appel late counsel in most circumst ances. Alter natively , by stating that \"Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recog nized right to appoi nted appel late counsel, \" ante, at 623, the major\u00ad ity might mean that Mich igan law afforded Halbert no right to appoi nted PAGES Thomas, J., dissenti ng tion. If so, the statement is true but irrele vant. Of course Mich igan law did not afford Halbert a right to appoi nted counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes. But the questi on is whether , by pleadi ng no contest with knowledge of the conditi on (no paid counsel on appea l), Hal\u00ad bert accepted the conditi on and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appea l. In other words, the questi on is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right by pleading. Second, even if the major ity were correc t about Mich igan law, that is beside the point. At issue here is whether Hal\u00ad bert waived any federa l constituti onal right to appoi nted ap\u00ad pellate have enjoyed. Whether Mich igan law prov ides for such counsel says noth ing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federa l constitu\u00ad tional right to that effec t. That Mich igan, as a matter of state receiv ing appoi nted ap\u00ad pellate he pleaded guilty or no contest is irrele vant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federa l constituti onal right to such counsel. Third, the major ity implies that if the existence of a right to paid appel late counsel had been someth ing more than \"no[t] recog nized\" at the time of Halbert's plea, then the right would have been waivable , ibid. What this cryptic statement means is unclear . But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been expl icitly and uniformly rec\u00ad ognized by statute or case law may be waived. If that is what the statement means, then the major ity has outlawed all conditi onal waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it). I take it instead that the reference to rights that are some\u00ad thing more than \"no[t] recog nized,\" and hence waivable , ibid., means not just rights that are uniformly recog nized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled. If this under\u00ad standi ng of the major ity's rule is correc t, then the rule does not justi fy its claim that the constituti onal OPIN 641 J., dissenti ng whol ly unrecog nized. In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea. By that date , November 7, 2001, the Mich igan Supreme Cour t had issued Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the prac tice of deny ing the appoi ntment of appel late counsel on appl icati on for leave to appea l a plea\u00ad based conviction; and a Federa l District Cour t had enjoined Mich igan state judges from deny ing the appoi ntment of ap\u00ad pellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute , on the ground that the statute was unconstituti onal, Tesme r v. Kowalski, 114 F. Supp . 2d 622, 625-629 (ED Mich. 2000). The major ity appears to focus on the fact that Mich igan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrele vant to whether they possessed a federa l constituti onal right. The existence of that right was unsettled at the time of Halbert's plea; hence , on what I take to be the major ity's own terms, the right shou ld have been waivable .2 The major ity attempts to deflec t this criticism by saying that \"noth ing in Halbert's plea colloquy indicates that he waived an 'unsettled' . . . but assumed right to the assist ance of appoi nted appel late counsel, postplea. \" Ante, at 623, n. 7. But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a sepa\u00ad rate issue from, and is irrele vant to, the questi on at hand: whether the was recog nized, and hence waivable , by Halbert (or any defendant decidi ng how to plead), irre\u00ad spec tive of the content of the plea colloquy . 2 Moreover , the major ity's failure to make clear which sources of law are to be considered in decidi ng whether a right is \"no[t] recog nized,\" ante, at 623, and hence nonwaivable , is bound to wreak havoc. For instance , sup\u00ad pose that a defendant waived the right to appea l his sentence after the regional Cour t of Appea ls had held that the principle of Blakely v. Wash\u00ad ington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), did not apply to the United States Sentenci ng Guidel ines, but before this Cour t held the contrary in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005). The defendant could claim that, in his cir\u00ad cuit, the Sixth Amendment right against the appl of the Guidel ines was \"no[t] MICHIGAN Thomas, J., dissenti ng 2 The major ity compounds its error by expressi ng doubt in dictum that the right to appoi nted appel late counsel can be waived. Ante, at 624, n. 8. This ignores the well\u00ad established presumpti on of waivabi lity, e. g., Mezzan atto, 513 U. S., at 200-201; Hill, 528 U. S., at 114. By ignoring the presumpti on, the major ity effec tively reverses it, espousi ng an analysis that is \"direc tly contrary to the approach we have taken in the context of a broad array of constituti onal and statutory prov isions.\" Mezzan atto, For the propositi that Mich igan' s waiver requirement is unconsti\u00ad tutional, the major ity cites Douglas, 372 U. S., at 357-358, and M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 110-113, which explai ned that States cannot create unreasoned disti nctions between indi\u00ad gent and moneyed defendants. Ante, at 624, n. 8. These cases have noth ing to do with waiver; they deter mined only that certain rights existed, not that they both existed and were nonwaivable. The major ity seems to think that Mich igan' s waiver re\u00ad quirement arbitrar ily disti nguishes between indigents and more affluent persons. As I have explai ned, howe ver, the statute does no such thing. Rather , it sensibly differenti\u00ad ates between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea. Supra, at 614-615. The major ity's dic\u00ad tum fails to persuade . 3 In this case , the plea colloquy shows that Halbert's waiver was know ing and intelligent, and that any deciency in the plea colloquy was harmless. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2111; cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(h). First, Halbert understood he was waiv ing any appea l as of right: The trial cour t asked Halbert, \"You underst and if I accept your plea you are giving up or waiv ing any claim of an appea l as of right, \" and Halbert an\u00ad swered \"Yes, sir.\" App. 22. Second, explai ned the statutory excepti ons gover ning PGT: OPIN 643 (2005) J., dissenti ng might be appoi nted, and Halbert again indicated In the cour t's enumerati on of the limited conditi ons in which counsel might be appoi nted informed Halbert that counsel would not be appoi nted in other circum\u00ad stances. Third, at the end of the colloquy , the cour t asked counsel, \"Any other promises or considerati ons I shou ld be made aware of?\" App. 24, and \"Do counsel believe I've com\u00ad plied with the cour t rule regardi ng no contest pleas?\" id., at 25, both of which questi ons the prosecutor and defense attor\u00ad ney answered in the afrmative . Cf. Brad shaw v. Stumpf , ante, at 183 (\"Where a defendant is represented by compe\u00ad tent counsel, the cour t usua lly may rely on that counsel' s assurance that the defendant has been proper ly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleadi ng guilty\"). Fourth, the ingly made , volunt ary and accurate .\" App. 25. There can be no serious claim that Halbert would have changed his plea had the cour t prov ided further informati on. * * * Today the Cour t confers on defendants convicted by plea a right nowhere to be found in the Constituti on or this Cour t's cases. It does so at the expense of defendants whose claims are, on average , likely more meritorious. And it ignores that, even if such a right exists, it is fully waivable and was waived in this case. I 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 MAYLE , WARDEN v. FELIX certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the ninth circuit No. 04-563. Argued April 19, 2005 \u2014Decided June 23, 2005 Respondent Felix was convicted of murder and robbery in California state cour t and sentenced to life imprisonment. His current appl icati on for federa l habeas relief centers on two alleged trial-cour t errors, both in\u00ad volv ing the admissi on of out-of-cour t statements during the prosecutor 's case in chief but other wise unrelated. Felix had made inculpatory statements during pretr ial police interrogati on. He alleged that those statements were coerced, and that their admissi on violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-i ncrimination. He also alleged that the admissi on of a videot ape recordi ng of testi mony of a prosecuti on witness the Sixth Amendment' s Confront ation Clause . Felix's conviction was afrmed on appea l and became nal on August 12, 1997. Under the one-year limitation period imposed by the Antiter\u00ad rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( d)(1), Felix had until August 12, 1998, to le a habeas petiti on in federa l cour t. On May 8, 1998, in a timely led habeas petiti on, Felix asser ted his Confront ation Clause challenge to admissi on of the video\u00ad taped prosecuti on witness testi mony , but did not then challenge the ad\u00ad missi on of his own pretr ial statements. On January 28, 1999, over ve months after the August 12, 1998 expirati on of AEDP A's time limit and eight months after the cour t appoi nted counsel to represent him, Felix led an amended petiti on asser ting a Fifth Amendment objec tion to admissi on of his pretr ial statements. In response to the State's argu\u00ad ment that the Fifth Amendment claim was time barred, Felix asser ted the rule that pleadi ng amendments relate back to the ling date of the original pleadi ng when both the original plea and the amendment arise out of the same \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence set forth . pleadi ng,\" Fed. Rule Proc. 15(c)(2). Because his Fifth Amendment and Confront ation Clause claims challenged the constitu\u00ad tionality of the same criminal conviction, Felix urged, both claims arose out of the same \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence .\" The District Cour t dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time barred, and re\u00ad jected the Confront ation Clause claim on its merits. The Ninth Circuit afrmed as to the latter claim, but reversed the dismissa l of the coerced statements claim and remanded it for further proceedi ngs. In the cour t's view, the relevant \"transac for PGT: OPIN U. S. 644 (2005) Syllabus Felix's state-court trial and conviction.

Before a responsive pleadi ng is served, pleadi ngs may be amended once as a \"matter of course ,\" i. e., without seek ing cour t leave . Ibid.

That pleadi ng must \"speci fy all grounds for available to the petiti oner \" and \"state the facts suppor ting each ground. \" Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c). A prime purpose of Rule 2(c)'s demand that petiti oners plead with particularity is to assist the distr ict cour t in deter mining whether the State shou ld be ordered to \"show cause why the writ shou ld not be granted, \" \u00a72243, or the petiti on in\u00ad stead shou ld be summar ily dismissed without order ing a responsive pleadi ng.

Under that view, Felix's own pretr ial statements, newly raised in his amended peti\u00ad tion, would not relate back because they were separated in time and 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES PGT: witness testi mony .

Decisi ons apply ing Rule 15(c)(2) in the civil context illustrate that Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate , the statute of limitations; hence relati on back depends on the existence of a common core of operative facts uniti ng the original and newly asser ted claims. The Cour t disagrees with Felix's asser tion that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)'s relati on-back prov ision than t, transac tion, or occurrence\" in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580-581. There , the amended complai nt invoked a legal theory not sug\u00ad gested in the original complai nt and relied on facts not originally as\u00ad serted. Relati on back was nevertheless permitted. In Tiller, how\u00ad ever, there was but one \"occurrence ,\" the death of the petiti oner 's husband, which she attributed throughout to the respondent' s failure to prov ide a safe workplace . In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes, the videot aped witness testi mony in his original petiti on and his own interrogati on at a different time and place in his amended petiti on. Pp. 656-660. (c) Felix's contenti on homi ng in only on what makes those claims actionable in a habeas proceedi ng. Al\u00ad though his self-i ncrimination claim did not ripen until the prosecutor introduced his pretr ial statements at trial, the essentia l predicate for his Fifth Amendment claim was an extrajudicia l event, i. e., an out-of\u00ad cour t police interrogati on. The dispositive questi on in an adjudicati on of that claim would be the charac ter of the police interrogati on, speci \u00ad cally, did Felix answer volunt arily were his statements coerced. See Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, Rule 2(c)'s particularity-in-pleadi ng requirement, Confront ation Clause claim pleaded discretely , as would his self-i ncrimination claim. Each separate conger ies of facts suppor ting the grounds for re\u00ad lief, the Rule suggests, would delineate an \"occurrence .\" Felix's and the Ninth Circuit' s approach is boundless by compar ison, allowing a mis\u00ad cellany of claims for relief to be raised later rather than sooner and to relate back. If claims asser ted after the one-year period could be re\u00ad vived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sen\u00ad tence as a timely led claim, AEDP A's limitation period would have slim signicance .

The current controversy centers on two alleged errors at Felix's trial. Both involve the admissi on of out-of-cour t statements during the prosecutor 's case in chief, but the two are other wise unrelated. One prompted a Fifth Amend\u00ad ment self-i ncrimination objec tion originally raised in the trial cour t, the other , a Sixth Amendment Confront ation Clause challenge , also raised in the trial proceedi ngs. Felix's Fifth Amendment claim rested on the prosecuti on's introduc tion of statements Felix made during pretr ial police interrogati on. These statements were adduced at trial on direc t exami nation of the investigati ng ofcer . Felix urged that the police used coercive tactics to elicit the statements. Id., at 8-9.

Felix argued in response that the new claim related back to the date of his original petiti on.

They allow relati on back only when the claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely led claims, and not when the new claims depend upon events separate in \"both time and type\" from the originally raised episodes. Ibid. Because Felix's own pretr ial statements, newly raised in his amended petiti on, were separated in time and type from witness Williams' videot aped statements, raised in Fe\u00ad lix's original petiti on, the former would not relate back under the denition of \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence\" to which most Circuits adhere . We are not aware , in the run-of-the-mi ne civil proceedi ngs Rule 15 gover ns, of readi \"conduc t, ous as the constr uction the Ninth and Seventh Circuits have adopted for habeas cases.

That unremarkable appl icati on of the relati on-back rule bears little resemblance to the argument made by Felix and embraced by the dis\u00ad sent \u2014that all manner of factually and tempora lly unrelated conduc t may be raised after the statute of limitations has run and relate back, so long as the new and originally pleaded claims challenge the same conviction. See infra, U. S. 644 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ing to sell Coast al Plains to a third party did not relate back to claim based on creditor 's failure to retur n inventory to Coast al Plains, even though both claims were linked to credi\u00ad tor's alleged \"broader plan to destroy Coast al (CA9 1988) (where original complai nt challenged the manner in which an agency appl ied a regulation, an amendment challeng ing the agency' s \"conduc t in adopti ng the regulatio[n]\" did not relate back). See also Jackso n v. Suffo lk County Homicide Bu\u00ad reau, 135 F. 3d 254, 256 (CA2 1998) (although all of plaintiff's 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 claims arose out of a single state-cour t criminal proceedi ng, plaintiff's First Amendment claims did not arise out of the same conduc t as the originally asser ted excessive force claims, and therefore did not relate back). As these decisi ons illustrate , Rule 15(c)(2) relaxes, but does not obliterate , the statute of limitations; hence relati on back depends on the existence of a common \"core of operative facts\" uniti ng the original and newly asser ted claims. See Clippe r Exx press, 690 F. 2d, at 1259, n. 29; 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. , Federa l Prac tice and Procedure (2d ed. 1990). Felix asser ts that he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit ac\u00ad corded, no wider range for sion than key words \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence\" in Tiller v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580-581 (1945). We disagree . In Til\u00ad ler, a railroad worker was struck and killed by a railroad car. His widow sued under the Federa l Employers' Liabi lity Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a751 et seq., to recover for his wrong ful death. She initia lly alleged various negligent acts. In an amended complai nt, she added a claim under the Federa l Boiler In\u00ad spec tion Act for failure to prov ide the train's locomotive with a rear light. We held that the amendment related back, and therefore avoided a statute of limitations bar, even though the amendment invoked a legal theory not suggested by the original complai nt and relied on facts not originally asser Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES v. FELIX Opinion of the Cour t There was but one episode-i n-suit in Tiller, a worker 's death attributed from the start to the railroad' s failure to prov ide its employee with a reasonably safe place to work. The federa l rulemakers recog nized that persona l injury plaintiffs often cannot pinpoi nt the precise cause of an injury prior to discovery . See 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federa tice and Procedure \u00a7 1215, pp. ed. They therefore included in the Appendix to the Federa l Rules an illustrative form indicati ng that a persona l injury plaintiff could adequately state a claim for relief simply by alleging that the defendant negligently operated a certain instrument ality at a particular time and place . See Form 9, Complai nt for Negligence , Forms App., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc., 28 U. S. C. App., p. 829. The widow in Tiller met that meas\u00ad ure. She based her complai nt on a single \"occurrence ,\" an accident resu lting in her husband' s death. In contrast, Felix targeted separate episodes, the pretr ial police interrogati on of witness Williams in his original petiti on and his own in\u00ad terrogati on at a different time and place in his amended petiti on. Felix contends, howe ver, that his amended petiti on quali\u00ad es for relati on back because the trial itself is the \"transac\u00ad tion\" or \"occurrence\" that counts. See Brief for Respondent 21-23. Citing Chavez v. Mar tinez, 538 U. S. 760 (2003) (plu\u00ad rality opinion), Felix urges that neither the videot aped inter\u00ad view with witness Williams nor the pretr ial police interroga\u00ad tion to which Felix himself was exposed transgressed any constituti onal limitation. Until the statements elicited by the police were introduced at trial, Felix argues, he had no actionable claim at all. Both the confront ation right he timely presented and the privilege against self-i ncrimination he asser ted in his amended petiti on are \"trial right[ s],\" Felix underscores. Brief for Respondent 21 (emphasis deleted). His claims based on those rights, he maintains, are not \"sepa\u00ad rate,\" id., at 22; rather , they are related in time and type, for \"they arose on successive days during the trial and both 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN 661 Cite as: 545 U.

Felix articially truncates his claims by homi ng in only on what makes them actionable in a habeas proceedi ng. We do not here questi on his asser tion that his Fifth Amendment right did not ripen until his statements were admitted against him at trial. See Chavez, 538 U. S., at 766-767. Even so, the essentia l predicate for his self-i ncrimination claim was an extrajudicia l event, i. e., an out-of-cour t police interrogati on. The dispositive questi on in an adjudicati on of that claim would be the charac ter of Felix's conduc t, not in cour t, but at the police interrogati on, speci cally, did he answer volunt arily or were his statements coerced. See Haynes 373 U. S. 503, 513-514 (vol\u00ad ances\" surroundi the challenged confessi on\"). Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c), we earlier relief\" and to \"state the facts suppor ting each ground. \" Under that Rule, Felix's Confront ation Clause claim wou as wou ld his self\u00ad incrimination claim. Each separate conger ies of facts sup\u00ad porting the grounds for relief, the Rule suggests, would de\u00ad lineate an \"occurrence .\" Felix's approach, the approach that prevailed in the Ninth Circuit, is boundless by compar ison. A miscel lany of claims for relief could be raised later rather than sooner and relate back, for \"conduc t, transac tion, or oc\u00ad currence\" would be dened to encompass any pretr ial, trial, or post-tr ial error that could prov ide a basis for challeng ing the conviction. An approach of that breadth, as the Fourth Circuit observed, \"views 'occurrence' at too high a level of genera lity.\" Pittman, 209 F. 3d, at 318.6 6 The dissent builds a complex discussi on on an apparent assumpti on that claim preclusi on operates in habeas cases largely as it does in mine\u00ad run civil cases. See post, at 673-674. Ironica lly, the Cour t Congress enac ted AEDP A to advance the nality of crimi\u00ad nal convictions. See Rhines v. Weber, 544 U. S. 269, 276 (2005). To that end, it adopted a tight time line, a one-year limitation period ordinarily runni ng from \"the date on which the judg ment became nal by the conclusi on of direc t review or the expirati on of the time for seek ing such review,\" 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( d)(1)(A). If claims asser ted after the one\u00ad year period could be revived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely led claim, AEDP A's limitation period would have slim signicance . See 379 F. 3d, at 619 (Tallman, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part) (Ninth Circuit' s rule would permit \"the 'relati on back ' doctrine to swallow AEDP A's statute of limi\u00ad tation\"); Pittman, 209 F. 3d, at 318 (\"If we were to craft such a rule, it would mean that amendment s... would almost invariably be allowed even after the statute of limitations had expired, because most [habeas ] claims arise from a crimi\u00ad nal defendant' s under lying conviction and sentence .\"); Duf\u00ad fus, 174 F. 3d, at 338 (\"A prisoner shou ld not be able to asser t a claim other wise barred by the statute of limitations merely because he asser ted a separate claim within the limitations period.\"). The very purpose of Rule 15(c)(2), as the dissent notes, is to \"qua lify a statute of limitations.\" Post, at 666. would surv ive swift dismissa l were that so, for the very objec tive of the petiti on is to undo a nal judg ment after direc t appea ls have been ex\u00ad hausted or are time barred. On judicia l and legislative development of standards gover ning successive habeas petiti ons, standards that do not track the Rest atement of Judgments, see Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.

This argu\u00ad ment over looks a pleader 's right to amend without leave of cour t \"any time before a responsive pleadi ng is served. \" Rule 15(a). In federa l habeas cases that time can be rather long, as indeed it was in the instant case. See supra, at 651. Under Habeas Corpus Rule 4, a petiti on is not immediately served on the respondent. The judge rst exami nes the pleadi ng to deter mine whether appears . . . that the petiti oner is not relief.\" Only if the petiti on surv ives that preliminary inspec tion will the judge \"order the respondent to le an answer .\" In the inter im, the peti\u00ad tioner may amend his pleadi ng \"as a matter of course ,\" as Felix did in this very case. Rule 15(a). Accordi ngly, we do not regard Rule 15(a) as a rm check against petiti on amend\u00ad ments that present new claims dependent upon discrete facts after AEDP A's limitation period has run. 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN 664 MAYLE v. of the Cour t Our rejection of Felix's translati on of same \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence\" to mean same or sentence\" scarcely leaves Rule 15(c)(2) \"meani ngless in the habeas context, \" 379 F. 3d, at 615.

Both pleadi ngs related to evidence obtained at the same time by the same police depar tment. The Cour t of Appea ls approved relati on back. And in Woodward v. Williams, 263 F. 3d 1135, 1142 (CA10 2001), the appea ls cour t upheld relati on back where the original petiti on challenged the trial cour t's admissi on of recanted state\u00ad ments, while the amended petiti on challenged the cour t's refusa l to allow the defendant to show that the statements had been recanted. See also 3 J.

It is so ordered. Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens joins, dissenti ng. This case requires the Cour t to decide how the relati on back prov ision of Rule 15(c)(2) of the Federa l Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply in federa l habeas corpus cases, when neither text nor precedent prov ides clear guidance . I see noth ing in habeas law or prac tice that calls for the Cour t's narrow constr uction of the rule, and good reasons to go the other way, includi ng the unfor tunate consequence that the Cour t's view creates an unfair dispar ity between indi\u00ad gent habeas petiti oners and those able to afford their own counsel. I respec tfully dissent. I At the outset, there is need for care in underst andi ng the narrow scope of the problem this case presents. A habeas petiti oner 's oppor tunity to amend as a matter of course , without permissi on of the trial cour t, exists only before the responsive pleadi ng is served, and even then only once . Rule 15(a). After one amendment, or after the gover nment les the answer or other response , assumi ng one is even re\u00ad quired, see Habeas Corpus Rule 4, the prisoner may not amend without the cour t's leave or the gover nment' s consent, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a). While leave to amend \"sha ll be freely given when justice so requires, \" ibid., justice does, within the con ned circumst ances in which our decisi ons require appoi nt\u00ad ment of counsel for an indigent litigant at a critica l stage to ensure his meani ngful access to justice . See Souter, J., dissenti ng after all, have to require it, and the District Cour ts will pre\u00ad sumably say no, for example , in the face of unjusti able delay or threatened prejudice to the State. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962); see also Brief for Professor Arthur R. Miller et al. as Ami ci Curiae 20-21 (descr ibing reasons cour ts regularly deny leave to amend and citing cases); 6 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane Miller) (discussi ng reasons leave to amend may be and often is de\u00ad nied, includi ng delay and prejudice). The n for \"unconstrai ned\" recourse to petiti on amendments, ante, at 663, is thus misplaced. The limited oppor tunity to amend also suppl ies perspec\u00ad tive claim that Felix's readi ng of the relati on back rule would under mine the 1-year limitation period of the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDP A) and the statute' s concomit ant concer n nality of 663. In fact, AEDP A's ob\u00ad jectives bear little weight in the analysis, because the very point of every relati on back rule is to qualify a statute of limitations, and Rule 15(c) \"is based on the notion that once litigati on involv ing particular conduc t or a given transac tion or occurrence has been instituted, the parties are not entitled to the protec tion of the statute of limitations against the later asser tion by amendment of defenses or claims that arise out of the same conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence as set forth in the original pleadi ng.\" 6A Wright & Miller \u00a7 1496, at 64. AEDP A's statute of limitations, like any other , may be trumped by relati ng back when the subjec t of the amendment arises out of the same conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence descr ibed in the original pleadi ng, but that alone does not help us gure out what conduc t, transac tion, or oc\u00ad currence is the same . II Felix's disputed right to amend with relati on back effec t turns entirely , as the Cour t says, ante, at 656, on how nar\u00ad545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN 667 Cite S. 644 (2005) Souter, J., dissenti ng rowly or how broadly the tripartite author ization for relati on back ought to be constr ued: whether the relevant \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence\" 1 to which a habeas petiti on refers includes the under lying trial (which resu lted in the custody being challenged) or is limited to the set of facts under lying each trial ruling claimed to be constituti onally defec and the in\u00ad terrogati on that produced the incriminating statement). If the former, a habeas petiti oner will have the benet of rela\u00ad tion any amendment raisi ng error subjec t to the distr ict judge' s discreti on to deny leave except for the one amendment of right; if the latter , a petiti oner is effec\u00ad tively precluded from mak ing any amendment unless a single trial ruling amounts to disti nct errors or an under lying fact is the subjec t of disti nct rulings, notw ithst s evident relati on back in habeas proceed\u00ad ings, see 28 U. Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Ha\u00ad beas Corpus Rule 11. The text alone does not tell us the answer , for either the facts speci c to the claim or the trial as a whole could be the relevant \"conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence .\" The Cour t assumes that the former approach is correc t and then pro\u00ad ceeds to explai n, based on that assumpti on, the inrmity of a contrary approach. For example , the Cour t asser ts that under Felix's rule, \"all manner of factually and tempora lly unrelated conduc t may be raised after the statute of limita\u00ad tions has run . . . .\" Ante, at 658, n. 5. But in saying this the Cour t presumes that the relevant transac tion is what occurred outside the cour troom. Felix's entire argument is that the proper transac tion is instead what occurred in cour t, namely , the impositi on of the conviction that justi es the challenged custody . If he is right, then the Cour t's asser tion is incorrec t, for what Felix seeks to add is a claim not about 1 There is a tendency toward the gest alt in readi ng the phrase , but the three items are disti nct, and a party claiming the benet of the rule need satisfy only one. 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES unrelated conduc t,\" ibid., but about conduc t that occurred at the same trial as the conduc t addressed in the initia l petiti on. That newly addressed con\u00ad duct will hardly be \"tempora lly unrelated\" to what was pre\u00ad viously targeted; it likely will have occurred on the same day of trial as the original conduc t or within a few days. Nor will it be \"factually... unrelated\" to the previously raised in-cour t conduc t, for it will almost certainly involve the same judge , the same parties and attor neys, the same cour troom, and the same jurors. Agai n, my point is just that much of the Cour t's argument lacks force because it assumes that the proper transac tion is what occurred outside the cour t\u00ad room rather than inside , when that is the questi on we must answer . The Cour t also cauti ons that \"it would be anoma lous to allow relati on back under Rule 15(c)(2) based on a broader readi ng of the words 'conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence' in federa l habeas proceedi ngs than in ordinary civil litigati on.\" Ante, at 663. The cases the Cour t cites to establish the scope of civil relati on back, howe ver, see ante, at 657-660, simply stand for the propositi on that an amendment relates back only if it deals with the same conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence . Felix does not purport to claim anyth ing more .2 2 In any event, it is not clear why it is more \"capaci ous,\" ante, at 657, to regard a single trial lasti ng days or weeks as one transac tion or occur\u00ad rence than it is, for example , to view numerous separate protests led with the Interst ate Commerce Commissi on over a period of two years (each in response to a different proposed tariff amendment) as one trans\u00ad action or occurrence , see Clippe r Exx press v. Rocky Mountain Motor Tariff Bureau, Inc., 690 F. 2d 1240, 1260, n. 29 (CA9 1982) (\"The protests involve a single transac tion or occurrence\" (emphasis deleted)), cited ante, at 657-658. The Cour t responds that in Clippe r Exx press the amendment was \"tied to the same operative facts as those initia lly alleged. \" Ante, at 658, n. 5. But as just noted, those \"operative facts\" (i. e., the relevant transac tion) consisted of a number of separate protests led with the Interst ate Com\u00ad merce Commissi on over a period of two years, each in response to a differ\u00ad ent proposed tariff amendment. This is, to say the least, a rather expan\u00ad sive transac tion, much more so in my view a single trial involv ing S. 644 (2005) Souter, J., dissenti ng At rst glance , an argument for readi ng generous notice-pleadi ng standard for the benet of ordinary civil plaintiffs under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), see Conley v. Gibson, 355 U. S. 41, 47 (1957), Habeas Corpus Rule 2(c) requires habeas petiti oners to \"speci fy all the grounds for relief available ,\" and to \"state the facts suppor t\u00ad ing each ground. \" The Cour t implies that because pleadi ng must be factually c, tion, or occur\u00ad rence\" of Federa of Civil Procedure 15(c) be spe\u00ad cically factual to a para llel degree; as the Cour t puts it, a habeas petiti oner will plead claims \"discretely ,\" ante, at 661, such that each ground for relief \"wou ld delineate an 'occur\u00ad rence ,' \" ibid. But this does not follow; all that follows from \"discret[ e]\" pleadi ng is that each claim would delineate a sep\u00ad arate ground for relief, whate ver may be the conduc t, trans\u00ad action, or occurrence out of which the claims arise. As Til\u00ad ler v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 323 U. S. 574 (1945), and the other civil cases the Cour t cites demonstrate , see ante, at 657-660, relati on back is regularly allowed when an amendment raises a separate claim for relief arising out of the same transac tion or occurrence , no matter how discretely that claim might be stated. Indeed, this is what the text anticipates; Rule 15(c)(2) permits relati on back when \"the claim or defense\" asser ted in the amendment arises out of the same conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence set forth in the original pleadi ng. That is, the same conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence can suppor t multiple , discrete claims for relief. Nor is there any policy under lying the particular habeas pleadi ng rule that requires a more grudging relati on back standard. As the Cour t concedes, ante, at 656, the purpose of the heightened pleadi ng standard in habeas cases is to help a distr ict cour t weed out frivolous petiti ons before call\u00ad (for all claims stemmi ng from it) the same judge , the same parties, the same attor neys, the same jury, the same indictment, and so 545US2 Unit:$U74 [04-07-08 12:22:35] PAGES Souter, J., dissenti ng ing upon the State to answer .

In sum, Felix's claims are not outside the text of Rule 15(c)(2). Then there are a number of indicati ons that Congress would not want the rule read narrowly , the rst center ing on the word \"transac tion.\" That term not only goes to the breadth of relati on back, but also to the scope of claim preclu\u00ad sion. E. g., Kreme r v. Chemical Constr. Corp., 456 U. S. 461, 482, n. 22 (1982) (\"Res judicat a has recently been taken to bar claims arising from the same transac tion even if brought under different statutes . . . \"); accord, 1 all rights . . . with respec t to all or any part of the transac tion, or series of connec ted transac tions, out of which the action arose\"). For purposes of claim preclusi on in ha\u00ad beas cases, the scope of \"transac tion\" is crucial in apply ing AEDP A's limitation on second or successive petiti ons: with very narrow excepti ons, federa l habeas limits a prisoner to only one petiti on challeng ing his conviction or sentence . See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2244( b)(1).7 The prov isions limiting second or successive habeas petiti ons regard the relevant \"transac\u00ad tion\" for purposes of habeas claim preclusi on as the trial that yielded the conviction or sentence under attack; once a chal\u00ad lenge to that conviction or sentence has been rejected, other challenges are barred even if they raise different claims. By contrast, under the Cour t's view of Rule 15(c) that the rele\u00ad vant \"transac tion\" is the facts or conduc t under lying each discrete claim, a prisoner shou ld be allowed to le a second 7 The Cour t asser ts that my argument here \"builds . . on an apparent assumpti on that claim preclusi on operates in habeas cases largely as it does in mine-run civil cases. \" Ante, at 661, n. 6.

Turpin, U. dissenti ng habeas petiti on so long as it is based on different under lying facts or conduc t (i. e., on what the Cour t considers a separate \"transac tion\"). The Cour t thus adopts, for purposes of rela\u00ad tion back in habeas cases, a denition of \"transac tion\" differ\u00ad ent from the one Congress apparently intended for purposes of claim preclusi on in habeas cases. Judge Easterbrook ex\u00ad plained this tensi on in Ellzey v. United States, 324 F. 3d 521 (CA7 2003), and the Cour t offers no evidence that Congress would have decreed any such apparent anoma ly within the body of habeas standards.8 There is, rather , a fair indicati on that Congress would have intended other wise, in the fact that it has already placed limits on the right of some habeas petiti oners to amend their petiti ons. In Chapter 154 of Title 28, prov iding specia l pro\u00ad cedures for petiti oners subjec t to capit al sentences in certain States, Congress speci cally pro\u00ad hibited amendment of the original habeas petiti ons after the ling of the answer , except on the grounds speci ed for sec\u00ad ond or successive petiti ons under 28 U. S. \u00a7 2244( b). See \u00a7 2266( oppor tunity to amend (and thus to take advant age of relati on back) makes sense owing to capit al petiti in\u00ad prov ision it enac ted also helps us make sense of Rule 15(c) in the usua l habeas case where a prisoner has no incentive to string the process out. For Congress has shown not only that it knows how to limit amendment in habeas cases, but also that it speci cally con\u00ad sidered the subjec t of limiting amendment in such cases and chose not to limit amendment in the ordinary ones. 8 The Cour t is mist aken in stating that I \"wou ld read Rule 15(c)(2)' s words, 'conduc t, transac tion, or occurrence ,' into... 28 U. 2244( b) and 2255, \u00b68 . . . .\" Ante, at 662, n. 6.

In prac tical terms, the signi\u00ad cance of the right to amend arises from the fact that in the over whelmi ng major ity of cases, the original petiti on is the work of a pro se petiti oner .

See Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) (requir\u00ad ing counsel \"[i]f an evidentiary hear ing is warranted\"). And the judge almost certainly will not appoi nt counsel until after the preliminary review of the petiti on to see whether it plainly warrants dismissa l. See Rule 4. Where a peti\u00ad tion (even in its pro se form) has surv ived this review by show ing enough merit to justi fy appoi nting counsel, it makes no sense to say that counsel (appoi nted because of that ap\u00ad parent merit) precluded from exercisi ng profes\u00ad sional judg ment when that judg ment calls for addi ng a new ground for relief that would relate back to the ling of the original petiti on. For by hobbl ing counsel this way, the Cour t limits the capacity of appoi nted counsel to prov ide the professi onal serv ice that a paid , J., dissenti ng can give a client. The lawyer hired at the start of the pro\u00ad ceedi ng will be able to draf t an original petiti on cont aining all the claims revealed to his trained eye; if the same lawyer is appoi nted by the cour t only after the petiti oner has dem\u00ad onstrated some merit in an original pro se ling, he and his prisoner client will have no right to state all claims by addi ng to the original petiti on, unless the lawyer happens to be ap\u00ad pointed and able to get up to speed before the statute of limitations runs out. The rule the Cour t adopts today may not make much difference to prisoners with enough money to hire their own counsel; but it will matter a great deal to poor prisoners who need appoi nted counsel to see and plead facts show ing a colorable basis for relief.9 The Cour t of Appea ls got it right, and I respec tfully dissent. 9 It is not that I see the Cour t's rule as constituti onally troubl ing. But this case requires us to apply text that is ambig uous, and the Cour t's resoluti on of that ambig uity is based on the assumpti on that when Con\u00ad gress author ized the appoi ntment of counsel in habeas cases, it would have intended the appoi nted lawyer to have one hand tied behind his back, as compared with an attor ney hired by a prisoner with money . That is not in my view a sound assumpti on. (The Cour t also observes that in this case counsel had plenty of time to le an amended petiti on, but that fact cannot drive this decisi on, for the rule the Cour t adopts today will of course apply in cases other than this one.) 545US2 Unit:$U75 [03-26-08 20:12:05] PAGES PGT: Syllabus VAN ORDEN v. PERR Y, in his official cap acity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN , STATE PRESER VATION BOARD , et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the fifth circuit No. 03-1500. Argued March 2, 2005 \u2014Decided June 27, 2005 Among the 21 histor ical markers and 17 monuments surroundi ng the Texas State Capitol is a 6-foot-h igh monol ith inscr ibed with the Ten Commandments. The legislative record illustrates that, after accepti ng the monument from the Frater nal Order of Eagles\u2014a national socia l, civic, and patr iotic organi zation\u2014the State selec ted a site for it based on the recommendati on of the state organi zation that maintains the capitol grounds. Petitioner , an Austin resident who encounters the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 suit seek ing a declarati on that the monument' s placement violates the First Amendment' s Establishment Clause and an injunc tion requir\u00ad ing its remova l. Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause , the District Cour t found that the State had a valid secu lar pur\u00ad pose in recog nizing and re\u00ad duce juveni le delinquency , and a reasonable observer , mindfu l of history , purpose , and context, would not conclude that this passive mon\u00ad ument conveyed the message that the State endorsed religion. The Fifth Circuit afrmed. Held: The judg ment is afrmed. 351 F. 3d 173, afrmed. The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy , and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Establishment Clause allows the display of a monument inscr ibed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds. Reconci ling the strong role played by religion and religious traditi ons throughout our Nati on's history , see Scho ol Dist. of Abington Towns hip v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203, 212-213, with the principle that gover nment al interventi on in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom requires that the Cour t neither abdicate its responsibi lity to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hosti lity to religion, e. g., Zorach v. 343 U. S. 306, 313-314. Whil e the Cour t has someti mes pointed to Lemo n v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, for the gover ning test, Lemo n is not usefu l in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erec ted on PERR Y Syllabus its capitol grounds. Instead, the analysis shou ld be driven by both the monument' s nature and the Nati on's history . From at least 1789, there has been an unbroken history of ofcia l acknowledg ment by all three branches of gover nment of religion's role in Amer ican life. Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 674. Texas' display of the Commandments on gover nment proper ty is typical of such acknowledg ments. Represen\u00ad tations of the Commandments appear throughout this Cour t and its grounds, as well as the Nati on's Capit al. Moreover , the its building, have recog nized the role the Decalogue plays in Amer ica's heritage. See, e. g., McGowan v. Mar yland, 366 U. S. 420, 442, 462. Whil e the Commandments are religious, they have an undeni\u00ad able histor ical meani ng. Simply having religious content or promoti ng a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afou l of the Establishment Clause . See, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly , supra, at 680, 687. There are, of course , limits to the gover nment' s display of religious mes\u00ad sages or symbols. For example , this Cour t held unconstituti requir ing the posti of the Ten Commandments in every publ ic schoolroom. Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, 41-42. However, neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stone's holdi ng would extend beyond the context of publ ic schools to a legis\u00ad lative chamber , see Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783, or to capitol grounds. Texas' placement of the Commandments monument on its capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted element ary school students every day. Indeed, petiti oner here apparently walked by the monu\u00ad ment for years before bringing this suit. Schempp , supra, and Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, disti nguished. Texas has treated its capitol grounds monuments as representi ng severa l strands in the State's politi\u00ad cal and legal history . The inclusi on of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual signicance , partaking of both religion and gover nment, that cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause . Pp. 683-692. Justice Breyer concluded that this is a difcu lt border line case where none of the Cour t's various tests for evaluati ng Establishment Clause questi ons can substitute for the exercise of legal judg ment. See, e. g., Scho ol Dist. of Abington Towns hip v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203, 305 (Goldberg , J., concurr ing). That judg ment is not a persona l judg ment. Rather , as in all constituti onal cases, it must reflec t and remai n faith\u00ad ful to the under lying purposes of the First Amendment' s Religion Clauses\u2014to assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, to avoid the religious divisiveness that promotes socia l confl ict, and to maintain the separati on of church and state. No exac t formula can dictate a resoluti on to fact-intensive cases such 677 (2005) Syllabus Despite the Commandments' religious message , an inquiry into the con\u00ad text in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also convey a secu lar mora l message about proper standards of socia l conduc t and a message about the histor ic relati on between those standards and the law. The circumst ances surroundi ng the monument' s placement on the capitol grounds and its physica l set\u00ad ting prov ide a strong , but not conclusive , indicati on that the Command\u00ad ments' text as used on this monument conveys a predomi nantly secu lar message . The deter minative factor here , howe ver, is that 40 years passed in which the monument' s presence , legally speak ing, went un\u00ad challenged (until the single legal objec tion raised by petiti oner). Those 40 years suggest more strong ly than can any set of formulaic tests that few indiv idua ls, whate ver their belief systems, are likely to have under\u00ad stood the monument as amounti ng, in any iment al way, to gover nment effor establish religion. See ibid. The publ ic vis\u00ad iting the capitol grounds is more likely to have considered the religious aspec t of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader mora l and histor ical message reflec tive of a cultura l heritage. For these reasons, the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constituti onal line. Pp. 698-705. Rehnquist , C.

Opinion of Rehnquist , C. J. SENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRA TERN AL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961. \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 21. The legislative record surroundi ng the State's accept ance of the monument from the Eagles\u2014a national socia l, civic, and patr iotic organi zation\u2014is limited to legislative journal entr ies. After the monument was accepted, the State se\u00ad lected a site for the monument based on the recommendati on of the state organi zation responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The Eagles paid the cost of erec ting the monument, the dedicati on of which was presided over by two state legislators. Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan and a resi\u00ad dent of Austin. At one time he was a licensed lawyer , hav\u00ad ing graduated from Souther n Methodist Law School. Van Orden testi ed that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds. His visits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in the Supreme Cour t building, which is located just northwest of the Capitol building. Forty years after the monument' s erec tion and six years after Van Orden began to encounter the monument fre\u00ad quently , he sued numerous state ofcia ls in their ofcia l ca\u00ad pacities under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, seek ing both a declarati on that the monument' s placement violates the Establishment Clause and an injunc tion requir ing its re\u00ad mova l. After a bench trial, the District Cour t held that the monument did not contravene the Establishment Clause . It found that the State had a valid secu lar purpose in recog niz\u00ad ing and commendi ng the Eagles for their effor ts to reduce juveni le delinquency . The District Cour t also deter mined that a reasonable observer , mindfu l of the history , purpose , and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State was seek ing to en\u00ad dorse religion.

S. 923 (2004), and now afrm. Our cases, Janusl ike, point in two direc tions in apply ing the Establishment Clause . One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious traditi ons throughout our Nati on's history . As we observed in Scho ol Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203 (1963): \"It is true that religion has been closely identi ed with our history and gover nment. . . The fact that the Foundi ng Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clear ly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compac t to the Constituti on itself . . . . It can be truly said, therefore , that today , as in the beginning, our national life reflec ts a religious people who, in the words of Madison, are 'earnestly pray ing, as . . . in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawg iver of the Univers e... guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [blessi ng .... ]'\" Id., at 212-213.2 The other face looks toward the principle that gover nment al interventi on in religious matters can itself endanger reli\u00ad gious freedom. This case , like all Establishment Clause challenges, pre\u00ad sents us with the difcu lty of respec ting both faces. Our instituti ons presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these institu\u00ad tions must not press religious observances upon their citi\u00ad zens. One face looks to the past in acknowledg ment of our Nati on's heritage, while the other looks to the present in demandi ng a separati on between church and state. Recon\u00ad ciling these two faces requires that we neither abdicate our 2 See also Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.

See, e. g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709 (2005); Corporation of Presi ding Bisho p of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sain ts v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327 (1987); Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U.

Whate ver may be the fate of the Lemo n test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence , we think it not usefu l in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erec ted on its Capitol grounds. Instead, our anal\u00ad ysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our Nati on's history . As we explai ned in Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U.

For example , a large statue of Moses holdi ng the Ten Commandments, alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul, has over looked the rotunda of the Library of Congress' Jefferson Building since 1897. And the Jefferson Building's Great Readi ng Room cont ains a sculpture of a woman beside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from the Old Testament (Micah 6:8). A meda llion with two tablets depic ting Command\u00ad decorates the floor Nati Inside the Depar tment of a statue entitled \"The Spir it of Law\" has two tablets representi ng the Ten Commandments lying at its feet. In front of the Rona ld Reagan Building is another sculpture that includes a depic tion of the Ten Commandments.

Moses is also promi nently featured in the Cham\u00ad ber of the United States House of Represent atives.9 Our opinions, like our building, have recog nized the role the Decalogue plays in Amer ica's heritage.

These displays and recog nitions of the Ten Commandments bespeak the on of reli\u00ad gious ments. Of course , the Ten Commandments are religious\u2014they were so viewed at their incepti on and so remai n. The monu\u00ad ment, Accordi ng to Judeo-Chr istian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawg iver as well as a religious leader . And the Ten Commandments have an undeniable having religious content or promoti ng a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afou l of the Establishment Clause . See Lynch v.

There are, of course , limits to the display of religious mes\u00ad sages or symbols. For example , we held unconstituti onal a Kentucky statute requir ing the posti ng the Ten Com\u00ad mandments in every publ ic schoolroom. Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per curiam).

Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 583-584 (1987). Compare Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 596-597 (1992) (holdi ng a prayer at with Marsh v. Chambe rs, supra (upholdi ng a prayer in the state Indeed, wards v.

Neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stone's holdi ng would extend to a legislative chamber , see Marsh v. Chambe rs, supra, or to capitol grounds.11 The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text con\u00ad fronted element ary school students every day. Indeed, Van Orden, the petiti oner here , apparently walked by the monu\u00ad ment for a number of years before bringing this lawsuit. The monument is therefore also quite different from the prayers involved in Schempp and Lee v. Weisman. Texas has treated its Capitol grounds monuments as representi ng the severa l strands in the State's politica l and legal history . The inclusi on of the Ten Commandments monument in this 11 Nor does anyth ing suggest that Stone would extend to displays of the Ten Commandments that lack a \"plai nly religious,\" \"pre-emi nent pur\u00ad pose ,\" id., See Edwards v.

We cannot say that Texas' display of this monument violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls is afrmed. It is so ordered. Justice Scalia, concurr ing. I join the opinion of The Chief Justice because I think it accurately reflec ts our current Establishment Clause juris\u00ad prudence \u2014or at least the Establishment Clause jurispru\u00ad dence we currently apply some of the time. I would prefer to reach the same resu lt by adopti ng an Establishment Clause jurisprudence that is in accord with our Nati on's past and present prac tices, and that can be consistently appl ied\u2014 the centra l relevant feature of which is that there is noth ing unconstituti onal in a State's favor ing religion genera lly, hon\u00ad oring God through publ ic prayer and acknowledg ment, or, in a the Ten Command\u00ad ments. See McCrear y County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 885-894 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). Justice Thomas, concurr ing. The Cour t holds that the Ten Commandments monument found on the Texas State Capitol grounds does not violate the Establishment Clause . Rather than trying to suggest meani nglessness where there meani ng, The Chief recog nizes that the monument has \"religious signicance .\" Ante, at 690. He proper ly recog nizes the role of religion in this Nati on's and the permissibi lity of gover acknowledg ing that history . Ante, at 686-688. For those reasons, I join The Chief Justice 's opinion in full. This case would be easy if the Cour t were willing to aban\u00ad don the inconsistent guideposts it has adopted (2005) 693 Thomas, J., concurr ing Establishment Clause challenges,* and retur n to the original meani ng of the Clause . I have previously suggested that the Clause' s text and history \"resis[ t] incor porati on\" against the States. See Elk Grove Unied Scho ol Dist. v. Newdo w, 542 U. S. 1, 45-46 (2004) (opinion concurr ing in judg ment); see v. Simmo ns-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 677-680, and n. 3 (2002) (concurr ing opinion). If the Establishment Clause does not restrai n the States, then it has no appl icati on here , where only state action is at issue . Even if the Clause is incor porated, or if the Free Exercise Clause limits the power of States to establish religions, see Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 728, n. 3 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurr ing), our task would be far simpler if we retur ned to the original meani ng of the word \"establishment\" than it is under the various approaches this Cour t now uses. The Framers understood an establishment \"necessar [to] concurr ing in judg ment); Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.

S. 668, 679-681 (1984) (\"[W]e have repeatedly emphasi zed our unwillingness to be con ned to any single test or criterion in this sensitive area\"). 545US2 Unit:$U75 PERR Y Thomas, J., concurr ing free from coercive state establishments. \" Newdo w, supra, at 53 (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment). There is no questi on that, based on the original meani ng of the Establishment Clause , the Ten Commandments dis\u00ad play at issue here is constituti onal. In no sense does Texas compel petiti oner Van Orden to do anyth ing. The only in\u00ad jury to him is that he takes offense at seeing the monument as he passes it on his way to the Texas Supreme Cour t Li\u00ad brary . He need not stop to read it or even to look at it, let alone to express suppor t for it or adopt the Commandments as guides for his life. The mere presence of the monument along his path involves no coerci on and thus does not violate the Establishment Clause . Retur ning to the original meani ng would do more than simplify our task. It also would avoid the pitfa lls present in the Cour t's current approach to such challenges. This Cour t's precedent elevates the trivial to the proverbia l \"fed\u00ad eral case ,\" by mak ing benig n signs and posti ngs subjec t to challenge . Yet even as it does so, the Cour t's precedent at\u00ad tempts to avoid declar ing all religious symbols and words of longst andi ng traditi on unconstituti onal, by ing them of little religious signicance . Even when the Cour t's cases recog nize that such symbols have religious meani ng, they adopt an unhappy compromise that fails fully to account for either the adherent' s or the nonadherent' s be\u00ad liefs, and prov ides no principled way to choose between them. Even worse , the incoherence of the Cour t's decisi ons in this area renders the Establishment Clause impenetra\u00ad ble and incapable of consistent appl icati on. All told, this Cour that is hardly new. See Newdo w, supra, at 45, n. 1 (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment) (collecting cases). First, this Cour t's precedent permits even the slightest publ ic recog nition of religion to constitute an establishment of religion. For example , indiv J., concurr ing cour thouse have successfu lly challenged as an Establishment Clause violati on a sign at the cour thouse alerting the publ ic that the building was closed for Good Friday and cont aining a 4-inch-h igh . 743, and n. 2, 746-747 (ED Ky. 1997), aff'd on other grounds, 173 F. 3d 568, 576 (CA6 1999). Similarly, a park ranger has claimed that a cross erec ted to honor World War I veterans on a rock in the Mojave Deser t Preserve violated the Establishment Clause , and won. See Buono v. (CD Cal. If a cross in the middle of a deser t establishes a religion, then no religious observance is safe from challenge . Still other suits have charged that city seals cont aining religious symbols violate the Establishment Clause . See, e. g., Robin\u00ad son v. Edmo nd, 68 F. 3d 1226 (CA10 1995); Mur tin, 947 F. 2d 147 (CA5 1991); Friedm an v. Board of of Bernalillo Cty., 781 F. 2d 777 (CA10 1985) (en banc). In every instance , the litigants are mere \"[p]assersby . . . free to ignore [such symbols or signs], or even to turn their backs, just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of gover nment speech. \" County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 664 (1989) (Ken\u00ad nedy , J., ing in judg ment in part and dissenti ng in part). Second, in a seemi ng attempt to balance out its willingness to consider almost any acknowledg ment of religion an estab\u00ad lishment, in other cases Members of this Cour t have con\u00ad cluded that the term or symbol at issue has no religious meani ng by virtue of its ubiquity or rote ceremonia l invoca\u00ad tion. See, e. g., id., at 630-631 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment); Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 716-717 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenti ng). But words such as \"God\" have religious signicance . For exam\u00ad ple, just last Term this Cour t had before it a challenge to the recit ation of the Pledge of Allegiance , J., concurr ing phrase \"one Nati on under God. \" The declarati on that our country is \" 'one Nati on under God' \" necessar ily \"ent ail[s] an afrmati on that God exists. \" Newdo w, 542 U. S., at 48 (Thomas, J., concurr ing in judg ment). This phrase is thus anathema to those who reject God' s existence and a valida\u00ad tion of His existence to those who accept it. Telling either nonbel ievers or believers that the words \"under God\" have no meani ng contradic ts to be true. More\u00ad over , repetiti on does not depr ive religious words or symbols of their traditi onal meani ng. Words like \"God\" are not vul\u00ad garities for which the shock value diminishes with each suc\u00ad cessive utterance . Even when nize the religious meani ng of symbols or words, that recog nition fails to re\u00ad spec t fully religious belief or disbel ief. This Cour t looks for the meani ng to an observer of indeter minate religious afli\u00ad knows all the circumst ances surroundi ng a challenged display . See, e. g., Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 780 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment) (presum\u00ad ing that a reasonable observer is \"aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious display appears\"). In looking to the view of this unusua lly informed observer , this Cour t inquires whether the sign or display the ancillary message to . . . nonadherents 'that they are outsiders, not full members of the politica l community , and an accompany ing message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the politica l commu\u00ad nity.' \" Santa Fe Inde penden t Scho ol Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 309-310 (2000) (quoti ng Lynch, supra, at 688 (O'C on\u00ad nor, J., concurr ing)). This analysis is not fully satisfy ing to either nonadherents or adherents. For the nonadherent, who may well be more sensitive than the hypothetica l \"reasonable observer ,\" or who may not know all the facts, this test fails to capture completely the honest and deeply felt offense he takes from 545US2 Unit:$U75 [03-26-08 20:12:05] J., concurr ing the gover nment conduc t. For the adherent, this analysis takes no account of the message sent by remova l of the sign or display , which may well appear to him to be an act hosti le to his religious faith. The Cour t's foray into religious mean\u00ad ing either gives insufcient weight to the views of nonadher\u00ad ents and adherents alike, or it prov ides no principled way to choose between those views. In sum, this Cour t's effor t to assess religious meani ng is fraught with futility. Finally, the very \"flexibi lity\" of this Cour t's Establishment Clause precedent leaves it incapable of consistent appl ica\u00ad tion. See Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 640 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng) (criticizing the Lemo n test' s any principled rationale\" (inter nal quot ation marks omitted)). The inconsistency between the decisi ons the Cour t reaches today in this case and in Mc- Crear y County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, p. 844, only compounds the confusi on. The unintelligibility of this Cour t's precedent raises the further concer n that, either in appearance or in fact, adjudi\u00ad cation of Establishment Clause challenges turns on judicia l predi lections. See, e. g., Harris v. Zion, 927 F. 1401, 1425 (CA7 1991) (Easterbrook, J., dissenti ng) (\"Line draw ing in this area will be erratic and heav ily influenced by the per\u00ad sona l views of the judges\"); post, at 700(Breyer, J., concur\u00ad ring in judg ment) (\"I see no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal judg ment\"). The outcome of constituti onal cases ought to rest on rmer grounds than the persona l pref\u00ad erences of judges. Much, if not all, of this would be avoided if the Cour t would retur n to the views of the Framers and adopt coerci on as the touchstone for our Establishment Clause inquiry . Every acknowledg ment of religion would not give rise to an Establishment Clause claim. Cour ts would not act as theo\u00ad logical commissi mat\u00ad ters. Most impor tant, our precedent would be capable of consistent and coherent appl icati on. While J., concurr ing in judg ment rectly rejects the challenge to the Ten Commandments mon\u00ad ument on the Texas Capitol grounds, a more fundament al reth inking of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence re\u00ad mains in order . Justice Breyer, concurr ing in the judg ment. In Scho ol Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203 (1963), Justice Goldberg , joined by Justice Harlan, wrote , in respec t to the First Amendment' s Religion Clauses, that there is \"no simple and clear measure which by precise appl icati on can readi ly and invariably demark the permissi\u00ad ble from the imper missible .\" Id., at 306 (concurr ing opin\u00ad ion). One must refer instead to the basic purposes of those Clauses. They seek to \"assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all.\" Id., at 305. They seek to avoid that divisiveness based upon religion that pro\u00ad motes socia l v. Simmo ns-Harris, S. 639, 717-729 ng). They seek to main\u00ad tain that \"separati on of church and state\" that has long been critica l to the \"peacefu l domi nion that religion exercises in [this] country ,\" where the \"spir it of religion\" and the \"spir produc tively \"united, \" \"reig n[ing] together \" but in spheres \"on the same soil.\" A. de Tocque\u00ad ville, Democracy in ica 282-283 (1835) (H. Manseld & D. Winthrop transls. and eds. 2000). They seek to further the basic principles set forth today by Justice O'Connor in her concurr ing opinion in McCrear y County v. Ame rican Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 881. The Cour t has made clear , as Justices Goldberg and Harlan noted, that the realization of these goals means that gover n\u00ad ment must \"neither engage in nor compel religious prac\u00ad tices, \" that it must \"effec t no favor itism among sects or be\u00ad tween religion and nonrel igion,\" and that it must \"work deterrence of no belief.\" Schempp , supra, at 305 (concurr ing opinion); see Weisman, 505 577, Unit:$U75 [03-26-08 20:12:05] OPIN 699 S. 677 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment 587 (1992); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947). The gover nment must avoid excessive in\u00ad terference with, or promoti on of, religion. See genera lly County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, J., dissenti the Establishment Clause does not compel the gover nment to purge from the publ ic sphere all that in any way partakes of the religious. See, e. g., Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783 (1983). Such absolutism is not only inconsistent with our national traditi ons, see, e. g., Lemo n v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 614 (1971); Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 672-678 (1984), but would also tend to promote the kind of socia l con\u00ad flict the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid. Thus, as Justices Goldberg and Harlan pointed out, the Cour t has found no single mechanica l formula that can ac\u00ad curately draw the constituti onal line in every case. See Schempp , 374 U. S., at 306 (concurr ing opinion). Where the Establishment Clause is at issue , tests desig ned to measure \"neutra lity\" alone are insufcient, both because it is some\u00ad times difcu lt to deter mine when a legal rule is \"neutra l,\" and because \"untutored devotion to the concept of neutra lity can lead to invocati on or approva l of resu lts which partake simply of that noni nter ference and noni nvolvement with the religious which the Constituti on commands, but of a broodi ng and pervasive devotion to the secu lar and a passive , or even active, hosti lity to the religious.\" Ibid. Neither can this Cour t's other tests readi ly explai n the Establishment Clause' s tolerance , for example , of the prayers that open legislative meeti ngs, see Marsh, supra; certain ref\u00ad erences to, and invocati ons of, the Deity in the publ ic words of publ ic ofcia ls; the publ ic references to God on coins, de\u00ad crees, and buildings; or the attenti on paid to objec Y Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg e. g., Lemo n, supra, at 612-613 (setti ng forth what has come to be known as the \"Lemo n test\"); Lynch, supra, at 687 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing) (setti ng forth the \"endorsement test\"); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v.

If the relati on between gover nment and religion is one of separati on, but not of mutua l hosti lity and suspici on, one will inevitably nd difcu lt border line cases. And in such cases, I see no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal judg\u00ad ment. See Schempp , supra, at 726-728 dissenti exercise of judg ment where quantit ative considerati ons matter). That judg ment is not a persona l judg ment. Rather , as in all constituti onal cases, it must re\u00ad flect and remai n faith ful to the under lying purposes of the Clauses, and it must take account of context and conse\u00ad quences measured in light of those purposes. While the Cour t's prior tests prov ide usefu l guideposts\u2014and might well lead to the same resu lt the Cour t reaches today , see, e. g., Lemo n, supra, at 612-613; Capitol Square, supra, at 773-783 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment)\u2014no exac t formula can dictate a resoluti on to such fact-intensive cases. The case before us is a border line case. It concer ns a large granite monument bear ing the text of the Ten Com\u00ad mandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capi\u00ad tol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message , invoking, S. 677 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment Deity. On the other hand, focusi ng on the text of the Com\u00ad mandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather , to deter mine the message that the text here con\u00ad veys, we must exami ne how the text is used. And that in\u00ad quiry requires us to consider the context of the display . In certain contexts, a display of the tablets of the Ten Commandments can convey not simply a religious message but also a secu lar mora l message (about proper standards of socia l conduc t). And in certain contexts, a display of the tablets can also convey a histor ical message (about a histor ic relati on between those standards and the law)\u2014a fact that helps to explai n the display of those tablets in dozens of cour thouses throughout the Nati on, includi ng the Supreme Cour t of the United States. See genera lly App. to Brief for United States as Ami cus Curiae 1a-7a. Here the tablets have been used as part of a display that communicates not simply a religious message , but a secu lar message as well. The circumst ances surroundi ng the dis\u00ad play' s placement on the capitol grounds and its physica l set\u00ad ting suggest that the State itself intended the latter , nonrel i\u00ad And the monument' s 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that that has been its effec t. The group that donated the monument, the Frater nal Order of Eagles, a private civic (and primarily secu lar) orga\u00ad nization, while interested in the religious aspec t of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shapi ng civic mora lity as part of that organi zation's effor ts to combat juveni le delinquency . See Tex. S. Con. Res. 16, 57th Leg., Reg. Sess. (1961). The Eagles' consu lta\u00ad tion with a committee composed of members of severa l faiths in order to nd a nonsec tarian text underscores the group' s ethics-based motives. See Brief for Respondents 5-6, and n. 9. The tablets, as displayed on the monument, promi\u00ad nently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display , a factor which, though not sufcient, thereby Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment the State itself from the religious aspec t of the Command\u00ad ments' message . The physica l setti ng of the monument, moreover , suggests little or noth ing of the sacred. See Appendix A, infra. The monument sits in a large park cont aining 17 monuments and 21 histor ical markers, all desig ned to illustrate the \"ideals\" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time. Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2001); see Appendix B, infra. The readi ly lend itself to medit ation or any other religious activity. But it does prov ide a context of history and mora l ideals. It (together with the display' s inscr iption about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to re\u00ad flect mora l principles, illustrati ng a relati on between ethics and law that the State's citizens, histor ically speak ing, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display' s mora l message \u2014an illustrative but not conclusive , indica\u00ad tion that the a predomi nantly secu lar message , a further factor is deter minative here . As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speak ing, went uncha llenged (until the single legal objec tion raised by peti\u00ad tioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesti ng that this was due to a climate of intimidati on. Hence , those 40 years suggest more strong ly than can any set of formulaic tests that few indiv idua ls, whate ver their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounti ng, in any signicantly detr iment al way, to a gover nment effor t to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote reli\u00ad gion S., at 305 (Goldberg , J., concurr ing). Those 40 years suggest that [03-26-08 20:12:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN 703 S. 677 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment the publ ic visiting the capitol grounds has considered the re\u00ad ligious aspec t of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader mora l and histor ical message reflec tive of a cul\u00ad tura l heritage. This case, moreover, is distinguishable from instances where the Cour t has found Ten Commandments displays im\u00ad permissible . The display is not on the grounds of a publ ic school, where , given the impressi onabi lity of the young ernment must exercise particular care in separati ng church and state. See, e. g., Weisman, 505 U. S., at 592; Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per curiam). This case also differs from McCrear y County, where the shor t (and stormy) history of the cour thouse tives of those who mounted them, and the effec t of this readi ly apparent objec\u00ad tive upon those who view them. See post, at 869-873 (opin\u00ad ion of the Cour t). That history there indicates a gover n\u00ad ment al effor t subst antia lly to promote religion, not simply an effor t primarily to reflec t, histor ically, the secu lar impac t of a religiously inspired document. And, in today' s world, in a Nati on of so many different religious and comparable nonrel igious fundament al beliefs, a more contemporary state effor t to focus attenti on upon a religious text is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this longst andi ng, pre\u00ad existi ng monument has not. For these reasons, I believe that the Texas display\u2014serv\u00ad ing a mixed but primarily nonrel igious purpose primar\u00ad entanglement with religion\"\u2014 might satisfy this Cour t's more formal Establishment Clause tests. Lemo n, 403 U. S., at 612-613 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted); see also Capitol Square, 515 U. S., at 773- 783 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg\u00ad ment). But, as I have said, in reach ing the conclusi on that the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitu\u00ad tional line, I rely less upon a litera Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment ular test than upon considerati on of the basic purposes of the First Amendment' s Religion Clauses themselves. This display has stood apparently uncontested for near ly two gen\u00ad erati ons. That exper ience helps us underst and that as a prac tical matter of degree this display is unlikely to prove divisive . And this matter of degree is, I believe, critica l in a border line case such as this one. At the same time, to reach a contrary conclusi on here , based primarily on the religious nature of the tablets' text would, I fear, lead the law to exhibit a hosti lity toward reli\u00ad gion that has no place in our Establishment Clause tradi\u00ad tions. Such a holdi ng might well longst of the Ten Commandments from publ ic buildings across the Nati on. And it could thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid. Zelman, 536 U. S., at 717-729 (Breyer, J., dissenti ng). Justices Goldberg and Harlan concluded in Schempp that \"[t]he First Amendment does not proh ibit prac tices which by any realistic measure create none of the dan\u00ad gers which it is desig ned to prevent and which do not so direc tly or subst antia lly involve the state in religious exercises or in the favor ing of religion as to have mean\u00ad ingful and prac tical impac t.\" 374 U. S., 308 (concur\u00ad ring opinion). That kind of prac tice is what we have here . I recog nize the danger of the slippery slope . Still, where the Establishment Clause is at issue , we must \"disti nguish between real threat and mere shadow .\" Ibid. Here, we have only the shadow . In light of these considerati ons, I cannot agree with to\u00ad day's plura lity's analysis. Nor can I agree with Justice Scalia' s dissent in McCrear y County, post, at885. Ido agree with Justice O'C onnor 's statement of principles in McCrear y County, post, at 881-883, though I 677 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment her evaluati on of the evidence as it bears on the appl icati on of those principles to this case.

The sole func tion of the monument on the grounds of Texas' State Capitol is to display the full text of one versi on of the Ten Commandments. The monument is not a work of art and does not refer to any event in the history of the State. It is signicant because , and only because , it commu\u00ad nicates the following message: \"I AM the LORD thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Honor thy father and thy mother , that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee . Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear against thy neighbor . Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's house . Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle , nor anyth ing that is thy neighbor 's.\" See Appendix, infra.1 Viewed on its face, Texas' display has no purported con\u00ad nection to God' s role in the formati on of Texas or the found\u00ad ing of our Nati on; nor does it prov ide the reasonable ob\u00ad server with any basis to guess that it was erec ted to honor any indiv idua l or organi zation. The message transmitted by Texas' chosen display is quite plain: This State endorses the divine code of the \"Judeo-Chr istian\" God. 1 At the bottom of the message , the observer learns that the display was \"[p]resented to the people and youth of Texas by the Frater nal Order of Eagles of Texas\" in Y Stevens, J., dissenti ng For those of us who learned to recite the King James ver\u00ad sion of the text long before we understood the meani ng of some of its words, God' s Commandments may seem like wise counsel. The questi on before this Cour t, howe ver, is whether it is counsel that the State of Texas may proclai m without violati ng the Establishment Clause of the Constitu\u00ad tion. If any fragment of Jefferson' s metaphor ical \"wall of separati on between church and State\" 2 is to be preserved\u2014 if there remai ns any meani ng to 'neutra lity' of which this Cour t's [Establishment Clause ] cases speak, \" Scho ol Dist. of Abington Towns hip v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203, 222 (1963)\u2014a negative answer to that questi on is mandatory . I In my judg ment, at the very least, the Establishment Clause has created a strong presumpti on against the display of religious symbols on publ ic proper ty. See, e. g., County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 650 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 797 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). The ador nment of our publ ic spaces with displays of religious symbols and messages un\u00ad doubtedly prov ides comfor t, indi\u00ad vidua ls who subscr ibe to particular faiths. Unfortunately , the prac tice also runs the risk of \"offend[i ng] nonmembers of the faith being adver tised as well as adherents who consider the particular adver tisement disrespec tful.\" Allegheny County, 492 U.S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part).3 2 Reyno lds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879); see also Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16 (1947). 3 As Senator Danfor th recently remi nded us, \"effor ts to haul references of God into the publ ic square , into schools and cour thouses, are far more apt to divide Amer icans than to advance faith. \" Danfor th, Onward, Mod\u00ad erate Christian Soldiers, N. Y. Times, June 17, dissenti ng Gover nment' s obligati on to avoid divisiveness and exclu\u00ad sion in the religious sphere is compel led by the Establish\u00ad ment and Free Exercise Clauses, which together erec t a wall of separati on between church and state.4 This metaphor ical wall protec ts principles long recog nized and often recited in this Cour t's cases. The rst and most fundament al of these principles, one that a major ity of this Cour t today afrms, is that the Establishment Clause demands religious neutra l\u00ad ity\u2014gover nment may not exercise a preference for one reli\u00ad gious faith over another . See, e. g., McCrear y County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 874-876.5 This essentia l command, howe ver, is not merely a proh ibition 4 The accuracy and utility of this metaphor have been called into ques\u00ad tion. See, e. g., Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 106 (1985) (Rehnquist , J., dissenti ng); see genera lly P. Hamburger , Separati on of Church and State (2002). Whate ver one may think of the merits of the histor ical de\u00ad bate t at a mini\u00ad mum has never questi oned the concept of the \"separati on of church and state\" in our First Amendment jurisprudence . The Chief Justice 's opinion afrms that principle . Ante, at 683 (demandi ng a \"separati on be\u00ad tween church and state\"). Indeed, even the Cour t that famously opined that \"[w]e are a religious people whose instituti ons presuppose a Supreme Being,\" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313 (1952), acknowledged that \"[t]here cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflec ts the philosophy that Church and State shou ld be separated, \" id., at 312. The questi on we face is how to give meani ng to that concept of separati on. 5 There is now widespread consensus on this principle . See Everson, 330 U. S., at 15 (\"Neither a nor the Federa l Gover nment . . . can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another \"); Scho ol Dist. of Abington Towns hip v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203, 226 (1963) (\"In the relati onsh ip between man and religion, the State is rmly committed to a positi on of neutra lity\"); Larso n v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244 (1982) (\"The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomi nation cannot be ofcia lly preferred over an\u00ad other \"); see also Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village Scho ol Dist. v. Grume t, 512 U. S. 687, 748 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng) (\"I have always . . that the Establishment Clause proh ibits the favor ing of one religion over others\"); but see Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U. S. 457, against the gover nment' s differentiati on among religious sects. We have repeatedly reafr med that neither a State nor the Federa l Gover nment \"can constituti onally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-bel ievers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.\" Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488, 495 (1961) (footnote omitted).6 This principle is based on the straightfor ward notion that gover nment al promoti on of orthodoxy is not saved by the aggregati on of severa l or\u00ad thodoxies under the State's banner . See Abington, 374 U. S., at 222. Acknowledg ments this broad underst andi ng of the neu\u00ad trality principle are legion in our cases.7 Strong arguments to the contrary have been raised from time to time, perhaps the strongest in then- Justice Rehnquist 's scholar ly dis\u00ad 6 In suppor t of this propositi on, the Torcaso Cour t quoted James Iredel l, who in the course of debati ng the adopti on of the Federa l Constituti on in North Carol ina, stated: \" '[I]t is objec ted that the people of Amer ica may, perhaps, choose represent atives who have no religion at all, and that pa\u00ad gans and Mahomet ans may be admitted into ofces. But how is it possible to exclude any set of men, without taking away that principle of religious freedom which we ourselves so warmly contend for?' \" 367 U. S., at 495, n. 10 (quoti ng 4 J.

Zorach, 343 U. S., at 325 (Jackson, J., dissenti ng) (\"The day that this country ceases to be free for irrel igion it will cease to be free for religion\u2014 except for the sect that can win politi\u00ad cal power \"). 545US2 Unit:$U75 [03-26-08 20:12:05] 711 S. 677 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng sent in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 91-114 (1985).8 Pow\u00ad erful as his argument was, we squarely rejected it and thereby reafr med the principle that the Establishment Clause requires the same respec t for the atheist as it does for the adherent of a Christian faith. As we wrote , \"the Cour t has unambig uously concluded idua l free\u00ad dom of conscience protec ted by the First Amendment em\u00ad braces the right to selec t any religious faith or none at all.\" Id., at 52-53. In restating this principle , I do not discount the impor\u00ad tance of avoidi ng an over ly strict inter pret ation of the meta\u00ad phor so often used to dene the reach of the Establishment Clause . The plura lity is correc t to note that \"religion and played This Cour t has often recog nized . . . of the role of religion in Amer ican life.\" Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 674 (1984); accord, Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 606-608 (1987) (Powel l, J., concur\u00ad ring). Given this history , it is unsur prising that a religious symbol may at times become an impor tant feature of a fami l\u00ad iar landscape or a remi nder of an impor tant event in the history of a community . The wall that separates the church from the State does not proh ibit the gover nment from ac\u00ad knowledg ing beliefs and prac tices of the Amer i\u00ad can people , nor does it require gover nments to hide works of art or histor ic memorabi lia from publ ic view just because they also have religious signicance . This case , howe ver, is not about histor ic preservati on or the mere recog nition of religion. The issue is obfuscated rather than claried by simplistic comment ary on the various 8 Justice Scalia 's dissent in the other Ten Commandments case we decide today , see McCrear y County v. Ame rican Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 885-894, raises similar objec tions. I address these Y Stevens, J., dissenti ng ways in which religion has played a role in Amer ican life, see ante, at 683-688 (plura lity opinion), and by the recit many extant gover nment al \"acknowledg ments\" of the role the Ten Commandments played in our Nati on's heri\u00ad tage,9 ante, at 687-689, , the mere compi la\u00ad tion of religious symbols, none of which includes the full text of the Commandments and all of which are exhibited in dif\u00ad ferent setti ngs, has only marg inal relevance to the questi on presented in this case. The monol ith displayed on Texas Capitol grounds cannot be discounted as a passive acknowledg ment of religion, nor can the State's refusa l to remove it upon objec tion be ex\u00ad plained as a simple desire to preserve a histor ic relic. This Nati on's resolute commitment to neutra lity with respec t to religion is flatly inconsistent with the plura lity's whole\u00ad hear ted validati on of an ofcia l state endorsement of the message that there is one, and only one, God. II When the Ten Commandments monument was donated to the State of Texas in 1961, it was not for the purpose of commemorati ng a notewor thy event in Texas history , signi\u00ad 9 Though this Cour t has subscr ibed to the view that the Ten Command\u00ad ments influenced the development of Wester n legal thought, it has not ofcia lly endorsed the far more speci c claim that the Ten Commandments played a signicant role in the development of our Nati on's foundati onal documents (and the subsidiary implicati on that it has specia l relevance to Texas). Although it is perhaps an overst atement to charac terize this lat\u00ad ter propositi on as \"idiotic, \" see Tr. of Oral Arg. 34, as one Member of the plura lity has done , at the very least the questi on is a matter of intense scholar ly debate .

To the contrary , the donati on was only one of over a hundred largely identica l monol iths, and of over a thousand paper replicas, distr ibuted to state and local gov\u00ad ernments throughout the Nati on over the course of severa l decades. This ambiti ous projec t was the work of the Fra\u00ad ternal Order of Eagles, a well-respec ted bene volent organi\u00ad zation whose good works have earned the praise of severa l Presidents.10 As the story goes, the program was initiated by the late Judge E. J. Ruegemer , a Minnesot a juveni le cour t then-Chair man of the Eagles Nati onal Commissi on on Youth Guidance . Inspired by a juveni le offender who had never heard of the Ten Commandments, the judge approached the Minnesot a Eagles with the idea of distr ibuti ng paper copies of the Commandments to be posted in cour thouses nation\u00ad wide. The State's Aerie under took t and its pop\u00ad ularity spread. When Ceci l B. DeMille, who at that time was lming the mov ie The Ten Commandments, heard of the judge' s endeavor , he teamed up with the Eagles to produce the type of granite monol ith now displayed in front of the Texas Capitol and at cour thouse squares, city halls, and pub\u00ad lic parks throughout the Nati on. Granite was repor tedly chosen over DeMille's original suggesti on of bronze plaques to better replicate the original Ten Commandments.11 10 See Brief for Frater nal Order of Eagles as Ami cus Curiae 2-3.

See Edwards, 482 U. S., at 606-608 (Powel l, J., concurr ing). The message at issue in this case , howe ver, is fundament ally different from either a bland admoniti on to observe genera lly accepted rules of behav ior or a genera l history lesson. The reason this message stands apar t is that the Deca\u00ad logue is a venerable religious text.14 As we held 25 years ago, it is beyond dispute that \"[t]he Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths. \" Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, 41 (1980) (per curiam).F or many followers, the Commandments represent the litera l word of God as spoken to Moses and repeated to his followers after descendi ng from Mount Sinai. The message conveyed by the Ten Commandments thus cannot be analogized to an appendage to a common article of commerce (\"In God we Trust\") or an incident al part of a fami liar recit al (\"God save the United States and this honorable Cour t\"). Thankfu lly, the plura lity does not attempt to minimize the religious sig\u00ad nicance of the Ten Commandments. Ante, at 690 (\"Of course , the Ten Commandments are religious\u2014they were so viewed at their incepti on and so remai n\"); ante, at 692 (Thomas, J., concurr ing); see also McCrear y County v. 14 In County of Allegheny v. Ame rican Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.

It is rather misleadi ng, howe ver, to quote my comment in that case to imply that I was referr ing to the text of the Ten Commandments simpl iciter. See McCrear y County, 677 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng American Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 909 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). Attempts to secu larize what sacred text defy credibi lity and disserve people of faith. The profoundly sacred message embodied by the text in\u00ad scribed on the Texas monument is emphasi zed by the espe\u00ad cially large letters that identi fy its author: \"I AM the LORD thy God. \" See Appendix, infra. It comm ands present worsh ip of Him and no other deity . It direc ts us to be guided by His teach ing in the current and future conduc t of all of our affairs.

The disti nction represents a critica l divide between the Protest ant and Cathol ic faiths. During the Refor mati on, Protest ants de\u00ad stroyed images of the Virgin Mary and of Jesus Christ that were vener\u00ad ated in Cathol ic churches. Even today there is a notable difference be\u00ad tween the imagery in different churches, a difference that may in part be attributable to differing underst andi ngs of the meani ng of what is the Second Commandment in the King James Bible translati on and a portion of the First Commandment in the Cathol ic translati on. See Finkelman, The Ten Commandments on the Cour thouse Lawn and Elsewhere , 73 gious signicance .16 See Lubet, The Ten Alabama, 15 Constituti onal Comment ary 471, 474-476 (Fall 1998). In choosi to display this versi on of the Command\u00ad ments, Texas tells the observer that the State suppor ts this side of the doctrinal religious debate . The reasonable ob\u00ad server , after all, has no way of know ing that this text was the produc t of a compromise , or that there is a rationale of any kind for the text' s selec tion.17 The Establishment gov\u00ad ernment from \"speci fying details upon which men and women who believe in a bene volent, omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are known to differ.\" Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 641 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). Given that the chosen text inscr ibed on the Ten Commandments monu\u00ad ment invariably places the State at the center of a serious 16 For example , in the Jewish versi on of the Sixth Commandment God commands: \"You shall not murder \"; whereas, the King James inter pret a\u00ad tion of the same command Compare W. Plaut, The Torah: Moder n Comment ary 534 (1981), with Appendix, infra. The difference between the two versi ons is not merely semantic; rather , it is but one example of a deep theolog ical dispute pret ations of this Commandment explai n the actions of veget arians who refuse to eat meat, pacists who refuse to work for muniti ons makers, prison ofcia ls who refuse to admi nister letha l injections to death row inmates, and phar macists who refuse to sell morning-af ter pills to women. See Finkelman 1494 -1496; Brief for Amer ican Jewish Congress et al. as Ami ci Curiae 22-23. Although the command is ambig uous, its power to motivate like-mi nded inter preters of its message cannot be denied. 17 Justice Scalia' s willingness to dismiss the disti nct textua l versi ons adhered to by different faiths in the name of gener ic \"monotheism\" based signicance , McCrear y County, post, at 909, is not only somewhat ironic, see A. Scalia, A Matter of Inter pret a\u00ad tion 23-25 (1997), but also serves to reinforce the concer n that interjec ting gover nment into the religious sphere will offend \"adherents who consider the particular adver tisement disrespec tful,\" Allegheny County, 492 U.S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng dispute , the display is unquesti onably unconstitu\u00ad tional under our case law. See Larso n v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244 (1982) (\"The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomi nation cannot be ofcia lly preferred over another \"). Even if, howe ver, the message of the monument, despite the inscr ibed text, fairly could be said to represent the belief system of all Judeo-Chr istians, it would still run afou l of the Establishment Clause by prescr ibing a compel led code of conduc t from one God, namely , a Judeo-Chr istian God, that is rejected by promi nent polytheistic sects, such as Hindu\u00ad ism, as well as nontheistic religions, such as Buddh ism.18 See, e. g., Allegheny County, 492 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\"The simultaneous endorsement of Judaism and Christianity is no less constituti onally inrm than the endorsement of Christianity alone\"). And, at the very least, the text of the Ten Commandments imper missibly commands a preference for religion over irrel igion. See, e. g., id., at 590 (The Establishment Clause \"guarantee[ s] religious lib\u00ad erty and equa lity to 'the indel, the atheist, or the adherent 18 See Brief for Hindu Amer ican Foundati on et al. as Ami ci Curiae. Though Justice Scalia disagrees that these senti ments are consistent with the Establishment Clause , he does not deny that our cases whole\u00ad hear tedly adopt this expressi on of neutra lity. Instead, he suggests that this Cour t simply discard what he terms the \"say-so of earlier Cour ts,\" based in part on his own \"say-so\" that nonmonotheists make up a statis\u00ad tically on's religious community Crear y County, post, at 889. Besides marg inalizing the belief systems of more than 7 million Amer icans by deemi ng them unwor thy of the specia l protec offers monotheists under the Establishment Clause , Jus\u00ad tice Scalia 's measure of analysis may be cause for concer n even for the self-proclai med \"popu lar\" religions of Islam and Judaism. The number of Buddh ists alone is near ly equa l to the number of Musl ims in this country , and while those of the Islamic and Jewish faiths only account for 2.2% of all believers, Christianity accounts for 95.5%. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce , Bureau of Census, Statistica l Abstrac t of the United States: 2004 -2005, p. 55 (124th ed. 2004) PGT: J., dissenti ng of a non-Chr istian faith such as Islam or Judaism' \" (quoti ng Wallace, 472 U. S., at 52)). Any of those bases, in my judg\u00ad ment, would be sufcient to conclude that the message shou ld not be proclai med by the State of Texas on a perma\u00ad nent monument at the seat of its gover nment. I do not doubt that some Texans, includi ng those elected to the Texas Legislature , may believe that the statues dis\u00ad played on the Texas Capitol grounds, includi ng the . . that compose Texan identity .\" Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2001). But Texas, like our entire country , is now a much more diversi ed community than it was when it became a part of the United States or even when the monument was erec ted. Today there are many Texans who do not believe in the God whose Commandments are displayed at their seat of gover nment. Many of them worsh ip a different god or no god at all. Some may believe that the account of the cre\u00ad ation in the Book of Genesis is less reliable than the views of men like Darwin and Einstei n. The monument is no more an expressi on of the views of every true Texan than was the \"Live Free or Die\" motto that the State of New Hampsh ire placed on its license plates in 1969 an accurate expressi on of the views of every citizen of New Hampsh ire. See Wooley v. Mayn ard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977). Recog nizing the diversity of religious and secu lar beliefs held by Texans and by all Amer icans, it seems beyond per\u00ad adventure that allowing the seat of gover nment to serve as a stage for the propagati on of an unmist akably Judeo- Christian message of piety would have the tendency to make nonmonotheists and nonbel ievers \"feel like [outsiders ] in matters of faith, and [strangers ] in the politica l community .\" Pinette, 515 U.S., at 799 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). \"[D]is\u00ad plays of this kind inevitably have a greater tendency to em\u00ad phasi ze sincere and deeply felt differences among indiv idua ls than to achieve an 677 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng U.S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part).19 Even more than the display of a religious symbol on gov\u00ad ernment proper ty, see Pinette, 515 U.S., at 797 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng); Allegheny 492 U. S., at 650-651 J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part), display\u00ad ing this sectarian text at the state capitol shou ld invoke a power ful presumpti on of invalidity . As Justice Souter 's opinion persuasively demonstrates, the physica l setti ng in which the Texas from rebutti ng that presumpti on\u2014ac tually enhances the religious content its message . See post, at 742-743 (dissenti ng opinion). The monument' s permanent xture at the seat of Texas gover n\u00ad ment is of immense signicance . The fact that a monument \"is installed on publ ic proper ty implies ofcia l recog ni\u00ad tion and reinforcement of its message . That implicati on is especia lly strong when the sign stands in front of the seat of the gover nment itself . The 'reasonable ob\u00ad server ' of any symbol placed unattended in front of any capitol in the world will normally assume that the sover\u00ad eign\u2014wh ich is not only the owner of that parcel of real estate but also the lawg iver for the surroundi ng terri\u00ad tory\u2014has sponsored and facilitated its message .\" Pi\u00ad nette, 515 U. S., at 801-802 (Stevens, J., l exami nation of the Decalogue's display at the seat of Texas gover nment, rather than gener ic citation 19 The fact that this particular display has stood uncha llenged for over 40 years does not suggest other wise. One need look no further than the deluge of cases floodi ng lower cour ts to realize the discord these displays have engendered. See, e. g., Mercier v. Fraternal Order of Eagles, 395 F. 3d 693 (CA7 2005); ACLU mum v. Ogden, 297 F. 3d 995 (CA10 2002); Books v. Elkhar t, 235 F. 3d 292 (CA7 2000); State v. Freedo m From Religion (Colo . 1995); rson v. Salt Stevens, J., dissenti ng to the role of religion in Amer ican life, unmist akably reveals on which side of the \"slippery slope ,\" ante, at 704 (Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment), this display must fall. God, as the author of its message , the Eagles, as the donor of the monument, and the State of Texas, as its proud owner , speak with one voice for a common purpose \u2014to encourage Texans to abide by the divine code of a \"Judeo-Chr istian\" God. If this message is permissible , then the shining principle of neutra lity to which we have long adhered is noth ing more than mere shadow . III The plura lity relies heav ily on the fact that our Republ ic was founded, and has been gover ned since its nascence , by leaders who spoke then (and speak still) in plainly religious rhetor ic. The Chief Justice cites, for instance , George Washington's 1789 Thanksg iving Proclamati on in suppor t of the propositi on that the Establishment Clause does not pro\u00ad scribe ofcia l recog nition Being,\" ante, at 683. Many of the submissi ons made to this Cour t by the parties and amici, in accord with the plura lity's opinion, have relied on the ubiquity of references to God throughout our history . The speeches and rhetor ic charac teristic of the foundi ng era, howe ver, do not answer the questi on before us. I have already explai ned why Texas' display of the full text of the Ten Commandments, given the content of the actual display 20 This is, of course , a rhetor ical approach not unique to the plura lity's opinion today . Appea ls to such religious speeches have frequently been used in suppor t of gover nment al transmissi on of religious messages. See, e. g., Wallace, 472 U. S., at 98-104 (Rehnquist , J., dissenti ng); Lee v. Weis\u00ad man, 505 U. S. 577, 633-636 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng); Santa Fe Inde\u00ad penden t Scho ol Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 318 (2000) (Rehnquist , C. J., dissenti ng); cf. Lynch v. Donnelly , U. (1984). S. 677 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng and the context in which it is situated, sets this case apar t from the countless examples of benig n gover nment recog ni\u00ad tions of religion. But there is another crucial difference . Our leaders, when delivering publ ic addresses, often express their blessi ngs simultaneously in the serv ice of God and their constituents. Thus, when publ ic ofcials deliver public speeches, we recog nize that their words are not exclusively a transmissi on from the gover nment because those orator ies have embedded within them the inherently persona l views of the speaker as an indiv idua l member of the polity.21 The permanent placement of a textua l religious display on state proper ty is different in kind; it amalgamates other wise dis\u00ad cordant indiv idua into collective statement of gov\u00ad ernment approva l. Moreover , the message never ceases to transmit itself to objec ting viewers whose only choices are to accept the message or to ignore the offense by aver ting their gaze . Cf. Allegheny County, 492 U.S., at 664 (Ken\u00ad nedy , J., concurr ing judg ment and dissenti ng in part); ante, at 695 (Thomas, J., concurr In this sense , although Thanksg iving Day proclamati ons and inaug undoubtedly seem ofcia l, in most circumst ances they will not constitute the sort of gover nment al endorse\u00ad ment of religion at which the separati on of church and state is aimed.22 21 It goes without saying that the analysis differs when a listener is coerced into listeni ng to a prayer . See, e. g., Santa Fe Inde penden t Scho ol Dist., 530 U. S., at 308-312. 22 With respec t to the \"legislative prayers\" cited approv ingly by The Chief Justice, ante, at 687-688, I reiterate my view that \"the desig na\u00ad tion of a member of one religious faith to serve as the sole ofcia l chaplai n of a state legislature for a period of 16 years constitutes the preference of one faith over another in violati on of the Establishment Clause .\" Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783, 823 (1983) (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). Thus, Justice Scalia and I are in agreement with respec t to at least one point\u2014th is Cour t's decisi on in Marsh \"ignor[ed] the neutra lity principle\" at the hear t of the Establishment Clause . McCrear y County, post, at 892 J., dissenti ng The plura lity's reliance on early religious statements and proclamati ons made by the Founders is also problematic be\u00ad cause those views were not espoused at the Constituti onal Conventi on in 1787 23 nor enshr ined in the Constituti on's text. Thus, the present ation of these religious statements as a unied histor ical narrative is bound to paint a mislead\u00ad ing picture. It does so here . In accordi ng deference to the statements of George Washington and John Adams, The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, see ante, at 687 (plura l\u00ad ity opinion); McCrear y County, post, at 886, 887-888 (dissent\u00ad ing opinion), fail to account for the acts and publ icly espoused views of other influentia l leaders of that time. Notably ab\u00ad sent from their histor ical snapshot is the fact that Thomas Jefferson refused to issue the Thanksg iving proclamati ons that Washington had so readi ly embraced based on the argu\u00ad ment that to do so would violate the Establishment Clause .24 The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia disregard the sub\u00ad stantia l debates that took place regardi ng the constituti onal\u00ad ity of the early proclamati ons and acts they cite, see, e. g., Letter from James Madison to Edward Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 appoi ns be paid Nati onal Treasury was \"not with my approbati on\" and was a \"devia\u00ad tion\" from the principle of \"immunity of Religion from civil 23 See, e. g., J.

' \" 26 These seemi ngly nonconfor ming senti ments shou ld come as no surprise. Not insignicant numbers of colonists came to this country with memor ies of religious persecuti on by 25 See also James Madison, Detached Memoranda, in 5 Founders' Consti\u00ad tution 103-104. Madison' s letter to Livingston further argued: \"There has been another deviation from the strict principle in the Executive Proc\u00ad lamati ons of fasts & festiva ls, so far, at least, as they have spoken the lang uage of injunc tion, or have lost sight of the equa lity of all religious sects in the eve of the Constituti on....N otwithst andi ng the genera l progress made within the two last centur ies in favour of this branch of liberty, & the full establishment of it, in some parts of our Country , there remai ns in others a strong bias towards the old error , that without some sort of alliance or coalition between [Gover nment ] & Religion neither can be duly suppor ted.

S. 421, 427-429 (1962). The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia ignore the separati onist impu lses\u2014i n accord with the principle of \"neutra lity\"\u2014that these indiv idua ls brought to the debates surroundi ng the adopti on of the Establishment Clause .27 Ardent separati onists aside , there is another in the plura lity's portraya l of history . Simply put, many of the Founders who are often cited as author itative expositors of the Constituti on's original meani ng understood the Establishment Clause to stand for a narrower proposi\u00ad tion than the plura lity, for whate ver reason, is willing to ac\u00ad cept. Namely , many of the Framers understood the word \"religion\" in the Establishment Clause to encompass only the various sects of Christianity . The evidence is compe lling. Prior to the Philadelph ia Conventi on, the States had begun to protec t \"religious free\u00ad dom\" in their various constituti \"free ex\u00ad 27 The contrary evidence cited by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia only underscores the obvious fact that leaders who have draf ted and voted for a text are eminently capable of violati ng their own rules. The rst Congress was\u2014just as the present Congress is\u2014capable of pass\u00ad ing unconstituti onal legislati on. Thus, it is no to that the Founders' separati onist impu lses were \"plai nly rejected\" simply because the rst Congress enac ted laws that acknowledged God. See McCrear y County, post, at 896 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). To adopt such an inter pre\u00ad tive approach would misg uidedly give author itative weight to the fact that the Congress that proposed the Fourteenth Amendment also enac ted laws that tolerated segregati on, and the fact that 10 years after proposi ng the First Amendment, Congress enac ted the Alien and Sediti on Act, which indisput ably violated our present underst andi ng of the First Amendment.

In particular, the author of the plura lity once noted that \"Joseph Story , a Member of this Cour t from 1811 to 1845, and during much of that time a professor at the Harvard Law School, publ ished by far the most comprehensive treatise on the United States Constituti on that had then appeared. \" Wallace, 472 U.

Indeed, Justice Scalia is unable to point to any persuasive histor ical evi\u00ad dence or entrenched traditi ons in suppor t of his decisi on to give specia lly preferred constituti onal status to all monothe\u00ad istic religions. Perhaps this is because the history of the Establishment Clause' s original meani ng just as strong ly suppor ts a preference for Christianity as it does a preference for monotheism. Gener ic references to \"God\" hardly consti\u00ad tute evidence that those who spoke the word meant to be inclusive of all monotheistic believers; nor do such references demonstrate that those who heard the word spoken under\u00ad stood it broadly to include all monotheistic faiths. See supra, at 726-727. Justice Scalia 's inclusi on of Judaism and Islam is a laudable act of religious tolerance , but it is one that is unmoored from the Constituti on's history and text, and moreover one that is patently arbitrary in its inclu\u00ad sion of some , but exclusi on of g., Buddh ism), prac ticed non-Chr istian religions.

Under this view, not only could a State constituti onally ador n all of its publ ic spaces with crucixes or passages from the New Testament, it would also have full author ity to prescr ibe the teach ings of Martin Luther or Joseph Smith as the ofcia l state religion. Only the Federa l Gover nment would be pro\u00ad hibited from taking sides (and only then as between Chris\u00ad tian sects).

A Clause so understood might be faith\u00ad ful to the expec tations of some of our Founders, but it is plainly not worthy of a society whose enviable hallmark over the course of two centur ies has been the conti nuing expan\u00ad sion of religious plura lism and 214; Zelman v.

As the widely divergent views espoused by the leaders of our foundi ng era plainly reveal, the histor ical record of the preincor porati on Establishment Clause is too indeter minate to serve as an inter pretive North Star.33 It is our duty , therefore , to inter pret the First Amend\u00ad ment' s command that \"Congress shall make no law respec t\u00ad ing an establishment of religion\" not by merely asking what those words meant to observers at the time of the foundi ng, but instead by deriving from the Clause' s text and history the broad principles that remai n valid today . As we have said in the context of statutory inter pret ation, legislati on \"often [goes ] beyond the principa l evil [at which the statute was aimed] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the prov isions of our laws rather than the princi\u00ad prov ision\" intended to prevent \"Congress from inter fering with state es\u00ad tablishments\"). It is this unique history , not incor porati on writ large , that renders incoherent the posti ncor porati on reliance the Establish\u00ad ment Clause' s original underst andi ng. Justice Thomas, at least, has faced this problem head on. See id., at 45 (opinion concurr ing in judg ment). But even if the decisi on to incor po\u00ad rate the Establishment Clause was misg uided, it is at this point unw ise to reverse course given the weight of precedent that would have to be cast aside to reach the intended resu lt.

Its genera l principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas.\" Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910). The principle that guides my analysis is neutra lity.35 The basis for that principle is rmly rooted in our Nati on's 35 Justice Thomas contends that the Establishment Clause cannot in\u00ad clude such a neutra lity principle because the Clause reaches only the gover nment al coerci on of indiv idua l belief or disbel ief. Ante, at 693-694 (concurr ing opinion). In my view, although actual religious coerci on is undoubtedly forbidden by the Establishment Clause , that cannot be the full extent of the prov ision's reach. Jefferson' s \"wall\" metaphor and his to issue Thanksg iving proclamati ons, see supra, at 724, would have been nonsensica l if the Clause reached only direc t coerci on. Further, under the \"coerci on\" view, the Establishment Clause would amount to little more than a replica of our compel led speech doctrine, see, e. g., West Virg inia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 639 (1943), with a religious flavor . A Clause so inter preted would not icit state endorse\u00ad ments of religious orthodoxies of particular sects, actions that lie at the hear t of what the Clause was meant to regulate. The gover nment could, for example laudi ng Cathol the only pure ng endorsed by Justice Thomas, J., history and our Constituti on's text. I the requirement that gover nment must remai n neutra l between religion and irrel igion would have seemed foreig n to some of the Framers; so too would a requirement of neutra lity be\u00ad tween Jews and Christians. But cf. Letter from George Washington to the Hebrew Congregati on in Newpor t, R. I. (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington 284, 285 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). Fortunately , we are not bound by the Framers' expec tations\u2014we are bound by the legal principles they enshr ined in our Constituti on. Story' s vision that States shou ld not discr iminate between Christian sects has as its foundati on the principle that gover nment must remai n neutra l between valid systems of belief. As religious plura l\u00ad ism has expanded, so has our accept ance of what constitutes valid belief systems. The evil of discr iminating today against atheists, \"polytheists[,] and believers in unconcer ned deities, \" McCrear y County, post, at 893 (Scalia, J., dissent\u00ad ing), is in my view a direc t descendent of the evil of discr imi\u00ad nating among Christian sects. The Establishment Clause those programs would not be coercive because the viewer could simply turn off the television or ignore the ad. See ante, at 694 (\"The mere presence of the monumen t...i nvolves no coerci on\" because the passerby \"need not stop to read it or even to look at it\"). Further, the notion that the appl icati on of a \"coerci on\" principle would somehow lead to a more consistent jurisprudence is dubi ous. Enshr ining coerci on as the Establishment Clause touchstone fails to eliminate the dif\u00ad cult judg ment calls on must take.\" Mc- County, post, at 909 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng).

It may be a legal requirement or an effec t that is indirec tly inferred from a variety of factors. See, e. g., Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 431 (1962) (\"When the power prestige and nancia l suppor t of gover nment is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirec t coercive pressure upon religious minorities to confor m to the pre\u00ad vailing ofcia lly approved religion is plain\").

IV The Eagles may donate as many monuments as they choose to be displayed in front of Protest ant churches, bene v\u00ad olent organi zations' meeti ng places, or on the front lawns of private citizens. The expurgated text of the King James versi on of the Ten Commandments that they have crafted is unlikely to be accepted by Cathol ic parishes, Jewish syna\u00ad gogues, or even some Protest ant denomi nations, but the message they seek to convey is surely more compatible with church proper ty than with proper ty that is located on the gover nment side of the metaphor ical wall. The judg ment of the Cour t in this case stands for the prop\u00ad ositi on that the Constituti on permits gover nment al displays of sacred religious texts. This makes a mockery of the con\u00ad stituti onal ideal that gover nment be\u00ad tween religion and irrel igion. If a State may endorse a par\u00ad ticular deity' s command to \"have no other gods before me,\" it is difcu lt to conceive of any textua l display that would run afou l of the Establishment Clause . The disconnec t between this Cour t's approva and the against prefer\u00ad ring religion to irrel cannot be reduced to the exercise of plotti ng two adjacent locati ons on a slippery slope . Cf. ante, at 704 (Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment).

Although the First Amendment' s Religion Clauses have not been read to mandate absolute gover nment al neutra lity toward religion, cf. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), the Establishment Clause requires neutra lity as a genera l rule, e. g., Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 18 (1947), and thus expresses Madison' s condemnati on of \"em\u00ad ploy[i ng] Religion as an engine of Civil policy,\" Memor ial and Remonstrance Agai nst Religious Assessments, 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 187 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). A gover nment al display of an obviously religious text cannot be squared with neutra lity, except in a setti ng that plausibly indicates that the statement is not placed in view with a predomi nant pur\u00ad pose on the part of gover nment either to adopt the religious message or to urge its accept ance by others. Until today , only one of our cases addressed the constitu\u00ad tionality of posti ng the Ten Commandments, Stone v. Gra\u00ad ham, 449 U. S. 39, 41-42 (1980) (per curiam). A Kentucky statute required posti ng the Commandments on the walls of publ ic school classrooms, and the Cour t descr ibed the State's purpose (rele vant under the tripartite test laid out in Lemo n v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971)) as being at odds with the obligati on of religious neutra lity. on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature . The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sa\u00ad cred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no leg\u00ad islative recit ation of a supposed secu lar purpose can blind us to that fact. The Commandments do not con\u00ad545US2 J., dissenti ng ne themselves to arguably secu lar matters, such as honor ing one's parents, killing or murder , adultery , stealing, false witness, and covetousness. Rather , the rst part of the Commandments concer ns the religious duties of believers: worsh ipping the Lord God alone, avoidi ng idolatry , not using the Lord' s name in vain, and observ ing the Sabbath Day.\" 449 U. S., at 41-42 (foot\u00ad note and citations omitted). What these observati ons underscore are the simple realities that the Ten Commandments constitute a religious state\u00ad ment, that their message is inherently religious, and that the purpose of singling them out in a display is clear ly the same .1 Thus, a pedestr ian happeni ng upon the monument at issue here needs no training in religious doctrine to realize that the statement of the Commandments, quoti ng God himself, proclai ms that the will of the divine being is the source of obligati on to obey the rules, includi ng the facia lly secu lar ones. In this case , moreover , the text is presented to give particular promi nence to the Commandments' rst sectarian 1 The clarity of the religious mani festation in Stone was unaffec ted by the State's effor t to obscure it: the Kentucky statute that mandated post\u00ad ing the Commandments in classrooms also required the additi on to every posti ng on of the Com\u00ad mandments is clear ly seen in its adopti on as the fundament al legal code of Wester n Civilization and the Common Law of the United States. \" 449 U. S., at 39-40, n. 1 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). In the present case , the religious purpose was evident on the part of the donati ng organi zation. When the Frater nal Order of Eagles, the group that gave the monument to the State of Texas, donated identica l monuments to other jurisdic tions, it was seek ing to impar t a religious message . See Adland v. Russ, 307 F. 3d 471, 475 (CA6 2002) (quoti ng the Eagles' statement in a letter written to Kentucky when a monument was donated to that Commonwea lth: \" 'Most of today' s younger generati on either have not seen the Ten Commandments or have not been taught them. In our opinion the youth of today is in dire need of learning the simple laws of God ...' \"). Accordi ngly, it was not just the terms of the mora l code , but the proclamati on that the terms of the code were enjoined by God, that the Eagles put forward in the monuments they donated. 739 Souter, J., dissenti ng reference , \"I am the Lord thy God. \" That proclamati on is centered on the stone and written in slightly larger letters than the subsequent recit ation. To ensure that the religious nature of the monument is clear to even the most casua l pas\u00ad serby , the word \"Lord\" appears in all capit al letters (as does the word \"am\"), so that the most eye-catch ing segment of the quot ation is the declarati on \"I AM the LORD thy God. \" App. to Pet. for Cert. 21. What follows, of course , are the rules against other gods, graven images, vain swear ing, and Sabbath break ing. And the full text of the fth Command\u00ad ment puts forward lial respec t as a conditi on of long life in the land \"which the Lord thy God giveth thee .\" See ibid. clear .\" County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 598 (1989). To drive the religious point home , and identi fy the mes\u00ad sage as religious to any viewer who failed to read the text, the engraved quot ation is framed by religious symbols: two tablets with what appears to be ancient script on them, two Stars of David, and the super imposed Greek letters Chi and Rho as the fami liar monogram of Christ. Nothing on the monument, in fact, detrac ts from its religious nature ,2 see ibid. (\"Here, unlike in Lynch [v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668 (1984)], noth ing in the context of the display detrac ts from the cre`che's religious message\"), and the plura lity does not suggest other wise. It would therefore be difcu lt to miss the point that the gover nment of Texas 3 is telling everyone 2 That the monument also surrounds the text of the Commandments with various Amer ican symbols (notably the U. S. flag and a bald eagle) only underscores the imper missibi lity patr iotic symbols with the Commandments and other religious signs, the monument sends the message that being Amer ican means being reli\u00ad gious (and not just being religious but also subscr ibing to the Command\u00ad ments, i. e., prac ticing a monotheistic religion). 3 There is no questi on that the State in its own right is broadcasti ng the religious message . When Texas accepted the monument from the Eagles, the state legislature , aware that the Eagles \"for the past severa Souter, J., dissenti ng who sees the monument to live up to a mora l code because God requires it, with both code and concepti on of God being rightly understood as the inher itances speci cally of Jews and Christians.

The monument' s present ation of the Commandments with religious text emphasi zed and enhanced stands in contrast to any number of perfectly constituti onal depic tions prov iding a good example , where the of Moses stands among history' s great law\u00ad givers. While Moses holds the tablets of the Command\u00ad ments show ing some Hebrew text, no one looking at the lines of gures in marble relief is likely to see a religious purpose behind the assemblage or take away a religious message from it. Only one other depic tion represents a religious leader , and the histor ical personages are mixed with symbols of mora l and intellectual abstrac tions like Equity and Au\u00ad thor ity. See County of Allegheny, supra, at 652 (Stevens, J., concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part). Since Moses enjoys no especia l promi nence on the frieze, viewers can readi ly take him to be there as a lawg iver in the company of other lawg ivers; and the viewers may just as natura lly see the tablets of the Commandments (show ing the later ones, forbiddi ng things like killing and theft, but without the di\u00ad vine preface) as background from which the concept of law have placed across the countr y... parchment plaques and granite mono\u00ad liths of the Ten Commandments [in order ] to promote youth mora lity and to help stop the alarming increase in delinquency ,\" resolved \"that the Fra\u00ad ternal Order of the Eagles of the State of Texas be commended and con\u00ad gratu lated for quency throughout our nation.\" App. 97. The State, then, expressly approved of the Eagles' proselyti zing, which it 677 (2005) Souter, J., dissenti ng emerged, ultimately having a secu lar influence in the history of the Nati on. Gover nment may, of course , constituti onally call attenti on to this influence , and may post displays or erec t monuments recounti ng this aspec t of our history no less than any other , so long as there is a context and that context is histor ical. Hence , a display of the Commandments accompa\u00ad nied by an expositi on of how they have influenced moder n law would most likely be constituti onally unobjec tionable .4 4 For similar reasons, the other displays of the Commandments that the plura lity menti ons, ante, at 688-689, do not run afou l of the Establishment Clause . The statues of Moses and St. Paul in the Main Readi ng Room of the Library of Congress are 2 of 16 set in close proxi mity , statues that \"represent men illustr ious in the various forms of thought and activ\u00ad ity . . . .\" The Library of Congress: The Art and Arch itecture of the Thomas Jefferson Building 127 (J. Cole and H. Reeds eds. 1997). Moses and St. Paul represent religion, while the other 14 (a group that includes Beethoven, Shakespeare , Michelangelo , Columbus, and Plato) represent the nonrel igious ies philosophy , art, history , science , law, and poetry . Ibid. Similarly, the sculpture of the woman beside the Decalogue in the Main Readi ng Room is 1 of 8 such gures \"represent[i ng] eight charac teristic features of civilized life and thought, \" the same 8 fea\u00ad tures (7 of them nonrel igious) that Moses, St. Paul, and the rest of the 16 statues represent. Id., at 125. The inlay on the floor of the Nati onal Arch ives Building is one of four such discs, the collective theme of which is not religious. Rather , the discs \"symbol ize the various types of Gover nment records that were to come into the Nati onal Arch ives. \" Letter from Judith A. Koucky , Arch ivist, Records Control Section, to ivist.htm (as 16, 2005, and available in Clerk of Cour t's case le). (The four categor ies are war and defense , history , jus\u00ad tice, and legislati on. Each disc paired winged gure; the disc cont aining the depic tion of Commandments, a depic tion that, notably, omits the Commandments' text, gure featur[i ng] in the Chamber of the United States House of Represent atives, \" ante, at 689 (plura lity opinion), Moses is actually 1 of 23 portraits encircl ing the House Chamber , each approxi\u00ad mately the same size, having no religious theme .

S., at 42.5 Texas seeks to take advant age of the recog nition that vis\u00ad ual symbol and written text can mani fest a secu lar purpose in secu lar company , when it argues that its monument (like Moses in the frieze) is not alone and ought to be viewed as only 1 among 17 placed on the 22 acres surroundi ng the State Capitol. Texas, indeed, says that the Capitol grounds are like a museum for a collection of exhibits, the kind of setti ng that severa l Members of the Cour t have said can render the exhibition of religious artifacts permissible , even though in other circumst ances their display would be seen as meant to convey a religious message forbidden to the State. County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 595 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Stevens, J.); Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing). So, for example , the Gover n\u00ad ment of the United States does not violate the Establishment Clause by hang ing Giotto' s Madonna on the wall of the Na\u00ad tional Gallery. But 17 monuments with no common appearance , history , or esthetic role scattered over 22 acres is not a museum, and anyone strolling around the lawn would surely take each memor ial on its own terms without any dawni ng sense that some purpose held the miscel lany together more coherently has become Amer ican law.\" Art in the United States Capitol, House Doc. No. 94-660, p. 282 (1978). More impor tantly for purposes of this case , each portrait consists only of the subjec t's face; the Ten Commandments appear nowhere in Moses' s portrait. 5 Similarly permissible , though obviously of a different charac ter, are laws that can be traced back to the Commandments (even the more reli\u00ad gious ones) but are currently suppor ted by nonrel igious considerati ons. See McCrear y County v. Ame rican Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 861 (opinion of the Cour t) (noting that in McGowan v. Mar yland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), the Cour t \"upheld Sunday closi ng statutes on after that the gover had forsaken the religious (2005) Souter, J., dissenti ng than fortuity and the edge of the grass. One monument ex\u00ad presses admirati on for pioneer women. One pays respec t to the ghters of World War II. And one quotes the God of Abraham whose command is the sanc tion for mora l law. The themes are indiv idua l grit, patr iotic courage , and God as the source of Jewish and Christian mora lity; there is no com\u00ad mon denomi nator circumst an ar\u00ad gument similar to the State's, noting in County of Allegheny that \"[t]he presence of Sant as or other Christmas decorati ons elsewhere in the...

S., at 598-599, n. 48.6 If the State's museum argument does noth ing to blunt the religious message and mani festly religious purpose behind it, neither does the plura lity's reliance on genera lities culled from cases factually different from this one. E. g., ante, at 687 (\"We have acknowledged, for example , that 'religion has been closely identi ed with our history and gover nment, ' Scho ol Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp , 374 U. S., at 212, and that '[t]he history of man is inseparable from the 6 It is true that the Commandments monument is unlike the display of the Commandments considered in the other Ten Commandments case we decide today , McCrear y County. There the Commandments were posted at the behest of the county in the rst instance , whereas the State of Texas received the monument as a gift from the Eagles, which apparently conceived of the donati on at the suggesti on of a mov ie producer bent on promoti ng his commercia l lm on the Ten Commandments, Books v. Elk\u00ad hart, 235 F. 3d 292, 294-295 (CA7 2000), cert. denied, 532 U. S. 1058 (2001). But this disti nction fails to neutra lize the apparent expressi on of gover n\u00ad ment al intent to promote a religious message: although the nativ ity scene in County of Allegheny was donated by the Holy Name Society , we con\u00ad cluded that \"[n]o viewer could reasonably think that [the scene ] occupies [its] locati on [at the seat of county gover nment ] without the suppor t and approva l of the gover J., dissenti ng history of religion,' Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 434 (1962)\"). In fact, it is not until the end of its opinion that the plura lity turns to the relevant precedent of Stone, a case actually dealing with a display of the Decalogue. When the plura lity nally does confront Stone, it tries to avoid the case' s obvious appl icabi lity by limiting nd au\u00ad thor for limiting Stone's reach this way in the opinion's citations of two school-prayer cases, Scho ol Dist. of Abing\u00ad ton Township v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203 (1963), and Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421 (1962). But Stone relied on those cases for widely appl icable notions, not for any concept speci c to schools. The opinion quoted Schempp 's statements that \"it is no defense to urge that the religious prac tices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment, \" Schempp , supra, at 225, quoted in Stone, 449 U. S., at 42; and that \"the place of the Bible as an instrument of religion can\u00ad not be gainsaid, \" Schempp , supra, at 224, quoted in Stone, supra, at 41, n. 3. And Engel was cited to suppor t the prop\u00ad ositi on that the State was responsible for display ing the Commandments, even though their framed, printed texts were bought with private subscr iptions. Stone, supra, at 42 (\"[T]he mere posti ng of the [Commandments ] under the auspices of the legislature prov ides the ofcia l suppor t of the nment that the Establishment Clause proh ibits\" (ellipsis and inter nal quot ation marks omitted)). Thus, the schoolroom was beside the point of the citations, and that is presumably why the Stone Cour t failed to discuss the educa\u00ad tional setti ng, as other opinions had done when school was signicant. E. g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 584 (1987). Stone did not, for example , speak of children' s im\u00ad pressi onabi lity or their captiv ity as an audience in a school class. In fact, Stone's reasoni ng reached the classroom only in noting the lack of suppor t for the claim that the State had brought the Commandments into schools in order to \"inte\u00ad grat[ e] [them ] into the school curr dissenti ng Accordi ngly, our numerous prior discussi ons of have never treated its holdi ng as restr icted to the classroom.7 Nor can the plura lity deflec t Stone by calling the Texas monument \"a far more passive use of [the Decalogue] than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted element ary school students every day.\" Ante, at 691. Placi ng a monu\u00ad ment on the ground is not more \"passive\" than hang ing a sheet of paper on a wall when both cont ain the same text to be read by anyone who looks at it. The problem in Stone was simply that the State was putti ng the Commandments there to be seen, just as the monument' s inscr iption is there for those who walk by it. To be sure , Kentucky' s compu lsory-educati on law meant that the schoolch ildren were forced to see the display every day, whereas many see the monument by choice , and those who customar ily walk the Capitol grounds can presumably avoid it if they choose . But in my judg ment (and under our often inexac t Establishment Clause jurisprudence , such mat\u00ad ters often boil down to judg ment, see ante, at 700 (Breyer, J., concurr ing in judg ment)), this disti nction shou ld make no difference . The monument in this case sits on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. There is someth ing signicant in the common term \"statehouse\" to refer to a state capitol building: it is the civic home of every one of the State's citi\u00ad zens. If neutra lity in religion means someth ing, any citizen shou ld be able to visit that civic home without having to confront religious expressi ons clear ly meant to convey an of\u00ad cial religious positi on that may be at odds with his own 7 In any event, the fact that we have been, as the plura lity says, \" 'partic\u00ad ularly vigilant in monitor ing compl iance with the Establishment Clause in element ary and secondary schools, ' \" ante, at 691, does not of course mean that anyth ing goes outside the schoolhouse . As cases like County of Alle\u00ad gheny and Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668 (1984), illustrate , we have also closely scrutinized gover nment displays of religious symbols. And for reasons discussed in the text, the Texas monument cannot surv ive even a relaxed level of scrutiny. 746 Souter, J., dissenti ng religion, or with rejection of religion. See County of Alle\u00ad gheny, 492 U. S., at 626 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment) (\"I agree that the cre`che displayed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Cour thouse , the seat of county gover nment, conveys a message to nonad\u00ad herents of Christianity that they are not full members of the politica l communit y... . The display of religious symbols in publ ic areas of core gover nment buildings runs a specia l risk of mak ing religion relevant, in reality or publ ic percep\u00ad tion, to status in and in\u00ad ternal quot ation marks omitted)). Finally, though this too is a point on which judg ment will vary , I do not see a persuasive argument for constituti onality in the plura lity's observati on that Van Orden' s lawsuit the monument' ,\" on that echoes the State's contenti on that one fact cutti ng in its favor is that \"the monument had stood in Austin...f or some forty years without generati ng any controversy or litigati on,\" Brief for Respondents 25. It is not that I think the passage of time is necessar ily irrele\u00ad vant in Establishment Clause analysis. We have approved frami ng-era prac tices because they must originally have been understood as constituti onally permissible , e. g., Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783 (1983) (legislative prayer), and we have recog nized that Sunday laws have grown recog nizably secu lar over time, McGowan v. Mar yland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961). There is also an analogous argument, not yet evalu\u00ad ated, that ritualistic religious expressi on can become so numbi ng over time that its initia l Establishment Clause vio\u00ad lation becomes at some point too diminished for notice . But I do not underst and any of these to be the State's argument, which rather seems to be that 40 years without a challenge shows that as a factual matter the religious expressi on is too tepid to provoke a serious reac tion and constitute a violati on. Perhaps, but the writer of Exodus chapter 20 was not luke\u00ad warm, and other explanati ons may do (2005) Souter, J., dissenti ng for the late resor t to the cour ts. Suing a State over religion puts noth ing in a plaintiff's pocket and can take a great deal out, and even with volunteer litigators to supply time and energ y, the risk of socia l ostracism can be power fully deter\u00ad rent. I doubt that a slow walk to the cour thouse , even one that took 40 years, is much evidentiary help in apply ing the Establishment Clause . I would reverse the judg ment of the OCTOBER TERM, 2004 Syllabus TOWN OF CASTLE ROCK, COLORADO v. GONZALES, individu all y and as next best friend of her deceased minor children , GONZALES et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the tenth circuit No. 04-278. Argued March 21, 2005 \u2014Decided June 27, 2005 Respondent led this suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that petiti oner violated the Fourteenth Amendment' s Due Process Clause when its po\u00ad lice ofcers, acting pursuant to ofcia l policy or custom, failed to respond to her repeated repor ts over severa l hours that her estranged husband had taken their three children in violati on of her restrai ning order against him. Ultimately , the husband murdered the children. The District Cour t granted the town' s moti on to dismiss, but an en banc major ity of the Tenth Circuit reversed, nding that respondent had al\u00ad leged a cognizable procedura l due process claim because a Colorado stat\u00ad ute established the state legislature' s clear intent to require police to enforce restrai ning orders, and thus its intent that the order 's recipient have an entitlement to its enforcement. The cour t therefore ruled, among other things, that respondent had a protec ted proper ty interest in the enforcement of her restrai ning order . Held: Respondent did not, for Due Process Clause purposes, have a prop\u00ad erty interest in police enforcement of the restrai ning order against her husband. Pp. 755-768. (a) The Due Process Clause' s procedura l component does not protec t everyth ing that be descr ibed as a gover nment \"benet\": \"To have a proper ty interest in a benet, a perso n... must... have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577. Such entitlements are created by existi ng rules or underst andi ngs stemmi ng from an independent source such as state law. E. g., ibid. Pp. 755-756. (b) A benet is not a protec ted entitlement if ofcia ls have discreti on to grant or deny it. See, e. g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thomp\u00ad son, 490 U. S. 454, 462-463. It is inappropr iate here to defer to the Tenth Circuit' s deter mination that Colorado law gave respondent a right to police enforcement of the restrai ning order . This Cour t therefore proceeds to its own analysis. Pp. 756-758. (c) Colorado law has not created a persona l entitlement to enforce\u00ad ment of restrai ning orders. It does not appear that state law truly made such enforcement manda tory. A 748 (2005) Syllabus lice discreti on has long coexisted with apparently mandatory arrest stat\u00ad utes. Cf. Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 47, n. 2, 62, n. 32. Agai nst that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indicati on than the Colorado statute' s direc tion to \"use every reasonable means to enforce a restrai ning order \" or even to \"arrest . . . or . . . seek a \" A Colorado ofcer would likely have some discreti on to deter mine that\u2014despite probable cause to believe a restrai ning order violated\u2014the violati on's circumst ances or competi a partic\u00ad ular instance . The prac tical necessity for discreti on is particularly apparent in a case such as this, where the suspec ted violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown. In such circum\u00ad stances, the statute does not appear to require ofcers to arrest but only to seek a warrant. That, howe ver, would be an entitlement to noth ing but procedure , which cannot be the basis for a proper ty interest. Pp. 758-764. (d) Even if the statute could be said to make enforcement \"manda\u00ad tory,\" that would not necessar ily mean that respondent has an entitle\u00ad ment to enforcement. Her alleged interest stems not from common law or contrac t, but only from a State's statutory scheme . If she was given a statutory entitlement, the Cour t would expec t to see some indicati on of that in the statute itself . Although the statute spoke of \"protec ted person[ s]\" such as respondent, it did so in connec tion with matters other than a right to enforcement. Most impor tantly , it spoke direc tly to the protec ted person' s power to \"initiate\" contempt proceedi ngs if the order was issued in a civil action, which contrasts tellingly with its conferra l of a power merely to \"request\" initiati on of criminal contempt pro\u00ad ceedi ngs\u2014and even more dramatica lly with its complete silence about any power to \"request\" (much less demand) that an arrest be made . Pp. 764-766. (e) Even were the Cour t to think other wise about Colorado' s creati on of an entitlement, it is not clear that an indiv idua l entitlement to en\u00ad forcement of a restrai ning order could constitute a \"proper ty\" interest for due process purposes. Such a right would have no ascer tainable monet ary value and would arise inciden tally, not out of some new spe\u00ad cies of gover nment benet or a that gover n\u00ad ment actors have always performed\u2014arresti ng people when they have probable cause .

A panel of the Cour t of Appea ls afrmed the rejection of a subst antive due process claim, but found that respondent had alleged a cognizable procedura l due process claim. 307 F. 3d 1258 (CA10 2002). On rehear ing en banc, a divided 3 Three police ofcers were also named as defendants in the complai nt, but the Cour t of Appea ls concluded that they were entitled to qualied immunity , 366 F. 3d 1093, 1118 (CA10 2004) (en banc). Respondent did not le a cross-petiti on challeng ing that aspec t 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t cour t reached the same dispositi on, concludi ng that respond\u00ad ent had a \"protec ted proper ty interest in the enforcement of the terms of her restrai ning order \" and that the town had depr ived her of due process because \"the police never 'heard' nor seriously enter tained her request to enforce and protec t her interests in the restrai ning order .\" 366 F. 3d, at 1101, 1117. We granted certiorar i. 543 U. S. 955 (2004). II The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Consti\u00ad tution prov ides that a State shall not \"depr ive any person of life, liberty, or proper ty, without due process of law.\" Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1. In 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, Congress has created a federa l cause of action for \"the depr ivati on of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constituti on and laws. \" Re\u00ad spondent claims the benet of this prov ision on the ground that she had a proper ty interest in police enforcement of the restrai ning order against her husband; and that the town de\u00ad prived her of this proper ty without due process by having a policy that tolerated nonenforcement of restrai ning orders. As the Cour t of Appea ls recog nized, we left a similar ques\u00ad tion unanswered in DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189 (1989), another case to protec t a young boy from beati ngs by his father that left him severely brain damaged. Id., at 191-193. We held that the so-ca lled \"subst antive\" component of the Due Process Clause does not \"requir[ e] the State to protec t the life, lib\u00ad erty, and proper ty of its citizens against invasion by private actors. \" Id., at 195. We noted, howe ver, that the peti\u00ad tioner had not proper ly preserved the argument that\u2014and we thus \"decl ine[d] to consider \" tive serv ices in accordance with the terms of the statute , an entitlement which would enjoy due process protec tion.\" Id., at 195, n. [03-26-08 21:17:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN CASTLE GONZALES Opinion of the Cour t The procedura l component of the Due Process Clause does not protec t everyth ing that might be descr ibed as a \"bene\u00ad t\": \"To have a proper ty interest in a benet, a person clear ly must have more than an abstrac t need or desire\" and \"more than a unilatera l expec tation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\" Board of Re\u00ad gents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972). Such entitlements are, \" 'of course , . . . not created by the Constituti on. Rather , they are created and their dimen\u00ad are dened by existi ng rules or underst andi ngs that stem from an independent source such as state law.' \" Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 709 (1976) (quoti ng Roth, supra, at 577); see also Phillips v. Washington Legal Founda tion, 524 U. S. 156, 164 (1998). A Our cases recog nize that a benet is tlement if gover nment ofcia ls may grant or deny it in their discreti on. See, e. g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompso n, 490 U. S. 454, 462-463 (1989). The Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals in this case deter mined that Colorado law created an entitlement to enforcement of the restrai ning order because the . and a \"state statute com\u00ad mand[ ed]\" enforcement of the order when certain objec tive conditi ons were met (probable cause to believe that the order had been violated and that the objec t of the order had re\u00ad ceived notice of its existence). 366 F. 3d, at 1101, n. 5; see also id., at 1100, n. 4; id., at 1104 -1105, and n. 9. Respondent contends that we are obliged \"to give deference to the Tenth Circuit' s analysis of Colorado law on\" whether she had an entitlement to enforcement of the restrai ning order . Tr. of Oral Arg. 52. We will not, of course , defer to the Tenth Circuit on the ultimate issue: whether what Colorado law has given re\u00ad spondent constitutes a proper ty interest for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. That deter mination, despite its 748 (2005) 757 Opinion of the Cour t state-law under pinnings, is ultimately one of federa consti\u00ad tutional law. \"Although the under lying subst antive interest is created by 'an independent source such as state law,' fed\u00ad eral constitutional law deter mines whether that interest rises to the level of a 'legitimate claim of entitlement' pro\u00ad tected by the Due Process Clause .\" Memph is Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U. S. 1, 9 (1978) (quoti ng Roth, supra, at 577; emphasis added); cf. United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U. S. 266, 279 (1943). Resoluti on of the fed\u00ad eral issue begins, howe ver, with a deter mination of what it is that state law prov ides. In the context of the present case , the centra l state-law questi on is whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to police enforcement of the re\u00ad strai ning order . It is on this point that respondent' s call for deference to the Tenth Circuit is relevant. We have said that a \"presumpti on of deference [is] given the views of a federa l cour t as to the law of a State within its jurisdic tion.\" Phillips, supra, at 167. That presump\u00ad tion can be overcome , howe ver, see Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U. S. 137, 145 (1996) (per curiam), and we think deference inappropr iate here . The Tenth Circuit' s opinion, which re\u00ad versed the Colorado District Judge , did not draw upon a deep well of state-speci c exper tise, but consisted primarily of quoti ng lang uage from the restrai ning order , the statutory text, and a state-leg islative-hear ing transcr ipt. See 366 F. 3d, at 1103 -1109. These texts, moreover , say noth ing dis\u00ad tinctive to Colorado , but use mandatory lang uage that (as we shall discuss) appears in many state and federa l statutes. As for case law: The only state-law cases about restrai ning orders that the Cour t of Appea ls relied upon were decisi ons of Federa l District Cour ts in Ohio and Pennsylvania and state cour ts in New Jersey , Oregon, and Tennessee . Id., at 1104 -1105, n. 9, 1109.4 Moreover , if we were simply to ac\u00ad 4 Most of the Colorado-law cases cited by the Cour t of Appea ls appeared in footnotes declar ing them to be irrele vant because they involved only subst antive due process (366 F. 3d, at 1100 -1101, 4-5), only PAGES PGT: OPIN Opinion of the Cour t cept the Cour t of Appea ls' conclusi on, we would necessar ily have to decide conclusively a federa l constituti onal questi on (i. e., whether such an entitlement constituted proper ty under the Due Process Clause and, if so, whether petiti oner 's customs or policies prov ided too little process to protec t it). We proceed, then, to our own analysis of whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to enforcement of the restrai n\u00ad ing order .5 B The critica l lang uage in the restrai ning order came not from any part of the order itself (which was signed by the state-cour t trial judge and direc ted to the restrai ned party, respondent' s husband), but from the prepr inted notice to law-enforcement personnel that appeared on the back of the order . See supra, at 751-752. That violati on of a restrai ning order . At the time of the conduc t at issue in this case , that prov ision read as follows: \"(a) Whene restrai ning order is issued, the pro\u00ad tected person shall be prov ided with a copy of such without restrai ning orders (id., at 1101, n. 5), or Colorado' s Gover nment Immunity Act, which the Cour t concluded appl ies \"only to tort law claims\" (id., at 1108 -1109, n. 12). Our analysis is likew ise unaffec ted by the Immunity Act or by the way that Colorado has dealt with subst antive due process or cases that do not involve restrai ning orders. 5 In someth ing of an anyone-but-us approach, the dissent simultaneously (and thus unpersuasively) contends not only that this Cour t shou ld certify a questi on to the Colorado Supreme Cour t, post, at 776-778 (opinion of Stevens, J.), but also that it shou ld defer to the Tenth Circuit (which itself did not certify any such questi on), post, at 775-776. No party in this case has requested certicati on, even as an alternative dispositi on. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56 (petiti counsel \"disfavor[i ng]\" certicati on); id., at 25-26 (counsel for the United States arguing against certicati on). At oral argument, in fact, respondent' s counsel declined Justice Stevens' invitation to request it. Id., at 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t order . A peace ofcer shall use every reaso nable mean s to enforce a restrain ing order. \"(b) A peace ofcer shall arrest, or, if an arrest would be impractical unde r the circum stances , seek a warrant for the arrest of a restrained person when the peace ofcer has informati on amounti ng to probable cause that: \"(I) The restrai ned person has violated or attempted to violate any prov ision of a restrai ning order; and \"(II) The restrai ned person has been proper ly served with a copy of the restrai ning order or the restrai ned person has received actual notice of the existence and subst ance of such order . \"(c) In mak ing the probable cause deter mination de\u00ad scribed in paragraph (b) of this subsec tion (3), a peace ofcer shall assume that the informati on received from the registry is accurate . A peace ofcer shall enforce a valid restrain ing order whether or not there is a rec\u00ad ord of the restrain ing order in the registry.\" Colo . Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3) (Lexis 1999) (emphases added). The Cour t concluded that this statutory prov i\u00ad sion\u2014 especia lly taken in conjunc tion with a statement from its legislative history ,6 and with another statute restr icting 6The Cour t of Appea ls quoted one lawmaker 's descr iption of how the bill \" 'wou ld really attack the domestic violence problems' \": \" '[T]he entire criminal justice system must act in a consistent manner , which does not now occur . The police must make probable cause arrests. The prosecutors must prosecute every case. Judges must apply appro\u00ad priate sentences, and probati on ofcers must monitor their probati oners closely . And the offender needs to be sentenced to offender-speci c therapy . \" '[T]he entire system must send the same message . . . [that] violence is criminal. And so we hope that House Bill 1253 starts us down this road. ' \" 366 F. 3d, at 1107 (quoti ng Tr. of Colorado House Judiciary Hearings on House Bill 1253, Feb. 15, 1994; emphasis 21:17:18] PAGES OPIN CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES Opinion of the Cour t criminal and civil liability for ofcers mak ing arrests 7\u2014es\u00ad tablished the Colorado Legislature' s clear intent \"to alter the fact that the police were not enforci ng domestic abuse re\u00ad strai ning orders, \" and thus its intent \"that the recipient of a domestic abuse restrai ning order have an entitlement to its enforcement. \" 366 F. 3d, at 1108. Any other resu lt, it said, \"wou ld render domestic abuse restrai ning orders utter ly val\u00ad ueless. \" Id., at 1109. This last statement is sheer hyperbole . Whether or not respondent had a right to enforce the restrai ning order , it rendered certain other wise lawfu l conduc t by her husband both criminal and in contempt of cour t. See \u00a7\u00a7 18-6- 803.5(2)( a), (7). The creati on of grounds on which he could be arrested, criminally prosecuted, and held in contempt was hardly \"valueless\"\u2014 even if the prospec t of those sanc tions ultimately failed to prevent him from committi ng three mur\u00ad ders and a suicide . We do not believe that these prov isions of Colorado law truly made enforcement of restrai ning orders manda tory . A well established traditi on of police discreti on has long co\u00ad existed with apparently mandatory arrest statutes. \"In each and every state there are long-st andi ng stat\u00ad utes that, by their terms, preclude nonenforce\u00ad ment by the police....H owever,fora number of reasons, includi their resources, and l impossibi lity, it has been recog nized that inter preted litera lly. . . . [T]hey clear ly do not mean that a police ofcer may not lawfu lly decline to . . . make an arrest. As to third parties in these states, the full-enforcement statutes simply have no effec t, and their signicance is 7 Under Colo . order or other wise enforci ng a restrai ning order \" was not to be held civilly or criminally liable unless he acted \"in bad faith and with malice\" or violated \"rules adopted by the S. 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t further diminished. \" 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 1-4.5, comment ary, pp. 1-124 to 1-125 (2d ed. 1980) (footnotes omitted). The deep-rooted nature of law-enforceme nt discretion, even in the presence of seemi ngly mandatory legislative commands, is illustrated by Chicago v. Mor ales, 527 U.S. 41 (1999), which involved an ordinance that said a police ofcer \" 'shall order ' \" persons to disperse in certain circumst ances, id., at 47, n. 2. This Cour t rejected out of hand the possibi l\u00ad ity that \"the mandatory police no discreti Id., at 62, n. 32. It is, the Cour t proclai med, simply \"common sense that all police ofcers must use some discreti on in decidi ng when and where to enforce city ordinances. \" Ibid. (emphasis added). Agai nst that backdrop, a true mandate of police action would require some stronger indicati on from the Colorado Legislature than \"sha ll use every reasonable means to en\u00ad force a restrai ning order \" (or even \"sha ll arrest . . . or... seek a warrant\"), 18-6-803.5(3)( a), (b). That lang uage is not perceptibly more mandatory than the Colorado statute which has long told municipa l chiefs of police that they \"sha ll pursue and arrest any person fleeing from justice in any part of the state\" and that they \"sha ll apprehend any person in the act of committi ng any offens e... and, forthwith and without any warrant, bring such person before a . . . compe\u00ad tent author ity for Colo . Rev. Stat. \u00a7 31-4-112 (Lexis 2004). It is hard to imag ine that a Colo\u00ad rado peace ofcer would not have some discreti on to deter\u00ad mine that\u2014despite probable cause to believe a restrai ning order has been violated\u2014the circumst ances of the violati on or the competi ng duties of that ofcer or his agency counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance .8 8 Respondent in fact concedes that an ofcer may \"proper ly\" decide not to enforce a restrai ning order when the ofcer deems Respondent explai ns this as a deter mination that there is no probable cause . Opinion of the Cour t The prac tical necessity for discreti on is particularly apparent in a case such as this one, where the suspec ted violator is not actually present and his whereabouts are unknown. Cf. Donalds on v. Seattle, 65 Wash. App. 661, 671-672, 831 P. 2d 1098, 1104 (1992) (\"There is a vast difference between a mandatory duty to arrest [a violator who is on the scene ] and a mandatory duty to conduc t a follow up investigati on [to locate an absent violator ]. would be completely open-ended priority, durati on and intensity\"). The dissent correc tly points out that, in the speci c con\u00ad text of domestic violence , mandatory-arrest statutes have been found in some States to be more mandatory than tra\u00ad ditional mandatory-arrest statutes. Post, at 779-784 (opin\u00ad ion of Stevens, J.). The Colorado statute mandati ng arrest for a domestic-v iolence offense is different from but related to the one at issue here , and it includes similar though not identica l phrasi ng. See Colo . (Lexis 1999) (\"When a peace ofcer deter mines that there is probable cause to believe that a crime or offense involv ing domestic violence . . . has been committed, the ofcer shall, without undue delay , arrest the person suspec ted of its commissi on . . . \"). Even in the domestic-v iolence context, howe ver, it is unclear how the mandatory-arrest paradig m appl ies to cases in which the offender is not present to be arrested. As the dissent explai ns, post, at 780-781, and n. 8, much of the impetus for mandatory-arrest statutes and poli\u00ad cies derived from the idea that it is better for police ofcers to arrest the aggressor in a domestic-v iolence incident than to attempt to mediate the dispute or merely to ask the of\u00ad fender to leave the scene . Those other options are only available , of course , when the offender is present at the ent 28. We think, howe ver, that a deter mination of no probable cause to believe a violati on has occurred is quite different from a deter mination that the violati on is 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t scene . See Hanna, No Right to Choose: Mandated Victim Participati on in Domestic Violence Prosecuti ons, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 1849, 1860 (1996) (\"[T]he clear trend in police prac tice is to arrest the batterer at the scene . . . \" (emphasis added)). As one of the cases cited by the dissent, post, at 783, recog\u00ad nized, \"there will be situations when no arrest is possible, such as when the alleged abuser is not in the home.\" Donaldson, 65 Wash. App., at 674, 831 P. 2d, at 1105 (emphasis added). That case held that Washington's mandatory-arrest statute required an arrest only in \"cases where the offender is on the scene ,\" and that it \"d[id] not create an on-goi ng manda\u00ad tory duty to conduc t an investigati on\" to locate the offender . Id., at P. 2d, at 1105. Colorado' s restrai a similar disti nction, prov id\u00ad ing that when arrest is \"imprac tical\"\u2014wh ich was likely the case when the whereabouts of respondent' s husband were unknown\u2014the ofcers' statutory duty is to \"seek a warrant\" rather than \"arrest. \" \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( b). Respondent does not speci fy the precise means of enforce\u00ad ment that the Colorado restrai ning-order statute asser tedly mandated\u2014whether her interest lay in having police arrest her husband, having them seek a warrant for his arrest, or having them \"use every reasonable means, up to and includ\u00ad ing arrest, to enforce the order 's terms,\" Brief for Respond\u00ad ent 29-30.9 Such indeter minacy is not the hallmark of a duty that is mandatory . Nor can someone be safely deemed \"entitled\" to someth ing when the identity of the alleged enti\u00ad tlement is vague. See Roth, 408 U. S., at 577 (consider ing 9 Respondent charac terizes her entitlement in various ways. See Brief for Respondent 12 (\" 'entitlement' to receive protec tive serv ices\"); id., at 13 (\"interest in 14 of the cour t order protec ting her and her children against her abusive husband\"); id., at 32 (\"[T]he restrai ning order here mandated the arrest of Mr. Gonza les under speci ed circumst ances, or at a minimum required the use of reasonable means to enforce the order \"). 764 545US2 Unit: $U76 [03-26-08 21:17:18] PAGES the Cour t whether \"certain benets\" Ridgeeld, 170 F. (CA2 1999) (\"There is no reason . . . to restr ict the 'uncer\u00ad tainty' that will preclude existence of a federa lly protec table proper ty interest to the in dissent, formulations of the entitlement in questi on,10 ultimately con\u00ad tends that the obligati ons under the statute were quite pre\u00ad cise: either make an arrest or (if that is imprac tical) seek an arrest warrant, post, at 785. The problem with this is that the seek ing of an arrest warrant would be an entitlement to noth ing but procedure \u2014wh ich we have held inadequate even to suppor t standi ng, see Lujan v. Defende rs of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992); much less can it be the basis for a proper ty interest. See post, at 771-772 (Souter, J., concurr ing). After the warrant is sought, it remai ns within the discreti on of a judge whether to grant it, and after it is granted, it remai ns within the discreti on of the police whether and when to execute it.11 Respondent would have been assured noth\u00ad ing but the seek ing of a warrant. This is not the sort of \"entitlement\" out of which a proper ty interest is created. Even if the statute could be said to have made enforcement of restrai ning orders \"mandatory\" because of the domestic\u00ad violence context of the under lying statute , that would not 10 See post, at 773 (\"entitlement police the local police force\"); post, at 774 (\"a right to police assist ance\"); post, at 779 (\"a citizen's interest in the gover nment' s commitment to prov ide police enforcement in certain dened circumst ances\"); post, at 789 (\"respondent' s proper ty interest in the en\u00ad forcement of her restrai ning order \"); (the \"serv ice\" of \"protec tion from her husband\"); post, at 792 (\"interest in the enforcement of the restrai ning order \"). 11 The dissent asser ts that the police would lack discreti on in the execu\u00ad tion of this warrant, post, at 785, n. 12, but cites no statute mandati ng immediate executi on. The genera l Colorado ning arrest prov ides that police \"may arrest\" when they possess a \"command\u00ad ing\" arrest. 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t necessar ily mean that state law gave respo nden t an entitle\u00ad ment to enforcemen t of the mandate . Mak ing the actions of gover nment employees obligatory can serve various legiti\u00ad mate ends other than the conferra l of a benet on a speci c class of people . See, e. g., Sand in v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 482 (1995) (nding no constituti onally protec ted liberty inter\u00ad est in prison regulations phrased in mandatory terms, in part because \"[s]uch guidel ines are not set forth solely to benet the prisoner \"). The serv ing of publ ic rather than private ends is the normal course of the criminal law because crimi\u00ad nal acts, \"besides the injury [they do] to indiv idua ls, . . . strike at the very being of society; which cannot possibly subsist, where actions of this sort are suffered to escape with impunity .\" 4 W. Blackstone , Comment aries on the Laws of England 5 (1769); see also Hun tington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 668 (1892). This principle under lies, for example , a Col\u00ad orado distr ict attor ney's discreti on to prosecute a domestic assau lt, even though the victim withdraws her charge . See People v. Cune fare, 102 P. 3d 302, 311-312 (Colo . 2004) (en banc) (Bender , J., concurr in part, dissenti ng in part, and dissenti ng in part to the judg ment). Respondent' s alleged interest stems only from a State's statutory scheme \u2014from a restrai ning order that was author\u00ad ized by and tracked precisely the statute on which the Cour t of Appea ls relied. She does not asser t that she has any common-law or contrac tual entitlement to enforcement. If she was given a statutory entitlement, we would expec t to see some indicati on of that in the statute itself . Although Colorado' s statute spoke of \"protec ted person[ s]\" such as re\u00ad spondent, it did so in connec tion with matters other than a right to enforcement. It said that a \"protec ted person shall be prov ided with a copy of [a restrai ning] order \" when it is issued, \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( a); that a law enforcement agency \"sha ll make all reasonable effor ts to cont act the protec ted party upon the arrest of the restrai ned person, \" \u00a7 18-6- 803.5(3)( d); and that the agency CASTLE ROCK v. GONZALES Opinion of the Cour t person ] a copy\" of the repor t it submits to the cour t that issued the order , \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( e). Perhaps most impor\u00ad tantly , spoke direc tly to the protec ted person' s power to \"initiate contempt proceedi ngs against the re\u00ad strai ned person if the order [was] issued in a civil action or request the prosecuti ng attor ney to initiate contempt pro\u00ad ceedi ngs if the order [was] issued in a criminal action.\" \u00a7 18-6-803.5(7). The protec ted person' s express power to \"initiate\" civil contempt proceedi ngs contrasts tellingly with the mere ability to \"request\" initiati on of criminal contempt proceedi ngs\u2014and even more dramatica lly with the complete silence about any power to \"request\" (much less demand) that an arrest be made . The creati on of a persona l entitlement to someth ing as vague and novel as enforcement of restrai ning orders cannot \"simply g[o] without saying.\" Post, at 788, n. 16 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). We conclude that Colorado has not created such an entitlement. C Even if we were to think other wise concer ning the cre\u00ad ation of an entitlement by Colorado , it is by no means clear that an indiv idua l entitlement to enforcement of a restrai n\u00ad ing order could constitute a \"proper ty\" interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause . Such a right would not, of course , resemble any traditi onal concepti on of proper ty. Al\u00ad though that alone does not disqua lify it from due process protec tion, as Roth and its progeny show , the right to have a restrai ning order enforced does not \"have some ascer tain\u00ad able monet ary value,\" as even our \"Roth-type proper ty-as\u00ad entitlement\" cases have implicitly required. Merr ill, The Landscape of Constituti onal Proper ty, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 964 (2000).12 Perhaps most radica lly, the alleged proper ty 12 The dissent suggests that the interest in having a restrai ning order enforced does have an ascer tainable monet ary value, because one may \"contrac t with a private secur ity rm . to prov ly. Post, at 773, 790, 791, and n. 19. That is, of course , not as precise 767 S. 748 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t interest here arises incidentally, not out of some new species of gover nment benet or serv ice, but out of that gover nment actors have always performed\u2014to wit, arrest\u00ad ing people who they have probable cause to believe have committed a criminal offense .13 The indirec t nature of a benet was fatal to the due proc\u00ad ess claim of the nursi ng-home residents in O'Banno n v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U. S. 773 (1980). We held that, while the withdrawa l of \"direc t benets\" (nancia l payments under Medicaid for certain medica l serv ices) triggered due process protec tions, id., at 786-787, the same was not true for the \"indirec t benet[ s]\" conferred on Medicaid patients when the nment enforced \"minimum standards of care\" for nursi ng-home facilities, id., at 787. \"[A]n indirec t and incident al resu lt of the Gover nment' s enforcement action . . . does not amount to a depr ivati on of any interest in life, lib\u00ad erty, or proper ty.\" Ibid. In this and action that is direc ted against a third party and affec ts the citizen only indirec tly or ides a sufcient answer to\" re\u00ad cases that found gover nment-prov ided as the analogy between publ ic and private school ing that the dissent in\u00ad vokes.

Respondent probably could have hired a pri\u00ad vate rm to guard her house , to prevent her husband from comi ng onto the proper ty, and perhaps even to search for her husband after she discov\u00ad ered that her children were missi ng. Her alleged entitlement here , how\u00ad ever, does not consist in an abstrac t right to \"protec tion,\" but (accordi ng to the dissent) in enforcement of her restrai ning order through the arrest of her husband, or the seek ing of a warrant for his arrest, after she gave the police probable cause to believe the restrai ning order had been vio\u00ad lated. A private person would not have the power to arrest under those circumst ances because the crime would not have occurred in his presence . Colo . Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-3-201 (Lexis 1999). And, needless to say, a private person would not have the power to obtain an arrest warrant. 13 In other contexts, we have explai ned that \"a private citizen lacks a judicia lly cognizable interest in the prosecuti on or nonprosecuti on of an\u00ad other .\" Linda R.

III We conclude , therefore , that respondent did not, for pur\u00ad poses of the Due Process Clause , have a proper ty interest in police enforcement of the restrai ning order against her husband. It is accordi ngly unnecessary to address the Cour t of Appea ls' deter mination (366 F. 3d, at 1110 -1117) that the town' s custom or policy prevented the police from giving her due process when they depr ived her of that al\u00ad leged interest. See Ame rican Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sull i\u00ad van, 526 U.

Taylor, 451 U. S. 527, 544 (1981) (quoti ng Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S., at 701), but it does not mean States are power less to prov ide victims with per\u00ad sona lly enforceable remedies. Although the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 (the original source of \u00a7 1983), did not create a sys\u00ad tem by which police depar tments are genera lly held nan\u00ad cially account able for crimes that better policing might have 14 Because we simply do not address whether the process would have been adequate if respondent had had a proper ty interest, the dissent is correc t to note that we do not \"contest\" the point, post, at 774.

Ante, at 760-764, and n. 8. Gonza les's claim of a proper ty right thus runs up against police discreti on in the face of an indiv idua l demand to enforce , and discreti on to ignore an indiv idua l instruction not to enforce (because , say, of a domestic reconci liation); no one would argue that the beneciary of a Colorado order like the one here would be author ized to control a cour t's con\u00ad tempt power or order the police to refrai n from arresti ng. These considerati ons argue against inferr ing any guarantee of a level of protec tion or safety that could be understood as the objec t of a \"legitimate claim of entitlement, \" Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972), in the nature of proper ty arising under Colorado law.* Con\u00ad sequently , the classic predicate for federa l due process pro\u00ad tection of interests under state law is missi ng. Gonza les implicitly recog nizes this, when she argument: \"Ms. Gonza les alleges that . . . she was denied the proc\u00ad ess laid out in the statute . The police did not consider her request in a timely fashion, but instead repeatedly required her to call the station over severa l hours. The statute promised a process by which her restrai ning order would be given vitality through carefu l and prompt considerati on of an enforcement request . . . . Denial of that process drained all of the value from her proper ty interest in the restrai ning order .\" Brief for Respondent 10. The argument is uncon venti onal because the state-law bene\u00ad t for which it claims federa l procedura l protec tion is itself a variety of procedura l regulation, a set of rules to be fol\u00ad lowed by ofcers exercisi ng the State's executive power: *Gonza les does not claim to have a ted S. 748 (2005) Souter, J., concurr ing all reasonable means to enforce , arrest upon demonstrable probable cause , get a warrant, and so on, see ante, at 751-752. When her argument is understood as uncon venti onal in this sense , a further reason appears for rejecting its call to apply Roth, a reason that would apply even if the statutory mandates to the police were absolute , leaving the police with no discreti on when the beneciary of a protec tive order in\u00ad sists upon its enforcement. The Due Process Clause ex\u00ad tends procedura l protec tion to guard against ofcia ls of rights process protec ts the prop\u00ad erty created by state law. But Gonza les claims a proper ty interest in a state-mandated process in and of itself . This argument is at odds with the rule that \"[p]rocess is not an end in itself . Its constituti onal purpose is to protec t a sub\u00ad stantive interest to which the indiv idua l has a legitimate claim of entitlement. \" Olim v. Wakineko na, 461 U. S. 238, 250 (1983); see also Doe v. District of Columb ia, 93 F. 3d 861, 868 (CADC 1996) (per curiam); Doe v. Milwaukee County, 903 F. 2d 499, 502-503 (CA7 1990). In putti ng to rest the notion that the scope of an other wise discer nible proper ty interest could be limited by related state-law procedures, this Cour t observed that \"[t]he categor ies depr ivati on.\" Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, 541 (1985). Just as a State cannot diminish a proper ty right, once conferred, by attaching less than generous procedure to its depr ivati on, ibid., neither does a State create a proper ty right merely by ordai ning benecia l procedure unconnec ted to some articula\u00ad ble subst antive guarantee . This is not to say that state rules of executive procedure may not prov ide signicant rea\u00ad sons to infer an articulable proper ty right meant to be pro\u00ad tected; but it is to say that we have not identi ed proper v. GONZALES Souter, J., concurr ing with procedure as such. State rules of executive procedure , howe ver impor tant, may be noth ing more than rules of exec\u00ad utive procedure . Thus, in every instance of proper ty recog nized by this Cour t as calling tions imposed on state ofcia ls to protec t it. Whether wel\u00ad fare benets, Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U. S. 254 (1970), attendance at publ ic schools, Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), utility serv ices, Memph is Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U. S. 1 (1978), publ ic employment, Perry v. Sinde r\u00ad mann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972), professi onal licenses, Barry v. Barch i, 443 U. S. 55 (1979), and so on, the proper ty interest recog nized in our cases has always existed apar t from state procedura l protec tion l process. To accede to Gonza les's argument would therefore work a sea change in the scope of federa l due process, for she seeks federa l process as a substitute simply for state process. (And she seeks damages under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, for denia l of process to which she claimed a federa l right.) There is no articulable disti nction between the objec t of Gon\u00ad zales's asser ted entitlement and the process she desires in order to protec t her entitlement; both amount to certain steps to be taken by the police to protec t her fami ly and herself . Gonza les's claim would thus take us beyond Roth or any other recog nized theory of Fourteenth Amendment due process, by collapsi ng the disti nction between proper ty protec ted and the process that protec ts it, and would federa l\u00ad ize every mandatory state-law direc tion to executive ofcers whose performance on the job can be vitally signicant to indiv idua ls affec ted. The procedura l direc tions are just that. They presuppose no enforceable subst antive entitlement, and Roth does not raise them to federa lly enforceable status in the name of 748 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenti ng. The issue presented to us is much narrower than is sug\u00ad gested by the far-rang ing arguments of the parties and their amici. Neither the trag ic facts of the case , nor the impor\u00ad tance of accordi ng law fessi onals, shou ld diver t our attenti on from that issue . That issue is whether the restrai ning order entered by the Colo\u00ad rado trial cour t on June 4, 1999, created a \"proper ty\" interest that is protec ted from arbitrary depr ivati on by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is perfectly clear , on the one hand, that neither the Fed\u00ad eral Constituti on itself, nor any federa l statute granted re\u00ad spondent or her children any indiv idua entitlement to police protec tion. See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S. 189 (1989). Nor, I assume , does any Colorado statute create any such entitlement for the ordi\u00ad nary citizen. On the other hand, it is equa lly clear that fed\u00ad eral law imposes no impedi ment to the creati on of such an entitlement by Colorado law. Respondent certainly could have entered into a contrac t with a private secur ity rm, obligati ng the rm fam\u00ad ily; tionably constitute \"proper ty\" within the meani ng of the Due Process Clause . If a Colorado statute enac ted for her bene\u00ad t, or a valid order entered by a Colorado judge , created the func tional equiva lent of such a private contrac t by grant\u00ad ing respondent an entitlement to mandatory indiv idua l pro\u00ad tection by the local police force , that state-created right would also qualify as \"proper ty\" to constituti onal protec tion. I do not underst and the major ity to rule out the foregoi ng propositi ons, although it does express doubts. See ante, at 766 (\"[I]t is by no means clear that an indiv idua l entitlement to enforcement of a restrai ning order could constitute a 774 545US2 Unit: $U76 [03-26-08 21:17:18] PAGES ng 'proper ty' interest\"). Moreover , the major ity does not con\u00ad test, see ante, at 768, that if respondent did have a cognizable proper ty interest in this case , the depr ivati on of that interest violated due process. As the Cour t notes, respondent has alleged that she presented the police with a copy of the re\u00ad strai ning order issued by the Colorado cour t and requested that it be enforced. Ante, at 751, n. 1. In response , she contends, the ofcers effec tively ignored her. If these alle\u00ad gations are true, a federa l statute , Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983, prov ides her with a remedy against the peti\u00ad tioner , even if Colorado law does not. See Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532 (1985). The centra l questi on in this case is therefore whether , as a matter of Colorado law, respondent had a right to police assist ance comparable to the right she would have possessed to any other serv ice the gover nment or a private rm might have under taken to prov ide. See Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577 (1972) (\"Proper ty inter\u00ad ests, of course , are not created by the Constituti on. Rather , they are created and their dimensi ons are dened by existi ng rules or underst andi ngs that stem from an independent source such as state law\u2014r ules or underst andi ngs that se\u00ad cure certain benets and that suppor t claims of entitlement to those benets\"). There was a time when our traditi on of judicia l restrai nt would have led this Cour t to defer to the judg ment of more qualied tribuna ls in seek ing the correc t answer to that dif\u00ad cult questi on of Colorado law. Unfortunately , although the major ity proper ly identi es the \"centra l state-law questi on\" in this case as \"whether Colorado law gave respondent a right to police enforcement of the restrai ning order ,\" ante, at 758, it has chosen to ignore our settled prac tice by prov id\u00ad ing its own answer to that questi on. Before identi fying the flaws in the Cour t's ruling on the merits, I shall briefly com\u00ad ment on our past Stevens, J., dissenti ng I The major ity's decisi on to plunge ahead with its own anal\u00ad ysis of Colorado law \"deference [to] the views of a federa l cour t as to the law of a State within its jurisdic tion.\" Phillips v. Washington Legal Founda tion, 524 U. S. 156, 167 (1998); see also Bisho p v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346, and n. 10 (1976) (collecting cases). This policy is not only efcient, but it reflec ts of ap\u00ad peals are better schooled in and more able to inter pret the laws of their respec tive States. \" Brocke tt v. Spokane Ar\u00ad Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 500-501 (1985); Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620, 629-630 (1946) (endorsi ng \"great deference to the views of the judges of those cour ts 'who are fami liar with the intricacies and of local law and prac tice' \"). Accordi ngly, we have declined to show defer\u00ad ence only in rare cases in which the cour t of appea ls' resolu\u00ad tion of state law was \"clear ly wrong \" or other wise seriously decient. See Brocke tt, 472 U. S., at 500, n. 9; accord, Lea\u00ad vitt v. Jane L., 518 U. S. 137, 145 (1996) (per curiam). Unfortunately , the Cour t does not even attempt to demon\u00ad strate that the six-judge en banc major ity was \"clear ly wrong \" in its inter pret ation of Colorado' s domestic restrai n\u00ad ing order statute; nor could such a show ing be made . For it is certainly plausible to constr ue \"shall use every reasonable means to enforce a restrai ning order \" and \"shall arrest, \" Colo . Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( a)-(b) 1999) (empha\u00ad sis added), as conveying mandatory direc tives to the police, particularly when the same statute , at other times, tellingly employs different lang uage that suggests police discreti on, see \u00a7 18-6-803.5(6)( a) (\"A peace ofcer is authorized to use means protec . , unlike 1 The Cour t of Appea ls also looked to other prov isions of the statute to inform its analysis. In particular, it reasoned that a prov ision that gave police ofcers qualied immunity in 21:17:18] PAGES dissenti ng today' s decisi on, the Cour t of Appea ls was attentive to the legislative history of the statute , focusi ng on a statement by the statute' s sponsor in the Colorado House , ante, at 759, n. 6 (quoti ng statement), which it took to \"emphasi z[e] the impor tance of the police's mandatory enforcement of domes\u00ad tic restrai ning orders. \" 366 F. 3d 1093, 1107 (CA10 2004) (en banc). Far from over looking the traditi onal presumpti on of police discreti on, then, the Cour t of Appea ls' diligent analy\u00ad sis of the statute' s text, purpose , and history led it to con\u00ad clude that the Colorado Legislature intended precisely to ab\u00ad rogate that presumpti on in the speci c context of domestic restrai ning orders. That conclusi on is eminently reasonable and, I believe, worthy of our deference .2 II Even if the Cour t had good reason to doubt the Cour t of Appea ls' deter mination of state law, it would, in my judg\u00ad ment, be a far wiser course to certify the questi on to the restrai ning orders, see Colo . Stat. \u00a7 18-6-803.5(5) (Lexis 1999), sup\u00ad ported the inference that the Colorado Legislature intended mandatory enforcement. See 366 F. 3d 1093, 1108 (CA10 2004) (en banc). 2 The Cour t declines to show deference for the odd reason that, in its view, the Cour t of Appea ls did not \"draw upon a deep well of state-speci c exper tise,\" ante, at 757, but rather exami ned the statute' s text and legisla\u00ad tive history and disti nguished arguably relevant Colorado case law. See ante, at 757, and n. 4. This rationale makes a mockery of our traditi onal prac tice, for it is precisely when there is no state law on point that the presumpti on that circuits have local exper tise plays any usefu l role. When a circuit' s resoluti on of a novel questi on of state law is grounded on a concededly complete review of all the pertinent state-law mater ials, that decisi on is entitled to deference . Additi onally, it shou ld be noted that this is not a case in which the Cour t of Appea ls and the District Cour t dis\u00ad agreed on the relevant issue of state law; rather , those cour ts disagreed only over the extent to which a probable-cause deter mination requires the exercise of discreti on. Compare 366 F. 3d, at 1105 -1110, with App. to Pet. for Cert. Stevens, dissenti ng Colorado Supreme Cour t.3 Power ful considerati ons suppor t certicati on in this case. First, principles of federa lism and comity favor giving a State's high the oppor tunity to answer impor tant questi ons of state law, particularly when those questi ons implicate uniquely local matters such as law enforcement and might well require the weigh ing of policy considerati ons for their correc t resoluti on.4 See Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U. S. 647, 662, n. 16 (1978) (sua sponte certifying a questi on of state law because it is \"one in which state gov\u00ad ernments have the highest interest\"); cf. Arizonans for Of\u00ad cial English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 77 (1997) (\"Through certicati on of novel or unsettled questi ons of state law for author itative answers by a State's highest cour t, a federa l cour t may save 'time, energ y, and resources, and hel[p ] build a cooperative judicia l federa lism' \" (brackets in original)).5 3 See Colo . Rule App. Proc. 21.1( a) (Colorado Supreme Cour t may an\u00ad swer questi ons of law certied to it by the Supreme Cour t of the United States or another federa l cour t if those questi ons \"may be deter minative of the cause\" and \"as to which it appears to the certifying cour t there is no control ling precedent in the decisi ons of the [Colorado ] Supreme Cour t\"). 4 See Westminster v. Dogan Constr. Co., 930 P. 2d 585, 590 (Colo . 1997) (en banc) (in inter preti ng an ambig uous statute , the Colorado Supreme Cour t will consider legislative history and the \"consequences of a particu\u00ad lar constr uction\"); ibid. (\" 'Because we also presume that legislati on is in\u00ad tended to have just and reasonable effec ts, we must constr ue statutes accordi ngly and apply them so as to ensure such resu lts' \"). Additi onally, it is possible that the Colorado Supreme Cour t would have better access to (and greater facility with) relevant pieces of legislative history beyond those that we have before us. That cour t may also choose to give certain evidence of legislative intent greater weight than would be customary for this Cour t. See, e. g., Brief for Peggy Kerns et al. as Ami ci Curiae (bill sponsor explai ning the Colorado Genera l Assembly' s intent in passi ng the domestic restrai ning order statute). 5 Citing similar considerati ons, the Second Circuit certied questi ons of state law to the Connec ticut Supreme Cour t when it was faced with a procedura l due process claim involv ing a statute that arguably mandated the remova l of children upon probable cause of child abuse . See Sealed v. Sealed, 332 F. 3d 51 (2003). The Connec ticut Stevens, J., dissenti ng Second , by certifying a potentially dispositive state-law issue , the Cour t would adhere to its wise policy of avoidi ng the unnecessary adjudicati on of difcu lt questi ons of consti\u00ad tutional law. See Elkins, 435 U. S., at 661-662 (citing con\u00ad stituti onal avoidance as a factor suppor ting certicati on). Third, certicati on would promote both judicia l economy and fairness to the parties. After all, the Colorado Supreme Cour t is the ultimate author ity on the meani ng of Colorado law, and if in later litigati on it shou ld disagree with our effor ts wasted and respondent will have been depr ived of the oppor tunity to have her claims heard under the author itative view of Colorado law. The unique facts of this case only serve to emphasi ze the impor tance of employ ing a procedure that will prov ide the correc t answer to the centra l questi on of state law. See Brocke tt, 472 U. S., at 510 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing) (\"Specu lation by a federa l cour t about the mean\u00ad ing of a state statute in the absence of a prior state cour t adjudicati on is particularly gratuitous when, as is the case here , the state cour ts stand willing to address questi ons of state law on certicati on from a federa l cour t\").6 certicati discreti onary , not mandatory . See Teresa T. v. Ragagl ia, 272 Conn. 734, 865 A. 2d 428 (2005). 6 The Cour t is correc t that I would take an \"anyone-but-us approach, \" ante, at 758, n. 5, to the questi on of who decides the issue of Colorado law in this case. Both options that I favor\u2014 deferr ing to the Circuit' s inter pret ation or, barr ing that, certifying to the Colorado Supreme Cour t\u2014recog nize the comparative exper tise of another tribuna l on ques\u00ad tions of state law. And both options offer their own efciencies. By con\u00ad trast, the Cour any cogent justi cati on. The fact that neither party requested certicati on certainly cannot be a sufcient reason for dismissi ng that option. As with abstenti on, the considerati ons that weigh in to settle correc tly a recurr ing issue of state law\u2014transcend the interests of indiv idua l litigants, render ing it imprudent to cast them as gatekeepers to the procedure . See, e. g., Elkins v. Moreno, 435 U. S. 647, 662 (1978) (certifying state-law issue absent a request from the 748 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng III Three flaws in the Cour t's rather super cial analysis of the merits highlight the unw isdom of its decisi on to answer the state-law questi on de novo. First, the Cour t places undue weight on the various statutes throughout the country that seemi ngly mandate police enforcement but are genera lly un\u00ad derstood to preserve police discreti on. As a resu lt, the Cour t gives shor t shrift to the unique case of \"mandatory arrest\" statutes in the domestic violence context; States passed a wave of these statutes in the 1980' s and 1990' s with the unmist akable goal of eliminating police discreti on in this area. Second, the Cour t's formalistic analysis fails to take seriously the fact that the Colorado statute at issue in this case was enac ted for the benet of the narrow class of per\u00ad sons who are beneciar ies of domestic restrai ning orders, and that the order at issue in this case was speci cally in\u00ad tended to prov ide protec tion to respondent and her children. Finally, the Cour t is simply wrong to asser t that a citizen's interest in the gover nment' s commitment to prov ide police enforcement in proper ty,\" ante, at 766; in fact, a citizen's proper ty interest in such a commitment is just as concrete and worthy of protec tion as her interest in any other impor tant serv ice the gover nment or a private rm has under taken to prov ide. In 1994, the Colorado Genera l Assembly passed omnibus legislati on targeti ng domestic violence . The part of the leg\u00ad islati on at issue in this case mandates enforcement of a do\u00ad mestic restrai ning order upon probable cause of a violati on, \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3), while another part direc ts ll, without undue delay , arrest\" a suspec t upon \"probable cause to believe that a crime or offense of domestic violence v.

Thus, when Colorado passed its statute in 1994, it joined the ranks of 15 States that mandated arrest for domestic violence offenses and 19 States that mandated arrest for do\u00ad mestic restrai ning order violati ons.

While Colorado case law does not speak to the questi on, it is instructive that other state cour ts inter preti ng their anal\u00ad ogous statutes have held that they eliminate the police's traditi onal discreti on to refuse enforcement, but have 10 See Note, Mandatory Arrest: A Step Toward Eradicati ng Domestic Violence , But is It Enough?

For example , in Nearing v. Weaver, 295 Ore. 702, 670 P. 2d 137 (1983) (en banc), the cour t held that although the common law of negligence did not sup\u00ad port a suit against the police for failing to enforce a domestic restrai ning order , the statute' s mandatory direc tive formed the basis for the suit because it was \"a speci c duty imposed by statute for the benet of indiv idua ls previously identi ed by judicia l order .\" Id., at 707, 670 P. 2d, at 140.11 In Mat\u00ad thews v.

Id., at 165. See also Camp\u00ad bell v. Campbell, 294 N. J. Super . 18, 24, 682 A. 2d 272, 274 (1996) (domestic restrai ning order statute \"allows no discre\u00ad tion\" with regard to arrest; \"[t]he duty imposed on the police ofcer is minister ial\"); Donalds on v.

In regard to domestic violence , the rule is the reverse . If the ofcer has the legal grounds to arrest pursuant to the statute , he has a mandatory duty to make the arrest\"). To what extent the Colorado Supreme Cour t would agree with the views of these cour ts is, of course , an open questi on, but it does seem rather brazen for the major ity to assume that the Colorado Supreme Cour t 11 The Oregon Supreme Cour t noted that the \"widespread refusa l or failure of police ofcers to remove persons involved in episodes of domestic violence was presented to the legislature as the main reason for tighteni ng the law so as to require enforcement of restrai ning orders by mandatory arrest and custody .\" Nearing, 295 Ore., at 709, 670 P. 2d, at 21:17:18] Stevens, J., dissenti ng would repudiate this consistent line of persuasive author ity from other States. Indeed, the Cour t fails to come to terms with the wave of domestic violence statutes that prov ides the crucial context for underst andi ng Colorado' law. The Cour t concedes that, \"in the speci c context of domestic violence , mandatory\u00ad arrest statutes have been found in some States to be more mandatory than traditi onal mandatory-arrest statutes,\" ante, at 762, but that is a serious underst atement. The dif\u00ad ference is not a matter of degree , but of kind. Before this wave of statutes, the legal rule was one of discreti on; as the Cour t shows, the \"traditi onal,\" genera l mandatory arrest statutes have always been understood to be \"mandatory\" in name only, see ante, at 760. The innovati on of the domestic violence statutes was to make police enforcement, not \"more mandatory ,\" but simply manda tory . If, as the Cour t says, the existence of a protec ted \"entitlement\" turns on whether \"gover nment ofcia ls may grant or deny it in their discre\u00ad tion,\" ante, at 756, the new mandatory statutes undeniably create an entitlement to police enforcement of restrai ning orders. Perhaps recog nizing this point, the Cour t glosses over the dispositive questi on\u2014whether the police enjoyed discreti on to deny enforcement \u2014and focuses on a different questi on\u2014 which \"precise means of enforcement, \" ante, at 763, were called for in this case. But that questi on is a red herr ing. The statute direc ts that, upon probable cause of a violati on, \"a peace ofcer shall arrest, or, if an arrest would be imprac\u00ad tical under the circumst ances, seek a warrant for the arrest of a restrai ned person. \" Colo . Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( b) (Lexis 1999). Regardless of whether the enforcement called for in this case was arrest or the seek ing of an arrest warrant (the answer to that questi on probably changed over the course of the night as the respondent gave the police more informati on about the husband' s whereabouts), the crucial point is that, under the statute , the police were requ ired to prov ide Stevens, J., dissenti ng ing.12 The Cour t suggests that the fact that \"enforcement\" may encompass different acts infects any entitlement to en\u00ad forcement with \"indeter minacy .\" Ante, at 763. But this objec tion is also unfounded. Our cases have never required the objec t of an entitlement to be some mechanistic, unitary thing. Suppose a State entitled every citizen whose income was under a certain level to receive health care at a state clinic. The prov ision of health care is not a unitary thing\u2014 doctors and admi nistrators must decide what tests are called for and what procedures are required, and these decisi ons often involve difcu lt appl icati ons of judg ment. But it could not credibly be said that a citizen lacks an entitlement to health care simply because the content of that entitlement is not the same in every given situati on. Similarly, the en\u00ad forcement of a restrai ning order is not some amor phous, in\u00ad deter minate thing. Under the statute , if the police have probable cause that a violati on has occurred, enforcement consists of either mak ing an immediate arrest or seek ing a warrant and then executi ng an arrest \u2014traditi onal, well\u00ad dened tasks that enforcement ofcers day.13 12 Under the Cour t's readi ng of the statute , a police ofcer with probable cause is mandated to seek an arrest warrant if arrest is \"imprac tical under the circumst ances, \" but then enjoys unfettered discreti on in decidi ng whether to execu te that warrant. Ante, at 764. This is an unlikely read\u00ad ing given that the statute was motivated by a profound distr ust of police discreti on in the domestic violence context and motivated by a desire to improve the protec tion given to holders of domestic restrai ning orders. We do not have the benet of an author itative constr uction of Colorado law, but I would think that if an estranged husband harassed his wife in violati on of a restrai ning order , and then absconded after she called the police, the statute would not only obligate the police to seek an arrest warrant, but also obligate them to execute it by mak ing an arrest. In any event, under respondent' s allegati ons, by the time the police were informed of the husband' s whereabouts, an arrest was prac tical and, under the statute' s terms, mandatory . 13 The Cour t wonders \"how the mandatory-arrest paradig m appl ies to cases in which the offender is not present to be arrested. \" Ante, at 762. Agai n, questi ons as to the scope of the obligati on prov Stevens, J., dissenti ng The Cour t similarly errs in specu lating that the Colorado Legislature may have mandated police enforcement of re\u00ad strai ning orders for \"var ious legitimate ends other than the conferra l of a benet on a speci c class of people ,\" ante, at 765; see also ibid. (noting that the \"serv ing of publ ic rather than private ends is the normal course of the criminal law\"). While the Cour t's concer n would have some bite were we are far aeld from the key issue \u2014whether there exists an entitlement to enforcement. In any event, the Cour t's specu lations are off base . First, this is not a case like Donalds on v. Seattle, 65 Wash. App. 661, 831 P. 2d 1098 (1992), in which the restrai ned person violated the order and then left the scene . Here, not only did the husband violate the restrai ning order by comi ng within 100 yards of the fami ly home , but he conti nued to violate the order while his abduc tion of the daughters persisted. This is because the restrai ning order proh ibited him from \"molest[i ng] or disturb\u00ad [ing] the peace\" of the daughters. See 366 F. 3d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent of O'Br ien, J.). Because the \"scene\" of the violati on was where ver the husband was currently holdi ng the daughters, this case does not impli\u00ad cate the questi on of an ofcer 's duties to arrest a person who has left the scene and is no longer in violati on of the restrai ning order . Second, to the extent that arresti ng the husband was initia lly \"imprac tical under the circumst ances\" because his whereabouts were unknown, the Colorado statute (unlike some other States' statutes) expressly addressed that situa\u00ad tion\u2014it requ ired the police to seek an arrest warrant. Third, the Cour t is wrong to suggest that this case falls outside the core situati on that these types of statutes were meant to address. One of the well-known cases that contr ibuted to the passage of these statutes involved facts similar to this case. See Sorichetti v. New York City, 65 N. Y. 2d 461, 467, 482 N. E. 2d 70, 74 (1985) (police ofcers at police station essentia lly ignored a moth\u00ad er's pleas for enforcement of a restrai ning order against an estranged hus\u00ad band who made threats about their 6-year-old daughter; hours later , as the mother persisted in her pleas, the daughter was found muti lated, her father having attacked her with a fork and a knife and attempted to saw off her leg); Note, 1996 U. Ill. L. Rev., at 539 (noting Sorichetti in the development of mandatory arrest statutes); see also Sack 1663 (citing the police's failure to respond to domestic violence calls as an impetus behind mandatory arrest statutes). It would be singularly odd to suppose that in passi ng its sweepi ng omnibus domestic violence legislati on, the Colorado Legislature did not mean to require enforcement in the case of an abduc\u00ad tion of children in violati on of 748 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng faced with a broadly drawn statute direc ting, for example , that the police \"shall supp ress all riots,\" there is little doubt that the statute at issue in this case conferred a benet \"on a speci c class of people\"\u2014namely , recipients of domestic re\u00ad strai ning orders. Here, respondent appl ied for and was granted a restrai ning order from a Colorado trial judge , who found a risk of \"irreparable injury\" and found that \"physica l or emoti onal harm\" would resu lt if the husband were not excluded from the fami ly home . 366 F. 3d, at 1143 (appendix to dissent of O'Br ien, J.). As noted earlier, the restrai ning order required that the husband not \"molest or disturb\" the peace of respondent and the daughters, and it ordered (with limited excepti ons) that the husband stay at least 100 yards away from the fami ly home . Ibid.14 It also direc ted the police to \"use every reasonable means to enforce this . . . order ,\" and to arrest or seek a warrant upon probable cause of a violati on. Id., at 1144. Under the terms of the statute , when the order issued, respondent and her daughters became \" 'protec ted person[ s].' \" \u00a7 18-6-803.5(1.5)( a) person' the person or persons identi ed in the restrai ning order as the person or persons for whose ben\u00ad et the restrai ning order was issued\").15 The statute crim\u00ad inalized the know ing violati on of the restrai ning order , \u00a7 18-6-803.5(1), and, as already discussed, the statute (as 14 The order also stated: \"If you violate this order thinking that the other party or child named in this order has given you permissi on, you are wrong , and can be arrested and prosecuted. The terms of this order cannot be changed by agreement of the other party or the child(ren). Only the cour t can change this order .\" 366 F. 3d, at 1144 (appendix to dissent of O'Br ien, J.). 15 A concer n for the \" 'protec ted person' \" pervades the statute .

Upon the request of the protec ted person, the peace ofcer may also transpor t the minor child of the protec ted person, who is not an emancipated minor, to the same shelte r.... \" GONZALES Stevens, J., dissenti ng well as the order itself ) man dated police enforcement, \u00a7\u00a7 18-6-803.5(3)( a)-(b).16 Because the statute' s guarantee of police enforcement is triggered by, and operates only in reference to, a judge' s granti ng of a restrai ning order in favor of an identi ed \" 'pro\u00ad tected person, ' \" there is simply no room to suggest that such a person has received merely an \" 'incident al' \" or \" 'indirec t' \" benet, see ante, at 766-767. As one state cour t put it, do\u00ad mestic restrai ning order statutes \"identi fy with precisi on when, to whom, and under what circumst ances police protec\u00ad tion must be afforded. The legislative purpose in requir ing the police to enforce indiv idua l restrai ning orders clear ly is to protec t the named persons for whose protec tion the order is issued, not to protec t the community at large by gen\u00ad eral law enforcement activity.\" Nearing, 295 Ore., at 712, 670 P. 2d, at 143.17 Not only does the Cour t's doubt about 16 I nd it neither surprising nor telling, cf. ante, at 766, that the statute requires the restrai ning order to cont ain, \"in capit al letters and bold print,\" a \"notice\" informing protec ted persons that they can demand or request, respec tively , civil and criminal contempt proceedi ngs. \u00a7 18-6- 803.5(7). Whil e the legislature may have thought that these legal reme\u00ad dies were not popu larly understood, a person' s right to \"demand\" or \"re\u00ad quest\" police enforcement of a restrai ning order simply goes without saying given the nature of the order and its lang uage . Indeed, for a holder of a restrai ning order who has read the order 's emphatic lang uage , it would likely come as quite a shock to learn that she has no right to demand enforcement in the event of a violati on. To suggest that a pro\u00ad tected person has no such right would posit a lacuna between a protec ted person' s rights and an ofcer 's duties\u2014a resu lt that would be hard to reconci le with the Colorado Legislature' s dual goals of putti ng an end to police indifference and empower ing potentia l victims of domestic abuse . 17 See also Matthews v. Pickett County, 996 S. W. 2d 162, 165 (Tenn. 1999) (\"The order of protec tion in this case was not issued for the publ ic's protec tion speci cally identi ed Ms. Matthews and was issued solely for the purpose of protec ting her.

IV Given that Colorado law has quite clear ly eliminated the police's discreti on to deny enforcement, respondent is correc t that she had much more than a \"unilatera l expec tation\" that the restrai ning order would be enforced; rather , she had a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" to enforcement. Roth, 408 U. S., at 577. Recog nizing respondent' s proper ty interest in the enforcement of her restrai ning order is fully consistent with our precedent. This Cour t has \"made clear that the proper ty interests protec ted by procedura l due process ex\u00ad tend well beyond actual ownersh ip of real estate, chattels, or money .\" Id., at 571-572. The \"types of interests protec ted as 'proper ty' are varied and, as often as not, intangible, relat\u00ad ing 'to the whole domai n of socia l and economic fact.'\" Logan v. Zimme rman Brush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 430 (1982); see also Perry v. Sinde rmann, 408 U. S. 593, 601 (1972) (\" '[P]roper ty' interests subjec t to procedura l due process protec tion are not limited by a few rigid, technica l forms. Rather , 'proper ty' denotes a broad range of interests that secured by 'existi ng rules or underst andi ngs' \"). Thus, our cases have found \"proper disabi lity bene\u00ad (1976); publ ic educa\u00ad tion, Goss v. 565 (1975); utility serv ices, Memph is Light, Gas & Div. v.

S. 532 (1985), as well as in other entitle\u00ad ments that defy easy categor ization, see, e. g., Bell v. Burso n, 402 U. S. 535 (1971) (due process requires fair procedures before a driver's license may be revoked pendi ng the adju\u00ad dicati on of an accident claim); Logan, 455 U. S., at 431 (due process proh ibits the arbitrary denia l of a person' s interest in adjudicati ng a claim before a state commissi on). Police enforcement of a restrai ning order is a gover nment serv ice that is no less concrete and no less valuable than other gover nment serv ices, of recog nizing this type of proper ty interest is explai ned by the relative novelty of the domestic violence statutes creati ng a mandatory arrest duty; before this inno\u00ad vation, the unfettered discreti on that charac terized defeated any citizen's \"legitimate claim of enti\u00ad tlement\" to this serv ice. Novel or not, respondent' s claim nds strong suppor t in the principles that under lie our due process jurisprudence . In this case , Colorado law guaran\u00ad teed the prov ision certain dened cir\u00ad cumst ances, to a certain class of beneciar ies, and respond\u00ad ent reasonably relied on that guarantee . As we observed in Roth, \"[i]t is a purpose of the ancient instituti on of proper ty to protec t those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrar ily under mined. \" 18 The Cour t mist akenly relies on O'Banno n v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U. S. 773 (1980), in explai ning why it is \"by no means clear that an indiv idua l entitlement to enforcement of a restrai ning order could constitute a 'proper ty' interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause .\" Ante, at 766. In O'Banno n, the questi on was essentia lly whether certain regulations prov ided nursi ng-home residents with an entitlement to con\u00ad tinued residence in the home of their choice . 447 U. S., at 785. The Cour t concluded that the regulations created no such entitlement, but there was no suggesti on that Congress could not create one if it wanted to. In other words, O'Banno n did not address a situati on in which the under lying law created an entitlement, but the Cour t nevertheless refused to treat that entitlement as a proper ty interest within the meani ng of the Due Process 748 (2005) Stevens, J., dissenti ng 408 U. S., at 577. Surely , if respondent had contrac ted with a private secur ity rm to prov ide her and her daughters with protec tion from her husband, it would be apparent that she possessed a proper ty interest in such a contrac t. Here, Colorado under took a comparable obligati on, and respond\u00ad ent\u2014with restrai ning order in hand\u2014justi ably relied on that under taking. Respondent' s claim of entitlement to this promised serv ice is no less legitimate than the other claims our cases have upheld, and no less concrete than a hypotheti\u00ad cal agreement with a private rm.19 The fact that it is based on a statutory enac tment and a judicia l order entered for her specia l protec tion, rather than on a formal contrac t, does not prov ide a principled basis for refusi ng to \"proper ty\" worthy of constituti onal protec tion.20 19 As the analogy to a private secur ity contrac t demonstrates, a person' s interest in police enforcement has \" 'some ascer tainable monet ary value,' \" ante, at 766. Cf. Merrill, The Landscape of Constituti onal Proper ty, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 964, n. 289 (2000) (remark ing, with regard to the proper ty interest recog nized in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975), that \"any parent who has contemplated sendi ng their children to private schools knows that publ ic school ing has a monet ary value\"). And while the analogy to a pri\u00ad vate secur ity contrac t need not be precise to be usefu l, I would point out that the Cour t is likely incorrec t in stating that private secur ity guards could not have arrested the husband under the circumst ances, see ante, at 766-767, n. 12. Because the husband' s ongoi ng abduc tion of the daughters would constitute a know ing violati on of the restrai ning order , see n. 13, supra, and therefore a crime under the statute , see \u00a7 18-6-803.5(1), a pri\u00ad vate person who was at the scene and aware of the circumst ances of the abduc tion would have author ity to arrest. See \u00a7 16-3-201 (\"A person who is not a peace ofcer may arrest another person when any crime has been or is being committed by the arrested person in the presence of the person mak ing the arrest\"). Our cases, of course , have never recog nized any requirement that a proper interest possess \" 'some ascer tainable mone\u00ad tary value.'\" Regardless, I would assume that respondent would have paid the police to arrest her husband if that had been possible; at the very least, the entitlement has a monet ary value in that sense . 20 Accordi ng to Justice Souter, respondent has asser ted a prop\u00ad erty interest in merely a \"state-mandated process, \" ante, at 771 (concur\u00ad ring opinion), rather than in a GONZALES Stevens, J., dissenti ng V Because respondent had a proper ty interest in the enforce\u00ad ment of the restrai ning order , state ofcia ls could not de\u00ad prive her of that interest without observ ing fair proce\u00ad dures.21 Her descr iption of the police behav ior in this case and the depar tment' s callous policy of failing to respond proper ly to repor ts of restrai ning order violati ons clear This ands respondent' s claim. Putti ng aside the inart\u00ad ful passage of respondent' s brief that Justice Souter relies upon, ante, at 770, it is clear that respondent is in fact asser ting a subst antive interest in the \"enforcement of the restrai ning order ,\" Brief for Respondent 10. Enforcement of a restrai ning order is a tangible, subst antive act. If an estranged husband violates a restrai ning order by abduc ting children, and the police succeed in enforci ng the order , the person holdi ng the restrai n\u00ad ing order has undeniably just received a subst antive benet. As in other procedura l due process cases, respondent is arguing that the police ofcers failed to follow fair procedures in ascer taining whether the statutory crite\u00ad ria that trigger their obligati on to prov ide enforcement \u2014i. e., an outst and\u00ad ing order plus probable cause that it is being violated\u2014were satised in her case. Cf. Carey v. Piphu s, 435 U. S. 247, 266-267 (1978) (discussi ng analytic difference between the denia l of fair process and the denia l of the subst antive benet itself ). It is Justice Souter, not respondent, who makes the mist ake of \"collapsi ng the disti nction between proper process that protec ts it,\" ante, at 772. Justice Souter also errs in suggesti ng that respondent cannot have a proper ty interest in enforcement because she would not be author ized to instruct the police to refrai n from enforcement in the event of a violati on. Ante, at 770. The right to insist on the prov ision of a serv ice is separate from the right to refuse the serv ice. For example , compu lsory attendance laws deny minors the right to refuse to attend school. Nevertheless, we have recog nized that minors have a proper ty interest in publ ic educati on and that school ofcia ls must therefore follow fair procedures when they seek to depr ive minors of this valuable benet through suspensi on. See Goss , 419 U. S. 565. In the end, Justice Souter over looks the core pur\u00ad pose of procedura l due process\u2014 ensur ing that a citizen's reasonable reli\u00ad ance is not frustrated by arbitrary gover nment action. 21 See Logan v.

Argued April 26, 2005 \u2014Decided June 27, 2005 After respondent Thompson was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, Tennessee state cour ts denied postcon viction relief on his claim that his trial counsel had been ineffec tive for failing to adequately inves\u00ad tigate his ment al health. His federa l habeas attor neys subsequently retained psycholog ist Dr. Sultan, whose repor t and depositi on contended that Thompson suffered from serious ment al illness at the time of his offense . The District Cour t dismissed the petiti on, but apparently Thompson' s habeas counsel had failed to include Sultan's depositi on and repor t in the record. Upholdi ng the dismissa l, the Sixth Circuit, inter alia, found no ineffec tive assist ance and did not discuss Sultan's repor t and depositi on in detail. That cour t later denied rehear ing, but stayed issuance of its mandate pendi ng dispositi on of Thompson' s After this Cour t denied certiorar i on December 1, 2003, the Sixth Circuit stayed its mandate again, pendi ng dispositi on of a petiti on for rehear ing, which this Cour t denied on January 20, 2004. A copy of that order was led with the Sixth Circuit on January 23, but the cour t did not issue its mandate . The State set Thompson' s executi on date , and state and federa l proceedi ngs began on his competency to be exe\u00ad cuted. Competency proceedi ngs were pendi ng in the Federa l District Cour t on June 23, 2004, when the Sixth Circuit issued an amended opin\u00ad ion in the federa l habeas case , vacati ng the District Cour t's habeas judg\u00ad ment and remandi ng the case for an evidentiary hear ing on the ineffec tive-assist ance claim. The Sixth Circuit supplemented the rec\u00ad on appea l with Sultan's depositi on and explai ned that its author ity to issue an amended opinion ve months after this Cour t denied rehear\u00ad ing was based on its inherent power to reconsider an opinion before issuance of the mandate . Held: Assumi ng that Federa l Rule of Appel late Procedure 41 author izes a stay of a mandate following a denia l of certiorar i and that a cour t may stay the mandate without enter ing an order , the Sixth Circuit' s decisi on to do so here was an abuse of discreti on. Pp. 801-814. (a) This Cour t need not decide the scope of the cour t of appea ls' Rule 41 author ity to withhold a mandate in order to resolve this case. Pp. Syllabus Promi nent among the reasons warranti ng the resu lt here is that the Sixth Circuit did not release its amended opinion for more than ve months after this Cour t denied rehear ing. The consequence of delay for the State's criminal justice system was compounded by the Sixth Circuit' s failure to issue an order or other wise give notice to the parties that it was reconsider ing its earlier opinion. The express terms of the Sixth Circuit' s stay state that the mandate would be stayed until this Cour t acted on the rehear ing petiti on. Thus, once rehear ing was de\u00ad nied, the stay dissolved by operati on of law. Tennessee , relying on the Sixth Circuit' s earlier orders and this Cour t's certiorar i and rehear ing denia ls could assume that the mandate would issue , especia lly since Thompson sought no additi onal stay and the Sixth Circuit gave no indi\u00ad cation that it might be revisiting its earlier decisi on. The latter point is impor tant, for it is an open questi on whether a cour t may exercise its Rule 41(b) author ity to extend the time to issue a mandate through mere inaction. Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Cour t had, or have , any way to know whether the Sixth Circuit had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mist ake. That cour t could have spared the parties and state judicia l system considerable time and resources had it notied them that it was reviewing its deci\u00ad sion. The schedu ling of resu lting compe\u00ad tency proceedi ngs were steps taken in reliance on the assumpti on that the federa l habeas case was nal. That assumpti on was all the more reasonable because the delay in issui ng the mandate took place after this Cour t had denied certiorar i, which usua lly signals the end of litiga\u00ad tion. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(d)(2)(D ). The fact that the Sixth Circuit had the oppor tunity at the rehear ing stage to consider the same arguments it eventua lly adopted in its amended opinion is yet another factor suppor ting the deter mination here . A review of the Sultan depositi on also reinforces this conclusi on. Whil e the evidence would have been relevant to the District Cour t's analysis, it is not of such a charac ter as to warrant the Sixth Circuit' s extraordi nary depar ture from standard procedures. Finally, by withholdi ng its mandate for months\u2014based on evidence suppor ting only an arguable constituti onal claim\u2014wh ile the State prepared to carry out Thompson' s sentence , the Sixth Circuit did not accord the appropr iate level of respec t to the State's judg ment that Thompson' s crimes merit the ultimate pun\u00ad ishment.

Thompson argued that his earlier head injuries had diminished his men\u00ad tal capacity and that evidence of his conditi on shou ld have been presented as mitigati ng evidence during the pena lty phase of trial.

At this point, 13 years had passed since Thompson' s convic\u00ad tion. Sultan exami ned questi oned fami ly members, and conduc ted an ex\u00ad tensive review of his legal, military, medica l, and prison rec\u00ad ords, App. 12, before diag nosing him as suffer ing from schizoaffec tive disorder , bipolar type, id., at 20.

Sultan prepared an exper t repor t on Thomp\u00ad son's beha lf and was also deposed by the State. In February 2000, the United States District Cour t for the Easter n District of Tennessee granted the State's moti on for summary judg ment and dismissed the habeas petiti on. The cour t held that Thompson failed to show that the state cour t's resoluti on of his claim rested on an unreasonable ap\u00ad plicati on of Supreme Cour t precedent or on an unreasonable deter mination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state cour t. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2254( d). The District Cour t also stated that Thompson had not presented \"any sig\u00ad nicant probative evidence that [he] was suffer ing from a signicant ment al disease that shou ld have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase as mitigati on.\" No. 4:98-cv-006 (ED Tenn., Feb. 17, 2000), App. to Pet. for 799 545US2 Unit: $U77 [03-26-08 Opinion of the Cour t Cert. 270. Sultan's depositi on and repor t, howe ver, had ap\u00ad parently not been included in the District Cour t record. While Thompson' s appea l to the Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit was pendi ng, he led a moti on in the District Cour t under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) request\u00ad ing that the cour t supplement the record Sultan's ex\u00ad pert repor t and depositi on. Thompson' s habeas counsel at the time explai ned that the failure to include the Sultan evi\u00ad dence in the summary judg ment record was an oversight. Thompson also asked the Cour t of Appea ls to hold his case in abeyance pendi ng a ruling from the District Cour t and attached the Sultan evidence in suppor t of his moti on. The District Cour t denied the Rule 60(b) moti on as un\u00ad timely , and the of Appea ls denied Thompson' s mo\u00ad tion to hold his appea l in abeyance .

The lead opinion, authored by Judge Suhrhei n\u00ad rich, reasoned that there was no ineffec tive assist ance of counsel because Thompson' s attor neys were aware of his head injuries and made appropr iate inquir ies into his ment al tness. Id., at 589-592. In particular, Thompson' s attor\u00ad neys had requested that the trial cour t order a competency evaluati on. A team of exper ts at the Middle Tennessee Ment al Health Institute , a state-r un facility, found \"no ment al illness, ment al defec t, or insanity .\" Id., at 589.

We granted certiorar i. 543 U. S. 1042 (2005). II At issue in this case is the scope of the Cour t of Appea ls' author ity to withhold the mandate pursuant to Federa l Rule of Appel late Procedure 41. As relevant, the Rule prov THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t \"(b) When Issued. The cour t's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after the time to le a petiti on for rehear\u00ad ing expires, or 7 calendar days after entry of an order deny ing a timely petiti on for panel rehear ing, petiti on for rehear ing en banc, or moti on for stay of mandate , whichever is later .

The timely ling of a petiti on for panel rehear ing, petiti on for rehear ing en banc, or moti on for stay of mandate , stays the mandate until dispositi on of the petiti on or mo\u00ad tion, unless the cour t orders wise. \"(2) Pendi ng Petition for Certiorar i. \"(A) A party may move to stay the mandate pendi ng the ling of a petiti on for a writ of certiorar i in the Su\u00ad preme Cour t. The moti on must be served on all parties and must show that the certiorar i petiti on would pre\u00ad sent a subst antia l questi on and that there is good cause foras tay. \"(B) The stay must not exceed 90 days, unless the pe\u00ad riod is extended for good cause or unless the party who obtained the stay les a petiti on for the writ and so noti\u00ad es the circuit clerk in writing within the period of the stay. In that case , the stay conti nues until the Supreme must issue the mandate im\u00ad mediately when a copy of a Supreme Cour t order deny\u00ad ing the petiti on for writ of certiorar i is led.\" Tennessee argues that the Cour t of Appea ls was required to issue the mandate following this Cour t's denia l of Thomp\u00ad son's petiti on for State's positi on Rule 41(d)(2)(D ), which states S. 794 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Su\u00ad preme Cour t order deny ing the petiti on for writ of certiorar i is led.\" This prov ision, the State points out, admits of no excepti ons, so the mandate shou ld have issued on the date that a copy of this Cour t's order deny ing certiorar i was led with the Cour t of Appea ls, i. e., December 8, 2003. The State further contends that because the mandate shou ld have issued in December 2003, the Cour t of Appea ls' amended opinion was in essence a reca ll of the mandate . If this view is correc t, the Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on to revisit its earlier opinion must satisfy the standard established by Calderon v. Thompso n, 523 U. S. 538 (1998). Calderon held that \"where a of appea ls sua sponte reca lls its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decisi on deny ing habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner , the cour t abuses its discreti on unless it acts to avoid a miscarr iage of justice as dened by our habeas corpus jurisprudence .\" Id., at 558. See also Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298 (1995); Saw yer v. Whit\u00ad ley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992). Thompson counters by arguing that Rule 41(d)(2)(D ) is de\u00ad terminative only when the cour t of appea ls enters a stay of the mandate to allow the Supreme Cour t to dispose of a peti\u00ad tion for certiorar i. The prov ision, Thompson says, not affec t the cour t of appea ls' broad discreti on to enter a stay for other reasons. He relies on Rule 41(b), which prov ides the cour t of appea ls may \"shor ten or extend the time\" in which to issue the mandate . Because the author ity vested by Rule 41(b) is not limited to the period before a petiti on for certiorar i is denied, he argues that the Cour t of Appea ls had the author ity to stay its mandate following this Cour t's denia l of certiorar i and rehear ing. Although the Cour t of Appea ls failed to issue an order staying the mandate after we denied rehear ing, Thompson asser ts that the cour t exer\u00ad cised its Rule 41(b) powers by simply failing to issue it. To resolve this case , we need not adopt either party's in\u00ad terpret ation THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t arguendo, that the Rule author izes a stay of the mandate following the denia l of certiorar i and also that a cour t may stay the mandate without enter ing an order\u2014here the Cour t of Appea ls abused its discreti on in doing so. III We nd an abuse of discreti on for the following reasons. Promi nent among our concer ns is the leng th of time be\u00ad tween this Cour t's denia l of certiorar i and the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals' issuance of its amended opinion. We denied Thomp\u00ad son's petiti on for certiorar i in December 2003 and his petiti on for rehear ing one month later . From this last denia l, how\u00ad ever, the Cour t of Appea ls delayed issui ng its mandate for over ve months, releasi ng its amended opinion in June. The consequence of delay for the State's criminal justice system was compounded by the Cour t of Appea ls' failure to issue an order or other wise give notice to the parties that the cour t was reconsider ing its earlier opinion. The Cour t of Appea ls had issued two earlier orders staying its mandate . The rst order stayed the mandate pendi ng dispositi on of Thompson' s petiti on for certiorar i. The second order ex\u00ad tended the stay to allow Thompson time to le a petiti on for rehear ing with this Cour t and \"thereaf ter until the Supreme Cour t disposes of the case.\" So by the express terms of the second order the mandate was not to be stayed after this Cour t acted; and when we denied rehear ing on January 20, 2004, the Cour t of Appea ls' second stay dissolved by opera\u00ad tion of law. Tennessee , acting in reliance on the Cour t of Appea ls' earlier orders and our denia l of certiorar i and re\u00ad hear ing, could assume that the mandate would\u2014i ndeed must \u2014issue . While it might have been prudent for the State to verify that the mandate had issued, it is underst and\u00ad able that it proceeded to schedu le an executi on date . Thompson, after all, had not sought an additi onal stay of the mandate , and the Cour t of Appea ls had given no indicati on that it might be revisiting its earlier S. 794 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t This latter point is impor tant. It is an open questi on whether a cour t may exercise its Rule 41(b) author ity to ex\u00ad tend the time for the mandate to issue through mere inac\u00ad tion. Even assumi ng, howe ver, that a cour t could effec t a stay for a shor t period of time by withholdi ng the mandate , a delay of ve months is different in kind. \"Basic to the operati on of the judicia l system is the principle that a cour t speaks through its judg ments and orders. \" Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First National Bank of South Carolina, 741 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA4 1984). Without a formal docket entry neither the parties nor this Cour t had, or have , any way to know whether the cour t had stayed the mandate or simply made a clerical mist ake. Cf. Ballard v. Commissio ner, 544 U. S. 40, 59-60 (2005). The dissent claims \"the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error \" on the part of the Clerk 's ofce . Post, at 825 (opinion of Breyer, J.). The record lends no suppor t to this specu la\u00ad tion. The dissent also fails to explai n why it is willing to apply a \"presumpti on of regularity\" to the panel' s actions but not to the Clerk 's. Ibid. The Cour t of Appea ls could have spared the parties and the state judicia l system considerable time and resources if it had notied them that it was reviewing its original panel decisi on. After we denied Thompson' s petiti on for rehear\u00ad ing, Tennessee schedu led his executi on date . This, in turn, led to various proceedi ngs in state and federa l cour t to deter\u00ad mine Thompson' s present competency to be executed. See, e. g., Thompso n v. State, 134 S. W. 3d 168 (Tenn. 2004). All of these steps were taken in reliance on the mist aken impres\u00ad sion that Thompson' s rst federa l habeas case was nal. The State had begun to \"invok[ e] its entire legal and mora l author ity in suppor t of executi ng its judg ment. that Thompson' s habeas proceed\u00ad ings were complete was all the more reasonable because the Cour t of Appea ls' delay in PAGES v. THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t after we had denied certiorar i. As a prac tical matter , a deny ing discreti onary review usua lly signals the end of litigati on. While Rule 41(b) may author\u00ad ize a cour t to stay the mandate after certiorar i is denied, the circumst ances where such a stay would be warranted are rare. See, e. g., First Gibraltar Bank, FSB v. Morales, 42 F. 3d 895 (CA5 1995); Alph in v. Henson, 552 F. 2d 1033 (CA4 1977). In the typical case , where the stay of mandate is en\u00ad tered solely to allow this Cour t time to consider a petiti on for appea ls must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Cour t order deny ing the petiti on for writ of certiorar i is led.\" By prov iding a mechanism for correc ting errors in the cour ts of appea ls before Supreme Cour t review is requested, the Federa l Rules of Appel late Procedure ensure that litiga\u00ad tion following the denia l of certiorar i will be infrequent. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a) (\"Unless the time is shor tened or extended by order or local rule, a petiti on for panel re\u00ad hear ing may be led within 14 days after entry of judg\u00ad ment\"). See also Fed. Rules App. Proc. 35 (rehear ing en banc), 40 (panel rehear ing). Indeed, in this case Thompson' s petiti on for rehear ing and suggesti on for rehear ing en banc pressed the same argu\u00ad ments that eventua lly were adopted by the Cour t of Appea ls in its amended opinion. The Sultan evidence , rst pre\u00ad sented to the Cour t of Appea ls as an attachment to Thomp\u00ad son's moti on to hold his appea l in abeyance , was quoted extensively in the petiti on for rehear ing to the Cour t of Appea ls. Pet. for Rehear ing and Suggesti on for Rehear ing En Banc in No. 00-5516 (CA6), pp. 12-20, 28-31. After the request for rehear ing was denied, the State could have as\u00ad sumed with good reason that the Cour t of Appea ls was not impressed by Thompson' s arguments based on the Sultan evidence . The cour t's oppor tunity to consider these argu\u00ad ments at the rehear ing stage is yet S. 794 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t our deter mination that the decisi on to withhold the mandate was in error . Cf. Calderon v. Thompso n, 523 U. S., at 551- 553 (questi oning whether a \"mishandled law clerk transiti on\" and the \"failure of another judge to notice the action pro\u00ad posed by the original panel\" would justi fy reca the nonhabeas case). The dissent' s explanati on of how the Sultan evidence was over looked is inaccurate in severa l respec ts. For example , the statements that the \"Sultan documents were not in the initia l record on appea l,\" post, at 821, and that \"the panel previously had not seen these documents\" before the rehear\u00ad ing stage, post, at 822, convey the wrong impressi on. Al\u00ad though the Sultan evidence was not part of the District Cour t's summary judg ment record, the documents were in\u00ad cluded in the certied record on appea l as attachments to Thompson' s Rule 60(b) moti on. Record 133; Docket Entry 4/5/02 in No. (ED Tenn.); Docket Entry 4/10/02 in No. 00-5516 (CA6). The dissent also argues the petiti on for rehear ing did not adequately bring the Sultan evidence to the attenti on of the Cour t of Appea ls. Post, at 822, 826. This is simply untr ue. The original panel opinion, which did not discuss the Sultan evidence in any detail, emphasi zed that Thompson had failed to produce any evidence that he was ment ally ill at the time of his offense . 315 F. 3d, at 590; id., at 595-596 (Moore , J., concurr ing in resu lt). The peti\u00ad tion for rehear ing attacked this conclusi on in no uncer tain terms and placed the Sultan evidence front and center . Here, for example , is an excer pt from petiti on's table of contents: \"II. THE CONCL USION THA T THERE IS NO EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE RECORD OF THOMPSON'S MENT AL ILLESS AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME IS WRONG \"A. Thompson Has Set Forth Above The Record Facts Demonstrati ng His Ment al Illness At The Time Of 808 545US2 Unit: $U77 [03-26-08 20:28:39] PAGES THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t \"B. The Major ity Over looks The Facts And Exper t Opinion Set Forth In Dr. Sultan's Repor t And Deposi\u00ad tion.\" Pet. for Rehear ing and Suggesti on for Rehear\u00ad ing En Banc in No. 00-5516 (CA6), p. ii. See also id., at 1 (menti oning the Sultan evidence in the second paragraph of the statement in suppor t of panel re\u00ad hear ing). The rehear ing petiti on did not explai n why Sul\u00ad tan's depositi on and exper t repor t had been omitted from the summary judg ment record, but that is beside the point. The petiti on acknowledged that the Sultan evidence was rst presented to the District Cour t as an attachment to the Rule 60(b) moti on, id., at 29, and gave the Sultan evidence a prom\u00ad inent and expl icit menti on in the table of contents. It is difcu lt to see how Thompson' s counsel could have been clearer in telling the Cour t of Appea ls that it was wrong . The dissent' s treatment of this issue assumes that judges for\u00ad get even the basic details of a capit al case only one month after issui ng a 38-page opinion and that judges cannot be relied upon to read past the rst page of a petiti on for re\u00ad hear ing. The problem is that the dissent cannot have it both ways: If the Sultan evidence is as crucial as the dissent claims, it would not easily have been over looked by the Cour t of Appea ls at the rehear ing stage. Our review of the Sultan depositi on reinforces our conclu\u00ad sion that the Cour t of Appea ls abused discreti on by with\u00ad holdi ng the mandate . Had the Sultan depositi on and repor t been fully considered in the federa l habeas proceedi ngs, it no doubt would have been relevant to the District Cour t's analysis. Based on the Sultan depositi on, Thompson could have argued he suffered from ment al illness at the time of his crime that would have been a mitigati ng factor under Tennessee law and that his trial attor neys were constituti on\u00ad ally ineffec conduc t an adequate investiga\u00ad tion into his ment al health. Rele vant though the Sultan evidence may be, howe ver, it is not of such a charac ter as to warrant the S. 794 (2005) 809 Opinion of the Cour t extraordinary departure from standard appellate proce\u00ad dures. There are ample grounds to conclude the evidence was unlikely to have altered the District Cour t's resoluti on of Thompson' s ineffec tive-assist ance-of-counsel claim. Sul\u00ad tan exami ned Thompson for the rst time on August 20, 1998, App. 37, some 13 years after Thompson' s crime and conviction. She relied on the deter iorati on in Thompson' s present ment al health\u2014someth ing that obviously was not observable at the time of trial\u2014as evidence of his conditi on in 1985. (Indeed, there was a marked decline in his condi\u00ad tion during the 6-month period between Sultan's testi mony of two exper ts who exami ned him at the time of trial, Dr. Watson and Dr. Copple . Watson performed a battery of tests at the Middle Tennessee Ment al Health Institute , where Thompson was referred by the trial cour t for an ex\u00ad amination, and concluded that Thompson \" '[did] not appear to be suffer ing from any compl icated ment al disorder which would impair his capacity to appreciate the wrong fulness of the alleged offenses, or which would impair his capacity to confor m his conduc t to the requirements of the law.' \" 19 Tr. 164. Indeed, Watson presented subst antia l evidence suppor ting his conclusi on that Thompson was malinger ing for ment al illness. Id., at 151-152; 20 id., at 153-160. For example , Thompson claimed he could not read despite a B average in high school and one year 's college credit. 19 id., at 137; 20 id., at 151. Thompson' s test scores also indicated that he was attempti ng to fake schizophrenia. 20 id., at 153-154. Copple , the psycholog ist retained by Thompson' s defense team, agreed with Watson that Thompson was not suffer ing from ment al illness. 19 id., at 58. Had the Sultan depositi on been included in the District Cour t record, Thompson still would have faced an uphill battle to obtaining federa l habeas relief. He would have had to argue that his trial attor neys shou ld have v. THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t tal health even after both Watson and Copple had opined that there was noth ing to uncover . Sultan's testi committi ng the under lying offense , but it does bear upon an argument that Thompson' s attor neys could Thompson' s ment subst antia lly impaired his ability to confor m his conduc t to the requirements of the law\u2014is couched in the lang uage of a mitigati ng factor under Tennes\u00ad see law. Tenn. Code Ann. j)(8) (1982). See \u00a739-13-204( j)(8) (Lexis 2003). Thompson' s trial attor neys, howe ver, chose not to pursue a mitigati on strateg y based on ment al illness, stressi ng instead charac ter evidence from fami ly and friends and exper t testi mony that he had the ca\u00ad pacity to adjust to prison. Thompso n v. State, 958 S. W. 2d, at 164-165. This strateg ic calculation, while ultimately unsuccessfu l, was based on a reasonable investigati on into Thompson' s background. Sultan relied on three witnesses in prepar ing her repor t: Thompson' s grandmother , sister and ex-g irlfriend. These witnesses not only were inter\u00ad viewed by the defense attor neys; they testi ed sentenci ng. Consu ltation with these witnesses, when combi ned the opinions of Watson and Copple , prov ided an adequate basis to conclude that focusi ng on Thompson' s ment al health was not the best strateg y. As the Tennessee Cour t of Criminal Appea ls noted, \"Because two exper ts did not detec t brain damage , counsel cannot be faulted for discardi ng a strateg y that could not be suppor ted by a medica l opinion.\" Id., at 165. Without a single citation to the record, the dissent sug\u00ad gests that Thompson' s attor neys failed to conduc t adequate interv iews of the defense witnesses on whom Sultan relied in her repor t. Post, at 827-828. Most of the informati on on Thompson' s childhood was prov ided to Sultan by Nora Jean Wharton, Thompson' S. 794 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ting aside the fact that Thompson did not argue in state cour t that his counsel' s interv iew of Wharton was inade\u00ad s at\u00ad torneys cannot be faulted for failing to elicit from her any details on Thompson' s difcu lt home life. After all, Whar\u00ad ton testi ed at trial that Thompson' s childhood was \"poor ,\" but \"very happy .\" 18 Tr. 3. The dissent also implies that the exper ts who exami ned Thompson lacked informati on necessary to reach an accurate assessment. The record re\u00ad futes this asser tion. In conduc ting his exami nation, Watson had access to Thompson' s socia l history and military records. 19 id., at 149; 20 id., at 186 (Exh. 102, pp. 11, 27-28). Watson was also aware of the prior head injuries as well as Thomp\u00ad son's claim that he heard voices. 19 id., at 152; 20 id., at 154-155. Nevertheless, Watson, whose evaluati on was contemporaneous with the trial, found no evidence that Thompson was ment ally ill at the time of the crime. Wat\u00ad son's repor t was unequivoca l on this point: Thompson' s speech and communicati on were co\u00ad herent, rational, organi zed, ideas of reference , delusi ons, and other indicators of a thought disorder . His affec t was appropr iate to his thought content, and he exhibited no flight of ideas, manic, depressed, or bizarre behav iors, and his speech was not pressured nor rapid. He exhib\u00ad ited none of the signs of an affec tive illness. His judg\u00ad ment and insight are rather poor . Psycholog ical testi ng revealed him to be func tioning in the average range intellectually, to exhibit no signs of organicity or brain damage on the Bender-Gest alt Test and the Bender Inter ference Procedure . Persona lity pro les revealed no evidence of a psychosis, but indicated malinger\u00ad ing in the ment al illness direc tion. (For example , the schizophrenic score was at 120, while 545US2 Unit: $U77 [03-26-08 20:28:39] PAGES THOMPSON Opinion of the Cour t vations revealed no evidence of a thought disorder .) Mr. Thompson' s memory for recent and remote events appeared unimpaired. ' \" 20 id., at 159-160. Sultan's ides the strateg y of emphasi zing Thompson' s positive attributes was a mist ake in light of Thompson' s deter iorated conditi on 13 years after the trial. This evidence , howe ver, would not come close to satisfy ing the miscarr iage of justice standard under Calderon had the Cour t of Appea ls reca lled the mandate . Neither , in our view, did this evidence justi fy the Cour t of Appea ls' decisi on to withhold the mandate with\u00ad out notice to the parties, which in turn led the State to pro\u00ad ceed for ve months on the mist aken assumpti on that the federa l habeas proceedi ngs had terminated. The dissent suggests that failing to take account of the Sultan evidence would resu lt in a \"miscarr iage of justice ,\" post, at 814-815, 828, but the dissent uses that phrase in a way that is incon\u00ad sistent with our precedents. In Saw yer v. Whitley, 505 U. S., at 345-347, this Cour t held that additi onal mitigati ng evidence could not meet the miscarr iage of justice standard. Only evidence that affec ts a defendant' s eligibility for the death pena lty\u2014wh ich the Sultan evidence is not\u2014can sup\u00ad port a miscarr iage of justice claim in capit al sentenci ng context. Id., at 347; Calderon, 523 U. S., at 559-560. One last considerati on informs our review of the Cour t of Appea ls' actions. In Calderon, we held federa lism cerns, arising from the unique charac ter federa l habeas review of state-cour t judg ments, and the policies embodied in the Antiterror ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 required an additi onal presumpti on against reca lling the mandate . This case also arises from federa l habeas corpus review of a state conviction. While the State's reliance in\u00ad terest is not as strong in a case where , unlike Calderon, the mandate has not issued, the nality and comity concer ns that animated Calderon are implicated here . Here a dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error , 813 S. 794 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t and we are respec tful of the Cour t of Appea ls' willingness to correc t a decisi on that it perceived to have been mist aken. A cour t's discreti on under Rule 41 must be exercised, how\u00ad ever, in a way that is consistent with the \" 'State's interest in the nality of convictions that have surv ived direc t review within the state cour t system. ' \" Id., at 555 (quoti ng Brech t v. Abraham son, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Tennessee ex\u00ad pended considerable time and resources in seek ing to en\u00ad force a capit al sentence rendered 20 years ago, a sentence that reflec ts the judg ment of the citizens of Tennessee that Thompson' s crimes merit the ultimate punishment. By withholdi ng the mandate for months\u2014based on only an arguable constituti onal claim\u2014wh ile the State prepared to carry out Thompson' s sentence , the Cour t of Appea ls did not accord the appropr iate level of respec t to that judg ment. Calderon v. Thompso n, supra, at 554-557. The Cour t of Appea ls may have been influenced by Sul\u00ad tan's unsettl ing account of Thompson' s conditi on during one of her visits. She descr ibed as ons about Thompson' s deter iorati ng ment al health and perhaps his competence to be executed, but these concer ns were prop\u00ad erly addressed in separate proceedi ngs. Based on the most recent state-cour t decisi on, which rejected the argument that Thompson is not competent to be executed, it appears that his conditi on has improved. Thompso n v. State, 134 S. W. 3d, at 184-185. Proceedi ngs on this issue were under\u00ad way in the District Cour t when the Cour t of Appea ls issued its second opinion. If those proceedi ngs resume , the Dis\u00ad trict Cour t an oppor tunity to address these mat\u00ad ters again and in light of the current evidence . Taken together these considerati ons convince us that the Cour t of Appea ls abused any discreti on Rule 41 arguably granted it to stay its mandate , without enter ing a 20:28:39] J., dissenti ng order , after this Cour t had denied certiorar i. The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit is reversed. It is so ordered. Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenti ng. This capit al case circumst ances\u2014 cir\u00ad cumst ances of a kind that I have not previously exper ienced in the 25 years I have served on the federa l bench. After an appel late cour t writes and releases an opinion, but before it issues its mandate , the writing judge , through happen\u00ad stance , comes across a document that (he reasonably be\u00ad lieves) shows not only that the cour t's initia l decisi on is wrong but that the decisi on will lead to a serious miscarr iage of justice . What is the judge to do? What the judge did here was to spend time\u2014hundreds of hours (while a petiti on for certiorar i was pendi ng before this Cour t and during the ve months following our denia l of the petiti on for rehear ing)\u2014re viewing the contents of the vast record with its many afdav its, repor ts, transcr ipts, and other documents accumu lated in the course of numerous state and federa l proceedi ngs during the precedi ng 20 years. The judge ultimately concluded that his initia l instinct about the document was correc t. The document was critica lly im\u00ad portant. It could affec t the outcome of what is, and has al\u00ad ways been, the major issue in the case. To consider the case without reference to it could mean a miscarr iage of justice . The judge consequently wrote a leng thy opinion (almost 30,000 words) explai ning what had happened. The other members of the panel did not agree with everyth ing in that opinion, but they did agree that their initia l decisi on must be vacated. The Cour t descr ibes what occurred as fol\u00ad lows: A \"dedicated judge discovered what he believed to have been an error , and we are respec tful of the Cour t of Appea ls' willingness to correc t a 794 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng to have been mist aken. \" Ante, at 812-813. The Cour t, howe ver, does not decide this case in a manner consistent with that observati on. A somewhat more comprehensive account of the nature of the \"error \"\u2014of the matter at stake, of the impor tance of the document, of the mystery of its late appearance , of the potentia l for a miscarr iage of justice \u2014 shou ld help make apparent the difcu lt circumst ance the panel believed it faced. It will also explai n why there was no \"abuse\" of discreti on in the panel' s effor t to \"correc t a decisi on that it perceived to have been mist aken. \" I Judge Suhrhei nrich, the panel member who investigated the record, is an exper ienced federa l judge , serv ing since 1984 as a federa l trial cour t judge and since 1990 as a federa l appel late judge . He wrote a leng thy account of the circum\u00ad stances present here . To underst and this case , one must read that full account and then compare it with the Cour t's truncated versi on. I prov ide a rough summary of the mat\u00ad ter based upon my own readi ng of his opinion. 373 F. 3d 688, 692-742 (opinion concurr ing in part and senti ng in part). A The panel' s initia l decisi on, issued on January 9, 2003, fo\u00ad cused upon an issue often raised when federa l habeas cour ts review state proceedi ngs in capit al case , namely , the effec\u00ad tiveness of counsel at the original trial. Thompso n v. Bell, 315 F. 3d 566, 587-594. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). In this instance , the federa l ineffec tive\u00ad assist ance claim was that state trial counsel had not sufciently investigated the background of the defendant, Gregory Thompson. Thompson claimed that an adequate in\u00ad vestigati on would have shown, to the satisfac tion of testi fy\u00ad ing exper ts, that he suffered from episodes of schizophrenia at the time of the crime. The schizophrenia lty phase F. 3d, at 697-698, and n. 4. Thompson' s trial took place in a Tennessee state cour t, where he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. His state-appoi nted counsel put on no defense at trial. At sentenci ng, howe ver, counsel sought to show that Thompson was schizophrenic. State forensic psycholog ists exami ned Thompson and concluded that Thompson, probably \"malin\u00ad gering,\" did not show genui ne and signicant symptoms of schizophrenia at that time and was not ment ally ill. A clini\u00ad cal psycholog ist hired by Thompson' s counsel exami ned Thompson for eight hours and reached approxi mately the same conclusi on: He said that Thompson was not then men\u00ad tally ill. Id., at 692, 694-695. Thompson raised the issue of his ment al conditi on in state postcon viction proceedi ngs, which he initiated in 1990. His exper t witness, Dr. Gillian Blair , testi ed (with much sup\u00ad portive mater ial) that Thompson was by that time clear ly display ing serious schizophrenic symptoms\u2014voice illusions, attempts at physica l self-muti lation, and the like. Indeed, the State conceded that he was under a regime of major anti\u00ad psychotic medicati on. But Dr. Blair said that she could not deter mine whether Thompson had been similarly afflicted (i. e., suffer ing from episodes of schizophrenia) at the time of the crime without a thorough background investigati on\u2014 funds for which the state cour t declined to make available . The state cour t then ruled in the State's favor . Id., at 694-695. Thompson led a habeas petiti on in Federa l District Cour t about eight months after the state cour t's denia l of postcon\u00ad viction relief became nal. As I said above , see supra, at 815 and this page , he claimed ineffec tive assist ance of federa the serv ices of two exper ts, Dr. Barry Crown and Dr. Faye Sul\u00ad tan. Both exami ned Thompson, and (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng conduc ted the more thorough background investigati on that Dr. Blair had earlier sought. The State, after deposi ng Dr. Sultan, moved for summary judg ment. 373 F. 3d, at 696, 700-704, 711. The District Cour t granted that moti on on the ground that \"Thompson has not prov ided this Cour t with anyth ing other than factually unsuppor ted allegati ons that he was incompe\u00ad tent at the time he committed the crime,\" nor \"has Thomp\u00ad son that [he] was suffer ing from a signicant ment al disease that shou ld have been presented to the jury during the punishment phase as mitigati on evidence .\" Id., at 712- 713 (quoti ng District Cour t's memorandum opinion; emphasis and inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Thompson (now with a new publ ic defender as counsel ) appea led the District Cour t's grant of summary judg ment in the State's favor . (A little over a year later , while the ap\u00ad peal was still pendi ng, Thompson' s new counsel, apparently having discovered that Dr. Sultan's depositi on and repor t had not been included in the record before the District Cour t, led a moti on in that cour t for relief from judg ment under Federa l Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), seek ing to sup\u00ad plement the record with those documents. Counsel also led a moti on in the appel late cour t, with the Sultan deposi\u00ad tion attached, requesti ng that the appea l be held in abeyance while the District Cour t considered the Rule 60(b) moti on. Both moti ons were denied, and Thompson' s counsel did not take an appea l from the District Cour t's denia l of the Rule 60(b) moti on.) 373 F. 3d, at 714-715, and n. 10, 724-725. The Cour t of Appea ls reviewed the District Cour t's grant of summary judg ment. In doing so, the appel late panel ex\u00ad amined the record before that cour t. It noted that Thomp\u00ad son's federa l habeas counsel had hired two exper ts (Crown and Sultan), and had told the cour t (in an offer of proof ) that they would prov ide evidence that Thompson suffered from ment al illness at the time of the crime. But the appel late 818 545US2 Unit: $U77 [03-26-08 20:28:39] PAGES Breyer, J., dissenti ng panel found that neither exper t had done so. Indeed, said the panel, Thompson had \"never submitted to any cour t any proof that he suffered from severe ment al illness at the time of the crime.\" 315 F. 3d, at 590 (emphasis altered). Though Thompson' s severa l attor neys had made the same allegati on for many years in severa l different cour (said oppor tunity counsel fail[ed] to secure an answer to the critica l issue of whether Thompson was ment ally ill at the time of the crime.\" Ibid. That fact, concluded the panel (over a dissent), was fatal to Thompson' s basic ineffec tive-assistance-of-counsel claim. Obviously \"trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffec tive for failing to discover someth ing that does not appear to exist. \" Ibid.; see also id., at 595 (Moore , J., concurr ing in resu lt) (\"Thompson has presented no evidence that his [trial] counsel knew or shou ld have known either that Thompson was ment ally ill or that his ment al conditi on was deter iorati ng at the time of his trial or at the time of his crime\"). The dissenti ng judge thought Thompson had made out an ineffec tive-assist ance claim by show ing that his trial counsel had relied on an inadequate exper t, that is, an exper t without the necessary qualica\u00ad tions to counter the State's exper ts' conclusi ons. at 599-605 (opinion of Clay , J.). The appea ls cour t issued its opinion on January 9, 2003. Thompson' s appoi nted federa l appea ls counsel led a rehear\u00ad ing petiti on, which the cour t denied on March 10, 2003. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 346 (Order in No. 00-5516 (CA6)). Thompson' s counsel then sought Supreme Cour t review. This Cour t denied review (and rehear ing) about one year later . 540 U. S. 1051 (2003) (deny ing certiorar i); 540 U. S. 1158 (2004) (deny ing rehear ing). B The Cour t of Appea ls, following ordinary appel late-cour t prac tice, withheld issuance of its mandate while the case was under review here , namely , during calendar 794 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng ing that time and in the months that followed, someth ing unusua l happened. Judge Suhrhei nrich realized that the panel, in reach ing its decisi on, seemed to have over looked documents prov ided by Dr. Sultan that likely were relevant. In September 2003, the appel late cour t called for the entire certied record. Upon reviewing that record, Judge Suhr\u00ad heinrich found Dr. Sultan's depositi on and accompany ing re\u00ad port. 373 F. 3d, at 692-693; App. to Pet. for Cert. 347-348; see also Appendix, infra. The Sultan documents lled the evidentiary gap that un\u00ad derlay the District Cour t's and the appel late panel' s deter mi\u00ad nations. These documents made clear that Dr. Sultan had investigated Thompson' s background in depth and that in her (well-suppor ted) opinion, Thompson had suffered from seri\u00ad ous episodic bouts of schizophrenia at the time the crime was commi tted. Clear ly the documents cont ained evidence sup\u00ad porting Thompson' s claim regardi ng his ment al state at the time of the offense . Why had the District Cour t denied the existence of any such evidence? Why had Judge Suhrhei n\u00ad rich, and the other members of the panel (and the State, which took Dr. Sultan's depositi on) done the same? Judge Suhrhei nrich then draf ted an opinion that sought to answer three questi ons: Questi on One: Do these documents actually prov ide strong evidence that Thompson was schizophrenic (and seriously so) at the time of the crime? Questi on Two: If so, given the many previous oppor tuni\u00ad ties that Thompson has had to raise the issue of his ment al health, to what extent would these documents be likely to matter in respec t to the legal questi on raised in Thompson' s federa l proceedi ngs, i. e., would they likely lead a federa l ha\u00ad beas cour t to hold that Thompson' s trial counsel was ineffec\u00ad tive for failing to under take a background investigati on akin to that performed by Dr. Sultan? Questi on Three: How did these documents THOMPSON Breyer, J., dissenti ng 1 The panel answered the rst As Judge Suhrhei nrich's opinion explai ns, these documents detail Thompson' s horrendous childhood, his fami ly history of men\u00ad tal illness, behav ior (in\u00ad cludi ng auditory hallucinations) as a child, his mood swings and bizarre behav ior as a young adult, and a worseni ng of that behav ior after a serious beati ng to his head that he suf\u00ad fered while in the Navy . For example , Dr. Sultan's exami\u00ad nation of Thompson and her interv iews with Thompson' s fami ly members and others revealed that as a child Thomp\u00ad son would repeatedly bang his head against the wall to \"knock the Devil out\" after his grandmother yelled at him, \"You have the Devil in you. \" 373 F. 3d, at 716 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). These documents explai n how Thompson, as a young adult, would talk to himself and scream and cry for no apparent reason. They suggest that he had bouts of paranoia. The documents prov ide strong suppor t for the conclusi on that Thompson suffered from episodes of schizophrenia at the time of the offense . And they thereby offer signicant suppor t for the conclusi on that, had earlier testi fying exper ts had this informati countered the State's exper ts' conclusi on that Thompson was malinger ing at the time of trial. Thus, the Sultan mater ials seriously under\u00ad mined the foundati on of the State's positi on in respec t to Thompson' s ment al conditi on. The Sultan mater ials also revealed that trial counsel failed to discover other mitigati ng evidence of impor tance . Inter\u00ad views with fami ly members revealed repeated incidents of violence in the fami ly, includi ng an episode in which, as a young boy, Thompson witnessed his father brutally beat and rape his mother . His grandmother , with whom 794 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng and his siblings lived after their mother died, subjec ted them to abuse and neglect. She would forget to feed the children, leaving them to steal money from under her bed to buy food. These and other circumst ances are detailed in sections of the Sultan repor t and depositi on reproduced in the Appendix, infra. 2 The panel also responded unani mously to the second questi on: Would federa l-cour t access to the Sultan documents likely have made a signicant difference in re\u00ad spec t to the federa l legal questi on at issue in Thompson' s habeas petiti on, namely , the failure of Thompson' s trial coun\u00ad sel to investigate his background? Trial counsel had had impor tant indicati ons that someth ing was wrong . Indeed, counsel himself had sought an evaluati on of Thompson' s men\u00ad tal conditi on. He also was aware of Thompson' s violent be\u00ad havior in the military, and knew that Thompson had said he had had auditory hallucinations all his life. He was aware , too, of the changes in Thompson' s behav ior. Shou ld counsel not then have investigated further? The Sultan documents make clear that, had he done so, he would have had a strong answer to the State's exper ts. Thus the documents were relevant to the outcome of the federa l habeas proceedi ngs. The Federa l District Cour t based its grant of summary judg ment on the premise that there was no evidence suppor ting Thompson' s claim. The documents showed that precisely such evidence was then available . 3 The panel (while disagreei ng about how to allocate blame) agreed in part about the answer to the third questi on: how these documents previously had escaped the panel' s atten\u00ad tion. The judges agreed that the Sultan documents were not in the initia l record on appea l. J., dissenti ng ion, while menti oning both Dr. Sultan and Dr. Crown, as\u00ad sumed that neither exper t had addressed Thompson' s ment al conditi on at the time of the crime. 315 F. 3d, at 583, n. 13 (\"Su ltan's afdav it does not discuss Thompson' s ment al state at the time of the offense\" (emphasis added)); ibid. (explai n\u00ad ing that Thompson led a Rule 60(b) moti on to supplement the record with Dr. Sultan's repor t, but not menti oning that the repor t addressed Thompson' s ment al conditi on at the time of the offense); see also supra, at 817-818. How had the panel over looked the copies of the Sultan depositi on attached to (1) the rehear ing petiti on and (2) the (Rule 60(b)-related) moti on to hold the appea l in abeyance? As for the rehear ing petiti on, the reason could well lie in the petiti on's (incorrec t) suggesti on that the panel had already considered the appended document as part of the original record. See Pet. for Rehear ing and Suggesti on for Rehear\u00ad ing En Banc in No. 00-5516 (CA6), p. 1 (\"A major ity of this panel over looked other proof in the record, includi ng but not limited to, the exper t opinion of Dr. Faye E. Sultan\"); see also id., at 28-32. While the petiti on explai ns the impor\u00ad tance of the documents, it does not explai n the circum\u00ad stances, namely , that the panel previously had not seen these documents. Instead, it gives the impressi on that counsel was simply reemphasi zing a matter the panel had already considered. To that extent, the petiti on reduced the likeli\u00ad hood that the panel would make the connec tion it later made and fatally weakened its argument for re-hear ing. As for the moti on to hold the appea l in abeyance pan\u00ad el's is also underst andable . The moti on gives the impressi on that the appel late cour t would have been able to handle any problem arising from the exclusi on of these mater ials in an appea l taken from the District Cour t's Rule 60(b) decisi on. The appel late cour t, howe ver, never had any such oppor tunity because counsel did not appea l the District Cour t's denia l 794 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng C Once the panel understood the signicance of the Sultan repor t, it had to decide what to do. An appel late cour t ex\u00ad ists to correc t legal errors made in the trial cour t. What legal error had the District Cour t committed? The appea l concer ned its grant of summary judg ment in the State's favor . The District Cour t made that decisi on on the basis of the record before it, and that record apparently lacked the relevant documents. How then could an appea ls cour t say that the District Cour t was wrong to grant the summary judg ment moti on? The panel answered this questi on by not holdi ng that the District Cour t had erred. Finding that the Sultan docu\u00ad ments had been \"apparently negligently omitted\" from the record, it exercised its equit able powers to supplement the record with the depositi on. 373 F. 3d, at 691. It also found that, since the State itself had helped to create that docu\u00ad ment (because the State had taken Dr. Sultan's depositi on), the District Cour t's reconsiderati on of the matter would not unfair ly prejudice the State. And it noted that this case is a death case. Then, relying on its \"inherent power to recon\u00ad sider \" an opinion \"prior to the issuance of the mandate ,\" the cour t issued a new opinion, vacati ng the District Cour t's grant of summary judg ment to the State and remandi ng the case to the District Cour t for further proceedi ngs on the matter . Ibid. II The questi on before us is not whether we, as judges, would have come to the same conclusi ons as did the panel of the Cour t of Appea ls. It is whether the three members of the appel late panel abused their discreti on in reconsider ing the matter and, after agreei ng unani mously that they would have reached a different resu lt had they considered the over\u00ad looked evidence , vacati ng the District Cour Breyer, J., dissenti ng The Cour t concludes that the panel' s reconsiderati on of the matter and decisi on to vacate the District Cour t's judg ment amounted to an \"abuse of discreti on.\" Ante, at 796. It therefore reverses mous inter locutory judg\u00ad ment capit al case to the District Cour t for an evidentiary hear ing. The Cour t lists ve reasons why the Cour t of Appea ls \"abused its discreti on.\" Ante, at 804. None of these reasons, whether taken separately or consid\u00ad ered together , stands up to exami nation. Reaso n One. During the 5-mo nth period after this Court denied rehearing of Thompso n's certiorari petition, during which time the Court of Appea ls was reconsidering the mat\u00ad ter, it gave \"no indication that it might be revisiting its earlier decision.\" Had it \"notied\" the parties, the court \"could have spared the parties and the state judicial system considerable time and resources .\" Ante, at 804, 805. If this considerati on favors the Cour t's conclusi on, it does so to a very modest degree . For one thing, the Federa l Rules themselves neither set an unchangeable deadl ine for issuance of a mandate nor require notice when the cour t en\u00ad larges the time for issuance . Compare Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(b) (2005) (\"The cour t may shor ten or the time\") with Rule 41(a) (1968) (mandate \"sha ll\" issue \"unless the time is shor tened or enlarged by order\" (emphasis added)). The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 41 expressly con\u00ad template that the parties will themselves check the docket to deter mine whether the mandate has issued. See Advisory Committee' s 1998 Note on subd. (c) of Rule 41 (\"[T]he parties can easily calculate the anticipated date of issuance and ver\u00ad ify issuance of the mandate[;] the entry of the order on the docket alerts the parties to that fact\"). And Sixth Circuit Rules require the Circuit Clerk to prov ide all parties with copies of the mandate . See Inter nal Operati ng Procedure 41(a) (CA6 2005) (\"Copies of the mandate are distr ibuted to all parties and the distr ict cour t clerk 's ofce\"). Thus, the State's attor neys knew , or 794 (2005) Breyer, J., dissenti ng the mandate had not issued, and, as exper ienced prac\u00ad titioners, they also knew , or certainly shou ld have known, that a proceedi ng is not technica lly over until the cour t has issued its mandate . And if concer ned by the delay (and some delay in such matters is not uncommon), they could have asked the Circuit Clerk why the mandate had not issued. If necessary , they could have led a moti on seek\u00ad ing that informati on or seek ing the mandate' s immediate issuance . For another thing, since noticati on is a clerical duty , the panel may have thought the parties had been notied. One of the judges on the panel could well have instructed the Circuit Clerk not to issue the mandate , and then simply have assumed that the Clerk would notify the parties of that fact (though the Clerk, perhaps inadver tently , did not do so). Why would the cour t want to hide what it was doing from the parties? Once we apply a presumpti on of regularity to the panel' s actions, we must assume that the failure to notify the parties was likely due to a simple clerical error . Further, the prejudice to the State that troubles the Cour t was likely small or nonexistent. The need to reset an execu\u00ad tion date is not uncommon, and the state cour executi on order expl icitly F. Supreme Cour t order set Thompson' s execu\u00ad tion date for August 19, 2004, \"unless other wise ordered by this Cour t or other appropr iate author ity\" (inter nal quot a\u00ad tion marks omitted)). Moreover , the State has not even argued\u2014 despite ample oppor tunity to do so\u2014that the fur\u00ad ther proceedi ngs ordered by the panel would actually have required it to set a new date . Finally, the State did not, by way of a petiti on for rehear\u00ad ing, make any of its \"failure to notify\" arguments to the Cour t of Appea ls. Although the law does not require the State to seek rehear ing, such a petiti on would have permit\u00ad ted the panel to explai n why the State was not notied and possibly to explore the matter of prejudice . There is THOMPSON Breyer, J., dissenti ng son to reward the State for not ling a petiti on by assumi ng prejudice where none appears to exist. Given the State's likely knowledge that the mandate had not issued, the existence of avenues for resolv ing any uncer\u00ad tainty, and the small likelihood of prejudice , the lack of notice does not signicantly advance the Cour t's \"abuse of discre\u00ad tion\" nding. Indeed, if the Cour t believes that the Cour t of Appea ls could have issued a revised opinion correc ting its earlier judg ment if only it had given notice to the parties, the sanc tion it now imposes\u2014outr ight reversa Reaso n Two. The court's \"opportunity to consider\" the Sultan evidence \"at the rehearing stage is yet another factor supporting\" the abuse-of-discretion \"determination.\" Ante, at 806-807. I agree that it is unfor tunate that, upon review of the rehear ing petiti on, the panel failed to make the con\u00ad nection that would have allowed it, at that time, to reach the same conclusi on it reached later . Still, the petiti on wrong ly implied that the Sultan documents were part of the original appea l. Because it did not request rehear ing on the ground that the documents were not in the record, it did not offer a genui ne \"oppor tunity to consider \" the Sultan evidence . Under these circumst ances, I cannot agree that the cour t's oppor tunity to consider these documents at the rehear ing stage shou ld militate in favor of nding an abuse of discre\u00ad tion. To the contrary , I believe we shou ld encourage , rather than discourage , an appel late panel, when it learns that it has made a serious mist ake, to take advant age of an oppor tu\u00ad nity to correc t it, rather than to ignore the problem. Reaso n Three. The \"Sul tan evidence . . . is not of such a charac ter as to warrant [a] departure from standard ap\u00ad pellate procedures\" becau se \"the evidence was unlikely to have altered the District Court's resolution of Thompso n's ineffective-assistance-o f-counsel claim.\" Ante, at 808-809. That is to say, given the expert testimony in the trial court, the Sultan evidence is unlikely mean ingfully to have 827 dissenti ng streng thened Thompso n's claim before the Federal District Court. Ante, at 808-810. This conclusi on is wrong . The Cour t argues the follow\u00ad ing: (1) Dr. conclusi on rests in signicant part upon interv iews with three witnesses, Thompson' s grandmother and sister (with whom Dr. Sultan spoke direc tly) and his girlfriend (whose interv iew with a defense investigator Dr. Sultan reviewed); (2) since all three of these witnesses testi ed at sentenci ng, Thompson' s counsel must have sulted them at the time; and (3) \"[c]onsu ltation with these witnesses, when combi ned with of [the State's exper t] and [Thompson's attor neys to conclude that focusi ng on Thompson' s ment al health was not the best strateg y.\" Ante, at 810. The Cour t then says that trial counsel' s \"strateg y\" may have been \"a mist ake,\" ante, at 812, but ap\u00ad parently not enough of a mist ake to amount to inadequate assist ance of counsel. But how do the Cour t's conclusi ons follow from the prem\u00ad ises? Dr. Sultan's interv iew of the three witnesses appar\u00ad ently turned up new informati on, indeed, crucial informati on. Why does that fact not tend to show that trial counsel' s own \"consu ltation\" with those witnesses was inadequate? Or, if trial counsel was aware of the informati on, why does that not tend to show that trial counsel hired an exper t who was not qualied to assess Thompson' s ment al conditi on, or that counsel failed adequately to convey the critica l informati on to that exper t? This Cour t in Wiggins v. Smi th, 539 U. S. 510, 523-525 (2003), found trial counsel inadequate for failing to conduc t a reasonable investigati on, given notice that such an investigati on would likely turn up impor tant mitigati ng evidence . See also Rompilla v. Beard, ante, p. 374. Why is the same not true here , where Thompson' s trial counsel was fully aware of the need for a background investigati on, and then either did not ask the right questi ons, or did not hire the right exper t, or did not convey the right J., dissenti ng to that exper t? At the least, is there not a good argument to this effec t\u2014an argument that the Sultan documents signicantly streng thened? All three judges on the panel thought so: They concluded that they would have reached a different resu lt on Thompson' s ineffec tive-assist ance-of\u00ad counsel claim had they been aware of the Sultan documents. The Cour t does not satisfactorily explain its basis for second-g uessi ng the panel on this point. Reaso n Four. The Sultan evidence does \"not come close to satisfying the miscar riage of justice standard unde r Cal\u00ad deron.\" Ante, at 812 (referr ing to Calderon v. Thomp\u00ad son, 523 U. S. 538 (1998)). As the Cour t apparently agrees, see ante, at 803-804, Calderon does not apply here . And the without the ben\u00ad et of the Sultan evidence would constitute a grave miscar\u00ad riage of justice \u2014surv ives any plausible standard of review. I can nd noth ing in the Cour t's opinion that explai ns why the panel' s conclusi on is wrong . Reaso n Five. The Court of Appea ls \"did not acco rd the appropriate t\" to the State's \"jud gmen If by \"judg ment\" the Cour t means to refer to the state cour t's original judg ment of conviction, this reason simply repeats Reason Four. The panel carefu lly exami ned the entire record and deter mined that there is a signicant likelihood the Sultan evidence would demonstrate a violati on of the Federa l Constituti on. If the Cour t means to refer to the state cour t's judg ment not to set aside the conviction in state postcon viction pro\u00ad ceedi ngs, the Cour t is clear ly wrong . The state cour t on collatera l review refused to author ize funds for a background investigati on, one for which Thompson' s exper t then showed a strong need, and which Thompson' s exper t now shows could well have demonstrated a signicantly mitigati ng men\u00ad tal conditi on. How is it disrespec tful of the State for a federa l habeas cour t to Breyer, J., dissenti ng occurred in state-cour t proceedi ngs in a capit al case , by tak\u00ad ing account of a key piece of evidence , mist akenly omitted from the record? If the Cour t means to refer to the State's decisi on to pro\u00ad ceed with the executi on, I cannot possibly agree . The Cour t could not mean that any exercise by a federa l cour t to cor\u00ad rect an respec of a State's effor t to proceed to executi on. But if it does not mean \"any\" exercise at all, then how can it say the present exercise is disrespec tful? The present exercise embodies as thorough an exami nation of the record and as signicant a piece of evidence as one is likely to nd. The process\u2014the detail and care with which the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals combed the record\u2014 does not show \"disrespec t.\" It shows the contrary . The upshot is that the Cour t's ve reasons are uncon vinc\u00ad ing. The Cour t simply states those reasons as conclusi ons. It fails to show how, or why, the unani mous panel erred in reach ing diametr ically opposite conclusi ons, all suppor ted with detailed evidence set forth in Judge Suhrhei nrich's opinion. It does not satisfac torily explai n the evidentiary basis for its own conclusi ons. And, in the process, it loses sight of the questi on before us: again, not whether we, as judges, would have reached the same conclusi on that the three judges on the panel reached, but rather whether they , having unani mously agreed that their earlier decisi on was wrong , abused their discreti on in setti ng it right. III Ultimately this case presents three kinds of questi ons. The rst is a narrow legal questi on. Has the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals abused its discreti on? For the reasons I have set forth, the answer to that questi on, legally speak ing, must be \"no.\" The second is an epistemolog ical questi on. How, in re\u00ad spec t to matters involv ing the legal impac t of the Unit: $U77 PAGES PGT: OPIN BEL THOMPSON Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J. repor t and depositi on, can the Cour t replace the panel' s judg ment with its own? Judge Suhrhei nrich's opinion dem\u00ad onstrates why any assessment of that legal impac t must grow out of thorough knowledge of the record. He spent hundreds of hours with its numerous documents in order to make that assessment. Those of his conclusi ons that were shared by the other members of the panel are logical, rest upon record-based facts, and are nowhere refuted (in respec t to those facts) by anyth ing before us or by anyth ing in the Cour t's opinion. How can the Cour t know that the panel is wrong? The third questi on is about basic jurisprudence . A legal system is based on rules; it also seeks justice in the indiv id\u00ad ual case. Someti mes these ends confl ict. To take account of such confl ict, the system often grants judges a degree of discreti on, thereby prov iding oil for the rule-based gears. When we tell the Cour t of Appea ls that it cannot exercise its discreti on to correc t the serious error it discovered here , we tell cour ts they are not to act to cure serious injustice in similar cases. The consequence is to divorce the rule-based resu lt from the just resu lt. The Amer ican judicia l system has long sought to avoid that divorce . Today' s decisi on takes an unfor tunate step in the wrong direc tion. APPENDIX TO OPINION OF BREYER , J. Excer pts from the Gregory Thompson Psycholog ical Re\u00ad port prepared by Dr. Faye E.

Ms. Wharton descr ibed many instances of such abuse and neglect. She descr ibed the period following their mother 's death as particularly chaotic and neglectful, reca lling that often there was no food in the home and that the children would take money from under their grandmother 's mattress to go and buy food. In the period following their mother 's death, Ms. Wharton repor ted that her grandmother was con\u00ad tinuously drunk and unable to care for her grandch ildren.

A self-i njurious behav ior is what we would call it I think. Mr. Thompson, when he was Greg , in the rst and second and third grade had rather frequent hyster ical crying episodes in classrooms that Ms. Wharton reca lls also as very unusua l in the context of his schoolroom situati on. She de\u00ad scribes him as being the subjec t of torment on the part of the students because he behaved in an odd fashion.

How so? \"A. There are points in time when Mr. Thompson is out of cont act with reality.

A person is not able to confor m one's conduc t to the law if you are frankly delusi onal or hallucinat\u00ad ing in some way. Mr. Thompson over the years has had both of those symptoms. \"Q. So it's this delusi onal aspec t of this disorder that is the main factor that would keep him from having the ability to confor m his conduc t to the requirements of law, if I under\u00ad stand you correc tly? \"A. Is it the main factor? Let me say that I think it's at least as potent a factor if not more as the other aspec t of his ment al illness, which is that is not in control of his emoti ons.

He is often embarrassed about his behav ior after\u00ad wards, but there are points at which I believe he's not in control of what he's doing. \"Q. When you say 'he's not in control of what he's doing,' are you saying that it's impu over-aroused and overreac tive and I operate out of a faulty belief system, so that not only do I have the impu lse to do things that I ordinarily wouldn't, but I also think things are going on that aren' t, I have a combi nation in which yes, I suppose you 843 $U77 [03-26-08 S. 794 (2005) Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J. could call it impu lse, but you also have to take the notion into account that it might be an impu lse to do someth ing that doesn' t make any sense . \"Q. Does this disorder prevent Mr. Thompson from plan\u00ad ning his activities? \"A. Someti mes, yes, it does. \"Q. And so the inabi lity to plan, would that be a factor that would prevent him from confor ming his conduc t to the requirements of the law? \"A. If that were in operati on at some time. In the history of the Depar tment of Correc tions' ment al health records, when he's proper ly medicated I don't think that' s true about him. \"Q. Is it your professi onal opinion, then, that when he is medicated he has the ability to plan, but when he is not medi\u00ad cated he does not always have the ability to plan? \"A. Those two things are true. It's also true that if he's inadequately medicated or improper ly medicated he doesn' t have the ability to plan anyth ing. I don't know whether he has impu lses. I think he's all impu lse, so to have impu lses implies that there' s a part of you that' s not impu lsive .

AMERI- CAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KENTUCKY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeal s for the sixth circuit No. 03-1693. Argued March 2, 2005 \u2014Decided June 27, 2005 After petiti oners, two Kentucky Counties, each posted large , readi ly visi\u00ad ble copies of the Ten Commandments in their cour thouses, respondents, the Amer ican Civil Liber ties Union (ACLU) et al., sued under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 1983 to enjoin the displays on the ground that they violated the First Amendment' s Establishment Clause . The Counties then adopted near ly identica l resoluti ons calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky' s \"precedent legal code .\" The resoluti ons noted severa l grounds for taking that positi on, includi ng the state legislature' s acknowledg ment of Christ as the \"Prince of Eth\u00ad ics.\" The displays around the Commandments were modi ed to include eight smaller, histor ical documents cont aining religious references as their sole common element, e. g., the Declarati on of Independence' s \"en\u00ad dowed by their Creator \" passage . Enter ing a preliminary injunc tion, the District Cour t followed the Lemo n v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, test to nd, inter alia, that the original display lacked any secu lar purpose because the Commandments are a disti nctly religious document, and that the second versi on lacked such a purpose because the Counties narrowly tailored their selec tion of foundati onal documents to those spe\u00ad cically referr ing to Christianity . After chang ing counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again. No new resoluti on author ized the new ex\u00ad hibits, nor did the Counties repea l the resoluti ons that preceded the second one. The new posti ng, entitled \"The Foundati ons of Amer ican Law and Gover nment Display ,\" consists of nine framed documents of equa l size. One sets out the Commandments expl icitly identi ed as the \"King James Version,\" quotes them at greater leng th, and explai ns that they have profoundly influenced the formati on of Wester n legal thought and this Nati on. With the Commandments are framed copies of, e. g., the Star Spang led Banner 's lyrics and the Declarati on of Independence , accompanied by statements about their histor ical and legal signicance . On the ACLU's moti on, the District Cour t included this third display in the injunc tion despite the Counties' professed intent to show that the Commandments were part of the foundati on of Amer ican Law and Gov\u00ad ernment and to educate county citizens as to the documents. The cour t took proclai ming the Commandments' foundati PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 844 (2005) Syllabus rather than secu lar, purpose under Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39, and found that the Counties' asser ted educati onal goals crumbled upon an exami nation of this litigati on's history . Afr ming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under Stone, display ing the Commandments bespeaks a religious objec t unless they are integrated with a secu lar message . The cour t saw no integrati on here because of a lack of a demonstrated ana\u00ad lytica l or histor ical connec tion between the Commandments and the other documents. Held: 1.

Their asser tions that true \"pur pose\" is unknowable , and its search merely an excuse for cour ts to act selec tively and picking out evidence of subjec tive intent, are as seismic as they are uncon vincing. Exami nation of purpose is a staple of statutory in\u00ad terpret ation for every Amer ican appel late cour t, e. g., Gene ral Dynam\u00ad ics Land System s, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 600, and gover nment al purpose is a key element of a good deal of constituti onal doctrine, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229. Scrutinizing purpose makes prac\u00ad tical sense in Establishment Clause analysis, where an underst ng of ofcia l objec tive emerges ly discoverable fact set forth in a statute' s text, legislative history , and implement ation or comparable of\u00ad cial act. Wallace v. Jaffree, supra, at 73-74. Nor is there any indica\u00ad tion that the purpose enquiry is rigged in prac tice to nding a religious purpose domi nant every time a case is led. Pp. 861-863. (c) The Cour t also avoids the Counties' alternative tack of trivializ\u00ad ing the purpose enquiry . They would read the Cour t's cases as if the enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secu COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Syllabus satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry , to the point of ignoring history , no matter what bear ing it actually had on the signicance of current circumst ances. There is no precedent for these arguments, or reason suppor ting them. Pp. 863-866. (1) A legislature' s stated reasons will genera lly warrant the def\u00ad erence owed in the rst instance to such ofcia l claims, but Lemo n re\u00ad quires the secu lar purpose to be genui ne, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a religious objec tive, see, e. g., Santa Fe Inde penden t Scho ol Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 308. In those unusua l cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secu lar purpose secondary , the unsur prising resu lts have been ndings of no adequate secu lar objec t, as against a predomi nantly religious one. See, e. g., Stone, supra, at 41. Pp. 864-865. (2) The Counties' argument that purpose in a case like this shou ld be inferred only from the latest in a series of gover nment al ac\u00ad tions, howe ver close they may all be in time and subjec t, bucks com\u00ad mon sense . Reasonable observers have reasonable memor ies, and the Cour t's precedents sensibly forbid an observer \"to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose .\" Santa Fe, supra, at 315. P. 866. 2. Evaluati on of the Counties' claim of secu lar purpose for the ulti\u00ad mate displays may take their evoluti on into account. The development of the present ation shou ld be considered in deter mining its purpose . Pp. 867-874. (a) Stone is the Cour t's initia l benchmark as its only case dealing with the constituti onality of display ing the Commandments. It recog\u00ad nized that the Commandments are an \"instrument of religion\" and that, at least on the facts before the Cour t, their text' s display could presump\u00ad tively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law speci cally required their posti ng in classrooms, their isolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secu lar educati on explai ned their being there . 449 U. S., at 41, n. 3. But Stone did not purport to decide the constituti onality of every possible way the gover nment might set out the Commandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, County of Allegheny v. Ame rican Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 595. Hence , the Cour t looks to the record show ing the progressi on leadi ng up to the Commandments' third display , beginning with the rst. Pp. 867-868. (b) There are two obvious similarities between the display Stone rejected and the rst one here: both set out the Commandments' text as disti nct from any traditi onally symbol ic represent ation like blank tab\u00ad lets, and each stood alone, not as part of an arguably secu lar display . Stone stressed the signicance of PGT: OPIN U. S. 844 (2005) Syllabus a secu lar scheme to fores tall the broadcast of an other wise clear ly reli\u00ad gious message , 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a centra l point of reference in the religious and mora l history of Jews and Christians. They proclai m the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods), regulate details of religious obligati on (no graven images, sabbath break ing, or vain oath swear ing), and unmist akably rest even the universa lly accepted proh ibitions (as against murder , theft, etc.) on the sanc tion of the divinity proclai med at the text' s beginning. Display ing that text is thus different from symbol ic represent ation, like tablets with 10 roman numera ls, which could be seen as alluding to a genera l notion of law, not a sectarian concepti on of faith. Where the text is set out, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly suggesti ng a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view. The display in Stone had no such context, and the Counties' solo exhibit here did noth ing more to counter the sectarian implicati on than the Stone posti ngs. The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to empha\u00ad size and celebrate the Commandments' religious message . Pp. 868-869. (c) The Counties' second display , unlike the rst, did not hang the Commandments in isolati on, but included the statement of the gover n\u00ad ment' s purpose expressly set out in the county resoluti ons, and under\u00ad scored it by juxtaposi ng the Commandments to other documents whose references to God were highlighted as their sole common element. The display' s unsti nting focus was on religious passages, show ing that the Counties posted the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content. That demonstrati on of the gover nment' s objec tive was en\u00ad hanced by serial religious references and the accompany ing resoluti ons' claim about the embodi ment of ethics in Christ. Together , the display and resoluti on presented an indisput able, and undisputed, show ing of an imper missible . Pp. 869-870. (d) on no legitimizing secu lar pur\u00ad pose prompted the Counties' third display , the \"Foundati ons of Amer i\u00ad can Law and Gover nment\" exhibit, is amply justi ed. That display placed the Commandments in the company of other documents the Counties deemed especia lly signicant in the histor ical foundati on of Amer ican gover nment. In trying to persuade the District Cour t to lift the preliminary injunc tion, the Counties cited severa l new purposes for the third versi on, includi ng a desire to educate county citizens as to the signicance of the documents displayed. The Counties' claims, how\u00ad ever, persuaded neither that cour t, which was intimately fami liar with this litigati on's details, nor the Sixth Circuit. Where both lower cour ts were unable to discer n an arguably valid secu lar purpose , this Cour t normally shou ld hesit ate to nd one. COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Syllabus 578, 594. The Counties' new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigati ng positi on, there being no further author izing resolu\u00ad tions by the Counties' gover ning boards. And although repea l of the earlier county author izations would not have erased them from the rec\u00ad ord of evidence bear ing on current purpose , the extraordi nary resolu\u00ad tions for the second displays passed just months earlier were not re\u00ad pealed or other wise repudiated. Indeed, the sectarian spirit of the resoluti ons found enhanced expressi on in the third display , which quoted more of the Commandments' purely religious lang uage than the rst two displays had done . No reasonable observer , therefore , could accept the claim that the Counties had cast off the objec tive so unmist akable in the earlier displays. Nor did the selec tion of posted mater ial suggest a clear theme that might prevail over evidence of the conti nuing reli\u00ad gious objec t. For example , it is at least odd in a collection of documents said to be \"foundati onal\" to include a patr iotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most signicant structura l prov ision adopted since the original frami ng. An observer would probably sus\u00ad pect the Counties of reach ing for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of cour thouses was adequately sup\u00ad ported by evidence that the Counties' purpose had not changed at the third stage, the Cour t does not decide that the Counties' past actions forever taint any effor t on their part to deal with the subjec t matter . The Cour t holds only that purpose is to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and is to be understood in light of context. Dis\u00ad trict cour ts are fully capable of adjusti ng preliminary relief to take ac\u00ad count of genui ne changes in constituti onally signicant conditi ons. Nor does the Cour t hold that a sacred text can never be integrated constitu\u00ad tionally into a gover nment al display on law . t\u00ad room frieze depic ts the secu larly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawg iv\u00ad ers, most of them secu lar gures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the Nati F. 3d 438, afrmed.

Executives of two counties posted a versi on of the Ten Commandments on the walls of their cour thouses. After suits were led charg ing violati ons of the Establishment Clause , the legislative body of each county adopted a resolu\u00ad tion calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky' s \"precedent legal code ,\" Def.

The resu lt in each instance was a modi ed display of the Commandments surrounded by texts cont aining religious references as their sole common ele\u00ad ment. After chang ing counsel, the counties revised the ex\u00ad hibits again by eliminating some documents, expandi ng the text set out in another , and addi ng some new ones. The issues are whether a deter mination of the counties' purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complai nts, and whether evaluati on of the counties' claim of secu lar purpose for the ultimate displays may take their evoluti on into account.

In Pulaski , amidst repor ted controversy over the pro\u00ad priety of the display , the Commandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county Judge-E xecutive , who called them \"good rules to live by\" and who recounted the story of an astronaut who became convinced \"there must be a divine God\" after viewing the Earth from the moon. Dod\u00ad son, Commonwea lth Journal, July 25, 1999, p. A1, col. 2, in Memorandum in Suppor t of Plaintiffs' Moti on for tion No. 99-509 (inter ation marks omitted). The Judge-E xecutive was ac\u00ad companied by the pastor of his church, who called the Com\u00ad mandments \"a creed of ethics\" and told the press after the ceremony that display ing the Commandments was \"one of the greatest things the judge could have done to close out the millennium. \" Id., at A2, col. 3 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted).

As direc ted by the resoluti ons, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten Commandments in their locati ons, pre\u00ad sumably along with copies of the resoluti on, which instructed that it, too, be posted, id., at 9. In additi on to the rst dis\u00ad play' s large framed copy of the edited King James versi on of the Commandments,4 the second included eight other docu\u00ad ments in smaller frames, each either having a religious and their politica l subdiv isions\" through the Fourteenth Amendment.

Supp . 2d, at 684, and n. 4; 96 F. Supp . 2d, at 695-696, and n. 4. The exhibits in the record depic t the Commandments hang ing as a separate item, Def.

Like the District Cour t, we nd our analysis appl ies COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t theme or excer pted to highlight a religious element. The documents were the \"endowed by their Creator \" passage from the Declarati on of Independence; the Preamble to the Constituti on of Kentucky; the national motto , \"In God We Trust\"; a page from the Congressi onal Record of February 2, 1983, proclai ming the Year of the Bible and includi ng a statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamati on by President Abraham Lincoln desig nating April 30, 1863, a Na\u00ad tional Day of and Humiliation; an pt from Presi\u00ad dent Lincoln' s \"Reply to Loya l Colored People of Baltimore upon Present ation of a Bible ,\" readi ng that \"[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man\"; a proclamati on by President Reagan mark ing 1983 the Year of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compac t. 96 695-696. After argument, the District Cour t entered a preliminary injunc tion on May 5, 2000, order ing that the \"displa y...b e removed from [each ] County Cour thouse TEL Y\" and that no county ofcia l \"erec t or cause to be erec ted simi\u00ad lar displays. \" 96 F. 703. The cour t's analysis of the situati on followed the three-par t formulation rst stated in Lemo n v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). As to gover nment al purpose , it con\u00ad cluded \"lack[ pose\" because the Commandments \"are a disti nctly religious document, believed by many Christians and Jews to be the direc t and revealed word of God. \" 96 F. Supp . 2d, at 686; 96 F. Supp . 2d, at 698. Although the Counties had maintained that the original display was meant to be educati onal, \"[t]he narrow scope of the display\u2014a single unaccom\u00ad panied by any inter pret ation explai ning its role as a founda\u00ad tional document \u2014can hardly be said to present meani ngfully the story of this country' s The cour t found versi on also \"clear ly lack[ ed] a secu lar Cite 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t foundati onal documents to incor porate only those with spe\u00ad cic references to Christianity .\" 5 96 F.

They then installed another display in each cour t\u00ad house , the third within a year . No new resoluti on author\u00ad ized this one, nor did the Counties repea l the resoluti ons that preceded the second. The posti ng consists of nine framed documents of equa l size, one of them setti ng out the Ten Commandments expl icitly identi the \"King 20:3-17, 145 F.

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY.

Assembled with the Commandments are framed copies of the Mag na Carta, the Declarati on of Independence , the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star Spang led Banner , the May\u00ad flower Compac t, the Nati onal Motto , the Preamble to the Kentucky Constituti on, and a picture of Lady Justice . The collection is entitled \"The Foundati ons of Amer ican Law and Gover nment Display\" and each document comes with a state\u00ad ment about its histor ical and legal signicance . The com\u00ad ment on the Ten Commandments reads: \"The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formati on of Wester n legal thought and the forma\u00ad tion of our country . That influence is clear ly seen in the Declarati on of Independence , which declared that 'We hold these truths to be self-e vident, that all men are cre\u00ad ated equa l, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liber ty, and the pursuit of Happi ness. ' The Ten Com\u00ad mandments prov ide the mora l background of the Decla\u00ad ration of Independence and the foundati on of our legal traditi on.\" Id., at 180a. The ACLU moved to supplement the preliminary injunc\u00ad tion to enjoin the Counties' third display ,6 and the Counties responded with severa l explanati ons for the new versi on, in\u00ad 6 Before the District Cour t issued the modi ed injunc tion, the Counties removed the label of \"King James Version\" and the citation to Exodus. 145 F. Supp . 2d 845, 847 (ED 15:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t cludi ng desires \"to demonstrate that the Ten Command\u00ad ments were part of the foundati on of Amer ican Law and Gover nment\" and \"to educate the citizens of the county re\u00ad gardi ng some of the documents that played a signicant role in the foundati on of our system of law and gover nment. \" 145 F. Supp . 2d, at 848 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The cour t, howe ver, took objec tive of proclai ming the Commandments' foundati \"a religious, rather than secu lar, purpose\" under Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39 (1980) (per curiam), 145 F. Supp . 2d, at 849, and found the asser that the Counties' broader educati \"crumble[ s]... upon an of the his\u00ad tory of this litigati on,\" ibid. In light of the Counties' deci\u00ad sion to post the Commandments by themselves in the rst instance , contrary to Stone, and later to \"accentuat[ e]\" the religious objec tive by surroundi ng the Commandments with \"speci c references to Christianity ,\" the District Cour t un\u00ad derstood the Counties' \"clear \" purpose as being to post the Commandments, not to educate .7 145 F. Supp . 2d, at 849- 850 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). As requested, the trial cour t supplemented the injunc tion, and a divided panel of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Sixth Circuit afrmed. The Circuit major ity stressed that under Stone, display ing the Commandments bespeaks a religious objec t unless they are integrated with other mater ial so as to carry \"a secu lar message ,\" 354 F. 3d 438, 449 (2003). The major ity judges saw no integrati on here because of a \"lack of a demonstrated analytica l or histor ical connec tion [be\u00ad 7 The cour t also found that the effec t of the third display was to endorse religion because the \"reasonable observer will see one religious code placed alongside eight politica l or patr iotic documents, and will underst and that the counties promote that one religious code as being on a par with our nation's most cher ished secu lar symbols and documents\" and because the \"reasonable observer [would know ] someth ing of the controversy sur\u00ad roundi ng these displays, which has focused on only one of the nine framed documents: the Ten Commandments. \" Id., at v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t tween the Commandments and] the other documents. \" Id., at 451. They noted in particular that the Counties offered no suppor t for their claim that the Ten Commandments \"pro\u00ad vide[d] the mora l backdrop\" to the Declarati on Independ\u00ad ence or \"profoundly influenced\" it. Ibid. (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The major ity found that the Counties' purpose was religious, not educati onal, given the nature of the Commandments as \"an active symbol of reli\u00ad gion [stating] 'the religious duties of believers. '\" Id., at 455. The judges in the major ity understood the identica l displays to emphasi ze \"a single religious influence , with no menti on of any other religious or secu lar influences, \" id., at 454, and they took the very history of the litigati on as evidence of the Counties' religious objec tive, id., at 457. Judge Ryan dissented on the basis of wide recog nition that religion, and the Ten Commandments in particular, have played a foundati onal part in the evoluti on of Amer ican law and gover nment; he saw no reason to gainsay the Counties' claim of secu lar purposes. Id., at 472-473. The dissent de\u00ad nied that the prior displays shou ld have any bear ing on the constituti onality of the current one: a \"history of unconstitu\u00ad tional displays can[not] be used as a sword to strike down an other wise constituti onal display .\" 8 Id., at 478. We granted certiorar i, 543 U. S. 924 (2004), and now afrm. 8 The Sixth Circuit did not decide whether the display had the imper mis\u00ad sible effec t of advanci ng religion because one judge , having found the dis\u00ad play motivated by a religious purpose , did not reach that issue . 354 F. 3d, at 462 (Gibbons, J., concurr ing). The other judge in the major ity con\u00ad cluded that a reasonable observer would nd that the display had the effec t of endorsi ng religion given the lack of analytica l connec tion between the Commandments and the other documents in the display , the cour t\u00ad house locati on of the display , and the history of the displays. Id., at 458- 459. The dissent found no effec t of endorsement because it concluded that a reasonable observer would only see that the County had merely acknowledged the foundati onal role of the Ten Commandments rather than endorsed their religious content. Id., at 479-480. 859 U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t II Twenty-ve years ago in a case prompted by posti ng the Ten Commandments in Kentucky' s publ ic schools, this Cour t recog nized that the Commandments \"are undeniably a sa\u00ad cred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths\" and held that their display in publ ic classrooms violated the First Amend\u00ad ment' s bar against establishment of religion. Stone, 449 U. S., at 41. Stone found a predomi nantly religious purpose in the gover nment' s posti ng of the Commandments, given their promi nence as \" 'an instrument of religion,' \" id., at 41, n. 3 (quoti ng Scho ol Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp , 374 U. S. 203, 224 (1963)). The Counties ask for a different approach here by arguing that ofcia l purpose is unknowable and the search for it inherently vain. In the alternative , the Counties would avoid the District Cour t's conclusi on by having us limit the scope of the purpose enquiry so severely that any trivial rationalization would sufce , under a stand\u00ad ard oblivious to the history of religious gover nment action like the progressi on of exhibits in this case. A Ever since Lemo n v. Kurtzman summar ons Establishment Clause to whether gover nment action has \"a secu lar legislative purpose\" has been a common, albeit seldom dis\u00ad positive , element of our cases. 403 U.

In specia l instances $U78 [03-28-08 15:55:40] PAGES COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 75 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment). The touchstone for our analysis is the principle that the \"First Amendment mandates gover nment al neutra lity be\u00ad tween religion and nonre\u00ad ligion.\" Eppe rson v. Arkan sas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968); Ev\u00ad erson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 15-16 (1947); Wallace, supra, at 53. When the gover nment acts with the ostensible and predomi nant purpose of advanci ng religion, it violates that centra l Establishment Clause value of ofcia l religious neutra lity, there being no neutra lity when the gov\u00ad ernment' s ostensible objec t is to take sides. Corporation of Presi ding Bisho p of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sain ts v. Amos , 483 U. S. 327, 335 (1987) (\"Lemo n's 'purpose' requirement aims at from abandon\u00ad ing the intent of promoti ng a par\u00ad ticular point of view in religious matters\").

Simmo ns-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 718 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenti ng). By show ing a purpose to favor religion, the gover nment are outsiders, not full members of the politica l community , and an accompany\u00ad ing message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members . . . .'\" Santa Fe Inde penden t Scho ol Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290, 309-310 (2000) (quoti ng Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 688 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing)). Indeed, the purpose apparent from gover nment action can have an impac t more signicant than the resu lt expressly hold gover nment al action legitimate even where its mani fest purpose was presumably religious. See, e. g., Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783 (1983) (upholdi ng legislative prayer despite its religious nature). No such rea\u00ad sons present themselves here S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t decreed: when the gover nment maintains Sunday closi ng laws, it advances religion only minimally because many work ing people would take the day as one of rest regardless, but if the gover nment justi ed its decisi on with a stated de\u00ad sire for all Amer icans to honor Christ, the divisive thrust of the ofcia l action would be inescapable . This is the teach ing of McGowan v. Mar yland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), which upheld Sunday closi ng statutes on prac tical, secu lar grounds after nding that the gover nment had forsaken the religious purposes behind centur ies-old predecessor laws. Id., at 449-451. B Despite the intuitive impor tance of ofcia l purpose to the realization of Establishment Clause values, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemo n's purpose test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here . Their rst argument is that the very considerati on of purpose is deceptive: accordi ng to them, true \"pur pose\" is unknowable , and its search merely an excuse for cour ts to act selec tively and unpredic tably evidence of subjec tive intent. The asser tions are as seismic as they are uncon vincing. Exami nation of purpose is a staple of statutory inter pret a\u00ad tion that makes up the daily fare of every appel late cour t in the country , e. g., Gene ral Dynamics Land System s, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 600 (2004) (inter preti ng statute in light of its \"text, structure , purpose , and history\"), and gover n\u00ad ment al purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitu\u00ad tional doctrine, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976) (discr iminatory purpose required for Equal Protec tion violati on); Hun t v. Washington State Appl e Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 352-353 (1977) (discr iminatory pur\u00ad pose relevant to dormant Commerce Clause claim); Church of Lukumi Baba lu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520 (1993) (discr iminatory purpose raises level of scrutiny required by free exercise claim). With enquir ies into purpose this com\u00ad mon, if they were noth ing but COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t ing attenti on from bare judicia l will, the whole notion of pur\u00ad pose in law would have dropped into disrepute long ago. But scrutinizing purpose does make prac tical sense , as in Establishment Clause analysis, underst andi ng of ofcia l objec l psychoana lysis of a draf ter's hear t of hear ts. Wallace, 472 U. S., at 74 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment). The eyes that look to purpose belong to an \" 'objec tive observer ,' \" one who takes account of the tradi\u00ad tional exter nal signs that show up in the \"'text, legislative history , and implement ation of the statute ,' \" or compara\u00ad ble ofcia l act. Santa Fe, supra, at 308 (quoti ng Wallace, supra, at 76 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment)); see also Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 594-595 (1987) (en\u00ad quiry looks to \"plai the statute' s words, enlight\u00ad ened by their context and the contemporaneous legislative history [and] the histor ical context , . ng to [its] passage\"). There is, then, noth ing hinting at an unpredic table or disin\u00ad genuous exercise when a cour t enquires into purpose after a claim is raised under the Establishment Clause . The cases with ndings of a predomi nantly religious pur\u00ad pose point to the straightfor ward nature of the test. In Wallace, for example , we inferred purpose from a change of wordi ng from an earlier statute to a later one, each dealing with prayer in schools. 472 U. S., at 58-60. And in Ed\u00ad wards, we relied on a statute' s text and the detailed publ ic comments of its sponsor , when we sought the purpose of a state law requir ing creati onism to be taught alongside evolu\u00ad tion. 482 U. S., at 586-588. In other cases, the gover nment action itself bespoke the purpose , as in Abington, where the objec t of required Bible study in publ ic schools was patently religious, 374 U. S., at 223-224; in Stone, the Cour t held that the \"[p]osti ng of religious texts \"the posted copies of the Ten Commandments [were ] to have any effec t at all, PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t [would] be to induce the schoolch ildren to read, medit ate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey , the Commandments. \" 449 U. S., at 42. In each case , the gover nment' s action was held unconstituti onal because openly available data sup\u00ad ported a commonsense conclusi on that a religious objec tive permeated the gover nment' s action. Nor is there any indicati on that the enquiry is rigged in prac tice to nding a religious purpose domi nant every time a case is led. In the past, the test has not been fatal very often, presumably because gover nment does not genera lly act nant purpose of ad\u00ad vanci religion. That said, one consequence of the corol\u00ad lary that Establishment Clause analysis does not look to the veiled psyche of gover nment ofcers could be that in some of the cases in which establishment complai nts failed, savvy ofcia ls had disguised their religious intent so cleverly that the objec tive observer just missed it. But that is no reason for great constituti onal concer n. If someone in the gover n\u00ad ment hides religious motive so well that the \" 'objec tive ob\u00ad server , acquai , and im\u00ad plement ation of the statute ,' \" Santa Fe, 530 U. S., at 308 (quoti ng Wallace, supra, at 76 (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment)), cannot see it, then without someth ing more the gover nment does not make a divisive announcement that in itself amounts to taking religious sides. A secret motive stirs up no strife and does noth ing to make outsiders of non\u00ad adherents, and it sufces to wait and see whether such gov\u00ad ernment action turns out to have (as it may even be likely to have) the illegitimate effec t of advanci ng religion. C After declining the invitation to abandon concer n with purpose wholesa le, we also have to avoid the Counties' alter\u00ad native tack of trivializing the enquiry into it. The Counties would read the cases as if the purpose enquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secu larity would satisfy COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t they would cut context out of the enquiry , to the point of ignoring history , no matter what bear ing it actually had on the signicance of current circumst ances. There is no prec\u00ad edent for the Counties' arguments, or reason suppor ting them. 1 Lemo n said that gover nment action must have \"a sec\u00ad ular...p urpose ,\" 403 U. S., at 612, and after a host of cases it is fair to add that although a legislature' s stated rea\u00ad sons will genera lly get deference , the secu lar purpose re\u00ad quired has to be genui ne, not a sham, and not merely second\u00ad ary to a religious objec tive. See, e. g., Santa Fe, supra, at 308 (\"When a gover nment al entity professes a secu lar pur\u00ad pose for an arguably religious policy, the gover nment' s char\u00ad acterization is, of course , entitled to some deference . But it is nonetheless the duty of the cour ts to 'disti nguis[h ] a sham secu lar purpose from a sincere one' \"); Edwards, 482 U. S., at 586-587 (\"While the Cour t is normally deferentia l to a State's articulation of a secu lar purpose , it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham\"); id., at 590, 594 (referr ing to enquiry as one into \"preemi nent\" or \"primary\" purpose); Stone, supra, purpose\" of gover nment action). Even the Counties' own cited author ity conr ms that we have not made the purpose test a pushover for any secu lar claim. True, Wallace said gover nment action is tainted by its objec t \"if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion,\" 472 U. S., at 56, a remark that suggests, in isola\u00ad tion, a fairly complaisant attitude . But in that very case the Cour t declined to credit Alabama' s stated secu lar rationale of \"accommodati on\" for legislati on author izing a period of silence in school for medit ation or volunt ary prayer , given the implausibi lity of that explanati on in light of another stat\u00ad ute already accommodati ng children wishing to pray . Id., at 57, n. 45 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). And U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t be just as much a mist ake to infer that a timid standard under lies the statement in Lynch v. Donnelly that the pur\u00ad pose enquiry looks to whether gover nment tivated whol ons,\" 465 U. S., at 680; for two cases cited for that propositi on had exami ned and rejected claims of secu lar purposes that turned out to be implausible or inadequate: 11 Stone, supra, at 41; Abington, 374 U. S., at 223-224.12 See also Bowen v. Kendr ick, 487 U. S. 589, 602 (1988) (using the \"motivated whol ly by an im\u00ad permissible purpose\" lang uage , but citing Lynch and Stone). As we said, the Cour t often does accept gover nment al state\u00ad purpose , in keepi ng with the respec t owed in the rst instance to such ofcia l claims. But in those unusua l cases where the claim was an apparent sham, or the secu lar purpose secondary , the unsur prising resu lts been nd\u00ad ings of no secu lar objec t, as against a predomi\u00ad nantly religious one.13 11 Moreover , Justice O'Connor prov ided the fth vote for the Lynch major ity and her concurrence emphasi zed the point made implicitly in the major ity opinion that a secu lar purpose must be serious to be sufcient. 465 U. S., at 691 (The purpose inquiry \"is not satise d... by the mere existence of some secu lar purpose , howe ver domi nated by religious purposes\"). 12 Stone found the sacred charac ter of the Ten Commandments preemi\u00ad nent despite an avowed secu lar purpose to show their \"adopti on as the fundament al legal code of Wester n Civilization and the Common Law.... \" 449 U. S., at 39-40, n. 1 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). And the Ab\u00ad ington Cour t was uncon vinced that music educati on or the teach ing of literature were actual secu lar objec ts behind laws requir ing publ ic school teachers to lead recit ations from the Lord' s Prayer and readi ngs from the Bible . 374 U. S., at 273. 13 The dissent nonetheless maintains that the purpose test is satised so long as any secu lar purpose for the gover nment action is apparent. Post, at 901-902 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Leav ing aside the fact that this posi\u00ad tion is inconsistent with the lang uage of the cases just discussed, it would leave the purpose test with no real bite, given the ease of nding some secu lar purpose for almost any gover nment action. Whil e heightened deference to legislatures is appropr iate for the review PAGES COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t 2 The Counties' second proffered limitation can be dis\u00ad patched quickly . They argue that purpose in a case like this one shou ld be inferred, if at all, only from the latest news about the last in a series of gover nment al actions, howe ver close they may all be in time and subjec t. But the world is not made brand new every morning, and the Counties are simply asking us to ignore perfectly probative evidence; they want an absentmi nded objec tive observer , not one presumed to be fami liar with the history of the gover nment' s actions and competent to learn what history has to show , Santa Fe, 530 U. S., at 308 (objec tive observer is fami liar concurr ing in judg ment))); Edwards, supra, at 595 (enquiry to ical context of the statute...a nd of events leadi ng to [its] passage\"); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 780 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment) (\"[T]he reasonable ob\u00ad server in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious display appears\"). The Counties' positi on just bucks common sense: reasonable observers have reasonable memor ies, and our precedents sensibly forbid an observer \"to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose .\" 14 Santa Fe, supra, at 315. tion, an approach that credits any valid purpose , no matter how trivial, has not been the way the Cour t has approached gover nment action that implicates establishment. 14 One consequence of taking account of the purpose under lying past actions is that the same gover nment action may be constituti onal if taken in the rst instance and unconstituti onal if it has a sectarian heritage. This presents no incongr uity, howe ver, because purpose matters. Just as Holmes' s dog could tell the difference between being kicked and being stumbled over , it will matter to objec tive observers whether posti ng the Commandments follows on the heels of displays motivated by sectarian\u00ad ism, or whether it lacks a history demonstrati U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t III This case comes to us on appea l from a preliminary injunc\u00ad tion. We accordi ngly review the District Cour t's legal rul\u00ad ings de novo, and its ultimate conclusi on for abuse of discre\u00ad tion.15 Ashcro ft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656 (2004). We take Stone as the initia l legal benchmark, our only case dealing with the constituti onality of display ing the Com\u00ad mandments. Stone recog nized that the Commandments are an \"instrument of religion\" and that, at least on the facts before it, the display of their text could presumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although state law speci cally required their posti ng in publ ic school class\u00ad rooms, their isolated exhibition did not leave room even for an argument that secu lar educati on explai ned their being there . 449 U. S., at 41, n. 3 (inter nal quot ation marks omit\u00ad ted). But Stone did not purport to decide the constituti onal\u00ad ity of every possible way the Commandments might be set out by the gover nment, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key. County of Allegheny v. Ame rican Civil Liber\u00ad ties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 595 sent, apparently not giving the reasonable observer as much credit as Holmes' s dog, contends that in prac tice it will be \"absur[ d]\" to rely upon differences in purpose in assessi ng gover nment action. Post, at 907. As an initia l matter , it will be the rare case in which one of two identica l displays violates the purpose prong . In genera l, like displays tend to show like objec tives and will be treated accordi ngly. But where one dis\u00ad play has a history mani festi ng sectarian purpose that the other lacks, it is appropr iate that they be treated differently , for the one display will be proper ly understood as demonstrati ng a preference for one group of reli\u00ad gious believers as against another . See supra, at 860-861. Whil e post\u00ad ing the Commandments may not have the effec t of causi ng greater adher\u00ad ence to them, an ostensible indicati on of a purpose to promote a particular faith certainly will have the effec t of causi ng viewers to underst and the gover nment is taking sides. 15 We note that the only factor in the preliminary injunc tion analysis that is at issue here is the likelihood of the ACLU's success on the merits. COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t (1989) (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\"[T]he questi on is what viewers may fairly underst and to be the purpose of the dis\u00ad play. That inquiry , of necessity , turns upon the context in which the contested objec t appears\" (inter nal quot ation marks and citation omitted)). Hence , we look to the record of evidence show ing the progressi on leadi ng up to the third display of the Commandments. A The display rejected in Stone had two obvious similarities to the rst one in the sequence here: both set out a text of the Commandments as disti nct from any traditi onally sym\u00ad bolic represent ation, and each stood alone, not part of an arguably secu lar display . Stone stressed the signicance of integrati ng the Commandments into a secu lar scheme to forest all the broadcast of an other wise clear ly religious mes\u00ad sage , 449 U. S., at 42, and for good reason, the Command\u00ad ments being a centra l point of reference in the religious and mora l history of Jews and Christians. They proclai m the existence of a monotheistic god (no other gods). They regu\u00ad late details of religious obligati on (no graven images, no sab\u00ad bath break ing, no vain oath swear ing). And they unmist ak\u00ad ably rest even the universa lly accepted proh ibitions (as against murder , theft, and the like) on the sanc tion of the divinity proclai med at the beginning of the text. Display ing that text is thus different from a symbol ic depic tion, like tab\u00ad lets with 10 roman numera ls, which could be seen as alluding to a genera l notion of law, not a sectarian concepti on of faith. Where the text is set out, the insistence of the religious mes\u00ad sage is hard to avoid in the absence of a context plausibly suggesti ng a message going beyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view. The display in Stone had no con\u00ad text that might have indicated an objec t beyond the religious charac ter of the text, and the Counties' solo exhibit here did noth ing more to counter the sectarian implicati on than 869 PGT: OPIN Cite S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t posti ngs at issue in Stone.16 See also County of Allegheny, supra, at 598 (\"Here, unlike in Lynch [v. Donnelly ], noth ing in the context of the display detrac ts the cre`che's re\u00ad ligious message\"). Actually, the ng by the Counties lacked even the Stone display' s implausible disclai mer that the Commandments were set out to show their effec t on the civil law.17 What is more , at the ceremony for posti ng the framed Commandments in Pulaski County , the county execu\u00ad tive was accompanied by his pastor , who testi ed to the cer\u00ad tainty of the existence of God. The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to emphasi ze and celebrate the Commandments' religious message . This is not to deny that the Commandments have had in\u00ad fluence on civil or secu lar law; a major text of a major ity religion is bound to be felt. The point is simply that the original text viewed in its entirety is an unmist akably reli\u00ad gious statement dealing with religious obligati ons with mora lity subjec t to religious tion. When the gover n\u00ad ment initiates an effor t to place this statement alone in pub\u00ad lic view, a religious objec t is unmist akable . B Once the Counties were sued, they modi ed the exhibits and invited additi onal insight into their purpose in a display that hung for about six months. This new one was the prod\u00ad uct of forthright and near ly identica l Pulaski and McCreary County resoluti ons listing a series of Amer ican histor ical documents with theistic and Christian references, which 16 Although the Counties point out that the cour thouses cont ained other displays besides the Ten Commandments, there is no suggesti on that the Commandments display was integrated to form a secu lar display . 17 In Stone, the Commandments were accompanied by a small disclai mer: \"The secu lar appl icati on of the Ten Commandments is clear ly seen in its adopti on as the fundament al legal code of Wester n Civilization and the Common Law of the United States. \" 449 U. S., at 39-40, n. 1 (inter COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t were to be posted in order to furnish a setti ng for display ing the Ten Commandments and any \"other Kentucky and religious references\" them. Def. Exh. 1, at 1. As menti oned, the resoluti ons expressed sup\u00ad port for an Alabama judge who posted the Commandments in his cour troom, and cited the fact the Kentucky Legislature once adjour ned a sessi on in honor of \"Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics.\" Id., at 2-3. In this second display , unlike the rst, the Commandments were not hung in isolati on, merely leaving the Counties' pur\u00ad pose to emerge from the pervasively religious text of the Commandments themselves. Instead, the second versi on was required to include the statement of the gover nment' s purpose expressly set out in the county resoluti ons, and underscored it by juxtaposi ng the Commandments to other documents with highlighted references to God as their sole common element. The display' s unsti nting focus was on religious passages, show ing that the Counties were posti ng the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian con\u00ad tent. That demonstrati on of the gover nment' s objec tive was enhanced by serial religious references and the accom\u00ad pany ing resoluti on's claim about the embodi ment of ethics in Christ. Together , the display and resoluti on presented an indisput able, and undisputed, show ing of an imper missible purpose . Today , the Counties make no attempt to defend their unde\u00ad niable objec tive, but instead hopefu two as \"dead and buried.\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 15. Their refusa l to defend the second display is underst andable , but the reasonable observer could not forget it. C 1 After the Counties changed lawyers, they mounted a third display , without a new resoluti on or repea l of the old one. The resu lt was the \"Foundati ons of S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ernment\" exhibit, which placed the Commandments in the company of other documents the Counties thought especia lly signicant in the histor ican gover n\u00ad ment . In trying to persuade the District Cour t to lift the preliminary injunc tion, the Counties cited severa l new pur\u00ad poses for the third versi on, includi ng a desire \"to educate the citizens of the county regardi ng some of the documents that played a signicant role in the foundati on of our system of law and gover nment. \" 18 145 F. Supp . 2d, at 848 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The Counties' claims did not, howe ver, persuade the cour t, intimately fami liar with the de\u00ad tails of this litigati on, or the Cour t of Appea ls, neither of which found a legitimizing secu lar purpose in this third ver\u00ad sion of the display . \" 'When both cour ts [that have already passed on the case] are unable to discer n an arguably valid secu lar purpose , this Cour t normally shou ld hesit ate to nd one.' \" Edwards, 482 U. S., at 594, n. 15 (quoti ng Wallace, 472 U. S., at 66 (Powel l, J., concurr ing)). The conclusi ons of the two cour ts precedi ng us in this case are well warranted. These new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigati ng positi on, there being no further author izing ac\u00ad tion by the Counties' gover ning boards. And although re\u00ad peal of the earlier county author izations would not have erased them from the record of evidence bear ing on current purpose ,19 the extraordi nary resoluti ons for the second dis\u00ad play passed just months earlier were not repea led or other\u00ad 18 The Counties' other purposes were: \"to erec t a display cont aining the Ten Commandments that is consti\u00ad tutional;...t o demonstrate that the Ten Commandments were part of the foundati on of Amer ican Law and Gover nment; . . . [to include the Ten Commandments ] as part of the display for their signicance in prov id\u00ad ing 'the mora l background of the Declarati on of Independence and the foundati on of our legal traditi on.' \" 145 F. Supp . 2d, at 848 (some inter nal quot ation marks omitted). 19 Following argument in this case , in which the resoluti ons were dis\u00ad cussed, the McCreary and Pulaski County Boards did repea l the resolu\u00ad tions, acts of obviously minimal signicance in the COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t wise repudiated.20 Indeed, the sectarian spirit of the com\u00ad mon resoluti on found enhanced expressi on in the third display , which quoted more of the purely religious lang uage of the Commandments than the rst two displays had done; for additi ons, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a (\"I the LORD thy God am a jealous God\") (text of Second Commandment in third display); (\"the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain\") (text of Third Commandment); and (\"that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee\") (text of Fifth Commandment). No reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Coun\u00ad ties had cast off the objec tive so unmist akable in the earlier displays. Nor did the selec tion of posted mater ial suggest a clear theme that might prevail over evidence of the conti nuing religious objec t. In a collection of documents said to be \"foundati onal\" to Amer ican gover nment, it is at least odd to include a patr iotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most signic ant structural provision adopted since the original Frami ng. And it is no less baf\u00ad fling to leave out the original Constituti on of 1787 while quoti ng the 1215 Mag na Carta even to the point of its decla\u00ad ration that \"sh-weirs shall be removed from the Thames. \" Id., at 205a, \u00b6 33. If an observer found these choices and omissi ons perplexi ng in isolati on, he would be puzzled for a 20 The Counties argue that the objec tive observer would not conti nue to believe that the resoluti on was in effec t after the third display went up because the resoluti on author ized only the second display . But the resolu\u00ad tion on its face is not limited to any particular display . On the contrary , it encourages the creati on of a display with the Ten Commandments that also includes such documents as \"the Nati . without censorsh ip be\u00ad of any Christian or religious references. \" Def. Exh. 1, at 1. The third display cont ains all of these documents, suggesti ng that it fell within the resoluti ons as well. The record does not indicate whether the resolu\u00ad tions were posted with U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t different reason when he read the Declarati on of Independ\u00ad ence seek ing conr mati on explana\u00ad tion that the Ten Commandments' \"influence is clear ly seen in the Declarati on,\" id., at 180a; in fact the observer would nd that the Commandments are sanc tioned as divine imper\u00ad atives, while the Declarati on of Independence holds that the author ity of gover nment to enforce the law derives \"from the consent of the gover ned, \" id., at 190a.21 If the observer had not thrown up his hands, he would probably suspec t that the Counties were simply reach ing for any way to keep a religious document on the walls of cour thouses constituti on\u00ad ally required to embody religious neutra In holdi ng the preliminary injunction adequately sup\u00ad ported by evidence that the Counties' purpose had not changed at the third stage, we do not decide that the Coun\u00ad 21 The Counties have now backed away from their broad asser tion that the Commandments prov ide \"the\" mora l background of the Declarati on of Independence , and now merely claim that many of the Commandments \"regardi ng murder , proper ty, theft, coveti ng, marr iage, rest from labor and honor ing parents are compatible with the rights to life, liberty and happi ness. \" Brief for Petitioners 10, n. 7. 22 The Counties grasp at McGowan v. Mar yland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), but it bears little resemblance to this case. As noted supra, at 861, McGowan held that religious purposes behind centur ies-old predecessors of Maryland' s Sunday laws were not dispositive of the purposes of moder n Sunday laws, where the legislature had removed much of the religious reference in the laws and stated secu lar and prag matic justi cati ons for them. 366 U. S., at 446-452. But a conclusi on that centur ies-old pur\u00ad poses may no longer be operative says noth ing about the relevance of recent evidence of purpose , and this case is far more like Santa Fe, with its evoluti on of a school footba ll game prayer policy over the course of a single lawsuit. Like that case , \"[t]his [one] comes to us as the latest step in developi ng litigati on brought as prac tices that unquesti onably violated the Establishment Clause .\" 530 U. S., at 315 (descr ibing the evoluti on of the school distr ict's footba ll prayer policy). Thus, as in Santa Fe, it makes sense to exami ne the Counties' latest action \"in COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t ties' past actions forever taint any effor t on their part to deal with the subjec t matter . We hold only that purpose needs to be taken seriously under the Establishment Clause and needs to be understood in light of context; an implausible claim that gover nment al purpose has changed shou ld not carry the day in a cour t of law any more than in a head with common sense . It is enough to say here that distr ict cour ts are fully capable of adjusti ng preliminary relief to take ac\u00ad count in constituti onally signicant condi\u00ad tions. See Ashcro ft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656 (2004). Nor do we have occasi on here to hold that a sacred text can never be integrated constituti onally into a gover nment al display on the subjec t of law, or Amer ican history . We do not forget, and in this litigati on have frequently been re\u00ad minded, that our own cour troom frieze was deliberately de\u00ad signed in the exercise of gover nment al author ity so as to include the gure of Moses holdi ng tablets exhibiting a por\u00ad tion of the the later , secu larly phrased Com\u00ad mandments; in the lawg ivers, most of them secu lar gures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the Nati lity as an inter pretive guide is no less true now than it was when the Cour t broached the principle in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), and a word needs to be said about the different view taken in today' s dissent. We all agree , of course , on the need for some inter pret ative help. The First Amendment cont ains no textua l denition of \"establishment, \" and the 23 The dissent notes that another depic tion of Moses and the Command\u00ad ments ador ns this Cour t's east pedi ment. Post, at 906. But as with the cour troom frieze, Moses is found in the company of other gures, not only great but secu Cite U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t term is certainly not self-de ning. No one contends that the proh ibition of establishment stops at a desig nation of a na\u00ad tional (or with Fourteenth Amendment incor porati on, Cant\u00ad well v. Connec ticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940), a state) church, but noth ing in the text says just how much more it covers. There is no simple answer , for more than one reason. The proh ibition on establishment covers a variety of issues from prayer in widely vary ing gover nment setti ngs, to \u00ad nancia l aid indiv idua ls and instituti ons, to com\u00ad ment on religious questi ons. In these varied setti ngs, issues of inter preti ng inexac t Establishment lang lt inter pret ative ng values, each constituti onally respec table, but none open to realization to the logical limit. The First Amendment has not one but two clauses tied to \"religion,\" the second forbiddi ng any proh ibition on \"the free exercise thereof, the two clauses compete: spendi ng gover on the clerg estab\u00ad lishing religion, but if the gover nment cannot pay for mili\u00ad tary chaplai ns a good many soldiers and sailors would be kept from the oppor tunity to exercise their chosen religions. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 719 (2005). At other times, limits on gover nment al action that might make sense as a way to avoid establishment could arguably limit freedom of speech when the speak ing is done under gover nment aus\u00ad pices. Rosenbe rger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). The dissent, then, is wrong to read cases like Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970), as a rejection of neutra lity on its own terms, post, at 891-892, for tradeoffs are inevitable, and an elegant inter pret ative rule to draw the line in all the multifarious situati ons is not to be had. Given the variety of inter pret ative problems, the principle of neutra lity has good sense of direc tion: the gov\u00ad ernment may not favor one religion over another , or religion over irrel igion, religious choice being v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t vidua ls under the Free Exercise Clause . The principle has been helpfu l simply because it responds to one of the major concer ns that prompted adopti on of the Religion Clauses. The Framers and the citizens of their time intended not only to protec t the integr ity of indiv idua l conscience in religious matters, Wallace, 472 U. S., at 52-54, and n. 38, but to guard against the civic divisiveness that follows when the gover n\u00ad ment weighs in on one side of religious debate; noth ing does a better job of roiling society , a point that needed no expla\u00ad nation to the descendants of English Puritans and Cava liers (or Massachusetts Puritans and Baptists). E. g., Everson, supra, at 8 (\"A large propor tion of the early settlers of this country came here from Europe to escape [religious persecu\u00ad tion]\"). A sense of the past thus points gover nment al neutra lity as an objec tive of the Establishment Clause , and a sensible standard for apply ing it. To be sure , given its genera lity as a principle , an appea l to neutra lity alone cannot possibly lay every issue to rest, or tell us what issues on the marg ins are subst antia l enough for constituti onal signi\u00ad cance , point that has been clear from the foundi ng era to moder n times. E. g., Letter from J. Madison to R. Adams (1832), in 5 The Founders' Constituti on 107 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987) (\"[In calling for separati on] I must admit moreover that it may not be easy , in every possible case , to trace the line of separati on between the rights of religion and the Civil author ity with such disti nctness as to avoid collisions & doubts on unessentia points\"); Sherbert v. Verner, is not so narrow a channel that the slightest deviation from an absolutely straight course leads to condemnati on\"). But invoking neu\u00ad trality is a prudent way of keepi ng sight of someth ing the Framers of the First Amendment thought impor tant. The dissent, howe ver, puts forward a limitation on the ap\u00ad plicati on of the neutra lity principle , with citations to histor i\u00ad cal evidence said to show that the Framers understood the 877 545US2 Unit: $U78 [03-28-08 15:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 844 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ban on establishment of religion as sufciently narrow to allow the gover nment to espouse submissi on to the divine will. The dissent identi es God as the God of monotheism, all of whose three principa l strai ns (Jewish, Christian, and Musl im) acknowledge the religious impor tance of the Ten Commandments. Post, at 893-894. On the dissent' s view, it apparently follows that even rigorous espousa l of a com\u00ad mon element of this common monotheism is consistent with the establishment ban. But the dissent' s argument for the original underst andi ng is flawed from the outset by its failure to consider the full range of evidence show ing what the Framers believed. The dissent is certainly correc t in putti ng forward evidence that some of the Framers thought some endorsement of religion was compatible with the establishment ban; the dissent quotes the rst President as stating that \"[n]ational mora lity [cannot ] prevail in exclusi on of religious principle ,\" for exam\u00ad ple, post, at 887 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted), and it cites his rst Thanksg iving proclamati on giving thanks to God, post, at 886-887. Surely if expressi ons like these from Washington and his contemporar ies were all we had to go on, there would be a good case that the neutra lity principle has the effec t of broadeni ng ban on establishment beyond the Framers' underst andi ng of it (although there would, of course , still be the questi on of whether the histor ical case could overcome some 60 years of precedent taking neutra lity as its guiding principle).24 24 The dissent also maintains that our precedents show that a solo dis\u00ad play of the Commandments is a mere acknowledg ment of religion \"on par with the inclusi on of a cre`che or a menorah\" in a holiday display , or an ofcia l's speech or prayer , post, at 905. Whether or not our views would differ about the signicance of those prac tices if we were consider ing them as original matters, they mani fest no objec tive of subjec ting indiv idua l lives to religious influence comparable to the apparent and openly acknowl\u00ad edged purpose behind posti ng the Commandments. Cre`ches placed with holiday symbols and prayers by legislators do not insistently call for reli\u00ad gious action on the part of COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t But the fact is that we do have more to go on, for there is also evidence suppor ting the propositi on that the Framers intended the Establishment Clause to require gover nment al neutra lity in neutra lity in statements acknowledg ing religion. The very lang uage of the Establishment Clause represented a signicant depar\u00ad ture from early single na\u00ad instead genera l.\" See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.

Miller (Jan. 23, 1808), in 5 The Found\u00ad ers' Constituti on, supra, at 98. And Madison, whom the dissent claims as suppor ting its thesis, post, at 888, criticized Virginia's genera l assessment tax not just because it re\u00ad quired people to donate \"three pence\" to religion, but be\u00ad cause \"it is itself a signal of persecuti on.

Perry, ante, at 724-725 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng).25 The fair inference is that there was no common under\u00ad standi ng about the limits of the establishment proh ibition, and the dissent' s conclusi on that its narrower view was the original underst andi ng, post, at 886-888, stretches the evi\u00ad dence beyond tensi le capacity . What the evidence does show is a group of statesmen, like others before and after them, who proposed a guarantee with contours not whol ly worked out, leaving the Establishment Clause with edges still to be deter mined. And none the worse for that. Inde\u00ad terminate edges are the kind to have in a constituti on meant to endure , and to meet \"exigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly, and which can be best prov ided for as they occur .\" McCull och v. Mar yland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819). While the dissent fails to show a consistent original under\u00ad standi ng from which to argue that the neutra lity principle shou ld be rejected, it does manage to deliver a surprise. As menti oned, the dissent says that the deity the Framers had in mind was the God of monotheism, with the consequence that gover nment may espouse a tenet of traditi onal monothe\u00ad ism. This is truly a remarkable view. Other Members of the Cour t have dissented on the ground that the Establish\u00ad ment Clause bars noth ing more than gover nment al prefer\u00ad ence for one religion over another , e. g., Wallace, 472 U. S., at 98-99 (Rehnquist , J., dissenti ng), but at least religion has previously been treated inclusively . Today' s dissent, how\u00ad 25 The dissent cites mater ial suggesti ng that separati onists like Jefferson and Madison were not absolutely consistent in abst aining from ofcia l reli\u00ad gious acknowledg ment. Post, But, a record of inconsistent his\u00ad torical prac tice is too weak a lever to upset decades of precedent adher ing to the neutra lity principle . And it is worth noting that Jefferson thought his actions were consistent with nonendorsement of religion and Madison regretted any backsl iding he may have done . Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 622-625 (1992) (Souter, J., concurr ing). \"Homer nodded. \" Id., at 624, n. 5 (correc ted in erratum at 535 PAGES COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Opinion of the Cour t ever, apparently means that gover nment shou ld be free to approve the core beliefs of a favored religion over the tenets of others, a view that shou ld trouble anyone who prizes reli\u00ad gious liberty. Certainly justi fy it; on the con\u00ad trary , history shows that the religion of concer n to the Fram\u00ad ers was not that of the monotheistic faiths genera lly, but Christianity in particular, a fact that no Member of this Cour t takes as a premise for constr uing the Religion Clauses. Justice Story probably reflec ted the thinking of the frami ng generati on when he wrote in his Comment aries that the purpose of the Clause was \"not to countenance , much less to advance , Mahomet or Judaism, or indel\u00ad ity, by prostrati ng Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects.\" R. Cord, Separati on of Church and State: Histor ical Fact and Current Fiction 13 (1988) (empha\u00ad sis deleted). The Framers would, therefore , almost cer\u00ad that because Christianity was a monotheistic \"religion,\" monotheism with Mosaic antecedents shou ld be a touchstone of establishment inter pret ation.26 Even on originalist critiques of existi ng precedent there is, it seems, no escape from inter pret ative consequences that would surprise the Framers. Thus, it ap\u00ad pears to be common ground in the inter pret ation of a Consti\u00ad tution \"intended to endure for ages to come ,\" McCull och v. 26 There might, indeed, even have been some reservati ons about mono\u00ad theism as the paradig m example . It is worth noting that the canonica l biography of George Washington, the dissent' s primary exemplar of the monotheistic traditi on, calls him a deist. J. Ang (1793 -1799), p. 490 (1972) (\"Washington's religious belief was that of the enlightenment: deism\"). It would have been odd for the First Congress to propose an Amendment with Religion Clauses that took no account of the President' s religion. As with other histor ical matters pertinent here , howe ver, iser, ing George Washington 146 (1996) (\"Washington's God was no watchmaker \"). History writ small does not give clear and certain answers to questi ons about the limits of \"reli\u00ad 844 (2005) O'Connor, J., concurr ing Mar yland, supra, at 415, that appl icati ons unanticipated by the Framers are inevitable. Histor ical evidence thus suppor ts no solid argument for chang ing course (whate ver force the argument might have when direc ted at the existi ng precedent), whereas publ ic dis\u00ad course at the present time certainly raises no doubt about the value of the inter pret ative approach invoked for 60 years now. We are centur ies away from the St. Bartholomew' s Day massacre and the treatment of heretics in early Massa\u00ad chusetts, but the divisiveness of religion in current publ ic life is inescapable . This is no time to deny the prudence of underst andi ng the Establishment Clause to require the gover nment to stay neutra l on religious belief, which is re\u00ad served for the conscience of the indiv idua l. V Given the ample suppor t for the District Cour t's nding of a predomi nantly religious purpose behind the Counties' third display , we afrm the Sixth Circuit in upholdi ng the prelimi\u00ad nary injunc tion. It is so ordered. Justice O'Connor, concurr ing. I join in the Cour t's opinion. The First Amendment ex\u00ad presses our Nati on's fundament al commitment to religious liberty by means of two prov isions\u2014one protec ting the free exercise of religion, the other barr ing establishment of reli\u00ad gion. They were written by the descendents of people who had come to this land precisely so that they could prac tice their religion freely . Together with the other First Amend\u00ad ment guarantees\u2014of free speech, a free press, and the rights to assemble and petiti on\u2014the Religion Clauses were de\u00ad signed to safeg uard the freedom of conscience and belief that those immigrants had sought. They embody an idea that was once considered radica l: Free people are entitled v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. O'Connor, J., concurr ing and diverse thoughts, which gover nment ought neither to constrai n nor to direc t. Reasonable minds can disagree about how to apply the Re\u00ad ligion Clauses in a given case. But the goal of the Clauses is clear: to carry out the Founders' plan of preserv ing religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a plura listic society . By enforci ng the Clauses, we have kept religion a matter for the indiv idua l conscience , not for the prosecutor or bureau\u00ad crat. At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the assumpti on of religious author ity by gover nment, Amer icans may count themselves fortunate: Our regard for constituti onal boundar ies has protec ted us from similar travai ls, while allowing private religious exer\u00ad cise to flour ish. The well-known statement that \"[w]e are a religious people ,\" Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313 (1952), has proved true. Amer icans attend their places of worsh ip more often than do citizens of other developed na\u00ad tions, R. Fowler , A. Hertzke , & L. Olson, Religion and Poli\u00ad tics in Amer ica 28-29 (2d ed. 1999), and descr ibe religion as play ing an especia lly impor tant role in their lives, Pew Globa l Attitudes Projec t, Among Wealthy Nati ons . . . U. S. Stands Alone in its Embrace of Religion (Dec. 19, 2002). Those who would renegotiate the boundar ies between church and state must therefore answer a difcu lt questi on: Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poor ly? Our guiding principle has been James Madison' s\u2014that \"[t]he Religion...o fevery man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man. \" Memor ial and Remonstrance Agai nst Religious Assessments, 2 Writings of James Madi\u00ad son 183, 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901) (herei nafter Memor ial). To that end, we have held that the guarantees of religious free\u00ad dom protec t citizens from religious incursi ons by the States as well as by the Federa l Gover nment. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16 (1947); Cantwell v. Connec ti\u00ad cut, 310 U. S. U. S. 844 (2005) O'Connor, J., concurr ing son into worsh iping against her ibit her from worsh iping accordi ng to it. It may not prefer one religion over another or promote religion over nonbel ief. Everson, supra, at 15-16. It may not entangle itself with religion. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 674 (1970). And gover nment may not, by or a religious prac tice,\" \"mak[ e] to religion relevant to a person' s standi ng in the politica l community .\" Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 69 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment). When we enforce these restr ictions, we do so for the same reason that guided the Framers\u2014respec t for religion's spe\u00ad cial role in society . Our Founders conceived of a Republ ic receptive to volunt ary religious expressi on, and ided for ary reli\u00ad gious belief and expressi on may be as threatened when gov\u00ad ernment takes the mantle of religion upon itself as when gover nment direc tly inter feres with private religious prac\u00ad tices. When the gover nment associates one set of religious beliefs with the state and identi es nonadherents as out\u00ad siders, it encroaches upon the indiv idua l's decisi on about whether and how to worsh ip. In the marketplace of ideas, the gover nment has vast resources and specia l status. Gov\u00ad ernment religious expressi on therefore risks crowdi ng out private observance and distor ting the natura l inter play be\u00ad tween competi ng beliefs. Allowing gover nment po\u00ad tentia l mouthpiece for competi ng religious ideas risks the sort of division that might easily spill over into suppressi on of rival beliefs. Tying secu lar and religious author ity to\u00ad gether poses risks to both. Given the history of this particular display of the Ten Commandments, the Cour t correc tly nds an Establishment Clause violati on. See ante, at 867-873. The purpose be\u00ad hind the counties' display is relevant because it conveys an unmist akable message of endorsement to 15:55:40] PAGES COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. O'Connor, J., concurr ing server . See Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S. 668, 690 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing). It is true that many Amer icans nd the Commandments in accord with their persona l beliefs. But we do not count heads before enforci ng the First Amendment. See West Virg inia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943) (\"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw cer\u00ad tain subjec ts from the vicissitudes of politica l controversy , to place them beyond the reach of major ities and ofcia ls and to establish them as legal principles to be appl ied by the cour ts\"). Nor can we accept the theory that Amer icans who do not accept the Commandments' validity are outside the First Amendment' s protec tions. There is no list of approved and disapproved beliefs appended to the First Amendment \u2014and the Amendment' s broad terms (\"free ex\u00ad ercise ,\" \"establishment, \" \"religion\") do not admit of such a cramped readi ng. It is true that the Framers lived at a time when our national religious diversity was neither as robust nor as well recog nized as it is now. They may not have fore\u00ad seen the variety of religions for which this Nati on would eventua lly prov ide a home . They surely could not have pre\u00ad dicted new religions, some of them born in this country . But they did know that line-draw ing between religions is an enter prise that, once begun, has no logical stoppi ng point. They worr ied that \"the same author ity which can establish Christianity , in exclusi on of all other Religions, may estab\u00ad lish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusi on of all other Sects.\" Memor ial 186. The Religion Clauses, as a resu lt, protec t adherents of all religions, as well as those who believe in no religion at all. * * * We owe our First Amendment to a generati on with a pro\u00ad found commitment to religion and a profound commitment to religious liberty\u2014v isionar ies who held their faith \"with enough condence to believe that what shou ld OPIN S. 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng to God does not need to be decided and collected by Caesar .\" Zorach, 343 U.

Chambe rs, the Cour t upheld the Nebraska State Legislature' s prac tice of paying a chaplai n to lead it in prayer at the openi ng of legislative sessi ons. The Cour t explai ned that \"[t]o invoke Divine guidance on a publ ic body entr usted with mak ing the laws is not ...a n 'establishment' of religion or a step toward establishment; it is simply a tolerable ac\u00ad knowledg ment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country .\" 463 U. S., at 792. (Why, one wonders, is not respec t for the Ten Commandments a tolerable acknowl\u00ad edgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country?) The only \"good reason\" for ignoring the neutra lity princi\u00ad ple set forth in any of these cases was the antiquity of the prac tice at issue . See id., at 786-792, 794; Walz, supra, at 676-680. That would be a good reason for nding the neu\u00ad trality principle a mist aken inter pret ation of the Constitu\u00ad tion, but it is hardly a good reason for letting an unconstitu\u00ad tional prac tice conti nue. We did not hide behind that reason in Reyno lds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), which found un\u00ad constituti onal bicamera l state legislatures of a sort that had existed since the beginning of the Republ ic. And almost month ly, it seems, the Cour t has not shrunk from invalidat\u00ad ing aspec ts of criminal procedure and penolog y of similar vintage. See, e. g., Deck v. Missouri, 544 U. S. 622, 633 (2005) (invalidati ng prac at 641-645 (Thomas, J., dissent\u00ad ing); Roper v. Simmo ns, 543 U. S.

Besides appea ling to the demonstrably false principle that the gover nment cannot favor religion over irrel igion, today' s opinion suggests that the posti ng of the Ten Commandments violates the principle that the gover nment cannot favor one religion over another . See ante, at 868; see also Van Orden, ante, at 717-718 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). That is indeed a valid principle where publ ic aid or assist ance to religion is concer ned, see Zelman v. Simmo ns-Harris, 536 U. S. 639, 652 (2002), or where the free exercise of religion is at issue , Church of Lukumi Baba lu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 532-533 (1993); id., at 557-558 (Scalia, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment), but it necessar ily appl ies in a more limited sense to publ ic acknowledg ment of the Cre\u00ad ator. If religion in the publ ic forum had to be entirely non\u00ad denomi national, there could be no religion in the publ ic forum at all. One cannot say the word \"God, \" or \"the Al\u00ad mighty ,\" one cannot offer publ ic suppl icati on or thanksg iv\u00ad ing, without contradic ting the beliefs of some people that there are many gods, or that God or the gods pay no atten\u00ad tion to human affairs. With respec t to publ ic acknowledg\u00ad ment of religious belief, it is entirely clear from our Nati on's histor ical prac tices that the Establishment Clause permits this disregard of polytheists and believers in unconcer ned deities, just as it permits the disregard of devout atheists. The Thanksg iving Proclamati on issued by George Washing\u00ad ton at the instance of the First Congress was scrupulously nondenomi national\u2014but it was monotheistic.3 In Marsh v. lieve that \"the deity the Framers had in mind\" (presumably in all the instances of invocati on of the deity I have cited) \"was the of COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng Chambe rs, supra, we said that the fact the particular pray\u00ad ers offered in the Nebraska Legislature were \"in the Judeo- Christian traditi on,\" id., at 793, posed no additi onal problem, because \"there is no indicati on that the prayer oppor tunity has been exploited to proselyti ze or advance any one, or to disparage any other , faith or belief,\" id., at 794-795. Histor ical thus there is a dis\u00ad tance between the acknowledg ment of a single Creator and the establishment of a religion. The former is, as Marsh v. Chambe rs put it, \"a tolerable acknowledg ment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country .\" Id., at 792. The three most popu lar religions in the United States, Chris\u00ad tianity , Judaism, and Islam\u2014wh ich combi ned account for 97.7% of all believers\u2014are monotheistic. See U. S. Dept. of Commerce , Bureau of Census, Statistica l Abstrac t of the United States: 2004 -2005, p. 55 (124th ed. 2004) (Table No. 67).

See 13 Encyclo\u00ad pedia of Religion 9074 nguishable , insofar as other religions is concer ned, from publ honor ing God. Both prac tices are recog nized across such a broad and diverse range of the popu lation\u2014from Christians to Mus\u00ad lims\u2014that they cannot be reasonably understood as a gov\u00ad ernment endorsement of a particular religious viewpoi nt.4 ism.\" at 879. This reac tion would be more comprehensible if the Cour t could suggest what other God (in the singular, and with a capit al G) there is, other than \"the God of monotheism. \" This is not necessar ily the Christian God (though if it were , one would expec t Christ regularly to be invoked, which He is not); but it is inescapably the God of monotheism. 4 This is not to say that a display of the Ten Commandments could never constitute an imper missible endorsement of a particular religious view. The Establishment Clause would proh ibit, for example , gover nment al of the Decalogue as author itative . Here the display of the Ten Commandments alongside eight secu lar documents, 895 OPIN S. 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng B A few remarks are necessary in response to the criticism of this dissent by the Cour t, as well as Justice Stevens' criticism in the related case of Van Orden v. Perry, ante, p. 707. Justice Stevens ' writing is largely devoted to an attack upon a straw man. \"[R]eliance on early religious proclamati ons and statements made by the Founders is... problematic, \" he says, \"because those views were not es\u00ad poused at the Constituti onal Conventi shrined in the Constituti on's text. \" Van Orden, ante, at 724 (dissenti ng opinion) (footnote omitted). But I have not re\u00ad lied upon (as he and the Cour t in this case do) mere \"procla\u00ad mati ons and statements\" of the Founders. I have relied pri\u00ad marily upon ofcia l acts and ofcia l proclamati ons of the United States or of the component branches of its Gover n\u00ad ment, includi ng the First Congress' s beginning of the tradi\u00ad tion of legislative prayer to God, its appoi ntment of congres\u00ad sional chaplai iving Proclamati on, and tment Terri\u00ad tory Ordi nance; our s Thanksg iv\u00ad ing Proclamati on; and invocati on of God at the openi ng of sessi ons of the Supreme Cour t. The only mere \"proclama\u00ad tions and statements\" of the Founders I have relied upon were statements of Founders who occupied federa l ofce , and spoke in at least a quasi-ofcia l capacity\u2014W ashington's prayer at the openi ng of his Presidency and his Farewel l Address, President John Adams' letter to the Massachusetts Militia, and Jefferson' s and Madison' s inaug ural addresses. The Cour t and Justice Stevens, by contrast, appea l to no ofcia l or even quasi-ofcia l action in suppor t of their view of the Establishment Clause \u2014only James Madison' s Memo\u00ad rial and Remonstrance Agai nst Religious Assessments, writ\u00ad ten before the Federa l Constituti on had even been proposed, and the plaque' s explanati on for their inclusi on, make clear that they were not posted to take sides in a theolog COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng two letters written by Madison long after he was President, and the quasi-ofcia l inaction of Thomas Jefferson in refus\u00ad ing to issue a Thanksg iving Proclamati on. See ante, at 878- at 724-725 (Stevens, J., dissenti ng). The Madison Memor ial and Remonstrance , dealing as it does with enforced contr ibuti on to religion rather than publ ic ac\u00ad knowledg ment of God, is irrele of the letters is ut\u00ad terly ambig uous as to the point at issue here , and shou ld not be read to contradic t Madison' s statements in his rst inaug ural address, quoted earlier; even the other letter does not disapprove publ ic acknowledg ment of God, unless one posits (what Madison' s own actions as President would con\u00ad tradic t) that reference to God contradic ts \"the equa lity of all religious sects.\" See Letter from James Madison to Ed\u00ad ward Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitu\u00ad tion 105-106 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987). And as to Jefferson: The notor iously self-contradic ting Jefferson did not choose to have his nonauthorsh ip of a Thanksg did have in\u00ad scribed was his authorsh ip of the Virginia Statute for Reli\u00ad gious Freedom, a gover nment al act which begins \"Whereas, Almighty God hath created the mind free . . . .\" Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-1 (Lexis 2003). It is no answer for Justice Stevens to say that the un\u00ad derst andi ng that these ofcia was not ined in the Constituti \" Van Orden, ante, at 724 (dissenti ng opinion). The Establishment Clause , upon which Justice Stevens would rely, was en\u00ad shrined in the Constituti on's text, and these ofcia l actions show what it mean t. There were doubtless some who thought it shou ld have a broader meani ng, but those views were plainly rejected. Justice Stevens says that reliance on these actions is \"bound to paint a misleadi ng picture ,\" ibid., but it is hard to see why. What is more probative of the meani ng of the Establishment Clause S. 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng the very Congress that proposed it, and of the rst President charged with observ ing it? Justice Stevens also appea ls to the undoubted fact that some in the foundi ng generati on thought that the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment shou ld have a narrower meani ng, protec ting only the Christian religion or perhaps only Protest antism. See Van Orden, ante, at 725-728. I am at a loss to see how this helps his case , except by pro\u00ad viding a cloud of obfuscati ng smoke . (Since most thought the Clause permitted gover nment invocati on of monotheism, and some others thought it permitted gover nment invocati on of Christianity , he proposes that it be constr ued not to per\u00ad mit any gover nment invocati on of religion at all.) At any rate, those narrower views of the Establishment Clause were as clear ly rejected as the more expansive ones. Washing\u00ad ton's First Thanksg iving Proclamati on is merely an example . All of the actions of Washington and the First Congress upon which I have relied, virtually all Thanksg iving Proclama\u00ad tions throughout our history ,5 and all the other examples of our Gover nment' s favor ing religion that I have cited, have invoked God, but not Jesus Christ.6 Rather than relying 5 The two excepti ons are the March 23, 1798, proclamati on of John Adams, which asks God \"freely to remit all our offenses\" World,\" and the November 17, 1972, proclamati on of Richard Nixon, which stated, \"From Moses at the Red Sea to Jesus prepar ing to feed the multitudes, the Scriptures summon us to words and deeds of gratitude , even before divine blessi ngs are fully perceived, \" Presidentia l Proclamati on No. 4170, 37 Fed. Reg. 24647 (1972). 6 Justice Stevens nds that Presidentia l inaug ural and farewel l speeches (which are the only speeches upon which I have relied) do not violate the Establishment Clause only because everyone knows that they express the persona l religious views of the speaker , and not gover nment policy. See Van Orden v. Perry, ante, at 723 (dissenti ng opinion). This is a pecu liar stance for one who has voted that a student-led invocati on at a high school footba ll game and a rabbi-led invocati on at a high school graduati on did constitute the sort of gover nment al endorsement of reli\u00ad gion that the Establishment Clause forbids. See COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng upon Justice Stevens ' assurance that \"[t]he original under\u00ad standi ng of constitu\u00ad tional protec tion Clause likely did not includ e...f ollowers of Judaism and Islam, \" Van Orden, ante, at 728; see also ante, at 880, I would prefer to take the word of George Washington, who, in his famous Letter to the Hebrew Congregati on of Newpor t, Rhode Island, wrote: \"All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizensh ip. It is now no more that tolerati on is spo\u00ad ken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people , that another enjoyed the exercise of their inher\u00ad ent natura l rights. \" 6 The Papers of George Washing\u00ad ton, Presidentia l Series 285 (D. Twohig ed. 1996). The letter concluded, by the way, with an invocati on of the one God: \"May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our severa l vocati ons usefu l here , and in his own due time and way everlasti ngly happy .\" Ibid. Justice Stevens says that if one is serious about follow\u00ad ing the original underst andi ng of the Establishment Clause , he must repudiate its incor porati on into the Fourteenth Amendment, and hold that it does not apply against the States. See Van Orden, ante, at 729-731 (dissenti ng opin\u00ad ion). This is more smoke . Justice Stevens did not feel that way last Term, when he joined an opinion insisti ng upon the original meani ng of the Confront ation Clause , but none\u00ad theless apply ing it against the State of Washington. See Crawfo rd v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004). The notion that incor porati on empties meani ng has no suppor t in either reason or precedent. Scho ol Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290 (2000); Lee v.

This is not the place to debate the merits of the \"living Constituti on,\" though I ation from McCull och v. Mar yland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407 (1819), refutes rather than suppor ts that ap\u00ad proach.7 Even assumi the meani of the ought to change to \"democratic aspi\u00ad rations,\" why are those aspirati ons to be found in Justices' notions of what the Establishment Clause ought to mean, rather than in the democratica lly adopted dispositi ons of our current society? As I have observed above , numerous pro\u00ad visions of our laws and numerous conti nuing prac tices of our people demonstrate that the gover nment' s invocati on of God (and hence the gover nment' s invocati on tionable by Congress almost unani mously less than three years ago, stating that \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is con\u00ad stituti onal, see 116 Stat. 2058. To ignore all this is not to give effec t to \"democratic aspirati ons\" but to frustrate them. Finally, I must respond to Justice Stevens ' asser tion that I would \"marg inaliz[e] the belief systems of more than 7 million Amer icans\" who adhere to religions that are not monotheistic. Van Orden, ante, at 719, n. 18 (dissenti ng opinion). Surely that is a gross exaggerati on. The beliefs of those citizens are entirely protec ted by the Free Exercise Clause , and by those aspec ts of the Establishment Clause that do not relate to gover nment acknowledg ment of the Creator . Invocati on of God despite their beliefs is per\u00ad mitted not because nonmonotheistic religions cease to be religions recog nized by the Religion Clauses of the First 7 See Scalia, Originalism: The Lesser Evil, 57 Cincinnati L. Rev. 849, COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng Amendment, but because gover nment al invocati on of God is not an establishment. Justice Stevens fails to recog nize that in the context of publ ic acknowledg ments of God there are legitimate compe ting interests: On the one hand, the in\u00ad terest of that minority in not feeling \"excluded\"; but on the other , the interest of the over whelmi ng major ity of religious believers in being able to give God thanks and suppl icati on as a people, and with respec t to our national endeavors. Our national traditi on has resolved that confl ict in favor of the major ity.8 It is not for this Cour t to change a dispositi on that accounts, many Amer icans think, for the phenomenon remarked upon in a quot ation attributed to various authors, includi ng Bismarck, but which I prefer to associate with Char les de Gaulle: \"God watches over little children, drunk\u00ad ards, and the United States of Amer ica.\" II As bad as the Lemo n test is, it is worse for the fact that, since its incepti on, its seemi ngly simple mandates have been manipu lated to t whate ver resu lt the Cour t aimed to achieve. Today' s opinion is no different. In two respec ts it modi es Lemo n reli\u00ad gion. the justi es inquiry into legislative pur\u00ad pose , not as an end itself, but as a means to ascer tain the appearance of the gover nment action to an \" 'objec tive ob\u00ad server .' \" Ante, at 862.

But Justice O'Connor joined the opinion of the Cour t in Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U.

Under this approach, even if a gover nment could show that its ac\u00ad tual purpose was not to advance religion, it would presum\u00ad ably violate the Constituti on as long as the Cour t's objec tive observer would think other wise. See Capitol Square Re\u00ad view and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 776-777 (1995) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment) (stating that \"when the reasonable observer would view duty to hold the prac tice invalid,\" even if the law at issue was neutra l and the benet conferred on the religious entity was incident al). I have remarked before that it is an odd jurisprudence that bases the unconstituti onality of a gover nment prac tice that does not actually advance religion on the hopes of the gov\u00ad ernment that it would do so. See Edwards, 482 U. S., at 639. But that oddity pales in compar ison to the one invited by today' s analysis: the legitimacy of a gover nment action with a whol ly secu lar effec t would turn on the mispe rception an inary observer that the gover nment ofcia ls be\u00ad hind the action had the intent to advance religion. Second, the Cour t replaces Lemo n's requirement that the gover nment have \"a secu lar...p urpose ,\" 403 U. S., at 612 (emphasis added), with the heightened requirement that the secu lar purpose \"predomi nate\" over any purpose to advance religion. Ante, at 864-865. The Cour t treats this exten\u00ad sion as a natura l outgrowth of the longst andi ng requirement that the gover nment' s secu lar purpose not be a sham, but simple logic shows the two to be unrelated. If the gover n\u00ad ment' s proffered secu lar purpose is not genui ne, then the gover nment has no secu lar purpose at all. The new demand that secu lar purpose predomi nate contradic ts Lemo n's more limited requirement, and nds no suppor t in our cases.

Arkan sas, 393 97, 107-109 (1968). In Edwards, supra, the Cour t did say that the state action was invalid because its \"primary\" or \"preemi nent\" purpose was to advance a particular religious belief, 482 U. S., at 590, 593, 594, but that statement was unnecessary to the resu lt, since the Cour t rejected the State's only proffered secu lar purpose as a sham. See id., at 589. I have urged that Lemo n's purpose prong be abandoned, because (as I have discussed in Part I) even an exclu sive purpose to foster or assist religious prac tice not necessar\u00ad ily invalidati ng. But today' s extensi on makes things even worse . By shifting the focus of Lemo n's purpose prong from the search for a genui ne, secu lar motivati on to the hunt for a predomi nantly religious purpose , the Cour t converts what has in the past been a fairly limited inquiry into a rigor\u00ad ous review of the full record.9 Those responsible for the 9 The Cour t's reflexive skepticism of the gover nment' s asser ted secu lar purposes is flatly inconsistent with the deferentia l approach taken by our previous Establishment Clause cases. We have repeated many times that, where a cour t under takes the sensitive task of reviewing a gover n\u00ad ment' s asser ted purpose , it must take the gover nment at its word absent compel ling evidence to the contrary . See, e. g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 586 (1987) (stating that \"the Cour t is... deferentia l to a State's articulation of a secu lar purpose ,\" unless that purpose is insincere or a sham ); Muell er v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 394-395 \"reluc tance to attribute unconstituti onal motives to the States, particularly when a plausible secu lar purpose for the 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng adopti on of the Religion Clauses would surely regard it as a bitter irony that the religious values they desig ned those Clauses to protect have now become so distastefu l to this Cour t that if they constitute anyth ing more than a subor\u00ad dinate motive for gover nment action they will Even accepti ng the Cour t's Lemo n-based premises, the displays at issue here were constituti onal. A To any person who happened to walk down the hallway of the McCreary or Pulaski County Cour thouse during the rough ly nine months when the Foundati ons Displays were exhibited, the displays must have seemed unremarkable \u2014if indeed they were noticed at all. The walls of both cour t\u00ad houses were already lined with histor ical documents and other assor ted portraits; each Foundati ons Display was ex\u00ad hibited in the same format as these other displays and noth\u00ad ing in the record suggests that either County took steps to give it greater promi nence . Entitled \"The Foundati ons of Amer ican Law and Gover n\u00ad ment Display ,\" each display consisted of nine equa lly sized documents: the original versi on of the Mag na Carta, the Dec\u00ad larati on of Independence , the Bill of Rights, the Star Span\u00ad gled Banner , the Mayflower Compac t of picture of Lady Justice , the Nati onal Motto of the United States (\"In God We Trust\"), the Preamble to the Kentucky Constituti on, and the Ten Commandments. The displays did not empha\u00ad size any of the nine documents in any way: The frame holdi ng the Ten Commandments was of the same size and had the program may be discer ned from the face of the statute\"); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 74 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurr ing in judg ment) (\"[T]he inquiry into the purpose of the legislature . . COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY.

Posted with the documents was a plaque , identi fying the display , and explai ning that it \" 'cont ains documents that played a signicant role in the foundati on of our system of law and gover nment. ' \" Ibid. The explanati on related to the Ten Commandments was third in the list of nine and did not serve to disti nguish it from the other documents. It stated: \" 'The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formati on of Wester n legal thought and the forma\u00ad tion of our country . That influence is clear ly seen in the Declarati on of Independence , which declared that, \"We hold these truths to be self-e vident, that all men are cre\u00ad ated equa l, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liber ty, and the pursuit of Happi ness. \" The Ten Com\u00ad mandments prov ide the mora l background of the Decla\u00ad ration of Independence and the foundati on of our legal traditi on.' \" Ibid. B On its face, the Foundati ons Displays mani fested the purely secu lar purpose that the Counties asser ted before the District Cour t: \"to display documents that played a signi\u00ad cant role in the foundati on of our system of law and gover n\u00ad ment. \" Afdav it of Judge Jimmie Green t of De\u00ad fendants' Oppositi on to Plaintiffs' Moti on for Contempt or, in the Alter native , for Supplement al Prel iminary Injunc tion in Civ. Action No. 99-507 (ED Ky.), p. 2, \u00b64, App. 57. That the displays included the Ten Commandments did not transfor m their apparent secu lar purpose into one of imper missible ad\u00ad vocacy for Judeo-Chr istian beliefs. Even an display of the Decalogue conveys, at worst, \"an equivoca l message , perhaps of respec t for Judaism, for religion in genera l, or for law.\" Allegheny County, 492 U.S., OPIN 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng concurr ing in part and dissenti ng in part). But when the Ten Commandments appear alongside other documents of secu lar signicance in a display devoted to the foundati ons of Amer ican law and gover nment, the context communicates that the Ten Commandments are included, not to teach their binding nature as a religious text, but to show their unique contr ibuti on to the development of the legal system. See id., at 652-653. This is doubly true when the display is in\u00ad troduced by a document that informs passersby that it \" 'con\u00ad tains documents that played a signicant role in the founda\u00ad tion of our system of law and gover nment. ' \" 354 F. 3d, at 443. The same resu lt follows if the Ten Commandments display is viewed in light of the gover nment prac tices that this Cour t has countenanced the past. The acknowledg ment of the contr ibuti on that religion in genera l, and the Ten Command\u00ad ments in particular, have made to our Nati on's legal and gov\u00ad ernment al heritage is surely no more of a step toward estab\u00ad lishment of religion than was the prac tice of legislative prayer we approved in Marsh v. Chambe rs, 463 U. S. 783 (1983), and it seems to be on par with the inclusi on of a cre`che or a menorah in a \"Holiday\" display that incor porates other secu lar symbols, see Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S., at 679-680; Allegheny County, supra, at 621 (Blackmun, J., con\u00ad curr in part). The para llels be\u00ad tween this case and Marsh and Lynch are sufciently com\u00ad pelling that they ought to decide this case , even under the Cour t's misg uided Establishment Clause jurisprudence .10 10 The Cour t's only response is that the inclusi on of the Ten Command\u00ad ments in a display about the foundati ons of ican law reflec ts \"a [call on] citizens to act in prescr ibed ways as a persona l response to divine author ity,\" in a way that legislative prayer and the inclusi on of a cre`che in a holiday display do not. See ante, at 878, n. 24. That might be true if the Commandments were displayed by themselves in a church, or even in someone' s home . It seems to me \"undeniable histor a symbol of the religious foundati ons of law, see Van Orden, COUNTY v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng Acknowledg ment of the contr ibuti on that religion has made to our Nati on's legal and gover nment al heritage par\u00ad takes a centur ies-old traditi on. Members of this Cour t have themselves often detailed the degree to which religious belief pervaded the Nati onal Gover nment during the found\u00ad ing at 674-678; Marsh, supra, at 786-788; Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 633-636 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng); Wallace, 472 U. S., at 100-106 (Rehnquist , J., dissenti ng); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 446-450, and n. 3 (1962) (Stewar t, J., dissenti ng). Display of the Ten Commandments is well within the mainstream of this prac tice of acknowledg ment. Federa l, state, and local gover nments across the Nati on have engaged in such dis\u00ad play.11 The Supreme Cour t Building itself includes depic\u00ad tions of Moses with the Ten Commandments in the Cour t\u00ad room and on the east pedi ment of the building, and symbols of the Ten Commandments \"ador n the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Cour troom as well as the doors leadi ng into troom. \" depic tions of the ion)\u2014when they are cour thouse display of histor ical docu\u00ad ments.

See, e. g., Books v. Elkhar t County, 401 F. 3d 857, 858-859 (CA7 2005) (Ten Commandments included in a display identica l to the Foundati ons Dis\u00ad play); Mercier v.

Ante, at 689. The frequency of these displays tes\u00ad ties to the popu lar underst andi ng that the Ten Command\u00ad ments are a foundati on of the rule of law, and a symbol of the role that religion played, and conti nues to play, in our system of gover nment. Perhaps in recog nition of the centra Ten Com\u00ad mandments as a widely recog nized symbol of religion in pub\u00ad lic life, the Cour t is at pains to dispel the impressi on that its decisi on will require gover nments across the country to sandblast the Ten Commandments from the publ ic square . See ante, at 874. The constituti onal problem, the Cour t says, is with the Counties' purpose in erec ting the Founda\u00ad tions Displays, not the displays themselves. The Cour t adds in a footnote: \"One consequence of taking account of the pur\u00ad pose under lying past actions is that the same gover nment action may be constituti onal if taken in the rst instance and unconstituti onal if it has a sectarian heritage.\" Ante, at 866, n. 14. This inconsistency may be expl icable in theory , but I sus\u00ad pect that the \"objec tive observer \" with whom the Cour t is so concer ned will recog nize its absurdity in prac tice. By virtue of details fami liar only to the parties to litigati on and their lawyers, McCreary and Pulaski Counties, Kentucky , and Ruther ford County , Tennessee , have been ordered to re\u00ad move the same display that appears in cour thouses from Mercer County , Kentucky , to Elkhar t County , Indiana. Compare American Civil Liberties Union of Tenn. v. Ruth\u00ad erford County, 209 F. ons Display to be unconstituti onal based on prior actions of county commissi on), with Books v.

Scalia, J., dissenti ng that the County' s purpose had not been \"tainted with any prior history\"). Displays erec ted in silence (and under the direc tion of good legal advice) are permissible , while those hung after discussi on and debate are deemed unconstitu\u00ad tional. Reduc tion of the Establishment Clause' s protec tion tablishment; indeed, it may inflame religious passi ons by mak ing the passi ng comments of every gover nment ofcia l the subjec t of endless litigati on. C In any event, the Cour t's conclusi on that the Counties ex\u00ad hibited the Foundati ons Displays with the purpose of pro\u00ad moti ng religion is doubtfu l. In the Cour t's view, the imper\u00ad missible motive was apparent from the initia l displays of the Ten Commandments all by themselves: When that occurs, the Cour t says, \"a religious objec t is unmist akable .\" Ante, at 869. Surely that cannot be. If, as discussed above , the Commandments have a proper place in our civic history , even placi ng them by themselves can be civically motivated\u2014 es\u00ad pecia lly when they are placed, not in a school (as they were in the Stone case upon which the Cour t places such reliance), but in a cour thouse . Cf. Van Orden, ante, at 701 (\"The circumst ances surroundi ng the display' s capitol grounds and its physi\u00ad cal setti ng suggest that the And the fact that at the posti ng of the exhibit a clerg yman was present is unremarkable (clerg ymen taking particular pride in the role of the Ten Commandments in our civic history); and even more unremarkable the fact that the clerg yman \"testi ed to the certainty of the existence of God, \" ante, at 869. The Cour t has in the past proh ibited gover nment actions that \"proselyti ze or advance one, or . . . disparage any other , faith or belief,\" Marsh, 463 U. S., at 794-795, or that apply some level of coerci on (though I and others S. 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng agreed about the form that coerci on must take), see, e. g., Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S., at 592 (prayer at high-school gradua\u00ad tion invalid because of \"subtle coercive pressure\"); id., at 642 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). The passive display of the Ten Commandments, even standi ng alone, does not begin to do either . What Justice Kennedy said of the cre`che in Alle\u00ad gheny County is equa lly true of the Counties' original Ten Commandments displays: \"No one was compel led to observe or participate in any religious ceremony or activity. [T]he count[ies ] [did not] contr ibut[ e] signicant amounts of tax money to serve the cause of one religious faith. [The Ten Com\u00ad mandments ] are purely passive symbols of [the religious foundati on for many of our laws and gover nment al insti\u00ad tutions]. Passersby who disagree with the message conveyed by th[e] displays are free to ignore them, or even to turn their backs, just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of gover nment speech. \" 492 U. S., at 664 (opinion concurr ing in judg\u00ad ment in part and dissenti ng in part). Nor is it the case that a solo display of the Ten Command\u00ad ments advances any one faith. They are assuredly a reli\u00ad gious symbol, but they are not so closely associated with a single religious belief that their display can reasonably be understood as preferr ing one religious sect over another . The Ten Commandments are recog nized by Judaism, Chris\u00ad tianity , and Islam alike as divinely given. See 13 Encyclope\u00ad dia of Religion 9074 (2d ed. 2005).12 12 Because there are inter pret ational differences between faiths and within faiths concer ning the meani ng and perhaps even the text of the Commandments, Justice Stevens maintains that any display of the text of the Ten Commandments is imper missible because it \"invariably places the [gover nment ] at the center of a serious sectarian dispute .\" Van Orden, ante, at 718-719 (dissenti ng opinion). I think not. The sectarian dispute regardi ng text, if serious, is not widely known. I doubt that most religious adherents are even aware that there are competi ng versi ons with doctrinal consequences (I certainly was not). In any event, the context v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBER TIES UNION OF KY. Scalia, J., dissenti ng The Cour t also points to the Counties' second displays, which featured a number of statements in histor ical docu\u00ad ments reflec ting a religious influence the resoluti ons that accompanied their erec tion, as evidence of an imper mis\u00ad sible religious .13 In \"[t]he [second] display' s unsti nting focus... s] that the Counties were posti ng the Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content. \" Ante, at 870. No, all it necessar ily shows is that the exhibit was meant to focus upon the histor ic role of religious belief in our national life\u2014 which is entirely permissible . And the same can be said of the resoluti on. To forbid any gover nment focus upon this aspec t of our history is to display what Justice Goldberg called \"untutored devotion to the concept of neutra lity,\" Ab\u00ad ington Township, 374 U. S., at 306 (concurr ing opinion), that would commit the Cour t (and the Nati on) to a revisionist agenda of secu larization. of the display here could not conceivably cause the viewer to believe that the gover nment was taking sides in a doctrinal controversy . 13 Posted less than a month after respondents led suit, the second dis\u00ad plays included an excer pt from the Declarati on of Independence , the Pre\u00ad amble to the Kentucky Constituti on, a page from the Congressi onal Rec\u00ad ord declar ing 1983 to be the Year of the Bible and the proclamati on of President Reagan stating the same , a proclamati on of President Lincoln desig nating April 30, 1863, as a Nati onal Day of Prayer and Humiliation, an excer pt from Lincoln' s \"Reply to Loya l Colored People of Baltimore upon Present ation of a Bible\" stating that \"[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man, \" and the Mayflower Compac t. 96 F. Supp . 2d 679, 684 (ED Ky. 2000) (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). The Counties erec ted the displays in accordance with a resoluti on passed by their legis\u00ad lative bodies, author izing the County-J udge Executives \"to read or post the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of the Commonwea lth of Kentucky are founded, \" and to display alongside the Ten Commandments copies of the documents listed above \"without censorsh ip because of any Christian or religious ref\u00ad erences in these writings, documents, and histor ical records. \" Def.

Action No. 99-507, p. 1 (ED S. 844 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng Turning at last to the displays actually at issue in this case , the Cour t faults the Counties for not repealing the resoluti on expressi ng what the Cour t believes to be an imper missible intent. Under these circumst ances, the Cour t says, \"[n]o reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Coun\u00ad ties had cast off the objec tive so unmist akable in the earlier displays. \" Ante, at 872. Even were I to accept all that the Cour t has said before , I would not agree with that assess\u00ad ment. To begin with, of course , it is unlikely that a reason\u00ad able observer would even have been aware of the resoluti ons, so there would be noth ing to \"cast off.\" The Cour t implies that the Counties may have been able to remedy the \"taint\" from the old resoluti ons by enac ting a new one. See ante, at 871-872. But that action would have been whol ly unnec\u00ad essary in light of the explanati on that the Counties included with the displays themselves: A plaque next to the docu\u00ad ments informed all who passed by that each display \"cont ains documents that played a signicant role in the foundati on of our system of law and gover nment. \" Additi onally, there was no reason for the Counties to repea l or repudiate the resoluti ons adopted with the hang ing of the second displays, since they related only to the second displays. After com\u00ad plying with the District Cour t's order to remove the second displays \"immediately ,\" and erec ting new displays that in content and by express asser tion reflec ted a different pur\u00ad pose from that identi ed in the resoluti ons, the Counties had no reason to believe that their previous resoluti ons would be deemed to be the basis for their actions.14 After the Coun\u00ad 14 Contrary to the Cour t's suggesti on, see ante, at 872, n. 20, it is clear that the resoluti ons were closely tied to the second displays, but not to the third. Each of the documents included in the second displays was author ized by the resoluti ons, and those displays, consistent with the reso\u00ad lutions' direc tion to \"post the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of the Commonwea lth of Kentucky are founded, \" Def. Exh. 1, supra, n. 13, at 1, consisted of a large copy of the Ten Commandments alongside much smaller framed copies of other histor ical, religious documents.

Scalia, J., dissenti ng ties discovered that the senti ments expressed in the resolu\u00ad tions could be attributed to their most recent displays (in oral argument before this Cour t), they repudiated them immediately . In sum: The rst displays did not necessar ily evidence an intent to further religious prac tice; nor did the second dis\u00ad plays, or the resoluti ons author izing them; and there is in any event no basis for attributi ng whate ver intent motivated the rst and second displays to the third. Given the pre\u00ad sumpti on of regularity that always accompanies our review of ofcia l action, see n. 9, supra, the Cour t has identi ed no evidence of a purpose to advance religion in a way that is inconsistent with our cases. The Cour t may well be correc t in identi fying the third displays as the fruit of a desire to display the Ten Commandments, ante, at 872, but neither our cases nor our history suppor t its asser tion that such a desire renders the fruit poisonous. * * * For the foregoi ng reasons, I would reverse the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls. included documents not menti oned in the resoluti ons (the Mag na Carta and a picture of Lady Justice) and did not include documents author ized by the resoluti ons (correspondence and proclamati ons of Abraham Lincoln and the Resoluti on of Congress declar ing 1983 to be the Year of the Bible). The resoluti ons also prov ided that they were to be posted beside the displays that they author ized. Id., at 9. Yet respondents have never suggested the resoluti ons were posted next to the third displays, and the record before the Cour t indicates that they were not. The photos in\u00ad cluded in the Appendix show that the third displays included 10 frames\u2014 the nine histor ical documents and the prefatory statement explai ning the relevance of each of the documents.

Argued March 29, 2005 \u2014Decided June 27, 2005 Respondent companies distr ibute free software that allows computer users to share electronic les through peer-to-peer networks, so called because the computers communicate direc tly with each other , not through centra l servers. Although such networks can be used to share any type of digital le, recipients of respondents' software have mostly used them to share copyr ighted music and video les without author iza\u00ad tion. Seek ing damages and an injunc tion, a group of mov ie studi os and other copyr ight holders (herei respondents for onally distr ibuted their software to enable users to infringe copyr ighted works in violati on of the Copyr ight Act. Discovery revealed that billions of les are shared across peer-to-peer networks each month. Respondents are aware that users employ their software primarily to download copyr ighted les, although the decen\u00ad tralized networks do not reveal which les are copied, and when. Re\u00ad spondents have someti mes learned about the infringement direc tly when users have e-mai led questi ons regardi ng copyr ighted works, and respondents have replied with guidance . Respondents are not merely passive recipients of informati on about infringement. The record is re\u00ad plete with evidence that when they began to distr ibute their free soft\u00ad ware , each of them clear ly voiced the objec tive that recipients use the software to download copyr ighted works and took active steps to en\u00ad courage infringement. After the notor ious le-shar ing serv ice, Nap\u00ad ster, holders for facilitating copyr ight infringe\u00ad ment, both respondents promoted and marketed themselves as Napster alternatives. They receive no revenue from users, but, instead, gener\u00ad ate income by selling adver tising space , then streami ng the adver tising users adver tising oppor tu\u00ad nities are worth more . There is no evidence that either respondent made an effor t to lter copyr ighted mater ial from users' downloads or other wise to impede the shar ing of copyr ighted les. Whil e acknowledg ing tly infringed MGM' s copyr ights, the District Cour t nonetheless granted respondents summary judg ment as to liability arising from distr LTD. Syllabus ware . The Ninth Circuit afrmed. It read Sony Corp. of Ame rica v. Unive rsal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417, as holdi ng that the distr ibu\u00ad tion subst antia l noni nfringing uses could not give rise to contr ibutory liability for infringement unless the distr ibutor had actual knowledge of speci c instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge . Because the appea ls cour t found respondents' software to be capable of subst antia l noni nfringing uses and because respondents had no actual knowledge of infringement owing to the software' s decentra lized arch itecture , the cour t held that they were not liable . It also held that they did not mater ially contr ib\u00ad ute to their users' infringement because the users themselves searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing les, with no involvement by respondents beyond prov iding the software in the rst place . Finally, the cour t held that respondents could not be held liable under a vicari\u00ad ous infringement theory because they did not monitor or control the software' s use, had no agreed-upon right or current ability to superv ise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement. Held: One who distr ibutes a device with the objec t of promoti ng its use to infringe copyr ight, as shown by clear expressi on or other afrmative steps taken to foster infringement, going beyond mere distr ibuti on with knowledge of third-par ty action, is liable for the resu lting acts of in\u00ad fringement by third parties using the device, regardless of the device's lawfu l uses. Pp. 928-941. (a) The tensi the competi limiting infringement liability is the subjec t of this case. Despite offsetti ng considerati ons, the argument for imposi ng indirec t liability here is power ful, given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents' software . When a widely shared produc t is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protec ted work effec tively against all direc t infringers, so that the only prac tical alternative is to go against the device's distr ibutor for secondary liability on a theory of contr ibutory or vicarious infringement. vicariously by proti ng from direc t infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it. Although \"[t]he Copyr ight Act does not expressly render anyone liable for [another 's] infringement, \" Sony, 464 U. S., at 434, these secondary liability doctrines emerged from common law principles and are well established in the law, e. g., id., at 486. Pp. 928-931. (b) Sony addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distr ibuti on of a commercia 913 (2005) Syllabus copyr ight holders sued Sony , the manufac turer of videocassette record\u00ad ers, claiming that it was contr ibutor ily liable for the infringement that occurred when VCR owners taped copyr ighted programs. The evi\u00ad dence showed that the VCR' s principa l use was \"time-sh ifting,\" i. e., taping a program for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Cour t found to be a fair, noni nfringing use. 464 U. S., at 423-424. Moreover , there was no evidence that Sony had desired to bring about taping in violati on of copyr ight or taken active steps to increase its prots from unlawfu l taping. Id., at 438. On those facts, the only con\u00ad ceivable basis for liability was on a theory of contr ibutory infringement through distr ibuti on of a produc t. Id., at 439. Because the VCR was \"capable of commercia lly signicant noni nfringing uses, \" the Cour t held that Sony was not liable . Id., at 442. This theory reflec ted patent law's traditi onal staple article of commerce doctrine that distr ibuti on of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(c). The doctrine ab\u00ad solves the equivoca l conduc t of selling an item with lawfu l and unlawfu l uses and limits liability to instances of more acute fault. In this case , the Ninth Circuit misread Sony to mean that when a produc t is capable of subst antia l lawfu l use, the producer cannot be held contr ibutor ily lia\u00ad ble for third parties' infringing use of it, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown, unless the distr ibutors had speci c knowledge of infringement at a time when they contr ibuted to the in\u00ad fringement and failed to act upon that informati on. Sony did not dis\u00ad place other secondary liability theor ies. Pp. 931-934. (c) Nothing in Sony requires cour ts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists. It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived from the common law. 464 U. S., at 439. Where evidence goes beyond a produc t's charac teris\u00ad tics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions direc ted to promoti ng infringement, Sony's staple-ar ticle rule will not preclude liability. At common law a copy\u00ad right or patent defendant who \"not only expec ted but invoked [infring\u00ad ing use] by adver tisement\" was liable for infringement. Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62-63. The rule on inducement of in\u00ad fringement as developed in the early cases is no different today . Evi\u00ad dence of active steps taken to encourage direc t infringement, such as adver tising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infring\u00ad ing use, shows an afrmative intent that the produc t be used to infringe, and overcomes the law's reluc tance to nd liability when a defendant merely sells a commercia l produc t suitable for some lawfu l use. A rule that premises liability on purposefu l, culpable expressi on and GROKSTER , LTD. Syllabus does noth ing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innova\u00ad tion having a lawfu l promise . Pp. tive is un\u00ad mist akable classic instance of inducement is by adver tisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message desig ned to stimulate others to commit violati ons. MGM argues persuasively that such a message is shown here . Three features of the evidence of intent are particularly notable. First, each of the respondents showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyr ight infringement, the to former Napster users indicate a principa l, if not exclusive , intent to bring about infringement. Second, neither respondent at\u00ad tempted to develop ltering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software . Whil e the Ninth Circuit treated that failure as irrele vant because respondents lacked an inde\u00ad pendent duty to monitor their users' activity, this evidence underscores their intenti onal facilitation of their users' infringement. Third, re\u00ad spondents make money by selling adver tising space , then by direc ting ads to the screens of computers employ ing their software . The more their software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the adver tising revenue . Since the extent of the software' s use deter mines the gain to the distr ibutors, the commercia l sense of their enter prise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing. This evidence alone would not justi fy an inference of unlawfu l intent, but its impor t is clear in the entire record' s context. Pp. 937-940. (e) In additi on to intent to bring about infringement and distr ibuti on of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement theory requires evidence of actual infringement by recipients of the device, the software in this case. There is evidence of such infringement on a gigantic scale. Because subst antia l evidence suppor ts MGM on all elements, summary judg ment for respondents was error . On remand, reconsiderati on of MGM' s summary judg moti on will be in order . Pp. 940-941. 380 F. 3d 1154, vacated and remanded. Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unani mous Cour t.

Opinion of the Cour t centra l servers. The advant age of peer-to-peer networks over informati on networks of other types shows up in their subst antia l and grow ing popu larity. Because they need no centra l computer server to mediate the exchange of informa\u00ad tion or les among users, the high-bandw idth communica\u00ad tions capacity for a server may be dispensed with, and the need for costly server storage space is eliminated. Since copies of a le (particularly a popu lar one) are available on many users' computers, le requests and retrievals may be faster than on other types of networks, and since le ex\u00ad changes do not travel through a server , communicati ons can take place between any computers that remai n connec ted to the network without risk that a glitch in the server will dis\u00ad able the network in its entirety . Given these benets in se\u00ad electronic les by universities, gover nment agencies, corporati ons, and libraries, among others.1 Other of peer-to-peer networks include indiv idua l cipients and StreamCast' s software , and al\u00ad though the networks that they enjoy through using the soft\u00ad ware can be used to share any type of digital le, they have promi nently employed those networks in shar ing copy\u00ad righted music and video les without author ization.

Searches on peer-to-peer networks may not reach and uncover all available les be\u00ad cause search requests may not be transmitted to every computer on the network. There may be redundant copies of popu lar les. The creator of the software has no incentive to minimize storage or bandw idth con\u00ad sumpti on, the costs of which are borne by every user of the network. Most relevant here , it is more difcu lt to control the content of les avail\u00ad able for retrieval and the behav ior of PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t know ingly and intenti onally distr ibuted their to and distr ibute the copyr ighted works in violati on of the Copyr ight Act, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp . II).2 MGM sought damages and an injunc tion. Discovery during the litigati on revealed the way the soft\u00ad ware worked, the business aims of each defendant company , and the predi lections of the users. Grokster 's eponymous software employs what is known as FastTrack technolog y, a protocol developed by others and licensed to Grokster . StreamCast distr ibutes a very similar produc t except that its software , called Morpheus, relies on what is known as Gnutel la technolog y.3 A user who downloads and installs either software possesses the protocol to send requests for les direc tly to the computers of others using software com\u00ad patible with FastTrack or Gnutel la. On the FastTrack net\u00ad work opened by the Grokster software , the user 's request goes to a computer given an indexi ng capacity by the soft\u00ad ware and desig nated a super node , or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the les available on the computers of users connec ted to it. The super node (or indexi ng computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search re\u00ad quest to other super nodes. If the le is found, the super\u00ad node discloses its locati on to the computer requesti ng it, and the requesti ng user can download the le direc tly from the computer located. The copied le is placed in a desig nated shar ing folder on the requesti ng user 's computer , where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other le in that folder . 2 The studi os and recordi ng companies and the song writers and music publ ishers led separate suits against the defendants that were consol i\u00ad dated by the District Cour t. 3 Subsequent versi ons of Morpheus, released after the record was made in this case , apparently rely not on Gnutel la but on a technolog y called Neonet. These developments are not GROKSTER LTD. Opinion of the Cour t In the Gnutel la network made available by Morpheus, the process is mostly the same , except that in some versi ons of the Gnutel la protocol there are no super nodes. In these versi ons, peer computers using the protocol communicate di\u00ad rectly with each other . When a user enters a search request into the Morpheus software , it sends the request to comput\u00ad ers connec ted with it, which in turn pass the request along to other connec ted peers. The search resu lts are communi\u00ad cated to the requesti ng computer , and the user can download desired les direc tly from peers' computers. As this de\u00ad scription indicates, Grokster and StreamCast use no servers to intercept the content of the search requests or to mediate the le transfers conduc ted by users of the software , there being no centra l point through which the subst ance of the communicati ons passes in either direc tion.4 Although Grokster and StreamCast do not therefore know when particular les are copied, a few searches using their software would show what is available on the networks the software reaches. MGM commissi oned a statistician to con\u00ad duct a systematic search, and his study showed that near ly 90% of the les available for download on the FastTrack sys\u00ad tem were copy ing even of copyr ighted works may be author ized by the rightholders. They also argue that poten\u00ad tial noni nfringing uses of their software are signicant in kind, even if infrequent in prac tice. Some musica l perform\u00ad ers, for example , have gained new audiences by distr ibuti ng 4 There is some evidence that both Grokster and StreamCast previously operated super nodes, which compi led indexes of les available on all of the nodes connec ted to them. This evidence , pertaining to previous ver\u00ad sions of the defendants' software , is not before us and would not affec t our conclusi ons in any event. 5 By compar ison, evidence introduced by the plaintiffs in A&M Reco rds, Inc. v. Napste r, Inc., 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), showed that 87% of les available on the Napster le-shar ing network U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t their copyr ighted works for free across peer-to-peer net\u00ad works, and some distr ibutors of unprotec ted content have used peer-to-peer networks to dissemi nate les, Shakespeare being an example . Indeed, StreamCast has given Morpheus users the oppor tunity to download the briefs in this very case , though their popu larity has not been quanti ed. As for quanti cati on, the parties' anecdot al and statistica l evidence entered thus far to show the content available on the FastTrack and Gnutel la networks does not say much about which les are actually downloaded by users, and no one can say how often the software is used to obtain copies of unprotec ted mater ial. But MGM' s evidence gives reason to think that the vast major ity of users' downloads are acts of infringement, and because well over 100 million copies of the software in questi on are known to have been down\u00ad loaded, and billions of les are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutel la networks each month, the probable scope of copyr ight infringement is stagger ing. Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in most downloads, Brief for Respondents 10, n. 6, and it is un\u00ad contested that they are aware that users employ their soft\u00ad ware primarily to download copyr ighted les, even if the de\u00ad centra lized FastTrack and Gnutel la networks fail to reveal which les are being copied, and when. From time to time, moreover , the companies have learned about their users' in\u00ad fringement direc tly, as from users who have sent e-mai l to each company with questi ons about play ing copyr ighted mov ies they had downloaded, to whom the companies have responded with guidance .6 App. 559-563, 808-816, 939-954. And MGM notied the companies of 8 million copyr ighted les that could be obtained using their software . Grokster and StreamCast are not, howe ver, merely pas\u00ad sive recipients of informati on about infringing use. The rec\u00ad ord is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster 6 The Grokster founder contends that in answer ing these e-mai ls he often did not read them fully. App. LTD. Opinion of the Cour t and StreamCast began to distr ibute their free software , each one clear ly voiced the objec tive that recipients use it to download copyr ighted works, and each took active steps to encourage infringement. After the notor ious le-shar ing serv ice, Napster , was facilitation of copyr ight infringe\u00ad ment, A&M Reco rds, Inc. v. Inc., 114 F. Supp . 2d 896 (ND Cal. 2000), aff'd in part, in part, 239 F. 3d 1004 (CA9 2001), StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as OpenNap, desig ned as compatible with the Napster program and open to Napster users for downloadi ng les from other Napster and OpenNap users' indicates that \"[i]t [StreamCast' s] in\u00ad tent to use [its OpenNap network ] to be able to capture emai l addresses of [its] initia l target [it] could pro\u00ad mote [its] StreamCast Morpheus inter face to them, \" App. 861; indeed, the OpenNap program was engineered \" 'to le\u00ad verage Napster 's 50 million user base ,' \" id., at 746. StreamCast monitored both the number of users down\u00ad loadi ng its OpenNap program and the number of music les they downloaded. Id., at 859, 863, 866. It also used the re\u00ad sulting OpenNap network to distr ibute copies of the Mor\u00ad pheus software and to encourage users to adopt it. Id., at 861, 867, 1039. Inter nal company documents indicate that StreamCast hoped to attrac t large numbers of former Nap\u00ad ster users if that company was shut down by cour t order or other wise, and that StreamCast planned to be the next Nap\u00ad ster. Id., at 861. A kit developed by StreamCast to be de\u00ad livered to adver about StreamCast' s potentia l to capture former Napster users, id., at 568-572, and it introduced itself to some poten\u00ad tial adver tisers as a company \"which is similar to what Nap\u00ad ster was, \" id., at 884. It broadcast banner adver tisements to users of other Napster-compatible software , urging them to adopt its OpenNap . Id., at 586. An inter nal e-mai l from a company executive stated: \" 'We have put this network 15:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t place so that when Napster pulls the plug on their free serv ice . . . or if the Cour t orders them shut down prior to that . . . we will be positi oned to capture the flood of their 32 million users that will be actively looking for an alterna\u00ad tive.' \" Id., at 588-589, 861. Thus, StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its serv ice as the best Napster alternative . One proposed adver tisement read: \"Napster Inc. has announced that it will soon begin charg ing you a fee. That' s if the cour ts don't order it shut down rst. What will you do to get around it?\" Id., at 897. Another proposed ad touted StreamCast' s software as the \"#1 alternative to Napster \" and asked \"[w]hen the lights went off at Napster . . . where did 836 (ellipsis in original).7 StreamCast even planned to flaunt the illegal uses of its soft\u00ad ware; when it launched the OpenNap network, the chief tech\u00ad nolog y ofcer of the company averred that \"[t]he goal is to get in trouble with the law and get sued. It's the best way to get in the new[ s].\" Id., at 916. The evidence that Grokster sought to capture the market of former Napster users is sparser but revealing, for Grok\u00ad ster launched its own OpenNap system called Swaptor and inser ted digital codes into its Web site so that computer users using Web search engines to look for \"Napster \" or \"[f]ree le shar ing\" would be direc ted to the Grokster Web site, where they could download the Grokster software . Id., at 992-993. And Grokster 's name is an apparent derivative of Napster . StreamCast' s executives monitored the number of songs by certain commercia l artists available on their networks, and an inter nal communicati on indicates they aimed to have a larger number of copyr ighted songs available on their net\u00ad 7 The record makes clear that StreamCast developed these promoti onal mater ials but not whether it released them to the publ ic. Even if these adver tisements were not released to the publ ic and do not show encour\u00ad agement to infringe, GROKSTER , LTD. Opinion of the Cour t works than other le-shar ing networks.

The point, of course , would be to attrac t users of a mind to in\u00ad fringe, just as it would be with their promoti onal mater ials developed show ing copyr ighted songs as examples of the kinds of les available through Morpheus. Id., at 848. Morpheus in fact allowed users to search speci cally for \"Top 40\" songs, id., at 735, which were inevitably copyr ighted. Similarly, Grokster sent users a newsletter promoti ng ability to prov ide particular, popu lar ighted mater ials. Recordi ng Company Petitioners 7-8. In additi on to this evidence of express promoti on, market\u00ad ing, and intent to promote further, the business models employed by Grokster and StreamCast conr m that their principa l objec t was use of their software to download copy\u00ad righted works. Grokster and StreamCast receive no reve\u00ad nue from users, who obtain the software itself for noth ing. Instead, both companies generate income by selling adver tis\u00ad ing space , and they stream the adver tising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employ ing the programs. As the number of users of each program increases, adver tis\u00ad ing oppor tunities become worth more . Cf. App. 539, 804. While there is doubtless some demand for free Shakespeare , the evidence shows that subst antive volume is a func tion of free access to copyr ighted work. Users seek ing Top 40 songs, for example , or the latest release by Modest Mouse , are certain to be far more numerous than those seek ing a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars. Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an effor t to lter copyr ighted mater ial from users' downloads or other impede the shar ing of copyr ighted les. Al\u00ad though Grokster appears to have sent e-mai ls warning users about infringing content when it received threateni ng notice from the copyr ight holders, it never blocked anyone from conti nuing to use its software to share copyr Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Id., at 75-76. StreamCast not only rejected another com\u00ad pany' s offer of help to monitor infringement, id., at 928-929, but blocked the Inter net Protocol addresses of entities it be\u00ad lieved were trying to engage in such monitor ing on its net\u00ad works, id., at 917-922. B After discovery , the parties on each side of the case cross\u00ad moved for summary judg ment. The District Cour t limited its considerati on to the asser ted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distr ibuti ng the current versi ons of their software , leaving aside whether either was liable \"for dam\u00ad ages arising from past versi ons of their software , or from other past activities. \" 259 F. Supp . 2d 1029, 1033 (CD Cal. 2003). The District Cour t held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyr ighted media tly infringed MGM' s copyr ights, a conclusi on not contested on appea l, but the cour t nonetheless granted summary judg ment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distr ibuti on of the then-current versi ons of their software . Distributi ng that software gave rise to no liability in the cour t's view, because its use did not prov ide the distr ibutors with actual knowledge of speci c acts of infringement. Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213. The Cour t of Appea ls afrmed. 380 F. 3d 1154 (CA9 2004). In the cour t's analysis, a defendant was liable as a contr ibutory infringer when it had knowledge fringement and mater ially contr ibuted to the infringement. But the cour t read Sony Corp. of Ame rica v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), as holdi ng that distr ibu\u00ad tion antia l noni fringing uses could not give rise to contr ibutory liability for infringement unless the distr ibutor had actual knowledge of speci c instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge . The fact that the software was capable of sub\u00ad stantia l noni nfringing uses in the Opinion of the Cour t that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable , because they had no such actual knowledge , owing to the decentra lized arch itecture of their software . The cour t also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not mater ially contr ibute to their users' infringement because it was the users them\u00ad selves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing les, with no involvement by the defendants beyond prov id\u00ad ing the software in the rst place . The Ninth Circuit also considered whether Grokster and StreamCast could be liable under a theory of vicarious in\u00ad fringement. The cour t held against liability because the de\u00ad fendants did not monitor or control the use of the software , had no agreed-upon right or current ability to superv ise its use, and had no independent duty to police infringement. We granted certiorar i. 543 U. S. 1032 (2004). II A MGM and many of the amici fault the Cour t of Appea ls's holdi the respec tive values suppor ting communicati on technolog ies by limiting the incidence of liability for copy\u00ad right infringement. The more artistic protec tion is favored, the more technolog ical innovati discouraged; the admi nistrati of copyr ight law is an exercise in manag ing the tradeoff . See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 442; see genera lly Ginsburg , Copyr ight and Control Over New Technolog ies of Dissemi nation, 101 Colum. L. An Economic Perspec tive, 16 Harv. J. L. & Tech. 395 (2003). The tensi on between the two values is the subjec t of this case , with its claim that digital distr ibuti on of copyr ighted mater ial threatens copyr ight holders as never before , be\u00ad cause every copy is identica l to the original, copy ing is easy U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t and many people (especia lly the young) use le-shar ing soft\u00ad ware to download copyr ighted works. This very breadth of the software' s use may well draw the publ ic direc tly into the debate over copyr Peters, Memor J. Copyr ight Soc. 701, 705-717 (2004) (address by Register of Copyr ights), and the indicati ons are that the ease of copy ing songs or mov ies using software like Grokster 's and Napster 's tion, Wu, Isn't Law , 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 724-726 (2003). As the case has been presented to us, these fears are said to be offset by the different concer n that imposi ng liability, not only on in\u00ad fringers but on distr ibutors of software based on its potentia l for unlawfu l use, could limit further development of bene\u00ad cial technolog ies. See, 1345, 1386 -1390 (2004); Brief for Innovati on Scholars and Economists as Ami ci Curiae 15-20; Brief for Emerg ing Technolog y Companies as Ami ci Curiae 19-25; Brief for Intel Corporati on as Ami cus Curiae 20-22.8 The argument for imposi ng indirec t liability in this case is, howe ver, a power ful one, given the number of infringing downloads that occur every day using StreamCast' s and Grokster 's software . When a widely shared serv ice or prod\u00ad uct is used to commit infringement, it may be impossible to 8 The mutua l exclusiv ity of these values shou ld not be overst ated, how\u00ad ever. On the technolog ical innovators, includi ng those writing le-shar effec tive copyr ight protec\u00ad tions for their work. See, e. g., Wu, When Code Isn't Law , 89 Va. L. Rev. 679, 750 (2003). (StreamCast itself was urged by an associate to \"get [its] technolog y written down and [its intellectual proper ty] protec ted.\" App. 866.) On the other hand the widespread distr ibuti on of creative works through improved technolog ies may enable the synthesis of new works or generate audiences for emerg ing artists. See Eldred v. Ashcro ft, 537 U. S. 186, 223-226 (2003) (Stevens, J., dissenti ng); Van Houwel ing, Dis\u00ad (2005); Brief for Sovereig n ci Curiae GROKSTER , LTD. Opinion of the Cour t enforce rights in the protec ted work effec tively against all direc t infringers, the only prac tical alternative being to go against the distr ibutor of the copy ing device for secondary liability on a theory of contr ibutory or vicarious infringe\u00ad ment. See In re Aim ster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 645-646 (CA7 t infringement, see Gershw in Pub. Corp. v.

H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 307 (CA2 1963).9 Although \"[t]he Copyr ight Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another ,\" Sony Corp. v. UniversalCityStu\u00ad dios, 464 U. S., at 434, these doctrines of secondary liability emerged from common law principles and are well estab\u00ad lished in the law, id., at 486 (Blackmun, J., dissenti ng); Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62-63 (1911); Gershw in Pub. Corp. v. Columb ia Artists Man agemen t, 9 We stated in Sony Corp. of Ame rica v. Unive rsal City Studios, Inc., 464 U. S. 417 (1984), that \" 'the lines between direc t infringement, contr ib\u00ad utory infringement necessar ily entails considerati on of arguments and case law which may also be forwarded under the other labels, and indeed the parties... rely upon such arguments and author ity in suppor t of their respec tive positi ons on the issue of contr ibutory infringement, \" id., at 435, n. 17 (quot\u00ad ing Unive rsal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of Ame rica, 480 F. Supp . 429, 457-458 (CD Cal. 1979)). In the present case MGM has argued a vicarious liability theory , which allows impositi on of liability when the de\u00ad fendant prots direc tly from the infringement and has a right and ability to superv ise the direc t infringer , even if the defendant initia lly lacks knowledge of the infringement. See, e. g., Shap iro, Bernstein & Co. v. H. L. Green Co., 316 F. 2d 304, 308 (CA2 1963); Dream land Ball Room, Inc. v. Shap iro, Bernstein & Co., 36 F. 2d 354, 355 (CA7 1929). Because we resolve the case based on an inducement theory , there is no need to analyze separately MGM' s liability S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t supra, at 1162; 12.04[ A] (2005). B of these principles of secondary lia\u00ad bility, this Cour t has dealt with secondary copyr ight in\u00ad fringement in only one recent case , and because MGM has tailored its principa l claim to our opinion there , a look at our earlier holdi ng is in order . In Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, this Cour t addressed a claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the very distr ibuti on of a commercia l produc t. There , the produc t, novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette recorder or VCR . Copyr ight holders sued Sony as the manufac turer , claiming it was contr ibutor ily liable for infringement that oc\u00ad curred when VCR owners taped copyr ighted programs be\u00ad cause it suppl ied the means used to infringe, and it had con\u00ad structive knowledge that infringement would occur . At the trial on the merits, the evidence showed that the principa l use of the VCR was for \"'time-sh ifting,'\" or taping a pro\u00ad gram for later viewing at a more convenient time, which the Cour t found to be a fair, not an infringing, use. Id., at 423- 424. There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an objec t of bringing about taping in violati on of copyr ight or had taken active steps to increase its prots from unlawfu l taping. Id., at 438. Although Sony' s adver tisements urged consumers to buy the VCR to \" 'record favor ite shows' \" or \" 'build a library' \" of recorded programs, id., at 459 (Black\u00ad mun, J., dissenti ng), neither of these uses was necessar ily infringing, id., at 424, 454-455. On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated in\u00ad tent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for imposi ng liability was on a theory of contr ibutory in\u00ad fringement arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge that some would use them to infringe. Id., at 439. But because the VCR was \"capable of commercia lly signicant noni v. GROKSTER , LTD. Opinion of the Cour t could not be faulted solely on the basis of its distr ibuti on. Id., at 442. This analysis reflec ted patent law's traditi onal staple cle of commerce doctrine, now codied, that distr ibuti on of a component of a patented device will not violate the patent if it is suitable for use in other ways. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7 271(c); Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacemen t Co., 377 U. S. 476, 485 (1964) (noting codicati on of cases); id., at 486, n. 6 (same). The doctrine was devised to identi fy instances in which it may be presumed from distr ibuti on of an article in commerce that the distr ibutor intended the article to be used to infringe another 's patent, and so may justly be held liable for that infringement. \"One who makes and sells articles which are only adapted to be used in a patented combi nation will be presumed to intend the natura l consequences of his acts; he will be presumed to intend that they shall be used in the combi nation of the patent. \" New York Scaffolding Co. v. Whitney , 224 F. 452, 459 (CA8 1915); see also James Heekin Co. v. Bake r, 138 F. 63, 66 (CA8 1905); Canda v. Mich\u00ad igan 486, 489 (CA6 1903); Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Ohio Brass Co., 80 F. 712, 720-721 (CA6 1897); Red Jacke t Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 82 F. 432, 439 (CA7 1897); Holly v. Vergennes Mach ine Co., 4F.74, 82 (CC Vt. 1880); Renw ick v. Pond, 20 F. Cas. 536, 541 (No. 11,702) (CC SDNY 1872). In sum, where an article is \"good for noth ing else\" but infringement, Canda v. Michigan Malleable Iron Co., supra, at 489, there is no legitimate publ ic interest in its unlicensed availability, and there is no injustice in presumi ng or imput\u00ad ing an intent to infringe, see Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, 48 (1912), overr uled on other grounds, Motion Pic\u00ad ture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U. S. 502 (1917). Conversely , the doctrine absolves the equivoca l con\u00ad duct of selling an item with subst antia l lawfu l as well as un\u00ad lawfu l uses, and limits liability to instances of more acute 933 545US2 Unit: $U79 [03-28-08 15:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t fault than the mere underst andi ng that some of one's prod\u00ad ucts will be misused. It leaves breath ing room for innova\u00ad tion and a vigorous commerce . See Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, 464 U. S., at 442; Dawso n Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 221 (1980); Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., supra, at 48. The parties and many of the amici in this case think the key to resolv ing it is the Sony rule and, in particular, what it means for a produc t to be \"capable of commercia lly signi\u00ad cant noni nfringing uses. \" Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 442. MGM advances the argument that granti ng summary judg ment to Grokster and StreamCast as to their current activities gave too much weight to the value of innovative technolog y, and too little to the copyr ights in\u00ad fringed by users of their software , given that 90% of works available on one of the networks was shown to be copy\u00ad righted. Assumi ng the remai ning 10% to be noni nfring\u00ad ing use, MGM says this shou ld not qualify as \"subst antia l,\" and the Cour t shou to the extent holdi ng that a produc t used \"principa lly\" for infringement does not qualify. See Brief for Moti on Picture Studi o and Recordi before , Grokster and StreamCast reply by citing evidence that their software can be used to reproduce publ ic domai n works, and they point to copyr ight holders who actually encourage copy ing. Even if infringement is the principa l prac tice with their soft\u00ad ware today , they argue, the noni nfringing uses are signi\u00ad cant and will grow . We agree with MGM that the Cour t of Appea ls misappl ied Sony, which it read as limiting secondary liability quite be\u00ad yond the circumst ances to which the case appl ied. Sony barred secondary liability based on presumi ng or imputi ng intent to cause infringement solely from the desig n or distr i\u00ad bution of a produc t capable of l lawfu l use, which the distr ibutor knows is in fact used for v. GROKSTER , LTD. Opinion of the Cour t Ninth Circuit has read Sony's limitation to mean that when\u00ad ever a produc t is capable of subst antia l lawfu l use, the pro\u00ad ducer can never be held contr ibutor ily liable for third par\u00ad ties' infringing use of it; it read the rule as being this broad, even when an actual purpose to cause infringing use is shown by evidence independent of desig n and distr ibuti on of the produc t, unless the distr ibutors had \"speci c knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contr ibuted to the in\u00ad fringement, and failed to act upon that informati on.\" 380 F. 3d, at 1162 (inter nal quot ation marks and brackets omit\u00ad ted). Because the Circuit found the StreamCast and Grok\u00ad ster software capable of subst antia l lawfu l use, it concluded on the basis of its readi ng of Sony that neither company could be held liable , since there was no show ing that their software , being without any centra l server , afforded them knowledge of speci c unlawfu l uses. This view of Sony, howe ver, was error , converting the case from one about liability resti ng on imputed intent to one about liability on any theory . Because Sony did not displace other theor ies of secondary liability, and because we nd below that it was error to grant summary judg ment to the companies on MGM' s inducement claim, we do not revisit Sony further, as MGM requests, to add a more quanti ed descr iption of the point of balance between protec tion and commerce when liability rests solely on distr ibuti on with knowledge that unlawfu l use will occur . It is enough to note that the Ninth Circuit' s judg ment rested on an erroneous underst andi ng of Sony and to leave further considerati on of the Sony rule for a day when that may be required. C Sony's rule limits imputi ng culpable intent as a matter of law from the charac teristics or uses of a distr ibuted produc t. But noth ing in Sony requires cour ts to ignore evidence of intent if there is such evidence , and the case was never meant to foreclose rules of fault-based liability derived PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t the common law.10 Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, supra, at 439 (\"If vicarious liability is to be imposed on Sony in this case , it must rest on the fact that it has sold equip\u00ad ment with constr uctive knowledge\" of the potentia l for in\u00ad fringement). where evidence goes beyond a produc t's charac teristics or the knowledge that it may be put to in\u00ad fringing uses, and shows statements or actions direc ted to promoti ng infringement, Sony's staple-ar ticle rule will not preclude liability. The classic case of direc t evidence of unlawfu l purpose occurs when one induces commissi on of infringement by another , or \"entic[ es] or persuad[ es] another \" to infringe, Black 's Law Dictionary 790 (8th ed. 2004), as by adver tising. Thus at common law a copyr ight or patent defendant who \"not only invoked [infringing use] by liable for infringement recog nized in every part of the law.\" Kalem Co. v. Harper Broth\u00ad ers, 222 U. S., at 62-63 (copyr ight infringement). See also Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S., at 48-49 (contr ibutory liability for patent infringement may be found where a good' s \"most conspicuous use is one which will coo\u00a8perate in an in\u00ad fringement when sale to such user is invoked by adver tise\u00ad ment\" of the infringing use); Thomson-Houston Electric Co. v. Kelsey Electric R. Spec ialty Co., 75 F. 1005, 1007 -1008 (CA2 1896) (rely ing on defendant' s \"willingness . to aid other persons in any at\u00ad tempts which they may be disposed to make towards [patent ] infringement\"); Rum ford Chemical Works v.

S. C. \u00a7 271(c), extend to those who induce GROKSTER , LTD. Opinion of the Cour t The rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no different today .11 Evidence of \"active steps . . . taken to encourage direc t infringement, \" Oak In\u00ad dustries, Inc. v. Zenith Electronics Corp., 697 F. Supp . 988, 992 (ND Ill. 1988), such as adver tising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, show an af\u00ad rmative intent that the produc t be used to infringe, and a show ing that infringement was encouraged overcomes the law's reluc tance to nd liability when a defendant merely sells a commercia l produc t suitable for some lawfu l use, see, e. g., Water Techno logies Corp. v. Calco, Ltd., 850 F. 2d 660, 668 (CA Fed. 1988) (liability for inducement where one \"ac\u00ad tively and know ingly 2d 407, 412-413 (CA5 1963) (demonstrati ons by sales staff of infringing uses suppor ted liability for induce\u00ad ment); Haworth Inc. v.

Supp . 1198, 1215 (ED Pa. 1978) (nding inducement where the use \"depic ted by the defendant in its promoti onal lm and brochures infringes the... patent\"), overr uled on other grounds, 608 F. 2d 87 (CA3 1979). Cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Kee\u00ad ton on Law of Torts 37 (5th ed. 1984) (\"There is a denite tendency to impose greater responsibi lity upon a defendant whose conduc t was intended to do harm, or was mora lly wrong \"). For the same reasons that Sony took the staple-ar ticle doc\u00ad trine of patent law as a model for its copyr ight safe-harbor rule, the inducement rule, too, is a sensible one for copyr ight. We adopt it here , holdi ng that one who distr ibutes a device with the objec t of promoti ng its use to infringe copyr ight, as 11 Inducement has been codied U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t shown by clear expressi on or other afrmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resu lting acts of in\u00ad fringement by third parties. We are, of course , mindfu l of the need to keep from trench ing on regular commerce or discourag ing the development of technolog ies with lawfu l and unlawfu l potentia l. ngly, just as Sony did not nd intenti onal inducement despite the knowledge of the VCR manufac turer that its device could be used to infringe, 464 U. S., at 439, n. 19, mere knowledge of infringing poten\u00ad tial or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subjec t a distr ibutor to liability. Nor would ordinary acts incident to produc t distr ibuti on, such as offer ing customers technica l suppor t or produc t updates, suppor t liability in themselves. The inducement rule, instead, premises liabil\u00ad ity on purposefu l, culpable expressi on and conduc t, and thus does noth ing to compromise legitimate commerce or discour\u00ad age innovati on having a lawfu l promise . III A The only apparent questi about MGM' to withst and summary judg ment under the theory of inducement goes to the need on MGM' s part to adduce evidence that StreamCast and Grokster communi\u00ad cated an induci ng message to their software users. The classic instance of inducement is by adver tisement or solici\u00ad tation that broadcasts a message desig ned to stimulate oth\u00ad ers to commit violati ons. MGM claims that such a message is shown here . It is undisputed that StreamCast beamed onto the computer screens of users of Napster-compatible programs ads urging the adopti on of its OpenNap program, which was desig ned, as its name implied, to invite the cus\u00ad tom of patrons of Napster , then under attack in the cour ts for facilitating massive infringement. Those who accepted StreamCast' s OpenNap program were offered software to perform the same serv ices, which a factnder LTD. Opinion of the Cour t would readi ly have been understood in the Napster market as the ability to download copyr ighted music les. Grokster distr to lar copy\u00ad righted music. And anyone whose Napster or free le\u00ad shar ing searches turned up a link to Grokster would have understood Grokster to be offer ing the same le-shar ing ability as Napster , and to the same people who probably used Napster for infringing downloads; that would also have been the underst andi ng of anyone offered Grokster 's , its versi on of OpenNap . And both companies communicated a clear message by respondi ng af\u00ad rmatively to requests for help play ing copy\u00ad righted mater ials. In StreamCast' s case , , the evidence just de\u00ad scribed was supplemented by other unequivoca l indicati ons of unlawfu l purpose in the inter nal communicati ons and ad\u00ad vertising desig ns aimed at Napster went off at Napster . . where did the users go?\" App. (ellipsis in original)). Whether the messages were commu\u00ad nicated is not to the point on this record. The func tion of the message in the theory of inducement is to prove by a defendant' s own statements that his unlawfu l purpose dis\u00ad qualies him from claiming protec tion (and incident ally to point to actual violators likely to be found among those who hear or read the message). See supra, at 935-937. Prov\u00ad ing that a message was sent out, then, is the preemi nent but not exclusive way of show ing that active steps were taken with the purpose of bringing about infringing acts, and of show ing that infringing acts took place by using the device distr ibuted. Here, the summary judg ment record is replete with other evidence that Grokster and StreamCast, unlike the manufac turer and distr ibutor in Sony, with a pur\u00ad pose to cause copyr ight violati ons by use of software suitable for illegal use. See supra, at U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly notable. First, each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyr ight infringe\u00ad ment, the market compr ising former Napster users. StreamCast' s inter nal documents made const ant reference to Napster , it initia lly distr ibuted its , it adver tised its its Morpheus software func tions as Napster did except that it could be used to distr ibute more kinds of les, includi ng copyr ighted mov ies and software programs. Grokster 's name is apparently derived from Napster , it too initia lly tion is like\u00ad wise comparable to Napster 's, and it attempted to diver t quer ies for Napster onto its own Web site. Grokster and StreamCast' s effor ts former Napster users, ived of a mechanism to copy and distr ibute what were over whelmi ngly infringing les, indicate a principa l, if not exclusive , intent on the part of each to bring about infringement. Second, this evidence of unlawfu l objec tive is given added signicance by MGM' s show ing that neither company at\u00ad tempted to develop ltering tools or other mechanisms to diminish the infringing activity using their software . While the Ninth Circuit treated the defendants' failure to develop such tools as irrele vant because they lacked an independent duty to monitor their users' activity, we think this evidence underscores Grokster 's and s intenti onal facilita\u00ad tion of their users' infringement.12 Third, there is a further complement to the direc t evidence of unlawfu l objec tive. It is usefu l to reca ll that StreamCast 12 Of course , in the absence of other evidence of intent, a cour t would be unable to nd contr ibutory infringement liability merely based on a failure to take afrmative steps to prevent infringement, if the device other wise was capable of subst antia l noni nfringing uses. Such a holdi ng would tread too close to the Sony safe LTD. Opinion of the Cour t and Grokster make money by selling adver tising space , by direc ting ads to the screens of computers employ ing their software . As the record shows, the more the software is used, the more ads are sent out and the greater the adver tis\u00ad ing revenue becomes. Since the extent of the software' s use deter mines the gain to the distr ibutors, the commercia l sense of their enter prise turns on high-volume use, which the record shows is infringing.13 This evidence alone would not justi fy an inference of unlawfu l intent, but viewed in the context of the entire record its impor t is clear . The unlawfu unmist akable . B In additi on to intent to bring about infringement and dis\u00ad tributi on of a device suitable for infringing use, the induce\u00ad ment theory of course requires evidence of actual infringe\u00ad ment by recipients of the device, the software in this case. As the account of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the adequacy of MGM' s show ing on this point in order to surv ive the companies' summary judg ment requests. Al\u00ad 13 Grokster and StreamCast contend that any theory of liability based on their conduc t is not proper ly before this Cour t because the rulings in the trial and appel late cour ts dealt only with the present versi ons of their software , not \"past acts . . . that allegedly encouraged infringement or assisted . . . known acts of infringement. \" Brief for Respondents 14; see also id., at 34. This contenti on misapprehends the basis for their potentia l liability. It is not only that encourag ing a particular consumer to infringe a copyr ight can give rise to secondary liability for the infringement that resu lts. Inducement liability goes beyond that, and the distr ibuti on of a produc t can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the dis\u00ad tributor intended and encouraged the produc t to be used to infringe. In such a case , the culpable act is not merely the encouragement of infringe\u00ad ment but also the distr ibuti on of the tool intended for infringing use. See Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers, 222 U. S. 55, 62-63 (1911); Cable/Home Commun 948 PGT: OPIN Cite U. S. 913 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t though an exac t calculation of infringing use, as a basis for a claim of damages, is subjec t to dispute , there is no questi on that the summary judg ment evidence is at least adequate to entitle MGM to go forward with claims for damages and equit able relief. * * * In sum, this case is signicantly different from Sony and reliance on that case to rule in favor of StreamCast and Grokster was error . Sony dealt with a claim of liability based solely on distr ibuti ng a produc t with alternative lawfu l and unlawfu l uses, with knowledge that some users would follow the unlawfu l course . The case struck a balance be\u00ad tween the interests of protec tion and innovati imput ation of fault and consequent sec\u00ad ondary liability for the unlawfu l acts of others. MGM' s evidence in this case most obviously addresses a different basis of liability for distr ibuti ng a produc t open to alternative uses. Here, evidence of the distr ibutors' words and deeds going beyond distr ibuti on as such shows a purpose to cause and prot from third-par ty acts of copyr ight induci ng infringement is ulti\u00ad mately found, it will not be on the basis of presumi ng or imputi ng fault, but from inferr ing a patently illegal objec tive from statements and actions show ing what that objec tive was. There is subst antia l evidence in MGM' s favor on all ele\u00ad ments of inducement, and summary judg ment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was error On remand, reconsid\u00ad of MGM' s moti on for summary judg ment will be in order . The judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedi ngs consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. GROKSTER , LTD. Ginsburg, J., concurr ing Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join, concurr ing. I concur in the Cour t's decisi on, which vacates in full the judg ment of the Cour t of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit, ante, at 941, and write separately to clarify why I conclude that the Cour t of Appea ls misperceived, and hence misappl ied, our holdi ng in Sony Corp. of Ame rica v.

At bottom, howe ver labeled, the questi on in this case is whether Grokster and StreamCast are liable for the direc t infringing acts of others. Liabi lity under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encourag ing (or induci ng) in\u00ad fringement through speci c acts (as opinion develops) or on distr ibuti ng t copyr ights, if produc is not l\" or \"commercia lly signicant\" noni nfringing uses.

Draw ing an analogy to the staple article of commerce doctrine from patent law, 943 545US2 Unit: $U79 [03-28-08 15:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN U. S. 913 (2005) Ginsburg, J., concurr ing the Sony Cour t observed that the \"sale of an article . . . adapted to [a patent ] infringing use\" sufce \"to make the seller a contr ibutory infringer \" if the article \"is also adapted to other and lawfu l uses. \" Id., at 441 (quoti ng Henry v.

Thus, to resolve the Sony case , the Cour t explai ned, it had to deter mine \"whether the Betamax is capable of commercia lly signicant noni nfringing uses. \" Ibid.

Most purchasers used the Betamax princi\u00ad pally to engage in time-sh ifting, id., a use that \"plai nly satise[ d]\" the Cour t's standard, id., at 442. Thus, there was no need in Sony to \"give precise content to the questi on of how much J., concurr ing cially signicant. \" Ibid.1 Further development was left for later days and cases. The Ninth Circuit went astray , I will endeavor to explai n, when that cour t granted summary judg ment to Grokster and StreamCast on the charge of contr ibutory liability based on distr ibuti on of their software produc ts. Rely ing on its ear\u00ad lier opinion in A&M Reco rds, Inc. v.

Here, there has been no nding of any fair use and little beyond anecdot al evidence of noni nfringing uses. In nding uses, District Cour t and the Cour t of Appea ls appear to have relied largely on declara\u00ad tions submitted by the defendants. These declarati ons in\u00ad asser tions copyr ight owners author ize distr ibuti on of their works on the Inter net and that some publ ic domai n mater ial is avail\u00ad able through peer-to-peer networks includi ng those accessed through Grokster 's and StreamCast' s software . 380 F. 3d, 1161; 259 Supp StreamCast, in the Cour t of Appea ls' view, would be entitled to summary judg ment unless MGM could show that the software companies had knowledge of speci c acts of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge \u2014a standard the cour t held MGM could not meet. 380 F. 3d, v. , LTD.

Post, at 952-955. That survey identi ed 75% of the les avail\u00ad able through Grokster as copyr ighted works owned or control led by the plaintiffs, and 15% of the les as works likely copyr ighted. App. 439. As to the remai ning 10% of the les, \"there was not enough informati on to form reasonable conclusi ons either as to what those les even consisted of, and/or whether they were infringing or non-i nfringing.\" Id., at 479. Even assumi ng, as Justice Breyer does, that the Sony Cour t would have absolved Sony of contr ibutory liability solely on the basis of the use of the Betamax for author ized time-sh ifting, post, at 950-951, ment is not inevitably appropr iate here . Sony stressed that the plaintiffs there owned \"wel l below 10%\" of copyr ighted television programmi ng, 464 U. S., at 443, and found, based on trial testi mony from represent atives of the four major spor ts leagues and other indiv idua ls author ized consent to home recordi ng of their copyr ighted broadcasts, that a similar percent\u00ad age of program copy ing was author ized, id., at 424. Here, the plaintiffs allegedly control copyr ights for 70% or 75% of the mater ial exchanged through the Grokster and StreamCast software , 380 F. 3d 1154, 1158 (CA9 2004); App. 439, and the District Cour t does not appear to have relied on comparable testi mony about author ized v. GROKSTER , LTD. Ginsburg, J., concurr ing Even if the absolute number of noni nfringing les copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large , it does not follow that the produc ts are therefore put to subst antia l noni nfringing uses and are thus immune from liability. The number of noni nfringing copies may be reflec tive of, and dwar fed by, the huge total volume of les shared. Further, the District Cour t and the Cour t of Appea ls did not shar ply disti nguish between uses of Grokster 's and StreamCast' s software produc ts (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technolog y genera lly (which this case is not about). In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Grokster 's and StreamCast' s produc ts were , and had been for some time, over whelmi ngly used to infringe, ante, at 922-924; App. 434-439, 476-481, and that this infringement was the over whelmi ng source of revenue from the produc ts, 259 F. Supp . 2d, 1043 - 1044. Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufcient to demonstrate , beyond genui ne debate , a reasonable prospec l or commercia lly signicant noni nfringing uses were likely to develop over time. On this record, the District Cour t shou ld not have ruled dispositively on the contr ibutory infringement charge by granti ng judg ment to Grokster and StreamCast.4 If, on remand, the case is not resolved on summary judg\u00ad ment in favor of MGM based on Grokster and StreamCast actively induci ng infringement, the Cour t of Appea ls, I 4 The District Cour t's conclusi on that \"[p]laintiffs do not dispute that [d]efendants' software is being used, and could be used, for subst antia l noni 1029, (CD Cal. 2003); accord 380 F. 3d, at 1161, is, to say the least, dubi ous. In the cour ts below and in this Cour t, MGM has conti nuously disputed any such conclusi on.

Other Members of the Cour t, howe ver, take up the Sony questi on: whether Grokster 's produc t is or 'commercia lly signicant' noni nfringing uses. Ante, at 942 J., concurr ing) (quoti ng Sony, supra, at 442). And they answer that questi on by stating that the Cour t of Appea ls was wrong when it granted summary judg ment on the issue in Grokster 's favor . Ante, at 944. I write to explai n why I disagree with them on this matter . I The Cour t's opinion in Sony and the record evidence (as descr ibed and analyzed in the many briefs before us) to\u00ad gether convince me that the Cour t of Appea ls' conclusi on has adequate legal suppor t. A I begin with Sony's standard. In Sony, the Cour t consid\u00ad ered the potentia l copyr ight liability of a company that did not itself illegally copy protec ted mater ial, but rather sold a mach ine\u2014a videocassette recorder (VCR)\u2014that could be used to do so. A buyer could use that mach ine for non\u00ad infringing purposes, such as recordi ng for later viewing (someti mes called \" 'time-sh ifting,' \" Sony, 464 U. S., at 421) uncopyr ighted television programs or copyr ighted programs with a copyr ight holder 's permissi buyer LTD. Breyer, J., concurr ing the mach ine for infringing purposes as well, such as building librar ies of taped copyr ighted programs. Or, the buyer might use the mach ine to record copyr ighted programs under circumst ances in which the legal status of the act of recordi ng was uncer tain (i. e., where the copy ing may, or may not, have constituted a \"fair use,\" id., at 425-426). Sony knew many customers would use its VCRs to engage in unauthor ized copy ing and \" 'library-bui lding.' \" Id., at 458-459 (Blackmun, J., dissenti ng). But that fact, said the Cour t, was insufcient to make Sony itself an infringer . And the Cour t ultimately held that Sony was not liable for its customers' acts of infringement. In reach ing this conclusi on, the Cour t recog nized the need for the law, in xing secondar y copyr ight liability, to \"strike a balance between a copyr ight holder 's legitimate demand for effec tive\u2014not merely symbol ic\u2014protec tion of the statu\u00ad tory monopoly , and the rights of others freely to engage in subst antia lly unrelated areas of commerce .\" Id., at 442. It pointed to patent law's \"staple article of commerce\" doctrine, ibid., under which a distr ibutor of a produc t is not liable for patent infringement by its customers unless that produc t is \"unsuited for any commercia l noni nfringing use.\" Dawso n Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 198 (1980). The Cour t wrote that the sale of copy ing equipment, \"like the sale of other articles of commerce , does not constitute contr ibutory infringement if the produc t is widely used for legitimate , unobjec tionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capabl e of substan tial noninfringing uses.\" Sony, 464 U. t ulti\u00ad mately charac terized the case as \"whether [Sony' s is capabl e of noninfringing uses\" give \"precise to these terms). Ibid. (emphasis added). It then appl ied this standard. The Cour t had before it a survey (commissi oned by the District Cour t and then pre\u00ad pared by the respondents) show ing that rough ly 9% of all 951 OPIN S. 913 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing VCR recordi ngs were of objec t to time-sh ifting. See Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1983, No. 81-1687, pp. 52-53; see also Sony, supra, at 424 (7.3% of all Sony VCR use is to record spor ts programs; represent a\u00ad tives of the spor ts leagues do not objec t). A much higher percent age of VCR users had at one point taped an author\u00ad ized program, in additi on to taping unauthor ized programs. And the plaintiffs\u2014not a large class of content prov iders as in this case \u2014owned only a small percent age of the total available unauthor ized programmi ng. See ante, at 947, n. 3 (Ginsburg, J., concurr ing). But of all the taping actually done by Sony' s customers, only around 9% was of the sort the Cour t referred to as author ized. The Cour t found that the ized pro\u00ad grammi ng and it also noted the \"signicant potentia l for future author ized copy ing.\" 464 U. S., at 444. The Cour t suppor ted this conclusi on represent ative . Id., at 444, and n. 24. It also discussed (1) a Los Angeles educati onal station afli\u00ad ated with the Publ ic Broadcasti ng Serv ice that made many of its programs available for home taping, and (2) Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, a widely watched children' s program. Id., at 445. On the basis of this testi mony and other similar evi\u00ad dence , the Cour t deter mined that producers of this kind had author ized dupl icati on of their copyr ighted enough numbers tial for a noni nfringing use of the\" VCR . Id., at 447, n. 28 (empha\u00ad sis added). The Cour t, in using the key word \"subst antia l,\" indicated that these circumst ances alone constituted a sufcient basis for rejecting the impositi on of secondary liability. See id., at 456 (\"Sony demonstrated a signicant likelihood that sub\u00ad Breyer, J., concurr ing to time-sh ifting (emphasis added)). Nonetheless, the Cour t buttressed its conclusi on by nding separately that, in any event, un-author Id., at 447-456. B When measured against Sony's under lying evidence and analysis, the evidence now before us shows that Grokster passes Sony's test\u2014that is, whether the company' s produc t is of subst antia l or commercia lly signicant non\u00ad infringing 442. thing, petiti oners' (herei nafter MGM) own exper t declared that 75% of current les available on Grokster are infringing and are \"likely infringing.\" \u00b6\u00b6 Dr. Olkin); cf. ante, at 922 (opinion of the Cour t). That leaves some number of les near 10% that apparently are noni n\u00ad fringing, a gure very similar to the 9% or so of author ized time-sh ifting uses of the VCR that the Cour t faced in Sony. As in Sony, witnesses here explai ned the nature of the noni nfringing les on Grokster 's network without detailed quanti cati on. Those les include: \u2014Author ized copies of music by artists such as Wilco, Janis Ian, Pearl Jam, Dave Matthews, John Mayer , and others. See App. Sinnreich ) (Wilco's \"lesson has already been adopted by artists still signed to their major labels\"); id., at 170, swappi ng); id., at 74, \u00b6 10 Daniel B. Rung) (descr ibing Grokster 's partnersh ip with a company that hosts music from thousands of independent artists) \u2014Free electronic books and other works from various online publ ishers, includi ng Projec (\"Numerous OPIN Breyer, J., concurr ing shar ing . . . using these meeti author ized software , such as WinZip 8.1.

Id., at 70, \u00b6 24 (Decl. of Sean L. Mayers). The nature of these and other lawfu lly swapped les is such that it is reasonable to infer quantities of current lawfu l use rough ly approxi mate to those at issue in Sony. At least, MGM has offered no evidence sufcient to surv ive summary judg ment that could plausibly demonstrate a signicant quantit ative difference . See ante, at 922 (opinion of the Cour t); see also Brief for Moti on Picture Studi o and Record\u00ad ing Company Petitioners i (referr ing to \"at least 90% of the total use of the serv ices\"); but see ante, at 947, n. 3 (Gins\u00ad burg, J., concurr ing). To be sure , in quantit ative terms these uses account for only a small percent age of the total number of uses of Grokster 's produc t. But the same was true in Sony, which charac terized the relatively limited au\u00ad thor as \"subst antia l.\" (The Cour t made clear as well in Sony that the amount of mater ial then pres\u00ad ently available for lawfu l copy ing\u2014i f not actually copied\u2014 was signicant, see 464 U. S., at 444, and the same is cer\u00ad tainly true in this case.) Impor tantly , Sony also used the word \"capable ,\" asking whether the produc t is \"capabl e of\" subst antia l noni nfring\u00ad ing uses. Its lang uage and analysis suggest that a gure like 10%, if xed for all time, might well prove insufcient, but that such a gure serves as an adequate foundati on where there is a reasonable prospec t of expanded legitimate uses over time. See ibid. (noting a \"signicant potentia l for future author ized J., concurr ing cates the appropr iateness of looking to potentia l future uses of the produc t to deter mine its \"capabi lity.\" Here the record reveals a signicant future market noni nfringing uses of Grokster-ty pe peer-to-peer software . Such software permits the exchange of any sort of digital le\u2014whether that le does, or does not, cont ain copyr ighted mater ial. As more and more uncopyr ighted informati on is stored in swappable form, it seems a likely inference that lawfu l peer-to-peer shar ing will become increasi ngly preva\u00ad lent. See, Busher) (sales of per month through peer-to-peer net\u00ad works \"will increase in the future as Acoustica' s trialware is more widely distr what is happeni ng.

See Brief for Distrib\u00ad uted Computi as Ami Merges, A New Dynamism in the OPIN U. S. 913 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing U. Chi. L. Rev. 183 (2004). I can nd noth ing in the record that suggests that this course of events will not conti nue to flow natura lly as a consequence of the charac ter of the soft\u00ad ware taken together with the foreseeable development of the Inter net and of informati on technolog y. Cf. ante, at 920 (opinion of the Cour t) (discussi ng the signicant benets other noni nfringing uses that develop for peer-to-peer software , just as the home\u00ad video rent al industry (unmenti oned in Sony) developed for the VCR . But the foreseeable development of such uses, when taken together with an estimated 10% noni nfringing mater ial, is sufcient to meet Sony's standard. And while Sony considered the record following a trial, there are no facts asser ted by MGM in its summary judg ment lings that lead me to believe the outcome after a trial here could be any different. The lower courts reached the same conclusi on. Of course , Grokster itself may not want to develop these other noni nfringing uses. But Sony's standard seeks to pro\u00ad tect not the Groksters of this world (which in any event may well be liable under today' s holdi ng), but the development of technolog y more genera lly. And Grokster 's desires in this respec t are beside the point. II The real questi on here , I believe, is not whether the record evidence satises Sony. As I have inter preted the standard set forth in that case , it does. And of the Cour ts of Appea ls that have considered the matter , only one has proposed inter\u00ad preti ng Sony more strictly than I would do\u2014in a case where the produc t might have failed under any standard. In re Aim ster Copyright Litigation, 334 F. 3d 643, 653 (CA7 2003) (defendant \"failed to show that its serv ice is ever used for any purpose other than to infringe\" copyr ights (emphasis added)); see Matthew Bende r & Co. v. West Pub. Co., 158 concurr ing F. 693, 706-707 (CA2 1998) (cour t noni nfringing uses be \"predomi nant, \" it merely found that they were predomi nant, and therefore prov ided no analysis of Sony's boundar ies); but see ante, at 944, n. 1 (Ginsburg, J., concurr ing); see also A&M Reco rds, Inc. v. Napste r, Inc., 239 Corp. Quaid Ltd., 847 F. 2d 255, 262 (CA5 1988) (same); cf. Dynacore Holdings Corp. v. U. S. Philips Corp., 363 F. 3d 1263, 1275 (CA Fed. 2004) (same); see also Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F. 3d 655, 661 (CA7 2003) (\"A person may be liable as a contr ibutory infringer if the produc t or serv ice it sells has no (or only slight) legal use\"). Instead, the real questi on is whether we shou ld modi fy the Sony standard, as MGM requests, or inter pret Sony more strictly, as I believe Justice Ginsburg 's approach would do in prac tice. Compare ante, at 944-948 (concurr ing opinion) (insufcient evidence in this case of both present lawfu l uses and of a reasonable prospec t that subst antia l noni nfringing uses would develop over time), with Sony, 464 U. S., at 442- 447 (basing conclusi on as to the likely existence of a subst an\u00ad tial market for author ized copy ing upon genera l declarati ons, some survey data, and common sense). As I have said, Sony itself sought to \"strike a balance be\u00ad tween a copyr ight holder 's legitimate demand for effec tive\u2014 not merely symbol ic\u2014protec tion of the statutory monopoly , and the rights of others freely to engage in subst antia lly un\u00ad related areas of commerce .\" Id., at 442. Thus, to deter\u00ad mine whether modi cati on, or a strict inter pret ation, of Sony is needed, I would ask whether MGM has shown that Sony incorrec tly balanced copyr ight and new-technolog y interests. In particular: (1) Has Sony (as I inter pret it) worked to pro\u00ad tect new technolog y? (2) If so, inter pret Cite U. S. 913 (2005) 957 Breyer, J., concurr ing so, would new or necessary copyr ight-related benets out\u00ad weigh any such weakeni ng? A The rst questi on is the easiest to answer . Sony's rule, as I inter pret it, has prov ided entrepreneurs with needed assurance that they will be shielded from copyr ight liability as they bring valuable new technolog ies to market. Sony's rule is clear. That clarity allows those who de\u00ad velop new produc ts noni uses to know ante, that distr ibuti on of their produc t will not yield massive monet ary liability. At the same time, it helps deter them from distr ibuti ng produc ts that speci that t's holdi ng today reinforces (by addi ng a weapon to the copyr ight holder 's legal arsena l). Sony's rule is strongly techno logy protecting. The rule deliberately makes it difcu lt for cour ts to nd secondary liability where new technolog y is at issue . It establishes that the law will not impose copyr ight liability upon the dis\u00ad tributors of dual-use technolog (who do not themselves en\u00ad gage in unauthor ized copy ing) unless the produc t in questi on will be used almost exclu sively to infringe copyr ights (or unless they actively induce infringements as we today de\u00ad scribe). Sony thereby recog nizes that the copyr ight laws are not intended to discourage or to control the emergence of new technolog ies, includi ng (perhaps especia lly) those that help dissemi nate informati on and ideas more broadly or more efciently . Thus Sony's rule shelters VCRs, typewr iters, tape recorders, photocopiers, computers, cassette players, compac t disc burners, digital video recorders, MP3 players, Inter net search engines, and peer-to-peer software . But Sony's rule does not shelter descramblers, even if one could theoretically use a descrambler in noni v. GROKSTER , LTD. Breyer, J., concurr ing Compare Cable/Home Commun supra, tising television signal descrambler), with Vault Corp., supra, at 262 (primary use infringing but a subst antia l noni nfringing use). Sony's rule is forward looking. It does not con ne its scope to a static snapshot of a produc t's current uses (thereby threateni ng technolog ies that have unde veloped fu\u00ad ture markets). Rather , as the VCR example makes clear , a produc t's market can evolve dramatica lly over time. And Sony\u2014by referr ing to a to a plausible , not simply a theoretica l, likelihood that such uses will come to pass, and that fact anchors Sony in prac tical reality. Cf. Aim ster, 334 F. 3d, at 651. Sony's rule is mind ful of the limitations facing judges where matters of techno logy are concerned. Judges have no specia lized technica l ability to answer questi ons future technolog ical feasib capit alists themselves may lly disagree and where answers may differ dependi ng upon whether one focuses upon the time of produc t development or the time of distr i\u00ad bution. Consider , for example , the questi on whether de\u00ad vices can be added to Grokster 's software that will lter out infringing les. MGM tells us this is easy enough to do, as do severa l amici that produce and sell the ltering technol\u00ad ogy. See, e. g., Brief for Moti on Picture Studi o and Record\u00ad ing Company Petitioners 11; Brief for Audible Mag ic Corp. et al. as Ami ci Curiae 3-10. Grokster says it is not at all easy to do, and not an efcient soluti on in any event, and severa l apparently disinterested computer science professors agree . See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for Computer Science Professor Harold Abelson et al. as Ami ci Curiae 6-10, 14-18. Which account shou ld a judge credit? Sony says that the judge will not necessar ily have to U. S. 913 (2005) 959 Breyer, J., concurr ing Given the nature of the Sony rule, it is not surprising that in the last 20 years, there have been relatively few contr ibu\u00ad tory infringement suits\u2014based on hand\u00ad ful of federa l appel late cour t cases and perhaps fewer than two dozen District Cour t cases in the last 20 years). I have found noth ing in the briefs or the record that shows that Sony has failed to achieve its innovati on-protec ting objec tive. B The second, more difcu lt, questi on is whether a modi ed Sony rule (or a strict inter pret ation) would signicantly weaken the law's ability to protec t new technolog y. Jus\u00ad tice Ginsburg 's approach would require defendants to produce considerably more concrete evidence \u2014more than was presented here \u2014to earn Sony's shelter . That heav ier evidentiary demand, dramatic (case\u00ad by-case balanci ons that MGM and the Gover n\u00ad ment seek, would, I believe, undercut the protec tion that Sony now offers. To require defendants to prov ide, for example , detailed evidence \u2014say make life easier for copyr ight holder plaintiffs. But it would simultaneously increase the legal uncer tainty that surrounds the creati on or development of a new technol\u00ad ogy capable of being put to infringing uses. Inventors and entrepreneurs (in the garage , the dorm room, the corporate lab, or the boardroom ) would have to fear (and in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials when they create , pro\u00ad duce , or distr ibute the sort of technolog y that can be used for copyr ight infringement. They would often be left guessi ng as to how a cour t, upon later review of the produc t and its uses, would decide when necessar ily rough estimates amounted to sufcient evidence. They would have no way to predic t how cour LTD. Breyer, J., concurr ing tive values of infringing and noni nfringing changes; or assess a produc t's potentia l future markets. The price of a wrong guess\u2014 even if it involves a good-faith effor t to assess technica l and commercia l viability\u2014 could be large statutory damages (not less than $750 and up to $30,000 per infringed work). 17 U. S. C. \u00a7 504(c)(1). The additi onal risk and un\u00ad certainty would mean a consequent additi onal chill of techno\u00ad logical development. C The third questi on\u2014whether a positive y-related the most difcu lt of the three . I do not doubt that a more intrusive Sony test would genera lly prov ide greater revenue secur ity for copyr ight holders. But it is harder to conclude that the gains on the copyr ight swings would exceed the losses on the technolog y roundabouts. For one thing, the law disfavors equati ng the two different kinds of gain and loss; rather , it leans in favor of protec ting technolog y. As Sony itself makes clear , the producer of a technolog y which permits unlawfu l copy ing does not himself engage in unlawfu l copy ing\u2014a fact that makes the attach\u00ad ment of copyr ight to the creati tion, on of the technolog y an excepti onal See 464 ibuti on of new technolog ies). Moreover , Sony has been the law for some time. And that fact imposes a serious burden upon copyr ight holders like MGM to show a need for change in the current rules of the game , includi ng a more strict inter pret ation of the test. See, e. g., Brief for Moti on Picture Studi o and Recordi ng Company (Sony ts when the \"primary or principa l\" use is infringing). In any event, the evidence now available does not, in my view, make out a sufciently strong case for change . To OPIN U. S. 913 (2005) Breyer, J., concurr ing this is not to doubt the basic need to protec t copyr ighted mater ial from infringement. The Constituti on itself stresses the vital role that copyr ight plays in advanci ng the \"usefu l Arts.\" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8. No one disputes that \"re\u00ad ward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the publ ic of the produc ts of his creative genius. \" United States v. Paramo unt Pictures , Inc., 334 U. S. 131, 158 (1948). And deliberate unlawfu l copy ing is no less an unlawfu l taking of proper ty than garden-var iety theft. See, e. g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ment can be a predicate act under the Racketeer Influenced and Corr upt Organi zations Act); \u00a7 1956( c)(7)(D ) (2000 ed., Supp . II) (money launder ing includes the receipt of proceeds from copyr ight infringement). But these highly genera l principles cannot by themselves tell us how to balance the interests at issue in Sony or whether Sony's standard needs modi cati on. And at certain key points, informati on is lacking. Will an unmodi ed Sony lead to a signicant diminution in the amount or quality of creative work produced? Since copyr ight' s basic objec tive is creati on and its revenue objec\u00ad tives but a means to that end, this is the under lying copy\u00ad right questi on. See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U. S. 151, 156 (1975) (\"Creative work is to be en\u00ad couraged and rewarded, but private motivati on must ulti\u00ad mately serve the cause of promoti ng broad publ ic availability of literature , music, and the other arts\"). And its answer is far from clear . Unauthor ized copy ing likely diminishes industry revenue , though it is not clear by how much. Compare S.

Inter net serv ice prov iders (ISPs), in turn, link those calls to the Inter net network, not only by prov iding a physica l connec tion, but also by offer ing consumers the ability to translate raw data into informati on they may both view on their own computers and transmit to others connec ted to the Inter net. Techno\u00ad logical limitations of local telephone wires, howe ver, retard the speed at which Inter net data may be transmitted through such \"narrowband\" connec tions. \"Broadband\" Inter net serv ice, by contrast, transmits data at much higher speeds. There are two principa l kinds of broadband serv ice: cable modem serv ice, which transmits data between the In\u00ad ternet and users' computers via the network of television cable lines owned by cable companies, and Digital Subscr iber Line (DSL) serv ice, which uses high-speed wires owned by local telephone companies. Other ways of transmitti ng networks, are also emerg ing. The Communicati ons Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunica\u00ad tions Act of 1996, denes two categor ies S.

These two classi cati ons originated in the late 1970' s, as the Commissi on developed rules to regulate data-processi ng serv ices offered over telephone wires. Regulated \"telecommunicati ons serv ice\" under the 1996 Act is the ana\u00ad log to \"basic serv ice\" under the prior regime, the Compu ter rules. *Together with No. 04-281, Federal Commun ications Commissio n et al. v.

Under the 1996 Act, \"[i]nfor mati on serv ice\" is the analog to \"enhanced\" serv ice, dened computer\u00ad processi that act on the subscr iber's informati on, such as voice and data storage serv ices, as well as \"protocol conversi on,\" i. e., the ability to communicate between networks that employ different data-transmissi on formats. In the Decl aratory Ruling under review, the Commissi on classi ed broadband cable modem serv ice as an \"informati on serv ice\" but not a \"telecommunicati ons serv ice\" under the 1996 Act, so that it is not sub\u00ad ject to mandatory Title II common-carr ier regulation. The Commissi on relied heav ily on its Unive rsal Service Report, which earlier classi ed \"non-faci lities-based\" ISPs\u2014those that do not own the transmissi on facilities they use to connec t the end user to the Inter net\u2014solely as informati on-serv ice prov iders. Because capabi lity for manipu lating and storing informati on, the on concluded, it was an \"informati on serv ice.\" However, the integrated nature of such access and the high-speed wire used to prov ide it led the Commissi on to conclude that cable companies prov iding the Commissi on held that cable companies offer ing broadband In\u00ad ternet access, like non-faci lities-based ISPs, do not offer the end user telecommunicati ons serv ice, but merely use telecommunicati ons to pro\u00ad vide end users with cable modem serv ice. Numerous parties petiti oned for review. By judicia l lottery , the Cour t of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit was selec ted as the venue for the challenge . That cour t granted the petiti ons in part, vacated the Decl aratory Ruling in part, and remanded for further proceedi ngs. In particular, the cour t held that the Commissi on could not permissibly constr ue the Communicati ons Act to exempt cable companies prov iding cable modem serv ice from mandatory Title II regulation.

See, e. g., Verizon Commun ications Inc. v. FCC , 535 U. S. 467, 498. It is common usage to descr ibe what a company \"offers\" to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the integrated nished produc t, even to the exclusi on of discrete components that compose the produc t. What cable companies prov iding cable modem serv ice \"offer \" is nished Inter net serv ice, though they do so using the discrete components composi ng the end produc t, includi ng data transmissi func suppor ts the conclusi on that the Communicati ons Act is ambig uous about whether cable companies \"offer \" telecommunica\u00ad tions with cable modem serv ice. Congress passed the Act's denitions against the background of this regulatory history , and it may be as\u00ad sumed that and \"enhanced\" That history in at least two respec ts conr ms that the term \"telecommunicati is ambig uous. First, in the Compu ter II order establishing the terms \"basic \" and \"enhanced\" serv\u00ad ices, the Commissi on dened consumer interac ts with prov ided informati on, just as the Commis\u00ad sion did in the order under review. Cable modem serv ice is not \"trans\u00ad parent\" in terms of tion with customer-suppl on; tion with informati on processi ng. It was therefore consistent with the statute' s terms for the Commissi on to assume that the para ons path not in an integrated informati on\u00ad processi ng serv ice from Commissi ier regulation. That his\u00ad tory suggests, in turn, that the Act does not unambig uously classi fy non-faci lities-based ISPs as S. 967 (2005) Syllabus communicati ons,\" it also does denitions do not disti nguish the two types of carriers. The Act's silence suggests, instead, that the Commissi on has the discreti on to ll the statutory gap. Pp. 992-997. (c) The Commissi on's inter pret ation is also permissible at Chev\u00ad ron's step two because it is \"a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make ,\" 467 U. S., at 845. Respondents argue unpersuasively that the Commissi on's constr uction is municati ons prov ider to evade common-carr ier regulation by bundl ing informati on serv ice with telecommunicati ons. That resu lt does not follow from the inter pret ation adopted in the Decl aratory Rul\u00ad ing. The Commissi on classi ed cable serv ice solely as an infor\u00ad mati on serv ice because the telecommunicati ons input used to prov ide cable modem serv ice is serv ice's data-processi ng capabi lities, but part and parcel of that serv ice and integra l to its other capabi lities, and therefore is not a telecommunicati ons offer ing. This constr uction does not leave all informati on-serv ice offer ings unreg\u00ad ulated under Title II. It is plain, for example , that a local telephone company cannot escape regulation by packag ing its telephone serv ice with voice mail because such packag ing transparent transmis\u00ad sion on used ide cable modem serv ice is a func tionally integrated component of Inter net serv ice because it transmits data only in connec tion with the further processi ng of infor\u00ad mati on and is necessary such serv ice. The Commissi on's constr uction therefore was more limited than respondents assume . Respondents' argument that cable modem serv ice does, in fact, pro\u00ad vide \"transparent\" transmissi on from the consumer aken. Their charac terization of the \"informati on-serv ice\" offer ing of Inter net access as consisti ng only of access to a cable company' s e-mai l serv ice, its Web page , and the ability it prov ides to create a per\u00ad sona l with the Commissi on's reasonable underst and\u00ad ing of the nature of Inter net serv ice. When an end user accesses a third party's Web site, the Commissi on concluded, he is equa lly using the informati on serv ice prov ided by the cable company as when he ac\u00ad cesses that company' s own Web site, its e-mai l serv ice, or his persona l Web page . As the Commissi on recog nized, the serv ice that Inter net access prov iders offer the publ ic is Inter net access, not a transpar\u00ad ent ability (from the end user 's perspec TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Syllabus 3. The Cour t rejects respondent MCI, Inc.'s argument that the Com\u00ad missi on's treatment of cable modem serv ice is inconsistent with its treat\u00ad ment of DSL serv ice and is therefore an arbitrary and capr icious deviation from agency policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, see 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). MCI points out that when local telephone companies began to offer Inter net access through DSL technolog y, the Commissi on required them to make the telephone lines used to prov ide DSL available to competi ng ISPs on nondiscr iminatory , common-carr ier terms. Respondents claim that the Commissi on has not adequately ex\u00ad plained its decisi on not to regulate cable companies similarly. The Cour t thinks that the Commissi on has prov ided a reasoned expla\u00ad nation for this decisi on. The traditi onal reason for its Compu ter II common-carr ier treatment of facilities-based carriers was that the tele\u00ad phone network was the primary , if not the exclusive , means through which informati on-serv ice prov iders could gain access to their custom\u00ad ers. The Commissi on appl ied the same treatment to DSL serv ice based on that history , rather than on an analysis of contemporaneous market conditi ons. The Commissi on's Decl contrast, con\u00ad cluded that changed market conditi ons warrant different treatment of cable modem serv ice. Unlike at the time of the DSL order , substitute forms of Inter net transmissi on exist today , includi ng The therefore concluded that broadband serv ices shou ld exist in a minimal regulatory environ\u00ad ment that promotes investment and innovati on in a competitive market.

II At issue in these cases is the proper regulatory classi ca\u00ad tion under the Communicati ons Act of broadband cable In\u00ad ternet serv ice. The Act, as amended by the Telecommunica\u00ad tions Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, denes two categor ies of regulated entities relevant to these telecommunica\u00ad tions carriers and informati on-serv ice prov not on\u00ad serv ice prov iders, as common carriers. Telecommunicati ons carriers, for example , must charge just and reasonable , non\u00ad discr iminatory rates to their customers, 47 U. S.

By \"pure\" or \"transparent\" transmissi on, the Commissi on meant a communicati ons path that enabled the consumer to trans\u00ad mit an ordinary-lang uage message to another point, with no computer processi ng or storage of the informati on, other than the processi ng or storage needed to convert the mes\u00ad sage into electronic form and then back into ordinary lan\u00ad guage for purposes of transmitti ng it over the network\u2014 such as via a telephone or a facsi mile.

Id., at 434, \u00b6 129.

In September 2000, the Commissi on initiated a rulemak ing proceedi ng to, among other things, apply these classi cati ons to cable companies that offer broadband Inter net serv ice di\u00ad rectly to consumers. In March 2002, that rulemak ing culmi\u00ad nated in the Decl aratory Ruling under review in these cases. In the Ruling, TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t cluded that broadband Inter net serv ice prov ided by cable companies is an \"informati but not a \"telecommu\u00ad nicati ons serv ice\" under the Act, and therefore not subjec t to mandatory Title II common-carr ier regulation. In sup\u00ad port of this conclusi on, the Commissi on relied heav ily on its Universal Service Report. See Decl aratory Ruling 4821 - 4822, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 Report classi ed \"non-faci lities-based\" ISPs\u2014 those that do not own the transmissi on facilities they use to connec t the end user to the Inter net\u2014solely as informati on\u00ad serv ice prov iders. See Universal Service Report 11533, \u00b6 67. Unlike those ISPs, cable companies own the cable lines they use to prov ide Inter net access. Nevertheless, in the Decl aratory Ruling, the Commissi on found no basis in the statutory denitions for ng cable serv ice that enables the subscr iber to utilize Inter net access serv ice . . . and to realize the ice offer ing.\" Decl aratory 4823, for manipu lating and storing informati on, the Commissi on concluded that it was an informati on serv ice. Ibid. The integrated nature of Inter net access and the high\u00ad speed wire used to prov ide Inter net access led the Commis\u00ad sion to conclude that cable companies prov iding cess are iders. This conclusi on, the Commissi on reasoned, followed from the logic of the Uni\u00ad versal Service Report. The Report had concluded that, though Inter net serv ice \"involves data transpor t elements\" because \"an Inter net access prov ider must enable the move\u00ad ment of informati on between customers' own computers and distant computers with which those customers seek to inter\u00ad act,\" it also -11540, 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t \u00a7 153(46), and so were not proper ly classi ed as telecommuni\u00ad cations carriers, see id., at 11540, \u00b6 81. In other words, the Commissi on reasoned that consumers use their cable mo\u00ad dems not to transmit informati on \"transparently ,\" such as by using a telephone , but instead to obtain Inter net access. The Commissi on appl ied this same reasoni ng to cable com\u00ad panies offer ing broadband Inter net access. Its logic was that, like non-faci lities-based ISPs, cable companies do not \"offe[ r] telecommunicati ons serv ice to the . . . merely us[e] telecommunicati ons serv ice.\" Decl aratory Ruling 4824, \u00b6 declined to apply man\u00ad datory Title II common-carr ier regulation to cable compa\u00ad nies, it invited comment on whether under its Title I jurisdic\u00ad tion it shou ld require cable companies to offer other ISPs access to their facilities on common-carr ier terms. Id., at 4839, \u00b6 72. Numerous parties petiti oned challeng ing the Commissi on's conclusi on that cable modem serv ice was telecommunicati ons serv ice. By judicia l lot\u00ad tery, the Cour t of Appea ls for the Ninth Circuit was selec ted as the venue for the challenge . The Cour t of Appea ls granted the petiti ons in part, va\u00ad cated the Decl aratory Ruling in part, and remanded to the Commissi on for further proceedi ngs. In particular, the Cour t of Appea ls vacated the ruling to the extent it con\u00ad cluded that cable modem serv ice was not \"telecommunica\u00ad tions serv ice\" under the Communicati ons Act. It that the Commissi on could not permissibly constr ue the Commu\u00ad nicati ons Act to exempt cable companies prov iding Inter net serv ice from Title II regulation. See 345 F. 3d, at 1132. Rather than analyzing the permissibi lity of that constr uction under the deferentia l framework of Chevro n, 467 U. S. 837, howe ver, the Cour t of Appea ls grounded its holdi ng in the stare decisis effec t of AT&T Corp. v. Portland, 216 F. 3d 871 (CA9 2000). See 345 F. 3d, at 1128 -1132. Portland held that cable modem serv TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t ice,\" though the cour t in that case was not reviewing an ad\u00ad ministrative proceedi ng and the Commissi on was not a party to the case. See 216 F. 3d, at 877-880. Nevertheless, Port\u00ad land's holdi ng, the Cour t ls reasoned, overrode the contrary inter pret ation reached by the Commissi on in the Decl aratory Ruling. See 345 F. 3d, at 1130 -1131. We granted certiorar i to settle the impor tant questi ons of federa l law that these cases present. 543 U. S. 1018 (2004). III We rst consider whether we shou ld apply Chevro n's framework to the Commissi on's ation of the term \"telecommunicati ons serv ice.\" We conclude that we shou ld. We also conclude that the Cour t of Appea ls shou ld have done the same , instead of following the contrary constr uction it adopted in Portland. A In Chevro n, this Cour t held that ambig uities in within s jurisdic tion to admi nister are delegati ons of author ity to the agency to ll the statutory gap in rea\u00ad sonable fashion. Filling these gaps, the Cour t explai ned, involves difcu lt policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than cour ts. 467 U. S., at 865-866. If a statute is ambig uous, and if a federa cour t to accept the agency' s constr uction of the statute , even if the agency' s readi ng differs from what the cour t believes is the best statutory inter pret ation. Id., at 843-844, and n. 11. The Chevro n framework gover ns our review of the Com\u00ad Congress has delegated author ity to \"execute and enforce\" the Commu\u00ad nicati ons Act, \u00a7 151, and to \"prescr ibe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the publ ic interest to carry out the prov isions\" of the Act, \u00a7 201(b); AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 377-378 (1999). These prov isions give the Commissi on U. S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t binding legal rules; the Commissi on issued the order under review in the exercise of that author ity; and no one questi ons that the order is within the Commissi on's jurisdic tion. See Househo ld Credit Services, Pfenn ig, 541 U. S. 232, 238-239 (2004); United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 231-234 (2001); Christen sen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 586-588 (2000). Hence , as we have in the past, we apply the Chevro n framework to the Commissi on's inter pret ation of the Communicati ons Act. See National Cable & Telecom\u00ad mun ications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333-339 (2002); Verizon, 535 U. S., at 501-502. Some of the respondents dispute this conclusi on, on the ground that the Commissi on's inter pret ation is inconsistent with its past prac tice. We reject this argument. Agency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to analyze the agency' s inter pret ation under the Chevro n framework. Un\u00ad explai ned inconsistency is, at most, a reason for holdi ng an inter pret ation to be an arbitrary and capr icious change from agency prac tice under the Administrative Procedure Act. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automob ile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 46-57 (1983). For if the agency adequately explai ns the reasons for a rever\u00ad sal of policy, \"change is not invalidati ng, since the whole point of Chevro n is to leave the discreti on prov ided by the ambig uities of a statute with the implementi ng agency .\" Smiley v. Citibank (South Dako ta), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996); see also Rust v. Sull ivan, 500 U. S. 173, 186-187 (1991); Barnhar t v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 226 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurr ing in part and concurr ing in judg ment). \"An ini\u00ad tial agency inter pret ation is not instantly carved in stone . On the contrary , the agenc y... must consider vary ing inter\u00ad pret ations and the wisdom of its policy on a conti nuing basis, \" Chevro n, supra, at 863-864, for example , in response to changed factual circumst ances, or a change in admi nistra\u00ad tions, see State Farm, supra, at 59 (Rehnquist , J., concur\u00ad ring in part and dissenti ng in part). That is no $U80 [03-28-08 16:00:53] TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t in Chevro n itself, this Cour t deferred to an agency inter pre\u00ad tation that was a recent reversa l of agency policy. See 467 U. S., at 857-858. We therefore have no difcu lty conclud\u00ad ing that Chevro n appl ies. B The Cour t of Appea ls declined to apply Chevro n because it thought the Commissi on's inter pret ation of the confl icting constr uction of the Act it had adopted in Portland. See 345 F. 3d, at 1127 -1132. It based that holdi ng on Portland's con\u00ad struction overrode the Commissi on's, regardless of whether Portland had held the statute to be unambig uous. 345 F. 3d, at 1131. That reasoni ng t. A cour t's prior judicia l constr uction of a statute trumps an agency constr uction other wise entitled to Chevro n deference only if the prior cour t decisi on holds that its constr uction follows from the unambig uous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discreti on. This principle follows from Chevro n itself . Chevro n established a \"presumpti on that Congress, when it left ambig uity in a statute meant for implement ation by an agency , understood that the ambig uity would be resolved, rst and foremost, by the agency , and desired the agency (rather than the cour ts) to possess what\u00ad ever degree of discreti on the ambig uity allows. \" Smiley, supra, at 740-741. Yet allowing a judicia l precedent to fore\u00ad close an agency from inter preti ng an ambig uous statute , as the Cour t of Appea ls assumed it could, would allow a cour t's inter pret ation to overr ide an agency' s. Chevro n's premise is that it is for agencies, not cour ts, to ll statutory gaps. See 467 U. S., at 843-844, and n. 11. The better rule is to hold judicia l inter pret ations cont ained in precedents to the same demandi ng Chevro n step one standard that appl ies if the cour t is reviewing the agency' s constr uction on a blank slate: Only a judicia l PGT: OPIN Cite (2005) Opinion of the Cour t unambig uously forecloses and therefore cont ains no gap for the to ll, displaces a confl icting agency constr uction. A contrary rule would produce anoma lous resu lts. It would mean that whether an agency' s inter pret ation of an ambig uous statute is entitled to Chevro n deference would turn on the order in which the inter pret ations issue: If the cour constr uction would pre\u00ad vail, whereas if the agency' s came rst, the agency' s con\u00ad struction would command Chevro n deference . Yet whether Congress has delegated to an agency the author ity to inter\u00ad pret a statute does not depend on the order in which the judicia l and admi nistrative moreover , would \"lead to the ossicati on of large portions of our statutory law,\" Mead, 533 U. S., at 247 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng), by precludi ng agencies n the doctrine of stare decisis requires these haphazard resu lts. The dissent answers that allowing an agency to overr ide what a cour t believes to be the best inter pret ation of a stat\u00ad ute makes \"judicia l t to l by execu\u00ad tive ofcers. \" Post, at 1016 (opinion of Scalia, J.). It does not. Since Chevro n teaches that a cour t's opinion as to the best readi ng of an ambig uous statute an agency is charged with admi nister ing is not author itative , the agency' s decisi on to constr ue that statute differently from a cour t does not say that the cour t's holdi ng was legally wrong . Instead, the agency may, consistent with the cour t's holdi ng, choose a dif\u00ad ferent ns the author ita\u00ad tive inter preter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes. In all other respec ts, the cour t's prior ruling remai ns binding law (for example , as to agency inter pret ations to which Chev\u00ad ron is inappl icable). The precedent has not been \"reversed\" by the agency , any more than a federa l cour t's inter pret ation of a State's law can be said to been \"reversed\" 545US2 Unit: $U80 [03-28-08 TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t state cour t that adopts a confl icting (yet author itative) inter\u00ad pret ation of state law. The Cour t of Appea ls derived a contrary rule from a mis\u00ad taken readi ng of this Cour t's decisi ons. It read Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284 (1996), to establish that a prior judicia l constr uction of a statute categor ically controls an agency' contrary constr uction. 345 F. 3d, at 1131 -1132; see also post, at 1016, n. 11 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng). Neal es\u00ad tablished no such propositi on. Neal declined to defer to a constr uction adopted by the United States Sentenci ng on that confl icted with one the Cour t previously had adopted in Chapm an v. United States, 500 U. S. 453 (1991). Neal, supra, at 290-295. Chapm an, howe ver, had held the relevant statute to be unambig uous. See 500 U. S., at 463 (declining to apply the rule of lenity given the statute' s clear lang uage). Thus, Neal established only that a precedent holdi ng a statute to be unambig uous agency constr uction. That ng accorded with this Cour t's prior decisi ons, which had held that a cour t's inter pret ation of a statute trumps an agency' s under the doc\u00ad trine of stare decisis only if the prior cour in Indu stries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990) (em\u00ad phasis added); see also Lechme re, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U. S. 527, 536-537 (1992). Those decisi ons allow a cour t's prior inter pret ation of a statute to overr ide an agency' s inter pre\u00ad tation only if the relevant cour t decisi on held the statute unambig uous. Agai nst this background, the Cour t of Appea ls erred in refusi ng to U. S. C. \u00a7 153(46). Its prior decisi on in Portland held only that the best readi ng of \u00a7 153(46) was that cable modem serv\u00ad ice was a \"telecommunicati ons serv ice,\" not that it was the only permissibl e readi ng of the statute . See 216 F. 3d, at 877-880. Nothing in Portland held that S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t tions Act unambig uously telec ommunications carriers. Instead, the cour t noted that it was \"not presented with a case involv ing potentia l deference to an admi nistrative agency' statutory constr uction pursuant to n doctrine,\" id., at 876; and the cour t invoked no other rule of constr uction (such as the rule of lenity) requir ing it to conclude that the statute was unambig uous to reach its judg ment. Before a judicia constr uction of a statute , whether cont ained in a precedent or not, may trump an agency' s, the cour t must hold that the statute unambig uously requires the cour t's constr uction. Portland did not do so. As the dissent points out, it is not logically necessary for us to reach the questi on whether the Cour t of Appea ls mis\u00ad appl ied Chevro n for us to decide whether the Commissi on acted lawfu lly. See post, at 1019 -1020 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Nevertheless, it is no \"great mystery\" why we are reach ing the point here . Post, at 1019. There is genui ne confusi on in the lower cour ts over the interac tion between the Chevro n doctrine and stare decisis principles, as the peti\u00ad tioners informed us at the certiorar i stage of this litigati on. See Pet. for Cert. of Federa l Communicati ons Commissi on et al. pp. Cert. of Nati et al. in No. 04-277, pp. 22-29. The point has been briefed. See Brief for Federa l Petition\u00ad ers 38-44; Brief for Cable-Industry Petitioners 30-36. And not reach ing the point could under mine the purpose of our grant of certiorar i: to settle author itatively whether the Commissi on's aratory Ruling is Were we to up\u00ad hold the Decl aratory Ruling without reach ing the Chevro n point, the Cour t of Appea ls could once again strike down the Commissi on's rule based on its Portland decisi on. Portland (at least arguably) could compel the Cour t of Appea ls once again to reverse the Commissi on despite our decisi on, since our conclusi on that it is reaso nable to read the Communica\u00ad tions Act to classi [03-28-08 TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t mati on serv the best readi ng of the statute . We have before decided similar questi ons that were not, strictly speak ing, necessary to our dispositi on. See, e. g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 237 (1997) (requir\u00ad ing the Cour ts of Appea ls to adhere to our direc tly control\u00ad ling precedents, even those that rest on reasons rejected in other decisi ons); Roper v. Simmo ns, 543 U. S. 551, 628-629 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng) (criticizing this Cour t for not reach ing the questi on whether the Missour i Supreme Cour t erred by failing to follow direc tly contro lling Supreme Cour t precedent, though that conclusi on was not necessary to the Cour t's decisi on). It is prudent for us to do so once again today . IV We next address whether the Commissi on's of the denition S. C. 153(46), is a permissible readi ng of the Communicati ons Act under the Chevro n framework. Chevro n established a fami liar two-step procedure for evaluati ng whether an agency' s inter pret ation of a statute is lawfu l. At the rst step, we ask whether the statute' s plain terms \"direc tly ad\u00ad dres[ s] the precise questi on at issue .\" 467 U. S., at 843. If the statute is ambig uous on the point, we defer at step two to the agency' s inter pret ation so long as the constr uction is \"a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make .\" Id., at 845. The Commissi on's inter pret ation is permissible at both steps. A We rst set forth our underst andi ng of the inter pret ation of the Communicati ons Act that the Commissi on embraced. The issue before the Commissi on was whether cable compa\u00ad nies prov U. S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t The Commissi on rst concluded that cable modem serv ice is an \"informati on serv ice,\" ing, storing, an informati on serv ice, the Commissi on reasoned, because it prov ides with a comprehensive capa\u00ad bility for manipu informati on using the Inter net via high-speed telecommunicati ons. That serv ice enables users, for example , to browse the World Wide Web, to transfer les from le arch ives available on the Inter net via the \"File Transfer Protocol, \" and to access e-mai l and Usenet news\u00ad groups. Decl 37; Universal Service Report 11537, \u00b6 76. Like other forms of Inter net serv ice, cable modem serv ice also gives users access to the Domai n Name System (DNS). DNS, among other things, matches the Web page addresses that end users type into their browsers (or \"click\" on) with the Inter net Protocol (IP) ad\u00ad dresses 1 of the servers cont aining the Web pages the users wish to access. Decl aratory Ruling 4821 -4822, \u00b6 37. All of these features, the Commissi on concluded, were part of the informati on serv ice that cable companies prov ide consumers. Id., at 4821 -4823, \u00b6\u00b6 \u00b6\u00b6 75-79. At the same time, the Commissi on concluded that cable modem serv ice was ions service.\" telecom\u00ad municati ons for a fee direc tly to the publ ic.\" 47 U. S. C. \"Telecommunicati ons,\" in turn, is dened as \"the transmissi on, between or among points speci ed by the user , of informati on of the user 's choosi ng, without change in the form or content of the informati on as sent and received. \" 1 IP addresses identi fy computers on the Inter net, enabl ing data packets transmitted from other computers to reach them. See Unive rsal Service TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t \u00a7 153(43). The Commissi on conceded that, like cable companies use \"telecom\u00ad prov consumers with Inter net serv ice; cable companies prov ide such serv ice via the high-speed wire that transmits signals to and from an end user 's computer . Decl aratory Ruling 4823, \u00b6 40. For the Commissi on, how\u00ad ever, the questi on whether cable broadband Inter net prov id\u00ad ers \"offer \" telecommunicati ons involved more than whether telecommunicati ons was one necessary component of cable modem serv ice. Instead, whether that serv ice also includes a telecommunicati ons \"offer ing\" \"turn[ed] on the nature of the func tions the end user is offered, \" id., at 4822, \u00b6 38 (em\u00ad phasis ice\" does the fa\u00ad cilities facil\u00ad ities used\"). Seen from the consumer 's point of view, the Commissi on concluded, cable modem serv ice is not a telecommunicati ons offer ing because the consumer uses the high-speed wire al\u00ad ways and because the trans\u00ad missi on is a necessary component of Inter net access: \"As prov ided to the end user the telecommunicati ons is part and parcel of cable modem serv ice and is integra l to its other capabi lities. \" Decl aratory Ruling 4823, \u00b6 39. The wire is used, in other words, to access the World Wide Web, news\u00ad groups, and so forth, rather than \"transparently\" to transmit and receive ordinary-lang uage messages without computer processi ng or storage of the message . See supra, at 976 (noting the Compu ter II notion of \"transparent\" transmis\u00ad sion). The integrated charac ter of this offer ing led the Commissi on to conclude that cable modem serv ice is not a \"stand-a lone,\" transparent offer U. S. 967 (2005) 989 Opinion of the Cour t B This constr uction passes Chevro n's rst step. Respond\u00ad ents argue that it does not, on the ground that cable compa\u00ad nies prov iding derlying telecommunicati transmit that serv ice. The word \"offer ing\" as used in \u00a7153(46), howe ver, does not unambig uously require that resu lt. Instead, \"offer ing\" can reasonably be read to mean a \"stand-a lone\" offer ing of tele\u00ad communicati ons, i. e., an offered serv ice that, from the user 's perspec tive, unadu lterated by computer processi only from dinary meani ng of the word \"offer ing,\" but also from the regulatory history of the Communicati ons Act. 1 Cable companies in the broadband Inter net serv ice busi\u00ad ness \"offe[ r]\" consumers an informati on serv ice in the form of Inter net access and they do so \"via telecommunicati ons,\" \u00a7 153(20), but it does not inexorably follow as a matter of ordinary lang uage that they also \"offe[ r]\" consumers the high-speed data transmissi on (telecommunicati ons) that is an input used to prov ide this serv ice, \u00a7 153(46). We have held that where a statute' s plain terms admit of two or more rea\u00ad sonable ordinary usages, the Commissi on's choice of one of them is entitled to deference . See Verizon, 535 U. S., at 498 (deferr ing to the Commissi on's inter pret ation of the term \"cost\" by reference to an alternative linguistic usage dened by what \"[a] merchant who is asked about 'the cost of prov id\u00ad ing the goods' \" might \"reasonably\" say); National Railroad Passenge r Corporation v. Bost on & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 418 (1992) (agency constr uction entitled to deference where there were \"alternative dictionary denitions of the word\" at issue). The term \"offe[ r]\" as used in the denition TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t It is common usage to descr ibe what a company \"offers\" to a consumer as what the consumer perceives to be the inte\u00ad grated nished produc t, even to the exclusi on of discrete components that compose the produc t, as the dissent con\u00ad cedes. See post, at 1006 -1007 (opinion of Scalia, J.). One might well say that a car dealersh ip \"offers\" cars, but does not \"offer \" the integrated major inputs that make purchasi ng the car valuable , such as the engine or the chassis. It would, in fact, be odd to descr ibe a car dealersh ip as \"offer\u00ad ing\" consumers the car's components in additi on to the car itself . Even if it is linguistica lly permissible to say that the car dealersh ip \"offers\" engines when it offers cars, that shows, at most, that the term \"offer ,\" when appl ied to a com\u00ad mercia the offered nished produc t, or the produc t's discrete components as well. It does not show that no other usage is permitted. The questi on, then, is whether the transmissi on component of cable modem serv ice is sufciently integrated with the nished serv ice to make it reasonable to descr ibe the two as a single, integrated offer ing. See ibid. We think that they are sufciently integrated, because \"[a] consumer uses the high-speed wire and be\u00ad cause the transmissi on is a necessary component of Inter net access. \" Supra, at 988. In the telecommunicati ons context, it is at least reasonable to descr ibe companies as not \"offer\u00ad ing\" to consumers each discrete input that is necessary to prov iding, and is always used in connec tion with, a nished serv ice. We think it no misuse of lang uage , for example , to say that cable companies prov iding Inter net serv ice do not \"offer \" consumers DNS, even though DNS is essentia l to prov iding Inter net -4823, \u00b6 38. ise, a telephone company \"offers\" consumers a transparent transmissi on path that conveys an ordinary-lang uage S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t transmissi on facilities that also \"transmi[ t] \u00a7 153(43), or other physica l elements of the facilities used to prov ide telephone serv ice, like the trunks and switches, or the copper in the wires. What cable companies prov iding cable modem serv ice and telephone companies prov iding telephone serv ice \"offer \" is Inter serv ice respec tively\u2014the nished serv ices, though ponents as disti nct \"offer ings.\" In dissent argues that the high-speed trans\u00ad missi on component necessary to prov iding cable modem serv ice is necessar ily \"offered\" with Inter net serv ice because cable modem serv ice is like the offer ing of pizza delivery serv ice together with pizza, and the offer ing of puppies to\u00ad gether with dog leashes. Post, at 1007 -1008 (opinion of Scalia, J.). The dissent' s appea l to these analogies only un\u00ad derscores that the term \"offer \" is ambig uous in the way that we have descr ibed. The entire questi on is whether the produc here are func tionally integrated (like the com\u00ad ponents of a car) or func tionally separate (like pets and leashes). That questi on turns not on the lang uage of the Act, but on the factual particulars of how Inter net technol\u00ad ogy works and how it is prov ided, questi ons Chevro n leaves to the Commissi on to resolve in the rst instance . As the Commissi on has candidly recog nized, \"the questi on may not always be straightfor ward whether , on the one hand, an en\u00ad tity is prov a communi\u00ad cations and computi ng components, or, on the is prov iding two disti nct serv ices, ons serv ice.\" Universal Service Report 11530, \u00b6 60. Because the term \"offer \" can someti mes refer to a single, nished produc t and someti mes to the \"indiv nents in a package being ng on whether the components TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t as separate objec ts,\" post, at 1006), fails unambig\u00ad uously to classi fy the telecommunicati ons component of cable modem serv ice as a disti nct offer ing. This leaves federa l telecommunicati ons policy in this technica l and complex area to be set by the Commissi on, not by warr ing analogies. We also do not share the dissent' s certainty that cable modem serv ice is so obviously like pizza delivery serv ice and the combi nation of dog leashes and dogs that the Commissi on could not reasonably have thought other wise. Post, at 1007 - 1008. For example , unlike the transmissi on component of Inter net serv ice, delivery serv ice and dog leashes are not integra l components of the nished produc ts (pizzas and pet dogs). One can pick up a pizza rather than having it deliv\u00ad ered, and one can own a dog without buying a leash. By contrast, the Commissi on reasonably concluded, a consumer cannot purchase Inter net serv ice without also purchasi ng a connec tion to the Inter net on curs in connec tion with informati on processi ng. In any event, we doubt that a statute that, for example , subjec ted offerors of \"delivery\" serv ice (such as Federa l Express and United Parcel Serv ice) to common-carr ier regulation would unambig uously require pizza-del ivery companies to offer their delivery serv ices on onal at 976-977, also suppor ts the on that the Communicati ons Act is ambig uous about whether cable companies \"offer \" telecommunicati ons with cable modem serv ice. Congress passed the denitions in the Communicati ons Act against the background of this regulatory history , and we may assume that the para llel Com\u00ad missi on has held. See, e. g., In re Federal-Sta te Joint Board on Universal Service, 12 FCC Cite U. S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t (1997) (noting that the \"de nition of enhanced serv ices is subst 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993) (not\u00ad ing presumpti on that Congress is aware of \"settled judicia l and admi nistrative inter pret ation[s]\" of terms when it enac ts a statute). The regulatory history in at least two respec ts conr ms that the term \"telecommunications service\" is ambig uous. First, in the Compu ter II Order that established the terms \"basic \" and \"enhanced\" serv ices, the Commissi on dened terms func tionally, based on how the consumer inter\u00ad acts with the prov ided informati on, just as the Commissi on did in the order below . See supra, at 976-977. As we have explai ned, Inter net serv ice is not \"transparent in terms of its with customer connec\u00ad on processi ng. It was therefore consist\u00ad ent with the statute' s terms for the Commissi on to assume that the para llel term \"telecommunicati ons serv ice\" path not necessar ily separately pres\u00ad ent, from the end user 's perspec tive, in an integrated informati on-serv ice offer ing. Commission's application this on. The Commissi on has long held that \"all those who prov ide some form of transmissi on serv ices are not necessar ily common carriers. \" Compu ter II Order 431, \u00b6 122; see also id., at 435, \u00b6 132 ng] the exist\u00ad ence of a communicati component\" enhanced-serv ice offer ings).

They claim that the Communicati ons Act unambig uously classi es as telecommunicati ons carriers all entities that use telecommunicati ons inputs to prov ide infor\u00ad mati on serv ice.

Those ISPs prov ide con\u00ad sumers with transmissi on facilities used to connec t to the Inter net, see supra, at 974, and so, under respondents' argu\u00ad ment, necessar ily \"offer \" telecommunicati ons to consumers. Respondents' positi on that all such entities are necessar ily \"offer ing telecommunicati ons\" therefore entails mandatory common-carr ier regulation of entities the Commissi Cite U.

Respondents' analogy between cable companies that pro\u00ad vide cable own the on facilities used to prov ide those serv\u00ad ices\u2014fares no better . Respondents stress that under the Compu ter II rules the Commissi on regulated such prov ers non-faci The Commissi on for telephone companies that prov ided enhanced serv ices to offer their wires on ier basis to competi ng enhanced-serv ice prov id\u00ad ers.

Post, at 1011 (opinion of Scalia, J.). This analogy is flawed. A pizzeria \"deliv\u00ad ers\" noth ing, but ISPs plainly prov on serv ice direc tly to the publ ic in connec tion with Inter net serv ice. For example , with dial-up serv ice, ISPs process the electronic signal that travels over local telephone wires, and transmit it to the Inter net. See supra, at 974-975; Huber 988. The dissent therefore cannot deny that its positi on logically would require apply ing presumptively mandatory Title II regulation to all ISPs. 545US2 Unit: $U80 [03-28-08 16:00:53] TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t We disagree . We think it improbable that the Communi\u00ad cations Act unambig uously freezes in time the prov iders. The the \"offer[ s] telecommu\u00ad nicati ons for a fee direc tly the publ ic,\" 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 153(46), though the Act elsewhere subjec ts stricter regulation, see \u00a7 251(c) (imposi ng various duties on facilities-based local telephone companies). In the Com\u00ad puter II rules, Commissi on subjec ted facilities-based pro\u00ad viders to common-carr ier duties not because of the nature of the \"offer ing\" made by those carriers, but rather because of the concer n that local telephone companies would abuse the monopoly power they possessed by virtue of the \"bottleneck \" local telephone facilities they owned. See Compu ter II Order 474-475, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 231; Compu ter III Order 535 the natura lly monopol istic physica l structure of a local telephone ex\u00ad change). The differentia l treatment of facilities-based car\u00ad riers was therefore \"enhanced-serv ice\" and \"basic serv ice,\" but instead of a choice by the Commissi on to regulate more stringently , in its discreti on, certain entities that prov ided serv and basic serv ice, not the facilities-based grounds on which that policy choice was based, and the Commissi on re\u00ad mains free to impose specia l regulatory duties on facilities\u00ad based ISPs under its Title I ancillary jurisdic tion. In fact, it has invited comment on whether it can and shou ld do so. See supra, at 979. In sum, if the Act ice as \"offer[ S. 967 (2005) Opinion Cour not distinguish facilities-based and non\u00ad facilities-based carr iers. That silence suggests, instead, that the Commissi on has the discreti on to ll the conse\u00ad quent statutory gap. C We also conclude that the Commissi on's constr uction was \"a reasonable [Commissi on] to make\" at Chevro n's second step. 467 U. S., at 845. Respondents argue that the Commissi on's constr uction is unreasonable because ons prov ider to \"evade\" common-carr ier on serv ice with under the Commissi on's constr uction a telephone company could, for example , offer an informati on serv ice like voice mail together with telephone serv ice, thereby avoidi ng common-carr ier regulation of its tele\u00ad phone serv ice. We need not decide whether a constr uction that resu lted in these consequences would be unreasonable because we do not believe that these resu lts follow from the constr uction the Commissi on adopted. As we underst and the Decl ara\u00ad tory Ruling, the Commissi on did not say that any telecom\u00ad municati ons serv ice that is priced or bundled with an infor\u00ad mati on serv ice is automatica lly unreg ulated under Title II. The Commissi on said that a telecommunicati ons input used to prov ide an informati on serv ice that is not ng lities of the serv and parcel of [the informati on serv supra, not leave all informati on-serv ice offer ings exempt from mandatory Title II regulation. \"It is plain,\" for example , that TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Opinion of the Cour t escape Title II regulation of its residentia l local exchange serv ice simply by packag ing that serv ice with voice mail.\" Universal Service Report 11530, \u00b6 60. That is because a telephone company that packages voice mail with telephone serv ice offers a transparent transmissi on path\u2014telephone ided by voice mail. For instance , when a person makes a telephone call, his abil\u00ad ity to convey and receive informati on using the call is only trivially affec ted by the additi onal voice-mai l capabi lity. Equally, were a telephone company to add a time-of-day an\u00ad nouncement that played every time the user picked up his telephone , the \"transparent\" informati on transmitted in the ensui ng call would be only trivially dependent on the infor\u00ad mati on serv ice the announcement prov ides. By contrast, the high-speed transmissi on used to prov ide cable modem serv ice is a func tionally integrated component of that serv ice because it transmits data only in connec tion with the further processi ng of informati is necessary ice. The Commissi on's therefore was more limited than respondents assume . Respondents answer that cable modem serv ice does, in fact, prov ide \"transparent\" transmissi on from the consum\u00ad er's terize the \"informati Inter net access as consisti ng only of access to a cable com\u00ad pany' s e-mai l serv ice, its Web page , and the ability it pro\u00ad vides consumers to create a persona l Web page . When a consumer goes beyond those offer ings and accesses content prov ided by parties other than the cable company , respond\u00ad ents argue, the consumer uses \"pure transmissi on\" no less than a consumer who purchases phone serv ice together with voice mail. This argument, we believe, confl icts with the Commissi on's underst andi ng an un\u00ad derst andi ng we nd PGT: OPIN Cite as: U.

For example , as the Commissi on found below , part of the informati on serv ice cable companies prov ide is access to DNS serv ice. See supra, at 987. A user cannot reach a third-par ty's Web site without DNS, which (among other things) matches the Web site address the end user types into his browser (or \"clicks\" on with his mouse) with the IP address of the Web page' s host server . See P. Albitz & C. Liu, DNS and BIND 10 (4th ed. 2001) (For an Inter net user , \"DNS is a must. . . . of the Inter net's network serv ices use DNS. That includes the World Wide Web, electronic mail, remote terminal access, and le transfer \"). It is at least reasonable to think of DNS as a \"capabi utilizing, or mak ing available\" Web site addresses and therefore part of the informati on serv ice cable companies prov ide. 47 U. S. C. \u00a7 153(20).3 Similarly, the Inter net serv ice prov ided by cable companies facilitates access to third-par ty Web pages by of\u00ad fering consumers the ability to store , or \"cache ,\" popu lar con\u00ad tent on local computer servers. See Decl aratory Ruling 4810, \u00b6 17, and n. 76.

The dissent' s argument therefore begs the questi on be\u00ad cause it assumes that Inter net serv ice is a \"telecommunicati ons system\" or \"serv ice\" that DNS manages (a point on which, contrary to the dissent' s asser tion, post, at 1013, n. 6, we need take no view for purposes of this response). 545US2 Unit: $U80 [03-28-08 16:00:53] TELECOMMUNICA TIONS ASSN . v.

We therefore conclude that the Commissi on's constr uction was reasonable . V Respondent MCI, Inc., urges that the Commissi on's treat\u00ad ment of cable modem serv ice is inconsistent with its treat\u00ad ment of DSL serv ice, see supra, at 975 (descr ibing DSL serv\u00ad ice), and therefore is an arbitrary and capr icious deviation from agency policy. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). MCI points out that when local telephone companies began to offer In\u00ad ternet access through DSL technolog y in additi on to tele\u00ad phone serv ice, the Commissi ied its Compu ter II facilities-based classi cati on to them and required them to make the telephone lines used to transmit DSL serv ice avail\u00ad able to competi ng iders); In serv ice as a telecommunicati ons serv ice). MCI claims that the Commissi on's decisi on not to regulate cable companies similarly under Title II is inconsistent with its DSL policy. We conclude , howe ver, that the Commissi on prov ided a reasoned explanati S. 967 (2005) Opinion of the Cour t ferently from DSL serv ice. As we have already noted, see supra, at 981-982, the Commissi on is free within the limits of reasoned inter pret ation to change course if it adequately justi es the change .4 It has done so here . The traditi onal reason for its Compu ter II common-carr ier treatment of facilities-based carriers (includi ng DSL carriers), as the Commissi on explai ned, was \"that the telephone network [was] the primary , if not exclusive , means through which in\u00ad formati on serv ice ation marks omitted). The Commissi on ap\u00ad plied the same treatment to DSL serv ice based on that his\u00ad tory, rather than on an analysis of contemporaneous market conditi ons. See Wirel ine ISPs on nondiscr iminatory terms). The Commissi on in the order under review, by contrast, concluded that changed market conditi ons warrant different treatment of facilities-based cable companies prov iding In\u00ad ternet access. Unlike at the time of Compu ter II, substitute forms of Inter net transmissi on exist today: \"[R]esidentia l high-speed access to the Inter net is evolv ing over multiple electronic platfor ms, includi ng S.

This is adequate rational justi cati on for the Commissi on's conclusi ons. effec justi\u00ad iders from common-carr ier regulation appl ies with similar force to DSL prov iders. We need not address that argument. The Com\u00ad missi on's decisi on appears to be a rst step in an effor t to reshape the way the Commissi on regulates informati on\u00ad serv ice prov iders; that may be why tentatively con\u00ad that DSL serv ice prov ided phone companies shou ld also be classi ed solely as an informati on serv ice. See In re App ropriate Framewo rk for Broadband Access to the Internet over Wirel ine Facilities, 17 FCC Rcd. 3019, 3030, \u00b6 20 (2002). The Commissi on need not immediately apply the policy reasoni ng in the Decl ara\u00ad tory Ruling to all types of informati on-serv ice prov iders. It apparently prov iders increment ally. Any inconsistency between the order under review and the Commissi on's treatment of DSL serv ice can be adequately addressed when the Commissi on fully reconsiders its treatment of DSL serv ice and when it decides whether , pursuant to its ancillary Title I jurisdic tion, to require cable companies to allow independent ISPs access to their facilities. See supra, at 979 and this page . We ex\u00ad press no view on those matters. In particular, we express no view on how the Commissi on shou ld, or lawfu lly may, clas\u00ad sify DSL serv ice. * * * The questi ons the Commissi on resolved in the order under review involve a \"subjec t matter [that] U.

I join the Cour t's opinion because I believe that the Fed\u00ad eral Communicati ons Commissi on's decisi on falls scope of its statutor ily delegated author ity\u2014though perhaps just barely . I write separately because I believe it impor\u00ad tant to point out that Justice Scalia, in my view, has wrong ly charac terized the Cour t's opinion in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001) . He states that the Cour t held in Mead that \"some unspeci ed degree of formal process\" before the agency required\" for cour ts to cord the agency' s decisi on deference under Chevro n U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Reso urces Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Post, at 1015 (dissenti ng opinion); see also ibid. (formal process is \"at least the only safe harbor \"). Justice Scalia has correc tly charac terized the way in which he, in dissen t, charac terized the Cour t's Mead opinion. 533 U. S., at 245-246. But the Cour t TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Breyer, J., concurr ing agency action qualies for Chevro n deference when Con\u00ad gress has expl icitly or implicitly delegated to the agency the author ity to \"ll\" a statutory \"gap, \" includi ng an inter pretive gap created through an ambig The Cour t said in Mead that such delegati on \"may be shown inav ariety of ways,asby an agency' s power to engage in adjudicati on or notice-and-comment rulemak ing, or by some other indication of a comparabl e congressio nal intent.\" 533 U. S., at 227 (emphasis added). The Cour t ex\u00ad plicitly stated that the absence of notice-and-comment rule\u00ad mak ing did \"not decide the case ,\" for the Cour t has \"some\u00ad times found reasons for Chevro n deference even when no such admi nistrative formality was required and none was af\u00ad forded. \" Id., at 231. And the Cour t repeated that it \"has recog nized a variety of indicators that Congress would ex\u00ad pect Chevro n deference .\" Id., at 237 (emphasis added). It is not surprising that the Cour t would hold that the existence of a formal rulemak ing proceedi ng is neither a pret ation of a statute . It is not a necessary conditi on because an agency might arrive at an author itative inter pret ation of includi ng ways that Justice Scalia menti ons. See, e. g., Mead, supra, at 231. It is not a sufcient conditi on because Congress may have intended not to leave the matter of a particular inter pret ation up to the agency , irrespec tive of the procedure the agency uses to arrive at that inter pret a\u00ad tion, say, where an unusua lly basic legal questi on is at issue . Cf. Gene ral Dynamics Land System s, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 600 (2004) (rejecting agency' s answer to ques\u00ad tion whether age discr imination law forbids discr imination against the relatively young). Thus, while I believe Justice Scalia is right in emphasi z\u00ad ing that Chevro n deference 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng sence of formal agency proceedi ngs, Mead shou ld not give him cause for concer n. Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter and Jus\u00ad tice Ginsburg join as to Part I, dissenti ng. The Federa l Communicati ons Commissi on (FCC or Com\u00ad missi on) has once again attempted to concoc t \"a whole new regime of regulation (or of free-market competiti on)\" under the guise of statutory constr uction. MCI Telecommun ica\u00ad tions Corp. v. Ame rican Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 234 (1994). Actually, in these cases, it might be more accurate to say the Commissi on has attempted to es\u00ad tablish a whole new regime of non-regulation, which will make for more or less free-market competiti on, dependi ng upon impor tant fact, how\u00ad ever, is that the Commissi on has chosen to achieve this through an implausible readi ng of the statute , and has thus exceeded the author ity given it by Congress. I The rst sentence of the FCC ruling under review reads as follows: \"Cable modem serv ice prov ides high-speed access to the Inter net, as well as many appl icati ons or func tions that can be used with that access, over cable system facili\u00ad ties. \" In re Inqu iry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet Over Cable and Other Facilities, 17 FCC Rcd. 4798, 4799, omitted). mean that cable compa\u00ad nies \"offer \" high-speed access to the Inter net? Surprisingly not, if the Commissi on and the Cour t are to be believed. It happens that cable-modem serv ice is popu lar precisely because of the high-speed access it prov ides, and that, once connec ted with the Inter net, cable-modem subscr ibers often use Inter func tions from prov iders other than the cable TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Scalia, J., dissenti ng sifying what the cable company does, the Commissi on (with the Cour t's approva l) puts all the emphasis on the rest of the package (the additi onal \"appl icati ons or func tions\"). It does so by claiming that the cable company does not \"offe[ r]\" its customers high-speed Inter net access because it offers that access only in conjunc tion with particular appl icati ons \u00b6 7, 4823, focus on the term \"offer \" appropr iately derives from the statutory denitions at issue in these cases. Under the Telecommunicati ons Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 59, \" 'informati on serv ice' \" involves the capacity to generate , store , interac t with, or other wise manipu late \"informati on via telecommuni\u00ad cations.\" 47 U. S.

The questi on telecom\u00ad to the publ ic.\" If so, they are subjec t to Title II regulation as common carriers, like their chief competitors who prov ide Inter net access through other technolog ies. The Cour t concludes that the word \"offer \" is ambig uous in the sense that it has \" 'alternative dictionary denitions' \" that might be relevant. Ante, at 989 (quoti ng National Railroad Passenge r Corporation v. Bost on & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 418 (1992)). It seems to me, howe ver, that the analytic problem pertains not really to the meani ng of \"offer ,\" but to the identity of what is offered. The relevant questi on is whether the indiv idua l components in a package being offered still possess sufcient identity to be descr ibed as separate objec ts of the offer S. 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng so changed by their combi nation with the other components that it is no longer reasonable to descr ibe them in that way. Thus, I agree (to adapt the Cour t's example , ante, at 990) that it would be odd to say that a car dealer is in the business of selling steel or carpets because the cars he sells include both steel frames and carpeting. Nor does the water com\u00ad pany sell hydrogen, nor the pet store water (though dogs and cats are largely water at the molecu lar level). But what is someti mes true is not, as the Cour t seems to assume , always true. There are instances in which it is ridicu lous to deny that one part of a joint offer ing is being offered merely be\u00ad cause it is not offered on a \" 'stand-a lone' \" basis, ante, at 989. If, for example , I call up a pizzeria and ask whether they offer delivery , both common sense and common \"usage ,\" ante, at 990, would prevent them from answer ing: \"No, we do not offer delivery\u2014but if you order a pizza from us, we'll bake it for you and then bring it to your house .\" The logical response to this would be someth ing on the order of, \"so, you do offer delivery .\" But our pizza-man may conti nue to deny the obvious and explai n, paraphrasi ng the FCC and the Cour t: \"No, even though we bring the pizza to your house , we are not actually 'offer ing' you delivery , because the deliv\u00ad ery that we prov ide to our end users is 'part and parcel' of our pizzeria-pi zza-at-home serv ice and is 'integra l to its ' \" Cf. aratory Ruling 4823, \u00b6 39; ante, at 988, 997-998.1 Any reasonable customer would conclude at that point that his inter locutor was either crazy or following some too-cle ver-by-ha lf legal advice. In shor t, for the inputs of a nished serv ice to qualify as the objec ts of an \"offer \" (as that term is reasonably under\u00ad stood), it is perhaps a sufcient, but surely not a necessar y, conditi on that the seller offer separately \"each discrete input 1 The myth that the pizzeria does not offer delivery becomes even more difcu lt to maintain when the pizzeria adver tises quick delivery as one of its advant ages over competitors.

The pet store may have a policy of selling puppies only with leashes, but any customer will say that it does offer puppies\u2014because a leashed puppy is still a puppy , even though it is not offered on a \"stand-a lone\" basis. Despite the Cour t's mighty labors to prove other wise, ante, at 989-1000, the telecommunicati ons component of cable-modem serv ice retains such ample independent iden\u00ad tity that it must be regarded as being on offer\u2014 especia lly when seen from the perspec tive of the consumer or the end user , which the Cour t purports to nd deter minative , ante, at 990, 993, 998, 1000. The Commissi on's ruling began by noting that cable-modem serv ice prov ides both \"high-speed access to 1, because that is exac tly how any reasonable consumer would perceive it: as consist\u00ad ing of two separate things. The consumer 's view of the matter is best assessed by ask\u00ad ing what other produc ts cable-modem serv ice substitutes for in the marketplace . Broadband Inter net serv ice prov ided by cable companies is one of the three most common forms of Inter net serv ice, the other two being dial-up access and broadband Digital Subscr iber Line (DSL) serv ice.

With dial-up access, the physica l pathway comes from the telephone company , and the Inter net serv ides the func tionality. \"In the case of Inter net access, the end user utilizes two different and disti nct serv ices. One is the transmissi on pathway , a telecommunicati ons serv ice that the end user purchases from the telephone company . The second is the Inter net access serv ice, which is an enhanced serv\u00ad OPIN S. 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng over which that data travels.

It is therefore inevitable that customers will regard the compet\u00ad ing cable-modem serv ice as giving them both computi ng func tionality and the physica l pipe by which that func tional\u00ad ity comes to their computer\u2014both the pizza and the delivery serv ice that nondel ivery pizzerias require to be purchased from the cab company .4 2 See also In re Federal-Sta te Joint Board on Unive rsal Service, 13 FCC 11501, telecommu\u00ad nicati ons serv ice from local exchange and then use informati on serv ices prov ided site opera\u00ad tors] in order to access [the Web]\"). 3 In the DSL context, the physica l connec tion is genera lly resold to the consumer by an ISP that has taken advant age of the telephone company' s offer . The consumer knows very well, howe ver, that the physica l connec\u00ad tion is a necessary component for Inter net access which, just as in the dial-up context, is not prov ided by the ISP. 4 The Cour t contends that this analogy is inapposite because one need not have a pizza delivered, ante, at 992, whereas one must purchase the cable connec tion in order to use cable' s But the ISP func\u00ad tions prov ided by the cable company can be used without cable delivery\u2014 by accessi ng them from an Inter net TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Scalia, J., dissenti ng Since the delivery serv ice prov ided by cable (the broad\u00ad band connec tion between the customer 's computer and the cable company' s computer-processi ng facilities) is down\u00ad stream from the computer-processi ng facilities, there is no questi on that it merely serves as a conduit for the informa\u00ad tion serv ices that have already been \"assembled\" by the cable company in its capacity as ISP. This is relevant be\u00ad cause of the statutory disti nction between an \"informati on serv , by contrast, involves no \"change in the form or content of the informati on as sent and received. \" \u00a7 153(43). When cable-company-assembled informati on enters the cable for delivery to the subscr iber, the informati on serv ice is already complete . The informa\u00ad tion has been (as the statute requires) generated, acquired, stored, transfor med, processed, retrieved, utilized, or made available . All that remai ns is for the informati on in its nal, unaltered form, to be delivered (via telecommunicati ons) to the subscr iber. This reveals the insubst antia lity of the fear invoked by both the Commissi on and the Cour t: the fear of what will happen to ISPs that do not prov ide the physica l pathway to Inter net access, yet still use telecommunicati ons to acquire the pieces necessary to assemble the informati on that they pass back to their customers. Accordi ng to this reduc tio, ante, at 993-995, if ice prov deemed to prov ide \"telecommunicati ons serv ice,\" then so must all ISPs because they all \"use\" telecommunicati ons in prov iding Inter net func tionality (by connec ting to other merger of the physica l connec tion and Inter s offer\u00ad ings has noth do with the \" 'inextr icably inter twined, ' \" ante, at 978, nature of the two (like a car and its carpet), but is an articial produc t of the cable company' s marketi ng decisi on not to offer the two separately , so that the Commissi on could (by the Decl aratory Ruling under review here) exempt it S. 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng parts of the Inter net, includi ng Inter net backbone prov iders, for example). In terms of the pizzeria analogy, this is equiv\u00ad alent to saying that, pizzeria all res\u00ad taurants \"offer \" delivery , because the ingredients of the food they serve their customers have come from other places; no matter how their customers get the food (whether by eating it at the restaurant, or by comi ng to pick it up themselves), they still consume a produc t for which delivery was a neces\u00ad sary \"input. \" This is nonsense . Concludi ng that delivery of the nished pizza constitutes an \"offer \" of delivery does not require the conclusi on that the serv ing of prepared food includes an \"offer \" of delivery . And that analogy does not even do the point justice , since \"'telecommunicati ons serv\u00ad ice'\" is dened as \"the offer ing of telecommunicati ons for a fee directly to the publ ic.\" \u00a7 153(46) (emphasis added). The ISPs' in their processi ng of infor\u00ad mati on is not offered to the publ ic. The \"reg ulatory history\" on which the Cour t depends so much, ante, at 992-997, prov ides another reason why common-carr ier regulation of all ISPs is not a worry . Under its Compu ter Inqu iry rules, which as common carriers networks\"\u2014non-facilities\u00ad based prov who leased basic serv ices car\u00ad riers and bundled them with enhanced serv ices; it said that they , unlike facilities-based prov iders, would be deemed to prov ide only enhanced serv ices, ante, at 993-994.5 That 5 The Commissi on says forbearance cannot explai n why value-added net\u00ad works were not regulated as basic-serv ice prov iders because it was not given the power to forbear until 1996. Reply Brief for Federa l Petition\u00ad ers 3-4, n. 1. It is true that when the Commissi on ruled on value-added networks, the statute did not expl icitly prov ide for forbearance \u2014any more than it prov ided for the categor ies of basic and enhanced serv ices that the Compu ter Inqu iry rules established, and through which the forbearance was appl ied.

BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Scalia, J., dissenti ng same resu lt can be achieved today under the Commissi on's statutory author ity to forbear from imposi ng most Title II regulations. \u00a7 160. In fact, the statutory criteria for for\u00ad bearance \u2014wh ich include what is \"just and reasonable ,\" \"nec\u00ad essary for the protec tion of consumers, \" and \"consistent with the publ ic interest, \" \u00a7\u00a7 160(a)(1), (2), (3)\u2014 correspond well with the kinds of policy reasons the Commissi on has invoked to justi fy cable-modem serv ice. The Cour t also puts great stock in its conclusi on that cable-modem subscr serv ices prov ided by the cable company in its ISP capacity , even when they only click-through to other ISPs. Ante, at 998-1000. For, even if a cable-modem subscr iber uses e-mai l from another ISP, desig nates some page not prov ided by the cable company as his home page , and takes advant age of none of the other standard appl icati ons and func tions pro\u00ad vided by the cable company , he will still be using the cable company' s Domai n Name System (DNS) server and, when he goes to popu lar Web pages, perhaps versi ons of them that are stored in the cable company' s cache . This argument suf\u00ad fers from at least two problems. First, in the context of telephone serv ices, the Cour t serv ice by an informati on serv ice. Ante, at 997-998. A similar excep\u00ad tion would seem to apply to the func tions in questi on here . DNS, in Commissi 212 (1982). The Commissi on also says its Compu ter Inqu iry rules shou ld not apply to cable because they were developed in the context of telephone lines. Brief for Federa l Petitioners 35-36; see also ante, at 996. But to the extent that the statute impor ted the Compu ter Inqu iry approach, there is no basis for apply ing it differently to cable than to telephone lines, since the denition of \"telecommunicati ons serv ice\" appl ies \"regardless of the facilities 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng tion, which is expressly excluded formati on serv ice.\" \u00a7 153(20).6 Second, is apparently possible to sell a telecommunicati ons serv ice separately from, although in conjunc ISP-l ike serv ices; that is pre\u00ad cisely what happens in the DSL context, and the Commissi on does not contest that it could be done in the context of cable . The only impedi ment appears to be the Commissi on's fail\u00ad ure to require from cable companies the unbundl ing that it required of facilities-based prov iders under its Compu ter Inqu 29-32, it concluded the Decl aratory Ruling by asking, as the Cour t Commissi on] shou ld require cable companies to offer other ISPs access to their facilities on common-carr ier terms.\" Ante, at 979; see also Reply Brief for Federa l Petitioners 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17. In other words, what the Commissi on hath given, the Commissi on may well take away\u2014unless it doesn' t. This is a wonder ful illustrati on of how an exper ienced agency can (with some assist ance from credu cour ts) turn statutory constrai nts into bureaucratic discreti ons. The main source of the Commissi on's regulatory author ity over common carri\u00ad ers is Title II, but the Commissi on has rendered that inappl i\u00ad cable in this instance by concludi ng of \"telecommunicati ons serv ice\" ambig uous and does not (in 6 The Cour t says that invoking this expl icit excepti on the denition of informati ices, which appl ies only to the \"management, control, or operati on of a telecommunicati ons system or the management of a tele\u00ad communicati ons serv ice,\" \u00a7153(20), begs the modem serv ice includes a telecommunicati ons serv ice, ante, at 999, n. 3. I think not, and cite the excepti on only to demonstrate that the incident al func tions do not prevent cable from includi ng a telecommunicati ons serv ice if it otherwise qualies. It is rather the Cour t that begs the questi on, saying that the excepti on cannot apply because cable is not TIONS ASSN . v.

It contem\u00ad plates, howe ver, altering that (unnecessary) outcome , not by chang ing the law (i. e., its constr uction of the Title II deni\u00ad tions), but by reserv ing the right to change the facts. Under its unde ned and spar ingly used \"anci llary\" powers, the Commissi on might conclude that it can order cable com\u00ad panies to \"unbundle\" the ice.7 And presto , Title II will then apply to them, because will nally be \"offer the on will still have the statutory power to forbear from regulating them under \u00a7 160 (which it has already tentatively concluded it would do, Decl aratory that the statute con\u00ad strai ns the agency in any meani ngful way. After all is said and done , after all the regulatory cant has been translated, and the smoke of agency exper tise blown away , it remai ns perfectly clear that someone who sells cable-modem serv ice is \"offer ing\" telecommunicati ons. For that simple reason set forth in the statute , I would afrm the Cour t of Appea ls. II In Part III-B of its opinion, the Cour t conti nues the admi nistrative-law improv isati on projec t it began four years ago in United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001). To the extent it set forth a comprehensible rule,8 Mead drasti\u00ad 7 Under iding \"telecommunicati ons serv ices, \" there is reason to doubt whether it can use its Title I powers to impose common-carr ier-like requirements, \"telecommunica\u00ad tions carrier shall be treated as a common carrier under this chapter only to the exten t that it is engaged in prov iding telecommunicati ons serv ices\" (emphasis added), and \"this chapter \" includes Titles I and II. 8 For a descr iption of the confusi on Mead has produced, see Vermeu le, Mead in the Trenches, 71 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 347, 361 (2003) (concludi ng that \"the ing into no-man' s land\"); Bressman, 1015 Scalia, J., dissenti ng cally limited the categor ies of agency action that would qual\u00ad ify for deference under Chevro n U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\u00ad sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). For example , the positi on taken by an agency before the Su\u00ad preme Cour t, with full approva l of the agency head, would not qualify. Rather , some unspeci ed degree of formal proc\u00ad ess was required\u2014or was at least the only safe harbor . See Mead, supra, at 245-246 (Scalia, J., dissenti ng).9 This meant that many more issues appropr iate for agency deter mination would reach the cour ts without benet of an agency positi on entitled Chevro n deference , requir ing the cour ts to rule on these issues de novo.10 As I pointed out in Agency Action, 58 Vand. L. Rev. 1443, 1475 (2005) (\"Mead has muddled judicia l review of agency action\"). 9 Justice Breyer attempts to clarify Mead by repeati ng its formula\u00ad tions that the Cour t found to give a (still-unspeci of a (still\u00ad unspeci \"var iety of indicators, \" ante, at 1004 (concurr ing opinion) (inter nal quot ation marks and emphasis omitted). He also notes that def\u00ad erence is someti mes inappropr iate for reasons unrelated to the agency' s process. Surprising those who thought the Cour t's decisi on not to defer to the agency in Gene ral Dynamics Land System s, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 (2004), depended on its conclusi on that there was \"no serious questi on... about purely textua l ambig uity\" in the statute , id., at 600, Justice Breyer seemi ngly attributes that decisi on to a on to basic legal questi on[s],\" ante, at 1004. The Cour t today (thankfu lly) does not follow this approach: It bases its decisi on on what it sees as statutory ambig uity, ante, at 996-997, without asking whether the classi cati on of cable-modem serv ice is an \"unusua lly basic legal questi on.\" 10 It is true that, even under the broad basis for deference that I propose (viz., any agency positi on that plainly has the approva l of the agency head, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 256-257 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenti ng)), some inter pretive matters will be decided de novo, without deference to agency views. This would be a rare occurrence , howe ver, at the Supreme Cour t level\u2014at least with respec t to matters of any signi\u00ad cance to the agency . Seek ing to achieve 100% agency control of ambig u\u00ad ous prov isions through the compl icated method the Cour t proposes is not TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Scalia, J., dissenti ng dissent, this in turn meant (under the law as it was under\u00ad stood until today) 11 that many statutory ambig uities that might be resolved in vary ing fashions by successive agency admi nistrati ons would be resolved nally, conclusively , by federa l judges\u2014produci ng an \"ossi cati on of large portions of our statutory law,\" 533 U. S., at 247. The Cour t today moves to solve this problem of its own creati on by inventi executive ofcers. Imag ine the following sequence of events: FCC action is challenged as ultra vires under the gover ning statute; the litigati on reaches all the way to the Supreme Cour t of the United States. The Solicitor Genera l sets forth the FCC' s ofcia l positi in\u00ad terpret ation of the statute . Apply ing Mead, howe ver, the Cour t denies the agency positi on Chevro n deference , nds that the best inter pret ation of the statute contradic ts the agency' s positi on, and holds the challenged agency action un\u00ad lawfu l. The agency promptly conduc ts a 11 The Cour t's unani mous holdi ng in Neal v. United States, 516 U. S. 284 (1996), plainly rejected the notion that any form of deference could cause the Cour t to revisit a prior statutory-constr uction holdi ng: we have deter mined a statute' s meani ng, we adhere to our ruling under the doc\u00ad trine of stare decisis, and we assess an agency' s later inter pret ation of the statute against that settled law.\" Id., at 295. The Cour t attempts to reinter pret this plain lang uage by dissec ting the cases Neal cited, noting that they referred to previous deter minations of \" 'a statute' s clear mean\u00ad ing.' \" Lechme re, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U. 527, 537 (1992) (quoti ng Maisl in Indu stries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990)). But those cases reveal that today' s focus on the term \"clear \" is revisionist. The oldest case in the chain using that word, Maisl in Indu stries, did not rely on a prior decisi on that held the statute to be clear , but on a run-of\u00ad the-mi ll statutory inter pret ation cont ained in 1908 decisi 130- 131. When Maisl in Indu stries referred to t's \"a statute' s clear meani ng,\" it was referr ing to the fact that the prior decisi on had made the statute clear , and was not conduc ting a retro\u00ad spec tive inquiry into whether the prior decisi on had declared the statute itself to be clear on its own terms. 1017 S. 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng adopts a rule that compor with concer inter pret ation of the statute . Accordi ng to today' s opinion, the agency is thereupon free to take the action that the Su\u00ad preme Cour t found unlawfu l. This is not only bizarre . It is probably unconstituti onal. As we held in Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Water\u00ad manS. S.Corp., 333 U. S. 103 (1948), Article III cour ts do not sit to render decisi ons that can be reversed or ignored by executive ofcers. In that case , the Cour t of Appea ls had deter mined it had jurisdic tion to review an order of the Civil Aeronautics Board awardi ng an overseas air route . By statute such orders were subjec t to Presidentia l approva l and the order in questi on had in fact been approved by the President. Id., at 110-111. In order to avoid any confl ict with the President' s foreig n-affairs powers, the Cour t of Ap\u00ad peals concluded that it would review the board' s action \"as a regulatory agent of Congress, \" and the resu lts of that review would remai n subjec t to approva l or disapprova l by the Pres\u00ad ident. Id., at 112-113. As I noted in my Mead dissent, 533 U. S., at 248, the Cour t bristled at the suggesti on: \"Judg\u00ad ments within the powers vested in cour ts by the Judiciary Article of the Constituti on may not lawfu lly be revised, over\u00ad turned or refused faith and credit by another Depar tment of Gover nment. \" Waterman, supra, what today' s decisi on effec tively allows. Even when the agency itself is party to the case in which the Cour t constr ues a statute , the agency will be able to disregard that constr uc\u00ad tion and seek Chevro n deference for its contrary constr uc\u00ad tion the next time around.12 12 The Cour t contends that no reversa l of judicia l holdi ngs is involved, because \"a cour t's opinion as to the best readi ng of an ambig uous statute... is not author itative ,\" ante, at 983. That fails to appreciate the difference between a de novo constr uction of a statute and a decisi on whether to defer to an agency' s positi on, which does not even \"purport to give the statute a judicia l inter pret TIONS ASSN . v. BRAND X INTERNET SER VICES Scalia, J., dissenti ng Of course , like Mead itself, today' s novelty in belated re\u00ad mediati on of Mead creates many uncer bede vil the lower cour inter pret ation is conclusive , the Cour t says, only if it holds that inter pret ation to be \"the only permissibl e readi ng of the statute ,\" and not if it merely holds it to be \"the best readi ng.\" Ante, at 984. Does this mean that in future statutory-constr uction cases which of the two they are holdi ng? And what of the many cases decided in the past, before this dic\u00ad tum' s requirement was established? Apparently , silence on the point means that the cour t's decisi on is subjec t , whether cont ained in a precedent or not, may trump an agency' s, the cour t must hold that the statute unambig uously requires the cour t's constr uction.\" 13 Ante, at 985. (I have not made , and as far as I know the Cour t has not made , any calculation of how many hundreds of past statutory decisi ons are now agency-re versible because of failure to include an \"unambig u\u00ad ous\" nding. I suspec t the number is very large .) How much extra work will it entail for each cour t confronted with an agency-admi nistered statute to deter mine whether it has reached, not only the right (\"best\") resu lt, but \"the only uous\" under the Cour t's new agency-re versa l rule the same as the stand\u00ad ard for \"unambig uous\" under step one of Chevro n? (If so, J., dissenti ng). Once a cour t has decided upon its de novo constr uction of the statute , there no longer is a \"different constr uction\" that is \"consistent with the cour t's holdi ng,\" ante, at 983, and available for adopti on by the agency . 13 Suggestive of the same chaotic under mining of all prior judicia l deci\u00ad sions that do not uity Cour t's explanati of why agency depar ture from a prior judicia l decisi on does not amount to overr uling: \"[T]he agency may, consistent with the cour t's holdi ng, choose a different constr uction, agency remai ns the author itative inter\u00ad preter (within the limits of reason) of [ambig 967 (2005) Scalia, J., dissenti ng of course , every case that reaches step two of Chevro n will be agency- reversible.) Does the \"unambiguous\" dictum produce stare decisis effec t even when a cour t is afrming , rather than reversing , agency action\u2014so that in the future the agency must adhere to that afrmed inter pret ation? If so, does the victorious agency have the right to appea l a Cour t of Appea ls judg ment in its favor , on the ground that the text in questi on is in fact not (as the Cour t of Appea ls held) unambig uous, so the agency shou ld be able to change its view in the future? It is indeed a wonder ful new world that the Cour t creates, one full of promise for admi nistrative-law professors in need of tenure articles and, of course , for litigators.14 I would adhere to what has been the rule in the past: When a cour t inter prets a statute without Chevro n deference to agency views, its inter pret ation (whether or not asser ted to rest upon an unambig uous text) is the law. I might add that it is a great mystery why any of this is relevant here . What\u00ad ever the stare decisis effec t of AT&T Corp. v. Portland, 216 F. 3d 871 (CA9 2000), in the Ninth Circuit, it surely does not gover n this Cour t's decisi on. t's self-abnegati suggesti on to the contrary , ante, at 985-986\u2014the Ninth Circuit would already be obliged to 14 Further deossi cati on may already be on the way, as the Cour t has hinted that an agency constr uction unwor thy of Chevro n deference may be able to trump one of our statutory-constr uction holdi ngs. In Edelm an v. Lynchb urg College, 535 U. S. 106, 114 (2002), the Cour t found \"no need to resolve any questi on of deference\" because the Equal Employment Op\u00ad portunity Commissi on's rule was \"the if . . . we were inter preti ng the statute from scratch. \" It nevertheless refused to say whether the agency' s positi on was \"the only one permissible .\" Id., at 114, n. 8 (inter nal quot ation marks omitted). Justice O'Connor ap\u00ad propr iately that it is possible to reserve\" the questi on whether a regulation is entitled to Chevro n deference \"while simultaneously maintaining . . . that the agency is free to change its inter pret ation\" in the future . 535 U.
