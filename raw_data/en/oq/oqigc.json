Guo, M.H. Pittler and E. Ernst ABSTRACT: The aim of the current study was to systematically assess the effectiveness of herbal medicines in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) testing herbal medicines against any type of control intervention in patients with COPD and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were included. Theselection of studies, data extraction and validation were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. Effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Fourteen eligible RCTs, testing 14 different herbal medicines, were located. Herbal medicines were compared against placebo or no treatment in six trials. Significant intergroup differences for one or more outcome were reported for several herbal medicines including Panax ginseng and Salvia miltiorrhiza . In seven RCTs, which compared herbal medicines with other herbal medicines, the results were mixed. A single trial compared a herbal medicine ( Hedera helix leaf extract) with a conventional treatment (ambroxol tablet) and reported no significant difference between groups.Due to the heterogeneity of the data, statistical pooling was not performed. The median methodological quality score was 2 out of a possible maximum 5. The effectiveness of herbal medicines for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not established beyond reasonable doubt. Currently, the evidence from randomised clinical trials is scarce and often methodologically weak. Considering the popularity of herbal medicine among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, rigorously designed studies seem warranted. KEYWORDS: Chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, complementary therapy, herbal medicine Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of conditions char-acterised by airflow obstruction [1]. Chronic bronchitis (CB) and emphysema aretwo major conditions within this group. COPDis a public health concern worldwide, and the prevalence of this disease is increasing. According to the World Health Organizationreport in 1998, COPD was the sixth leading causeof death and the twelfth most common cause ofmorbidity worldwide. Both the direct and indir-ect economic costs of COPD to the society aresubstantial. In the USA, 16 million people have symptomatic COPD incurring estimated total economic costs for COPD-related morbidity andmortality of US$23.9 billion [2]. In the UK, about1.5 million patients suffer from COPD with a totalannual cost to the National Health Service of,\u00a3491 million for direct costs only and \u00a3982 million including indirect costs [1]. There is no cure for COPD [3]. Current conven- tional treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, preventing recurrent exacerbations, preservingoptimal lung function and enhancing the quality of life [4]. Smoking cessation is the only ther-apeutic intervention shown to reduce disease progression [5]. Although the conventional man- agement of COPD has been improved since the1990s, the progress is slow [6]. Unsatisfactory treatment outcomes from conventional drugs, and adverse effects associated with severalclasses of drugs, such as steroids and theophyl-line, contribute substantially to the increasing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and, in particular, herbal med-icine [7]. There is a long history of using herbal remedies to treat COPD, particularly in China, India andother Asian countries. Herbal expectorants, based on extracts from Hedera helix (ivy) or Thymus vulgaris (thyme) also enjoy considerable popular- ity in many European countries [8]. Despite the popularity of herbal medicine, there has been no comprehensive systematic review of herbal med-icines for treating COPD. The objective of the current review, therefore, was to systematicallyAFFILIATIONS Complementary Medicine, Peninsula Medical School, Universities ofExeter and Plymouth, Exeter, UK. CORRESPONDENCE R.

METHODS All methods detailed below were according to a pre-defined, unpublished protocol. Search strategy Five electronic databases (AMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library) were searched, from their respective inception to August 2005, without language restric- tion. Search terms were as follows: bronchitis, and individual common plant names andbotanical names. Hand searches were performed in files and journals of the authors' own library. Three manufacturers of relevant herbal remedies were contacted and asked tocontribute further information, particularly unpublished data. The bibliographies of all included trials and other relevant reviews were searched to identify further potential trials. Study selection The clinical trials included in this review had to be of herbal preparations administered systemically for CB, emphysema orCOPD, in which patients of either sex and of any age wererandomly assigned to receive either herbal medicines or control treatments ( i.e.placebo, no treatment, conventional therapy or other herbal medicines). Only trials assessingclinical outcomes ( e.g.forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), global clinical assessment of effectiveness, symptom scores, health-related quality of life, exacerbation severity andfrequency) were included. Trials including asthma patients were excluded. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment Titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened and full-text articles of potentially relevant trials were obtained. Articles in English and Chinese were read by R. Guo and articles in German by M.H. Pittler. These authors thendiscussed the articles and made decisions whether to include or exclude and, if needed, the third co-author (E. Ernst) was consulted. Data concerning the details of study design,participants, interventions, outcomes and adverse events were extracted from all included articles (R. Guo and M.H. Pittler). Missing data from one trial [9] were requested by contactingthe author of the report. To date, a response has not beenreceived. The methodological quality of the included trials was assessed using the five-point scale developed by J ADAD et al. [10]. This was done either independently by two authors (R. Guo and M.H. Pittler) for randomised clinical trails (RCTs) published inEnglish or by discussion of the same two authors for RCTspublished in German or Chinese. Data analysis The included RCTs were categorised according to the type of control intervention and the following comparisons were made. 1) Herbal medicine versus placebo or no treatment;2) herbal medicine versus conventional therapy; and 3) herbal medicine versus herbal medicine. Due to the inadequate reporting, the overall results were unclear in some trials. The effect sizes and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of primary outcomes of each of the studies were therefore calculated (R. Guo). Most trials reported FEV 1(in absolute volume or percentage of predicted value) as primaryoutcomes. Symptom scores and exacerbation frequency were also reported in some trials. Several Chinese trials reported the results of global assessment of effectiveness as the primaryoutcome measure. This was based on the ''Chinese National criteria for the clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation of chronic bronchitis'' [11], where responses are categorised intofour levels (excellent, good, moderate and no effect). The responder rates for the levels ''good'' and ''excellent'' were assessed. This was defined as the proportion of patients whomet the following criteria: at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum, dyspnoea and rale) disappeared and the other symptoms significantly improved, or at least three of the foursymptoms significantly improved and the other symptom improved. Results for continuous data (FEV 1, vital capacity (VC), symptom score, and exacerbation frequency and sever-ity) were calculated as weighted mean differences and resultsfor dichotomous data (responder rate) were calculated as risk ratio (the proportion of the responders in the test group divided by the proportion of responders in the control group).These results are presented in table 1 and are summarised descriptively. Pooled results were not calculated because only single trials were located for each herbal intervention. RESULTS The current authors located a total of 529 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. Of these, 48 articles were obtained for detailed evaluation and 19 RCTs [9, 12-30] were subsequently identified for further analysis. No unpublished RCTs werelocated. Of the 19 RCTs identified for further analysis, five were excluded because they did not report clinically relevant outcomes [26, 27], did not test a herbal remedy [29], did not usea systemic route of administration [28], or included asthmatic patients [30]. Figure 1 provides a flowchart of all included and excluded trials. Fourteen RCTs [9, 12-24] met all inclusion criteria and were assessed. The main characteristics of these studies aresummarised in table 2. They originate from four countries (China, n 510; Germany, n 52; Switzerland, n 51; and Italy, n51) and were published between 1991 and 2004 in three languages (Chinese, n 58; English, n 54; and German, n 52). A total of 1,359 subjects were randomised and 1,314 were analysed by the original investigators. Most of the trialsstudied herbal mixtures whereas four trials tested herbal monopreparations. Eleven studies included only adult subjects (three trials specified their subjects as senile), two includedboth children and adults, and one included children only.Patients were diagnosed as having COPD in five RCTs and CB in nine RCTs. In one RCT, patients were specified as being in remission whereas three other RCTs included patients in acuteexacerbation. The methodological quality of the trials was generally low with a median Jadad score of 2, ranging from 1 to 5 (tables 2 and 3).R. GUO ET AL. HERBAL MEDICINES FOR COPD c EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL VOLUME 28 NUMBER 2 331Of the 14 included RCTs, only three [9, 16, 24] described the methods for randomisation and five [9, 15, 17, 21, 22] mentioned double blinding, of which only one [9] describedthe method of blinding appropriately. Details of dropouts andwithdrawals were described in only five trials [9, 15, 17, 21, 24].Only two trials [9, 15] were placebo controlled. The 14 RCTs were categorised into three groups according to the type of control interventions. Detailed results aresummarised in table 1 and described below. Information on the preparations, such as manufactures and compositions, can be found in the Appendix. Herbal medicines versus placebo or no treatment The current authors located a total of six RCTs that comparedherbal medicines with placebo or no treatment. Two RCTs [9,15] compared herbal medicines with placebo and the other four [12-14, 16] compared herbal medicines with no treatment.TABLE 1 Summary of the results of all included randomised clinical trials First author [ref.]Intervention# Outcomes and results: effect size+Adverse events (cases) Test\"Control Herbal medicine versus placebo or no treatment WEI[12] Danshen injection No treatment Responder rate: RR No treatment Responder 3.90 FEV 1: mouth 1, FVC, FEV 1/FVC.

GUO ET AL. 332 VOLUME 28 NUMBER 2 EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNALIn all of these RCTs, both the experimental and the control groups received the same adjunctive treatment regimen with conventional therapies (table 2). Significant differences for pulmonary function, symptom score and/or responder rate were seen in several herbal remedies. Panax ginseng 1; Pharmaton SA, Basel, Switzerland) was found to be significantly superior to placebo in improving pulmonary functions, including FEV 1. However, the available data were insufficient for effect size calculations. Another RCT [14] tested Shen Mai injection (Affiliated Pharmaceuticals of West ChinaUniversity, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China), which is a combination preparation containing three herbs including P. ginseng as the main ingredient (see Appendix), against no treatment. Significant improvements were found in all outcomes, including pulmonary function tests (FEV 1, VC), global clinical assessment of effectiveness (responder rate) [11] and the Borg scale Ya-an, Sichuan, People's Republic of China) against no treatment and found a significant improvement in FEV 1. No significant difference in responder rate was found between treatment regiments.Traditional Chinese herbal medicine Two RCTs [13, 16] tested two Liujin and Jiawei JiaweiYupingfeng trial [16], the responder rate in the TCHM group was found to be significantly higher compared with the no treatment group. In the Jinshui Liujin trial [13], the authorreported significant improvement of all outcomes in both groups from baseline (p ,0.05). Calculations of effect size and 95% CI showed no significant difference in any of theoutcomes, including responder rate, \u00a8mmer GmbH & liquid extract made from threeherbs (Appendix), including Echinacea, as a supportivemedication. Significant improvements in FEV 1were reported. Herbal medicine versus conventional therapy Only one RCT [17] was located that compared a herbal remedy with a conventional therapy. VC was assessed as the primary outcome. No statistically significant difference was seen between H. helix leaf extract (Prospan 1) and ambroxol tablets (table 1). Herbal medicine versus herbal medicine Seven RCTs [18-24] compared one herbal medicine with another (table 1). One RCT [21] compared two forms of H. helix extract (Prospan 1cough syrup and Prospan 1herbal drops). No significant differences were found between groups in either FEV 1or VC. The other six RCTs tested one TCHM remedy against another. Five of these RCTs reported theresults for the responder rate. Four trials [18, 19, 20, 23] showed positive results favouring test groups and one [22] showed no significant difference between groups. Only one trial [18]reported data for the pulmonary function test (FEV 1), which showed no significant difference between groups. Two trials [24, 20] reported the results of symptom scores and bothshowed positive results favouring the test group. One trial [23] reported the assessment of exacerbation severity and fre- quency. The results suggested that both severity and frequencyof exacerbation were significantly reduced in the test group compared with the control group. Adverse events Only five out of 14 trials included information on adverse events (AE). Two of these RCTs reported no AE in either group. The other studies reported mild-to-moderate AE with no further details (table 1). DISCUSSION The present study has identified several herbal remedies with the potential to improve pulmonary function, to relieve symptoms or to reduce exacerbation severity and frequencyin the treatment of COPD. Studies on herbal products containing P. ginseng ,H. helix ,S. miltiorrhiza and some TCHM decoctions generated encouraging results. However,interpretation and extrapolation of these results are difficult the study selection process. RCT: randomised clinical trial.R. GUO ET AL.

GUO ET AL. 334 VOLUME 28 NUMBER 2 EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNALFirst, insufficient data are currently available for any specific herbal remedy. Only one trial was identified for each of the tested herbal interventions and most of these trials were ofsmall sample size and none reported formal sample size orpower calculations. Secondly, the overall methodological quality of the studies is low (table 3). Blinding and randomisation are two essential features for minimising bias [31]. However, in this review, onlyfive out of 14 RCTs were double blinded. Part of the reason forthe lack of blinding may be the difficulty in finding a credibleplacebo that is indistinguishable in colour, taste and smell, and also pharmacologically inert in the conditions under investiga- tion. This may be particularly problematic for herbal decoc-tions. Similarly, four trials compared herbal medicines against''no treatment'', which does not account for placebo effects andis a source of bias. The method for randomisation was rarelydescribed. In two RCTs [19, 20], there was a substantial difference between the numbers of patients in test and control groups. This could suggest that inappropriate methods ofrandomisation were used. These weaknesses, and the lack ofdescriptions of dropouts and withdrawals, contribute to theoften low scores on the Jadad scale. The validity of some RCTswas further limited by failings to report the concealment of treatment allocation and details of statistical analysis, or inappropriate analyses. Thirdly, seven RCTs compared a herbal medicine with another herbal medicine. Despite some positive results shown in thesetrials, interpretation is difficult due to the unknown effect of the control intervention. Furthermore, quality control of the herbal extracts is important to ensure the reproducibility of the study. Of the 12 herbalpreparations (excluding herbal decoctions) listed in theAppendix, data on extract standardisation are only availablefor one preparation. Details on the extract solvent were also only reported for one preparation. Finally, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products recommended using both FEV 1and a measure of symptomatic benefit as a combined primary outcome, andstates that the end-point for symptomatic benefit should be justified by referencing published data that support its validity [32]. However, only one trial [14] used a referenced sympto-matic benefit measure, in spite of the availability of a numberof validated, well accepted and widely applied instruments,such as the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire [33] and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [34]. The increasing popularity and, particularly, the easy access to herbal remedies raises safety issues. The common assumptionamong consumers that herbal medicines are safe is dangerous.Herbal medicines might be linked to serious AE and herb-drug interaction may have serious clinical consequences [35]. Several relevant herbs, such as Salvia milhiorrhiza ,Glycyrrhiza uralensis ,P. ginseng and Angelica sinensis were reported to interact with a range of conventional medicines [36-38].Unfortunately, in most of the included RCTs, AE were notmonitored and herb-drug interactions were considered in none of the reports. The included studies involved a large number of individual herbs in various combinations (seeAppendix). The AE and herb-drug interactions of most ofthese herbs and preparations are not well documented.Therefore, further studies on the safety of these remedies arerequired. Limitations of the current review and, indeed, systematic reviews in general pertain to the potential incompleteness ofthe reviewed evidence. The distorting effects arising frompublication bias and location bias are well documented [39-43]. In the current review, 10 out of 14 included RCTs wereTABLE 3 Details of quality assessment of included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) First author [ref.]Double blindedAppropriate method for blindingAppropriate method for randomisationDetails of dropouts and withdrawals describedPlacebo controlled CHENG [18] N NA NR N NA NR N Y Y NA NR N WU[24]N N A Y Y N HUANG [17]N N A Y N R N RCTs with each design feature n 51 3 5 2 no; NA: not applicable; NR: not ET AL. HERBAL MEDICINES FOR COPD c EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL VOLUME 28 NUMBER 2 335published in China, a country which has been previously shown to produce large numbers of positive CAM studies [44]. For the current study, databases were searched with a focus on the American and European literature and those whichspecialise in complementary medicine, and included hand-searches. There were no restrictions in terms of publicationlanguage. The current authors are, therefore, confident thattheir search strategy has located most of the published trials on the subject. However, whether all unpublished trials were identified remains uncertain. A further limitation of thisreview is (as pointed out previously) the paucity and limitedquality of the primary data. Conclusion The effectiveness of herbal medicines for treating chronic obstructive disease is not established beyond reasonable doubt.Currently, the evidence from randomised clinical trials is scarce and often methodologically weak. Considering the popularity of herbal medicine among chronic obstructivepulmonary disease patients, rigorously designed studies seemsto be warranted.
